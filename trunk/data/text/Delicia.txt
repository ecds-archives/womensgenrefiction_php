INTRODUCTORY NOTE
<p>The following slight and unelaborated sketch of a very commonplace and everyday tragedy will, I am aware, meet with the unqualified disapproval of the 'superior' sex. They will assert, with much indignant emphasis, that the character of 'Lord Carlyon' is an impossible one, and that such a 'cad' as he is shown to be never existed. Anticipating these remarks, I have to say in reply that the two chief personages in my story, namely, 'Lord Carlyon' and his wife, are drawn strictly from the life; and, that though both the originals have some years since departed from this scene of earthly contest and misunderstanding, so that my delineation of their characters can no longer grieve or offend either, the 'murder of Delicia'

<p>There are thousands of such 'murders' daily happening among us--murders which are not considered 'cruelty' in the eyes of the law. There are any number of women who work night and day with brain and hand to support useless and brainless husbands; women whose love never falters, whose patience never tires, and whose tenderness is often rewarded only by the most callous neglect and ingratitude. I do not speak of the countless cases among the hard-working millions whom we elect to call the 'lower classes,' where the wife, working from six in the morning till ten at night, has to see her hard earnings snatched from her by her 'better' half and spent at the public-house in strong drink, despite the fact that there is no food at home, and that innocent little children are starving. These instances are so frequent that they have almost ceased to awaken our interest, much less our sympathy. In my story I allude principally to the 'upper' ranks, where

Delicia had purchased this particular copy of
the original bust in the British Museum because
she imagined it was like her husband. No one
else thought it in the least like him-but she
did.
She had all sorts of fancies about this husband
of hers-fancies both pretty and passionate-
though she had none about herself. She was
only a worker; one whom certain distinguished
noodles on the Press were accustomed to sneer
at from  their unintellectual and impecunious
standpoint as 'a lady novelist' not meriting
the name of 'author,' and who, despite sneers
and coarse jesting, was one of the most cele-

the wealthiest. The house she lived in, built

was, strange to say, though an author and
a ' celebrity,' still an unspoilt, womanly woman.
Just when the sunshine crowned her, as the
sunshine had a way of doing at that particular
hour of the morning, she was very busy finishing
the last chapter of a book which had occupied
all her energies during the past four months.
She wrote rapidly, and the small, well-shaped,
white hand that guided the pen held that
dangerous intellectual weapon firmly, with a
close and somewhat defiant grip, suggestive of
the manner of a youthful warrior grasping a
light spear and about to hurl it in the face of
a foe. Her very attitude in writing indicated

Compliments and flatteries, however, were dis-

she received them from her husband. Then her
sweet soul kindled within her into a warm glow
of rapture and gratitude, and she wondered what
she had done to deserve praise from so lordly
and perfect a being.
There was something very touching as well
as beautiful in the way Delicia bent her proud
intellect and prouder spirit to the will of her
chosen mate. For him, and for him only, she
strove to add fresh glory to the lustre of her
name; for him she studied the art of dressing

fame of the regiment, it was no wonder the
affair created a sensation and a flutter in the
world of fashionable news and ladies' pictorials.
Delicia astonished and irritated several members
of her own sex by the extreme simplicity of her
dress on the occasion. She always managed
somehow, quite unintentionally, to astonish and
irritate her sweet 'sisters' in womanhood, who,
forced to admit her intellectual superiority to
themselves, loved her accordingly. Thus her
very wedding garment was an affront to them,
being only a classic gown of softly-draped white
silk crepe-de-chine, without any adornment of
either lace or flowers. Then her bridal veil
was a vexatious thing, because it was so un-
usually becoming-it was made of white chiffon,

of Mendelssohn. A considerably large crowd,
moved by feelings of sincere appreciation for
the union of the professions of War and
Literature, waited outside the church to give
the bride a cheer as she stepped into her
carriage, and some of them, hustling a little
in advance of the policemen    on duty, and
peering up towards the entrance of the sacred
edifice, were rewarded by seeing the Most
Distinguished Personage in the realm, smiling
his ever-cordial smile, and shaking hands with
the fair 'celebrity' just wedded. At this sight
a deafening noise broke out from the throats
of the honest 'masses,' a noise which became
almost tumultuous when the Distinguished
Personage walked by the side of the newly-
married pair down the red-carpeted pavement
from the church to the nuptial carriage-door,
and lifted  his hat again and  again to the
'huzzas' which greeted him. But the Dis-

'beloved women' that at rare intervals are
born to influence nations-so few they are and
so precious in their lives and examples that it
is little wonder nations make much of them
when they find them. There were people in
the crowd that day who had wept and smiled
over Delicia's writings, and who had, through
her teaching, grown better, happier and more
humane men and women; and there was a
certain loving jealousy in these which grudged
that she should stoop from her lofty height
of fame, to marry, like any other ordinary
woman. They would have had her exempt
from the common lot, and yet they all desired
her happiness. So in half-gladness, half-regret,
they cheered her and threw roses and lilies at
her, for it was the month of June; and she
with her veil thrown back, and the sunshine
glinting on her gold hair, smiled bewitchingly
as she bowed right and left to the clamorous
throng of her assembled admirers; then, with
her glorious six feet of husband, she stepped
into her carriage and drove away to the
sound of a final cheer. The Distinguished
Personage got into his brougham and departed.

yesterday.  Happiness had made the time fly
on swift wings, and her dream of love had as
yet lost nothing of its heavenly glamour. Her
marriage had caused no very perceptible change
in her fortunes -she worked a little harder
and more incessantly, that was all.    Her
husband deserved all the luxuries and enjoy-
ments of life that she could give him-so she
considered-and she was determined he should
never have to complain of her lack of energy.
Her fame steadily increased-she was at the
very head and front of her profession-people
came from far and near to have the privilege
of seeing her and speaking with her, if only for
a few minutes.   But popular admiration was
nothing to her, and she attached no import-

and invented lies and slanders concerning her,

Sneers and false rumours were inserted about her

lived them down, till finally the worst thing
anyone could find to say of her was that she
was 'idiotically in love' with her own husband.

But Spartan suddenly pricked his long ears,

passion; ' A dog may be honest without offence
to the world in general, but a man must never
be honest, unless he wishes to be considered a
fool or a madman, or both.'

Her artistic eye quickly took note of the

she appreciated the firm and manly lines of the
well-shaped hand that rested on Spartan's head,

Ah, but I cannot quite agree with you ! You

poured out the " treasures of their genius," to

consider one cannot be too grateful for a little

La Marina had been in what her intimates

she had drunk a great deal more champagne
than was good for her, and had afterwards
exhibited a tendency to throw wine glasses at

put a spoonful of strawberry ice down his

looking up at him brightly. 'You came home

Again Lord Carlyon coughed uncomfortably.
'Well, upon my word, I don't exactly

Delicia still kept her eyes fixed upon him.

IT was no impetus of feminine recrimination

that particular evening, and thus deprive her
husband of her society in the same abrupt
fashion with which he had so often deprived
her of his. Mr and Mrs Cavendish were old

music-hall was crowded, and looking down
on the densely-packed arena, she saw rows

Delicia.  He had seen something in one of
the papers about her which he judged as
quite sufficient ground of offence to go upon,
though he knew it was an attempt to vilify
her fair name, which he, as her husband, should
have instantly resented.  In his own mind he
was perfectly cognisant that, had he acted a
manly part in the matter, he should have
taken his riding-whip, and with it dealt a smart
cut across the face of the literary liar who had
published the false rumour, and yet, though
he was aware of this, he had managed to
work himself up into such a peculiar condition
of self-pity that he could see nothing at all
on his limited horizon but himself, his own
feelings and his own perfections; and though

for the mastery of his feelings, and during
the space of two or three minutes he thought
he would at once follow Delicia, throw him-

her forgiveness.  But what would be the use

It was the evening of her arrival at Broad-

after-glow  of the sunken sun rested on the
calm sea, and little waves, dimpling one over

pebbly beach with a soft sound as of children's

But as long as editors and proprietors prefer
to caper about at the heels of' swagger' society
instead of attending strictly to their duties and
to the grave responsibilities of journalism, so
long will the British Press be corrupted by
underlings, and 'used' for purposes which are
neither honourable nor national, nor in any way
exact, as reflecting the real current of public
opinion. Delicia knew all this of old, hence
her indifference to the press generally.  She
had always been entertained and surprised at
the naive delight with which certain society
'belles' had shown her descriptions of them-

over the world and gain fresh knowledge and
experience for her literary labours.  Or, if
constant travel proved to be too fatiguing,
she would take some place in the remote High-
lands of Scotland, or the beautiful sequestered
valleys of Ireland, and make a little hermitage
among the hills, where she could devote her-
self to work and study for the remainder of
her days.
'I daresay I shall manage to be at least
content, if I am   not happy,' she said to

Delicia looked at him steadily, and Robson

'Since the grand dinner his lordship gave
here last week, he has only called in for his

Delicia glanced around her at the picturesque
hall with its heraldic emblems, stained-glass
windows and rare old oak furniture, all of
which she had collected herself and arranged
with the taste of a perfect artist, and a faint
chill crept over her as she thought that

She went upstairs to her own bedroom and
looked nervously about her.  Had 'Madame

been plunged into her heart,-a black cloud
loomed before her eyes, and she fell forward
in a dead swoon.    Emily, the maid, who
was fortunately in the adjoining dressing-
room, heard her fall, and rushed at once to
her assistance.  With the aid of cold water
and smelling-salts, she shudderingly revived
and gazed about her in pitiful wonderment.
'Emily, is it you?'    she asked feebly.
'What is the matter? Did I faint? What
a strange thing for me to do! I remember

Emily, after lingering about a little, left
the room at last, with some uneasiness; and
when she had gone, Delicia leaned back in
her chair and closed her eyes.
'That was a horrible, horrible pain!' she
thought. ' I wonder if there is anything wrong
with my heart ?    To-morrow  I will see a
doctor; to-night I shall want all my strength,
physical and moral, to help me to look with
calmness on my husband's face.'
Gradually she grew better; her breathing
became easier and the nervous trembling of
her limbs ceased.  When the maid came up
with the tea she was almost herself again, and
smiled at her attendant's anxious face in a
perfectly reassuring manner.

looked such a picture of ethereal loveliness as
might have made 'Oberon, the fairy king,'

and at that time he did not mind it.   But
now, considering that he was 'Lord' Carlyon,
he did not care to be addressed as 'Billy,'
and his resentment showed itself pretty plainly
on  his darkened  countenance.  But Lady
Brancewith was too much excited to heed his
annoyance.
'The idea!' she continued. 'If she was
sitting there all the while she must have
heard everything!  A  nice mess you have

With a light laugh at her own sarcasm she

watch the dancing of "La Marina," who had
commenced her performance, and who was
announced for that evening as 'Mademoiselle
Violet de Gascon' out of deference to the

Think of the manner in which her influence

She herself, however, cared nothing for what

her dance she boldly asked her hostess where
Lady Carlyon was.
'She has gone home, I am sorry to say,'
was the reply.  'She is not very well, she
tells me; and she found the heat of the

where should he go to for his so-called 'fun'?
Some thoughts of this kind were in Lord
Carlyon's head as he threw on his opera-coat
and prepared to leave the scene of revelry at 
the Dexters. The pale, noble face of Delicia
haunted him; the disdain of her clear eyes
still rankled in his soul; and he was actually
indignant with her for what he considered
'that offensive virtue of hers,' which shamed 
him, and which had, for a moment at least,
made 'the most distinguished Lady Brance-
with' seem   nothing  but a common drab,
daubed with paint and powder.   Even as he
thought of her thus, the fair and faithless Lily
approached him, smiling, with a coaxing and

'All right!' he said with a stand-offish

'How   sweet and condescending of you!'
and Lady Brancewith threw on her mantle
gleaming with iridescent jewels and showered
with perfumed lace. 'So good of you to bore
yourself with my company!'
Her eyes flashed; she was in a danger-
ous mood, and Carlyon saw it. In silence he
piloted her through the ranks of attendant
flunkeys, and when her carriage came bowling
up to the door assisted her into it.
'Good-night!' he then said, raising his hat

caught him by the coat-sleeve. ' Do you know
what I wish for you?' she said slowly.
'Can't imagine!' he responded carelessly.
'Something nasty, no doubt.'
'Yes, it is something nasty!' She laughed
under her breath as she spoke. 'Something
nasty, yet very commonplace, too.  I wish
your wife may discover the kind of man you 
are,-and stop your allowances!  Good-night!'
She smiled brilliantly; the horses started
suddenly and he drew   back, smothering an
angry oath. Another moment and the carriage
had rolled away, leaving him alone staring at
the pavement. He stood for a little lost in
gloomy meditation; then, summoning a hansom,

Here he smiled. 'Poor little woman! I dare-

same as ever she was, and-and-by Jove!
I'll see if I can't turn over a new leaf. It'll
be infernally dull, but I'll try it!'
And perfectly satisfied with the plan he
had formulated in his own mind for setting
things straight, he arrived at his own house.
The door was opened to him by Robson,
who informed him that her ladyship had
returned about an hour ago and was waiting
to see him in her study.
'In her study, did you say?' he repeated.

DELICIA was at her desk, writing.   She had 
taken off her rich evening costume and was
clad in a loose robe of white cashmere that
fell down to her feet, draping her after the 
fashion of one of Fra Angelico's angels. Her

cynical, fault-finding, unforgiving 'virago.'

She rested in bed all day, dozing and
dreaming and thinking; all night between the
slow-pacing hours she had long waking in-

musings.  She saw herself, so she imagined,

change in her destinies, though  what that

Only on one special day was there a break

she was so strung up with feverish excite-
ment and eagerness to finish the work she
had begun, that external things made very
little impression upon her.
She returned to her writing with renewed
zest; Spartan was her chief companion; and
only her maid Emily began to notice how ill
she was looking. She had intended to consult
a doctor about her health; but, absorbed in her
work, she put it off from day to day, promis-
ing herself that she would do so when her
book was finished.  She received no news
whatever from  her husband; he was trying
the effect of a lengthy absence and sustained
silence on her always sensitive mind.

hers in a very great degree before her marriage,
when, as single-hearted Delicia Vaughan, she
had astonished the world by her genius, came
back to her now, and the clouds of trouble
and perplexity seemed suddenly to clear and
leave her life as blank and calm and pure
as though the shadow of a false love had
never darkened it.   The  sun fell warmly
across her desk, flickering over the pens and
paper; and Spartan stretched himself full length
in his usual place in the window-nook with
a deep sigh of absolute content. And with
radiance in her eyes and a smile on her lips,
Delicia sat down and wrote her ' conclusion.'
Her brain had never been clearer,-the thoughts

Glory did she see, that all the light and all the
splendour of the summer day should seem, for
that one moment, to be mirrored in her eyes? 
Then-she gave a sharp, choking cry, ...
'Spartan ! Spartan !'
With one bound the great dog obeyed the
call, and sprang up against her, putting his   '
huge, soft paws upon her breast. Convulsively  '
she clasped them  close,-as she would have
clasped the hands of an only friend,-and fell
back heavily in her chair-dead!
So they found her an hour later,-her cold
hands still holding Spartan's rough paws to her

he considered he had been 'done' in the results
of his marriage with an 'unsexed' woman of 
genius.  But gradually, very gradually, by 
some mysterious means, probably best known
to Lady Brancewith, who had never forgiven ,
the slight inflicted on her by his look and
manner when he suddenly refused to drive
home with her after promising to do so, 
rumour began to whisper the story of his
selfishness, and to comment upon it.
' He had committed no crime. Oh, no,' said
society, beginning to waver in its former adora-

Valdis knew that little letter by heart; it was

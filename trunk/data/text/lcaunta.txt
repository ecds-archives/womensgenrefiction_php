<head><l>AUNT ANNE
</l><l>CHAPTER I</l></head>
<p>MR. and MRS. WALTER HIBBERT had been married just four months when Aunt Anne first appeared on the scene. They were at Brighton, whither they had gone from Friday to Tuesday, so that Mr. Hibbert might get braced up after a hard spell of work. Besides doing his usual journalism, he had been helping a friend with a popular educational weekly, and altogether "had slaved quite wickedly," so his wife said. But he had declared that, though he found matrimony, as far as he had gone, very delightful, it had to be paid for, especially at the beginning of its career, when it ran into furniture, linen, plate, and expensive presents to a dear little wife, though the expensiveness of the last he generously kept to himself. So it resulted in the visit to Brighton. They spent the happiest four days in the world there, and felt quite sad when Tuesday morning arrived. But they wisely did their best to forget that the evening train would take them back to London, and resolved that their last day should pass merrily.</p>

</p>"Suppose we have a long drowsy morning on the pier," she suggested. "Nothing is nicer or more restful than to listen to the band and look down into the water. We needn't see the horrid people--indeed, if we sit on one of
<pb n="2     AUNT ANNE"/>

the end seats and keep our faces turned seawards, we can forget that they even exist."</p>

<p>Mr. Hibbert solemnly considered the proposal.</p>

<p>"The only drawback is the music--it makes so much noise; that's the worst of music--it always does," he said, sadly. "Another thing is, that I cannot lie full length on the pier as I can on the beach."</p>

<p>"Very well, then we'll go to the beach. The worst of the beach is, that we can't look down into the water, as we can from the end of the pier."</p>

<p>"That's true; and then there are lots of pretty girls on the pier, and I like to see them, for then I know that there are some left--for the other fellows," he added, nobly.</p>

<p>So they went to the pier, and sat on one of the side seats at the far end, and looked down into the water, and blinked their happy eyes at the sunshine. And they felt as if all the beautiful world belonged to them, as if they two together were being drawn dreamily on and on into the sky, and sea, and light, to make one glorious whole with happy nature; but a whole in which they would be forever conscious of being together, and never less sleepy or blissful than now. This was Walter's idea, and he said it all in his dear, romantic way that generally ended up with a laugh. "It would never do, you know, because we should get nothing to eat."</p>

<p>"Don't," she said. "That is so like you; you always spoil a beautiful idea, you provoking thing," and she rubbed her chin against the back of the seat and looked down more intently at the water. Without any one in the least suspecting it, he managed to stoop and kiss her hand, while he pretended to be trying to see something at the top of a wave that of course was not there.</p>

<p>They were having a delightful morning; they lived in
<pb n="3     AUNT ANNE"/>every moment of it, and wished it would never come to an end; still, when it did, there would be a delicious luncheon to go back to--very large prawns, roast chicken and green pease, and an enormous dish of ripe figs, which both their souls loved. After all, Walter thought, the world was not a bad place, especially when you had a wife who adored you and thought that everything you did bore the stamp of genius.</p>

<p>The band was playing a waltz, though to this day they do not know it. All manner of people were passing to and fro, but they did not notice them.</p>

<p>"I should like to stay here forever," Mrs. Hibbert said, with a sweet sigh of content. "Do you know, Walter," she went on, suddenly, after a pause, "it will be four months to-morrow since we were married? Time seems to have flown."</p>

<p>"By Jove! it really is a miracle what those four months have done with themselves," he answered, looking up for a moment, as if to be sure that Time was not a conjurer standing before him, about to hand the four months from beneath a handkerchief, with a polite bow and the remark that they would have to be lived through at the ordinary rate.</p>
<p>A spare-looking old lady, dressed in black, passed by, but he did not notice her.</p>
<p>"You see," he went on, with his eyes fixed on a sailing boat in the distance, "if things were always going to be--"</p>
<p>At the sound of his voice the lady in black, who was only a few yards off, stopped, listened, hesitated, and, turning suddenly back, stood before him. He recognized her in a moment.</p>
<p>"Aunt Anne!" he exclaimed. His voice was amiable, but embarrassed, as if he did not quite know what to do next.</p>
<pb n="4     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"My dear Walter," she said, with a sigh, and in a tone of great relief, "I am so glad to find you; I went to your lodgings--I saw your name and address in the 'visitors' list yesterday--but you were out; then I thought I might find you here. And this is your wife? My dear Florence, I am so glad to see you!"</p>
<p>Till that moment Mrs. Walter Hibbert had never heard of the existence of Aunt Anne, but Aunt Anne had evidently heard of Mrs. Hibbert. She knew her Christian name, and called her by it as naturally as if she had been at her christening. She stretched out a small hand covered with a black thread glove as she spoke, and held Florence's fingers affectionately in hers. Florence looked at her a little wonderingly. Aunt Anne was slight and old, nearly sixty perhaps. All over her face there were little lines that crossed and re-crossed and branched off in every direction. She had gray hair, and small, dark eyes that blinked quickly and nervously; there appeared to be some trifling affection of the left eye, for now and then, as if by accident, it seemed to be winking at you. The odd thing was that, in spite of her evident tendency to nervous excitement, her shabby black satin dress, almost threadbare shawl, and cheap gloves, there was an air of dignity about the spare old lady, and something like determination in her kindly voice that, joined to her impulsive tenderness, made you quickly understand she would be a very difficult person to oppose.</p>
<p>"Dear boy," she said, gently, to Walter, " why didn't you write to me when you married? You know how glad I should have been to hear of your happiness."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you write to me, Aunt Anne?" he asked, gayly turning the tables.</p>
<p>"Yes, I ought to have done so. You must forgive me, dears, for being so remiss," she said, looking at them both.
<pb n="5     AUNT ANNE"/>
"And believe me that it was from no lack of affection.</p>
<p>Then she went on, quickly, "We must not waste our time. You are coming to Rottingdean with me, and at once. Mr. Baines is longing to see you both."</p>
<p>"But we can't go now, Aunt Anne," Walter declared in his kindest manner; "we must get back to the lodgings. We told them to have luncheon ready at one o'clock, and to-night we go home. Couldn't you come and lunch with us?"</p>
<p>"My dear Walter," she said, with a look of dismay, and in a voice that was almost pained, "what would your uncle say? I could not possibly return without you."</p>
<p>"But he has never seen me, Aunt Anne."</p>
<p>"That is one reason why he would never forgive me if I did not take you back."</p>
<p>"But it is so far; we should be all day getting there," Walter objected, a little helplessly, for he felt already that Aunt Anne would carry her point.</p>
<p>"It is only to Rottingdean"--she spoke with hurt surprise--"and we will drive. I saw a beautiful fly as I was coming on to the pier, and engaged it. I know you too well, my darling, to think you will refuse me."</p>
<p>Her manner had changed in a moment; she said the last words with soft triumph, and looked at Florence the while. The sight of the young wife seemed to be too much for her; there was something like a tear in the left eye, the one that winked, when she spoke again.</p>
<p>"I must give her a kiss," she said, tenderly, and, putting out her arms, she gathered the girl to her heart. "But we must make haste," she went on, hurrying over the fag end of her embrace, as if she had not time to indulge in her feeling, much as she desired to do so. "Mr. Baines will wonder what has happened to us. He is long-
<pb n="6     AUNT ANNE"/>
ing to see you"--and, without their knowing it, she almost chased them along the pier.</p>
<p>Then Walter, thinking of the prawns and the chicken and the large dish of ripe green figs, made a wild struggle to get free.</p>
<p>"But really, Aunt Anne," he said, firmly, "we must go back to the lodgings. Come and lunch with us now, and let us go and see Mr. Baines another time. I dare say we shall be at Brighton again soon. We will make a point of coming, now that we know you are here, won't we, Floggie?"--and he appealed feebly to his wife.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed we will," Florence said.</p>
<p>"Dear children," Aunt Anne laughed, "I shall not let you escape, now that I have found you." There was an unexpected brightness in her manner, but there was no intention of letting them go.</p>
<p>"Besides, there may be important letters at the lodgings, and I ought to do a bit of work," Walter said; but there was evident invention in his voice, and she did not slacken her pace. Still, as if she wanted him to know that she saw through his excuses, she looked at him reproachfully, and with a determination that did not falter.</p>
<p>"You know it would be impossible for me to return without you; he would never forgive me. Besides, dear children, you don't know what a pleasure it is to see you. I could not let you go," she went on in her soft voice. "My heart gave a bound as I recognized Walter's voice," she added, turning to Florence; "he is so like what his dear father used to be. I knew him directly."</p>
<p>They were already by the turnstile. They felt helpless. The old lady with the thin shoulders and the black shawl loosely floating behind seemed to be their master: they were like children doing as they were told.</p>
<pb n="7     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Here is the fly. Get in, my darlings," she said, triumphantly, and Florence meekly took her place. "Get in, dear Walter," she repeated, with decision. "I will follow; get in," and he too obeyed. Another moment and they were going towards Rottingdean.</p>
<p>The old lady looked relieved and pleased when they were on their way.</p>
<p>"It is a lovely drive," she said, "and it will do you far more good than sitting on the pier. I am so glad to have you with me, dear children!" She seemed to delight in calling them children; and it was odd, but each time that she said the word it seemed to give her a stronger hold on them. She turned to Florence.</p>
<p>"Are your father and mother quite well, my dear?" she asked.</p>
<p>Walter put his hand on his wife's.</p>
<p>"She only has a mother," he said, gently.</p>
<p>Aunt Anne looked quite penitent. She winked with her left eye, and was silent for a moment or two, almost as if she meditated shedding a tear for the defunct father of the niece by marriage whom she had never seen in her life before to-day. Suddenly she turned the subject so grotesquely that they nearly laughed.</p>
<p>"Are you fond of chocolates, my darling?"</p>
<p>"Yes--" she hesitated a minute, and then said, softly, "Yes, Aunt Anne, very"--she had not had occasion to give the old lady any name in the few words she had spoken previously.</p>
<p>"Dear child, I knew you would be," Aunt Anne said, and from under her shawl she produced a box covered with white satin paper, and having on its lid a very bright picture of a very smart lady. "I bought that box of chocolates for you as I came along. I thought Florence
<pb n="8     AUNT ANNE"/>
would be like the picture on the lid," she added, turning to her nephew; "and she is, don't you think so, Walter, dear?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Anne, she is," he answered, and he looked fondly at his wife and drew up his lips a little bit in a manner that Florence knew meant, in the language only she and he in all the wide world understood, that in his thoughts he kissed her.</p>
<p>Aunt Anne was a dear old lady, Florence thought, and of course she liked, and always would like, any relation of Walter's; still, she did so wish that on this particular day, their last by the sea together, Aunt Anne had kept her distance. Walter was so pale when they left town, but since Friday, with nothing to do but to get brown in the sun, he had been looking better and handsomer every day, and this last one they had longed to enjoy in their own lazy way; and now all their little plans were spoiled. To-morrow he would be at his office; it was really too bad, though it was ungrateful to think it, perhaps, with the remembrance of Aunt Anne's embrace fresh upon her, and the box of chocolates on her lap. Still, after all, she felt justified, for she knew that Walter was raging inwardly, and that if they were alone he would use some short but very effective words to describe his own feeling in respect to the turning up of Aunt Anne. Only he was so good, so gentle and considerate, that, no matter what his thoughts might be, she knew he would not let Aunt Anne feel how much her kindness bothered him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile they jogged along in the open fly towards Rottingdean. A long, even road, with a view on the right of the open sea, on the left alternate high hedges and wide meadows. the grass on the cliffs was green; among the grass were little foot-paths made by wandering feet that
<pb n="9     AUNT ANNE"/>
had diverged from the main road. Florence followed the little tracks with her eyes; she thought of foot-paths like them far away, not by the sea, but among the hanging woods of Surrey. She and Walter had sauntered along them less than a year ago. She thought of home: of the dear mother busy with her houselold duties, making time in between them to write to the boys in India; of the dear, noisy boys who suddenly grew to be young men and vanished into the whirl of life; of the dirty old pony carriage in which she had loved to drive her sweetheart; and when she got to this point her thoughts came to a full stop, to think more particularly of the pony. His name was Moses, and he had liked being kissed and eating sugar. She remembered, with a pang of self-reproach, that in the last months before her marriage she used to forget to kiss Moses, though she often stood absently stroking his patient nose. She had sometimes even forgotten his morning lump of sugar in the excitement of reading the letter that the early post never failed to bring.</p>
<p>"Are you fond of scenery, dear?" Aunt Anne asked.</p>
<p>With a start Florence looked round at the old lady, at Walter, at the shabby lining of the fly.</p>
<p>"Yes, very," she answered.</p>
<p>"I knew it by the expression of your face when you looked at the sea. Mr. Baines says it is a lovely view."</p>
<p>Why should Mr. Baines be quoted, Florence wondered.</p>
<p>She looked again--an open sea, a misty horizon, a blue sky, and the sun shining. A fine sea-view, certainly, and a splendid day, but scenery was hardly the term to apply to the distance beside them.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Baines very fond of the sea?" she asked. She saw that Aunt Anne was waiting for her to speak, and she said the first words that presented themselves.</p>
<pb n="10     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Yes, my love, he delights in scenery. You must call him Uncle Robert, Florence. He would be deeply wounded to hear you say Mr. Baines. Neither he nor I could think of Walter's wife as anything but our niece. You will remember, won't you, my love?" Aunt Anne spoke in the gentle but authoritative voice which was, as they had already found, difficult to resist.</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Anne, of course I will if you wish it; it was only because, as yet, I do not know him."</p>
<p>"But you soon will know him, my love," the old lady answered, confidently; "and when you do, you will feel that neither he nor I could think of Walter's wife except to love her. Dear child, how fond he will be of you!" And she put her hand affectionately on Florence's while she turned to Walter, and asked, suddenly,</p>

<p>"Walter dear, have you got a white silk handkerchief for your neck?"</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment, almost puzzled, wondering whether she wanted to borrow one, before he answered, "No, Aunt Anne, I fear I have not."</p>
<p>She dived down into her pocket and pulled out a little soft packet. "I thought you wouldn't have one," she said, joyfully, "so I bought this for you just now"--and she tucked the little parcel into his hand. It took him by surprise; he did not know what to say. He felt like the school-boy she seemed to take him for, and a school-boy's awkwardness overtook him; he smiled, nodded mysteriously, and put the handkerchief into his pocket. His manner delighted Mrs. Baines.</p>
<p>"He is just the same," she said to Florence. " I remember him so well when he was only ten years old. He had the most lovely eyes I ever saw. Do you remember my
<pb n="11     AUNT ANNE"/>
going to see your father--Ah! we have reached the hill, that's why he's going so slowly," she exclaimed, excitedly. "We shall be there in five minutes. Now we are close to the village. Drive through the street, coachman," she called out, "past the church, and a little way on you will see a house standing back from the road, with a long garden in front and a white gate. Florence dear," she asked, still keeping her eyes fixed on the driver, "do you like preserve?"</p>
<p>"Like--do you mean jam?" Florence asked, bewildered by another sudden question.</p>
<p>"Yes, my love, preserve," Aunt Anne answered, pointedly, as if she resented the use of the shorter word.</p>
<p>"I like it very much," her newly-found niece said, humbly.</p>
<p>"We have quantities of fruit in our garden, and have been preserving it all the week. It is not very firm yet, but you must have some to take back with you."</p>
<p>"I am afraid we shall hardly be able to carry it--" Florence began, timidly, feeling convinced that if she were made to carry jam to London it would be fatal to the rest of her luggage.</p>
<p>"I will pack it for you myself," Aunt Anne said, firmly. She was watching the driver too intently to say more. She did not speak again till they had driven down the one street of Rottingdean, past the newly-built cottages and the church, and appeared to be getting into a main road again. Then suddenly she rose triumphantly from her seat. "There it is, coachman, that little cottage to the left. Dear Walter--how pleased your uncle will be. Here it is, dears," and all her kindly face lighted up with satisfaction as they stopped before a small whitewashed cottage with a long garden in front and a bed of lupins at the
<pb n="12     AUNT ANNE"/>
side. Florence noticed that the garden, stretching far behind, was full of fruit.</p>
<p>The old lady got out of the fly slowly; she handed out her niece and nephew. The latter was going to pay for the fly, but she pushed away his hand, then stood for a moment feeling absently in her pocket. After a moment she looked up and said, in an abstracted voice, "Walter, dear, you must settle with the flyman when you go back to Brighton; he is paid by the hour, and will wait for you, my darlings"--and she turned towards the gate. "Come, I must present you to your uncle. Robert," she called, "are you there?" She walked along the pathway, with a quick, determined step, a little in advance of her visitors; when she reached the house she stood still, as if hesitating to enter. Florence and Walter, coming up to her, saw that the front door opened into a room simply, almost poorly, furnished, with many photographs dotted about the walls, and a curious arrangement of quartz and ferns in one corner. While Mrs. Baines stood irresolute, there came round the house from the right a little shabby-looking maid-servant. Her dress was dirty, and she wore a large cap on her untidy head.</p>
<p>"Emma," said Aunt Anne, in the condescending voice of one who struggled, but unsuccessfully, to forget her own superior condition in life, "where is your master?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, mum, but I think he's tying up the beans."</p>
<p>"Have you prepared luncheon?"</p>
<p>The girl looked up in surprise she evidently did not dare express, and answered in the negative.</p>
<p>"Then go and do so immediately."</p>
<p>"But please, mum, what am I to put on the table?" asked the girl, bewildered.</p>
<pb n="13     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Put!" exclaimed the old lady. "Why, the cold pie, and the preserved cranberries, of course, and the honey, and the buns."</p>
<p>Florence thought that it sounded like the oddest meal in the world.</p>
<p>"I think we had better return, I do indeed, Aunt Anne, if you will kindly let us," urged Walter, thinking regretfully of the chicken.</p>
<p>Aunt Anne waved her hand.</p>
<p>"Walter," she answered, grandly, "you shall not go until you have partaken of our hospitality. I wish it were a thousand times better than it is," she added, with a pathetic note in her voice that found their hearts directly.</p>
<p>Walter put his hand on her shoulder, like the simple, affectionate fellow that he was, and Florence hastened to to say, heartily,</p>

<p>"It sounds delightful, dear Aunt Anne; it is only that we--" and then there came slouching round the left side of the house a tall, ungainly-looking man of about sixty, a man with a brown beard and brown trousers, carrying in his hand a newspaper. He looked at Walter and at Florence in almost stupid surprise, and turned from them with a grunt.</p>
<p>"Anne," he said, crossly, "where have you been? I have wasted all my morning looking for you. You knew those scarlet runners wanted tying up, and the sunflowers trimming. Who are these?" he asked, nodding at his visitors as coolly as if they had been out of hearing; "and what is that fly doing at the gate?"</p>
<p>"Why, I have been to Brighton, of course," Aunt Anne answered, bravely, lifting her head and looking him in the face; but there was a quaver of something like fear in her voice. "I told you I was going: I went by the omnibus."</p>
<pb n="14     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"What did you go to Brighton for?--you were there only last week." He lowered his voice and asked again, "Who are these?"</p>
<p>"Robert, I told you yesterday that Walter Hibbert's name was in the visitors' list in the paper, and that I was longing to see him and his wife," she answered, sharply, but still with dignity--it was doubtful which of the two was master--"so of course I went off this morning to fetch them. I knew how glad you would be to see them."</p>
<p>The maid inside, laying the cloth in the whitewashed sitting-room, stopped clattering the forks and spoons to hear what was going on, and to look through the open window. Aunt Anne noticed it in a moment, and, turning to her, said, sternly,</p>

<p>"Emma, proceed with your work. I told you," she went on, again speaking to her husband, "that these dear children were at Brighton. I have brought them back, Robert, to introduce them to you. They have been looking forward to it."</p>
<p>He gave another grunt, and smiled an awkward smile that seemed forced from him, and shook his awkward shoulders.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's it," he said. "Well, you had better come in and have something to eat"--and he led the way into the cottage.</p>
<p>Aunt Anne entirely recovered herself the moment she was under her own roof. "He is so forgetful," she said, softly, "but he has really been longing to see you"--and then she turned to him. "I told them how glad you would be to see them, Robert," she said, appealingly, as if she felt quite certain that he would remember his gladness in a moment or two, and wondered if it was yet flowing into his heart. Then she turned to Mrs. Hibbert.</p>
<p>"Dear Florence, you must ask him to show you his botanical specimens; he has a wonderful collection," she said.</p>
<pb n="15     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"We will," Walter answered, good-humoredly.</p>
<p>"And now you must excuse me for a few minutes, dears. I know how much your uncle will enjoy a talk with you"--and, to the dismay of the Hibberts, Aunt Anne vanished, leaving them alone with the brown man.</p>
<p>Mr. Baines sat slowly down on the arm-chair, the only really comfortable one in the room, and stretched out his left leg in a manner that showed it was stiff. Then he looked at his visitors almost grimly, but with an expression of odd amusement on his face, as if he knew perfectly how awkward they felt.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Mrs. Hibbert," he said, nodding towards an ordinary chair, and including Walter in the nod. "I dare say you'll be glad of your food before you look at specimens. I shall"--and he gave a lumbering laugh. "I have done a hard morning's work."</p>
<p>"I am sure you must be very tired," Florence said, gently, wishing Aunt Anne would return.</p>
<p>He seemed to know her thoughts, and answered them in an explanatory manner: "Anne won't be long. She always dresses before we have dinner. Great nonsense, living as we do; but it's no use my speaking. Do you make a long stay in Brighton, Mr. Hibbert?"</p>
<p>"No, we go back to town to-night."</p>
<p>"A good thing for you. Brighton is a horrible place, to my mind, and the sooner one leaves it the better. That pier, with its band and set of idle people, with nothing else to do but to walk up and down--well, it's my opinion that railways have done a vast deal of mischief and mighty little good to make up for it. The same thing can be said of newspapers. What good do they do?"</p>
<p>Walter felt that this sudden turn upon the press was a little hard on him, but he looked up over his moustache
<pb n="16     AUNT ANNE"/>
with laughter in his eyes, and wondered what would come next. Florence was almost angry. Aunt Anne's husband was very rude, she thought, and she determined to come to the rescue.</p>
<p>"But you were reading a paper," she said, and tried to see what one it was that Mr. Baines had thrown down beside his chair.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I like to try and find out what mischief they are going to do next. If I had my way they should only be published monthly, if at all. All they do is to try and set people by the ears."</p>
<p>"But they tell us the news," she said, valiantly.</p>
<p>"Well, and what better are we for that? I don't want to know that a man was hanged last week, and a prince will be married to-morrow. I only waste my time reading about them, when I might be usefully employed minding my own business."</p>
<p>"Walter writes for a paper," she said, distantly, determined to find out if Mr. Baines was being rude on purpose. A little dull curiosity came into his eyes, as he looked up and asked,
<p>"Walter--who's Walter?"</p>
<p>"I am," laughed the owner of the name; but she needn't have betrayed me." Mr. Baines was in no way disconcerted.</p>
<p>"Oh! you write for a paper, do you ? Well, I am sorry for you; you might do something much better. Oh, here's Anne; now we had better go and eat."  With the aid of a stick, he shuffled out of the chair, refusing Walter's offered help. "I didn't know you wrote for a paper, or I would have held my tongue," he said, as a sort of apology. "No, thank you, I am all right once I am on my feet."</p>
<pb n="17     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>Florence and Walter were astonished when they looked at Aunt Anne. They hardly knew her again. The shabby black shawl had vanished, the dusty bonnet was replaced by a soft white cap; there was lace at her throat fastened by a little crinkly gold brooch, having a place for hair in the middle; her satin dress trailed an inch or two on the ground behind, and she had put a red carnation in her bosom almost coquettishly.</p>
<p>"Now, dears," she said, with a smile of welcome that was fascinating from its absolute genuineness, "I shall be truly hurt if you fail to do justice to our simple repast"--and she took her place with an air of old-fashioned stateliness, as if she were heading a banquet table. "Now, my dears; Robert, you must put Florence on your right hand."</p>
<p>The Hibberts took their places merrily, their spirits reviving now that they were no longer alone with their host. Aunt Anne, too, looked so picturesque sitting there in the little summer-like room, with the garden beyond, that they could not help being glad that they had come. They felt that they were living a distinct day in their lives, and not one that afterwards in looking back they would find difficult to sort out from a hundred others like it.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Baines grew less grumpy, and offered presently to show them the garden.</p>
<p>"And the plum-trees and the pear-trees," said Aunt Anne; "and the view from the summer-house in the corner."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," her husband said, "we'll show them all"--and he helped to do the honors of the table with what he evidently intended to be genial courtesy.</p>
<p>"It does my heart good to see you, dears," Aunt Anne said, as she insisted on helping them to an enormous quantity of stewed cranberries.</p>
<pb n="18     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"And it does us good to be here," they answered, forgetting all their vexation at losing a day by the sea--forgetting even the poor chicken that was being roasted in vain, and the waiting fly to be paid for at so much an hour.</p>
<p>"Walter, dear," Mrs. Hibbert said, as they drove back to Brighton, carefully balancing on their knees four large pots of jam, while they also kept an eye on an enormous nosegay badly tied up, that wobbled about on the back seat, "Mr. Baines didn't seem to know you when we arrived."</p>
<p>"He had never set eyes on me before. Aunt Anne only set eyes on him five years ago. He was rather a grumpy beggar. I wonder who the deuce he was. We none of us ever knew."</p>
<p>"He did not think much of your profession," she laughed.</p>
<p>"No, he didn't. I wonder if he ever did anything for a living himself." Then, as if he repented saying anything that sounded unkind of a man whose salt he had just eaten, he added, "But you can never tell what people are from their talk the first time you see them. He is not unlike a man I knew some years ago, who was a great inventive genius. He used to shuffle about in shoes too big for him, just as this beggar did."</p>
<p>"I felt quite frightened when he first came round the corner."</p>
<p>"You see it was rough upon him having his morning spoiled. A man who lives in the country like that generally gets wrapped up in his surroundings. I suppose I must have known that Aunt Anne was at Rottingdean," he went on; "but, if so, I had forgotten it. She quarrelled with my father and every one else, because she was always quite unable to keep any money. There was a great de-
<pb n="19     AUNT ANNE"/>
liberation in the family a few years ago, when it was announced that Aunt Anne was destitute and no one wanted to keep her."</p>
<p>"But had she no money of her own?"</p>
<p>"She had a little, but she lived on the capital till it was gone, and there was an end of that. Then suddenly she married Mr. Baines. I don't know who he was, but she met him at a railway-station. He had a bad headache, I believe; and she thought he was ill, and went up to him and offered him some smelling-salts."</p>
<p>"Why, it was quite romantic," Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>Walter had a curious way of looking up when he was amused, and he looked up in that curious way now, and said, "Oh, quite."</p>
<p>"Do go on," she said.</p>
<p>"I don't know any more, except that somehow they got married, and she turned up to-day as you saw; and I wish she hadn't given us any jam, confound it! I say, darling, let's throw it over that hedge."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't for the world. It would be so unkind. She was a dear old lady, Walter, and I am glad we went to see her. She asked for our address in London, and said she would write to us."</p>

<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>But Aunt Anne did not write for a long time, and then it was only to condole with Walter on the death of his father. The first year after their visit to Rottingdean she sent a large Christmas-card inscribed to "My dear Walter and Florence, from Aunt Anne"--but the second year even this was omitted. It was not until Mr. and Mrs. Hibbert had been married nearly seven years that Aunt Anne again appeared before them.</p>
<pb n="[20]"/></div><div n="2" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER II</head>
<p>MANY things had happened to Mr. and Mrs. Hibbert in those seven years. Most important of all--to themselves, at least--was the birth of their two children--lovely children Mrs. Hibbert declared them to be, and in his heart her husband agreed with her. But the time came when Walter found to his dismay that even lovely children would sometimes cry, and that as they grew older they wanted room to run about with that delightful patter-pattering sound that is usually more musical to a mother's ear than to a father's, especially when he has to produce intelligible copy. So the Hibberts moved away from the little flat in which they lad begun their married life, to an ugly little upright house sufficiently near Portland Road to enable Walter to get quickly to the office. There a nursery could be made at the top of the house, where the children were not only out of sight, but out of hearing.</p>
<p>Walter did a great deal of work and was fairly well paid, but that did not mean a large income for a young couple with two children and three servants, trying to keep up an appearance before the world. He wrote for magazines and literary journals, occasionally he did a long pot-boiler for one of those reviews he called refuges for destitute intellects, and altogether was thrown much among men better off than himself, so that he did not like to look poor. Besides, he preferred to live with a certain amount of comfort, even though it meant a certrain
<pb n="21     AUNT ANNE"/>
amount of anxiety, to looking poverty-stricken or shabby for the sake of knowing precisely where he would stand at the end of the quarter, or being able at any moment to lay his hand on a ten-pound note.</p>
<p>"You not only feel awkward yourself if you look poor, but cause other people to feel so," he said; "and that is making yourself a nuisance; and you have no business to do that if you can avoid it."</p>
<p>So, though the Hibberts had only a small house, it was pretty and well arranged. Their simple meals were daintily served, and everything about them had an air that implies content dashed with luxury. In fact they lived as people can live now, on a moderate income, and especially in London, in comfort and refinement.</p>
<p>Still, it was a difficult task to pull through, and Walter felt that he ought to be making more money. He knew, too, though he did not tell his wife so, that the constant work and anxiety were telling on him; he wanted another and a far longer bracing-up than the one he had had seven years ago at Brighton. "A sea voyage would be the thing," he thought, "only I don't see how it could be managed, even if I could get away."</p>
<p>The last year had been a fortunate one in some ways: an aunt of Mrs. Hibbert's had died; leaving them a hundred pounds and a furnished cottage near Witley in Surrey. It was a dear little cottage they both protested--red brick, of course, as all well-bred cottages are nowadays--standing in an acre and a half of its own fir-wood, and having round it a garden with tan paths and those prim flowers that grow best in the vicinity of fir. It would be delightful to stay there in the summer holidays, they agreed, or to run down from Saturday to Monday, or by and by to send the children there for a spell with
<pb n="22     AUNT ANNE"/>
the governess when their parents were not able to get away from town. Walter had tried sending Florence and the children and going down every week himself, but he found "it didn't work." She was always longing to be with him, and he with her. It was only a broad sea and a few thousand miles that would make separation possible, and he did not think he could ever endure that very long, for he was absurdly fond of his dear little wife.</p>
<p>All this he thought over as he walled along the Strand one morning to his office. He was going to see his chief, who had sent for him on a matter of business. His chief was Mr. Fisher, an excellent editor, though he was perhaps not quite enough of a partisan to have a strong following. <hi rend="italic">The Centre</hi> was a model of fairness and the mainstay of that great section of the reading public that likes its news trustworthy and copious, but has no pronounced party leanings. Still, if it was a paper without political influence, it was one of great political use, for it invariably stated a question from all points of view with equal fairness, though it leaned, if at all, from sheer editorial generosity, towards making the best of it for the weakest side. Thus a minority looked to it almost as to an advocate, and the majority knew that any strength that was against them would be set forth in <hi rend="italic">The Centre</hi>, and that if none was pleaded there, the right and the triumph were together. Mr. Fisher liked Walter Hibbert; and though, by tacit agreement, their relations inside the office were purely formal, outside they were more intimate.  Occasionally they took the form of a quiet dinner, or a few hours in the little house near Portland Road, where Florence contributed a good deal to her husband's popularity.</p>
<p>As he walked along the Strand that morning, Walter
<pb n="23     AUNT ANNE"/>
meditated on many ways of improving his condition, and at the same time of not overworking himself. He found that it told on him considerably to be down late at the office three nights a week, doing his article, and then, with the excitement of work still upon him, to go home tired and hungry in the small hours of the morning. It was bad for Florence too, for she generally sat up for him, declaring that to taste his supper and to have a little chat with him did her good and made her heart light. Sometimes he thought he would take up a different line altogether (he knew his editor would aid and abet him in
anything for his good) and try living in the country, running up to town every day if necessary. But this would never do, it would only make him restive. His position was not yet strong enough to admit of taking things so easily. It was important to him to live among men of knowledge and influence, to be in the whirl and twirl of things, and London was essentially the bull's-eye, not only of wealth and commerce, but of most other things with which men of all degrees concern themselves.</p>
<p>And when he got to this point he came to the conclusion that he was thinking too much about himself. After all, he only wanted a month's rest or a couple of month's change of air; a friendly talk, such as he might possibly get in the next quarter of an hour, would probably bring about either and in a far better form than he himself could devise it. Mr. Fisher was a man of infinite resource, not merely in regard to his paper, but for himself and his friends too, when they consulted him about their personal affairs. It was one of his characteristics that he liked being consulted. Walter felt that what he wanted was to get away somewhere alone with Florence, where the climate had no cause to be ashamed of itself, and where there would be warm sunshine to bask in. It was no good
<pb n="24     AUNT ANNE"/>
going alone, and no matter how pleasant a friend went with him, it was his experience that a time always came when he wanted to go by one route and the friend by another. "Now, your wife," he thought, "not only particularly longs to go by your route, but thinks you are a genius for finding it out."</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment to look at a book-shop; there was a box of second-hand books outside; he hesitated, but remembered that he had no time to stay. As he turned away some one touched him on the arm, and a voice said, doubtfully,</p>
<p>"Will you speak to me, Walter?" He looked up and
instantly held out his hand, witl a smile.</p>
<p>"Why, it's Wimple," he said. "How are you, old fellow? Of course I'll speak to you. How are you?"</p>
<p>The man who had stopped him was about eight-and-twenty; he was tall and thin; his legs were too long and very rickety. To look at he was not prepossessing: he had a pinky complexion, pale reddish hair and small round dark eyes with light lashes and weak lids. On either side of his face there were some straggling whiskers; his mouth was hard and his whole expression very grave. His voice was low but firm in its tone, as though he wished to convey that even in small matters it would be useless to contradict him. He wore rather shabby dark clothes, his thin overcoat was unbuttoned and showed that the undercoat was faced with watered silk that had worn a little shiny; attached to his waistcoat was a watchguard made of brown hair ornamented here and there with bright gold clasps. He did not look strong or very flourishing. He was fairly gentleman-like, but only fairly so, and he did not look very agreeable. The apparent weakness of his legs seemed to prevent him from walking
<pb n="25     AUNT ANNE"/>
uprightly; he looked down a good deal at the toes of his boots, which were well polished. The oddest thing about him was that with all his unprepossessing appearance he had a certain air of sentiment; occasionally a sentimental tone stole into his voice, but he carefully repressed it. Walter remembered, the moment he looked at him, that the brown hair watchguard had been the gift of a pretty girl, the daughter of a tailor to whom he had made love, as if in compensation for not paying her father's bill. He wondered how it had ended, whether the girl had broken her heart for him or found him out. But the next moment he hated himself for his ungenerous thoughts, and, forcing them back, spoke in as friendly a voice as he could manage. "It's ages since we came across each other," he said, "and I should not have seen you just now if you had not seen me."</p>
<p>"I wasn't sure whether you would speak to me," Mr. Wimple said, solemnly, as they turned on together--and then almost hurriedly, as if to avoid thinking about unpleasant things, he asked, "How is your wife?"</p>
<p>"All right, thank you. But how are you, and how are you getting on?"</p>
<p>"I am not at all well, Walter"--Mr. Wimple coughed, as if to show that he was delicate--"and my uncle has behaved shamefully to me."</p>
<p>"Why, what has he done?" Walter asked, wishing that he felt more cordial, for he had known Alfred Wimple longer than he had known any one. Old acquaintance was not to be lightly put aside, but constituted a claim in Walter's eyes as strong as did relationship, though it was only when the claim was made on him, and never when he might have pressed it for his own advantage, that he remembered this.</p>
<pb n="26     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Done! Why, he has turned me out of his office, just because he wanted to make room for the son of a rich client--for nothing else in the world."</p>
<p>"That was rough," Walter answered, thinking, almost against his will, that Wimple had never been very accurate, and that this account was possibly not a fair one.</p>
<p>"What excuse did he make?" he asked.</p>
<p>"He said my health was bad, that I was not strong enough to do the work, that I had better take a few months' holiday. It is quite true about my health. I am very delicate, Walter."  He turned, and looked at his friend with round, dark eyes that seemed to have no pupils to them, as though he wanted to see the effect of his statement. "I must take a few months' rest."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps he was right, after all. But can you manage the few months' rest?" Walter asked, hesitating, for he knew the question was expected from him. In old days he had had so much to do with Wimple's affairs that he did not like to ignore them altogether.</p>
<p>"He makes me an allowance, of course, but it's not sufficient," Alfred Wimple answered, reluctantly.  "I wanted him to keep my post open for a few months, but he refused, though he's the only relation I have."</p>
<p>"Well, but he has been pretty good," Walter said, in a pacific voice, "and perhaps he thinks you really want rest. It's not bad of him to make you an allowance. It's more than any one would do for me if I had to give up work for a bit."</p>
<p>"He only does it because he can't well refuse, and it's a beggarly sum, after all."  To which Walter answered nothing. He had always felt angry with himself for not liking Alfred better--they were such very old friends. They had been school-fellows long ago, and afterwards,
<pb n="27     AUNT ANNE"/>
when Walter was at Cambridge and Alfred was preparing for the study of law in London (he was by a few years the younger of the two), there had been occasions when they met and spent many pleasant hours together. To do Walter justice, it had always been Alfred who had sought him and not he who had sought Alfred, for, in spite of the latter's much professed affection, Walter never wholly trusted him; he hated himself for it, but the fact remained. "The worst of Alfred is, that he lies," he had said to himself long ago. He remembered his own remark to-day with a certain amount of reproach, but he knew that he had not been unjust; still, after all, he thought it was not so very great a crime, so many people lied nowadays, often almost without being aware of it. He was inclined to think that he had been rather hard on Alfred, who had been very constant to him. Besides, Wimple had been unlucky: he had been left a penniless lad to the care of an uncle, a rich city solicitor, who had not appreciated the charge; he had never had a soul who cared for him, and must have been very miserable and lonely at times. If he had had a mother or a sister, or any one at all to look after him, he might have been different. Then, too, Walter remembered that once when he was very ill in the vacation it was Alfred who had turned up and nursed him, with almost a woman's anxiety. A kindness like that made a link too strong for a few disagreeables to break. He could not help thinking that he was a brute not to like his old friend better.</p>
<p>"I am sorry things are so bad with you, old man; you must come and dine and talk them over."</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple looked him earnestly in the face.</p>
<p>"I don't like to come," he said, in a half-ashamed, half-pathetic  voice; "I behaved so badly to you about that thirty pounds, but luck was against me."</p>
<pb n="28     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Never mind, yon shall make it all right when luck is with you," Walter answered, cheerfully, determined to forget all unpleasant by-gones. "Why not come to-night?--we shall be alone."</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple shook his head.</p>
<p>"No, not to-night," he said. "I am not well, and I am going down to the country till Wednesday; it will do me good."  A little smile hovered round his mouth as he added, "Some nice people in Hampshire have asked me to stay with them."</p>
<p>"In Hampshire? Whereabouts in Hampshire?"</p>
<p>There was a certain hesitation in Mr. Wimple's manner as he answered,</p>
<p>"You don't know them, and I don't suppose you ever heard of the place, Walter; it is between Petersfield and Liphook."</p>
<p>"Liphook? why, of course I know it--it is on the Portsmouth line; we have a cottage, left us by my wife's aunt only last year, which is in the same direction, only nearer town. How long are you going to stay there?"</p>
<p>"Till Wednesday. I will come and dine with you on Thursday, if you will have me."</p>
<p>"All right, old man--7:30. Perhaps you had better give me your address in case I have to put you off for business reasons."</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple hesitated a minute, and then gave his London address, adding that he should be back on Wednesday night or Thursday morning at latest. They were standing now outside the newspaper office.</p>
<p>"Do you think there might be anything I could do here?" he asked, nodding at the poster outside the door. "I might review legal books or something of that sort."</p>
<p>"I expect Fisher has a dozen men ready for anything at a moment's notice," Walter answered; "but I'll put in
<pb n="29     AUNT ANNE"/>
a word for you if I get the chance"--and with a certain feeling of relief he shook his friend's hand and rushed upstairs. The atmosphere seemed a little clearer when he was alone. "I'll do what I can for him," he thought, "but I can't stand much of his company. There is a want of fresh air about him that bothers me so. Perhaps he could do a legal book occasionally--he used to write rather well. I'll try what can be done."</p>
<p>But his talk with Mr. Fisher was so important to himself and so interesting in many ways that he forgot all about Alfred until he was going out of the door; and then it was too late to speak about him. Suddenly a happy thought struck him--Mr. Fisher was to dine with Walter next week; he would ask him for Thursday. Then if he liked Alfred it might all go right. He remembered, too, that Alfred always dressed carefully and looked his best in the evening and laid himself out to be agreeable.</p>
<p>"By the way, Fisher, I wonder if you would come on Thursday instead of on Wednesday. I expect an old friend and should like you to meet him; he is clever and rather off luck just now; of course you'll get your chat with my wife all right--in fact better if there are one or two people to engross me."</p>
<p>"Very well, Thursday if you like; it will do equally well for me; I am free both evenings as far as I know."</p>
<p>"Agreed then"--and Walter went down the office stairs pleased at his own success.</p>
<p>"That horrid Mr. Wimple will spoil our dinner; I never liked him," Florence exclaimed when she heard of the arrangement.</p>
<p>"I know you didn't, and I don't like him either, which is mean of me, for he's a very old friend."</p>
<pb n="30     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"But if we neither of us like him, why should we inflict him on our lives?"</p>
<p>"We won't; we'll cut him as soon as he has five hundred a year; but it wouldn't be fair to do so just now, when he's down on his luck; he and I have been friends too long for that."</p>
<p>"But not very great friends?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not--but we won't throw him over in bad weather; try and be a little nice to him to please me, there's a dear Floggie," which instantly carried the day. "You had better ask Ethel Dunlop; Fisher is fond of music, and she will amuse him when he is tired of flirting with you," Walter suggested.</p>
<p>"He'll never tire of that," she laughed, "but I'll invite her if you like. She can play while you talk to Mr. Wimple, and your editor discusses European politics with me."</p>
<p>"He'll probably discuss politics outside Europe, if he discusses any," her husband answered; "things look very queer in the East."</p>
<p>"They always do," she said, wisely; "but I believe it's all nonsense, and only our idea because we live so far off."</p>
<p>"You had better tell Fisher to send me out to see."</p>
<p>"Us, you mean."</p>
<p>"No, me. They wouldn't stand you, dear"--and he looked at her anxiously. "I shouldn't be much surprised if he asked me to go for a bit--indeed, I think he has an idea of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, Walter, it would be horrible."</p>
<p>"Not if it did me good and gave me a thorough change; sometimes I think I need one."</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment.</p>
<p>"No, not then," she answered.</p>
<pb n="[31]"/>

<head>CHAPTER III</head>
<p>FLORENCE sat thinking over Walter's hint concerning his health. She had succeeded in frightening herself a good deal; for there was really nothing the matter with him that rest and change would not set right. She remembered all the years he had been constantly at work, for even in their holidays he had taken away something he wanted to get done, and for the first time she realized how great the strain must have been upon him. "He must long for a change," she thought--"for a break in his life, an upsetting of its present programme. The best thing of all would be a sea voyage. That would do him a world of good."  She fancied him on board a P. and 0., walking up and down the long deck, drinking in life and strength. How vigorous he would grow--how sunburnt and handsome; and how delightful it would be to see him return. She hoped that Mr. Fisher would offer him a special correspondentship for a time, or something that would break the routine of his life and give him the excitement and pleasure that a spell of rest and complete change would entail. She would talk to Mr. Fisher herself, she thought. He always liked arranging other people's lives; he was so clever in setting things right for any one who consulted him, and so helpful; and no doubt he had noticed already that Walter was looking ill.</p>
<p>"But he is quite well; it is nothing but overwork, and that can soon be set right--"</p>
<pb n="32     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>There was a double knock at the street door.</p>
<p>It was only eleven o'clock, too early for visitors. Florence left off thinking of Walter to wonder who it could be. The door was opened and shut; the servant's footsteps going up to the drawing-room were followed by others so soft that they could scarcely be heard at all.</p>
</p>"Mrs. Baines, ma'am. She told me to say that she was most anxious to see you."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Baines?" Florence exclaimed, absently. It was so long since she had seen Aunt Anne, and she had never heard her called by her formal name, that for the moment she was puzzled. Then she remembered and went up quickly to meet her visitor.</p>
<p>Aunt Anne was sitting on the little yellow couch near the window. She looked thin and spare, as she had done at Brighton, but she had a woe-begone air now that had not belonged to her then. She was in deep mourning; there was a mass of crape on her bonnet, and a limp cashmere shawl clung about her shoulders. She rose slowly as Florence entered, but did not advance a single step.</p>
<p>She stretched out her arms; the black shawl gave them the appearance of wings; they made her look, as she stood with her back to the light, like a large bat. But the illusion was only momentary, and then the wan face, the many wrinkles, and the nervous twitch of the left eye all helped to make an effect that was pathetic enough.</p>
<p>"Florence," she said, in a tremulous voice, "I felt that I must see you and Walter again"--and she folded Mrs. Hibbert to her heart.</p>
<p>"I am very glad to see you, Aunt Anne," Florence answered, simply. "Are you quite well, and are you staying in London? But you are in deep mourning--I hope you have not had any very sad loss?"</p>
<pb n="33     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>The tears came into the poor old lady's eyes.</p>
<p>"My dear," she said, still more tremulously than before, "you are evidently not aware of my great bereavement; but I might have known that, for if you had been you would have written to me. Florence, I am a widow; I am alone in the world."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hibbert put her hands softly on Aunt Anne's and kissed her.</p>
<p>"I didn't know, I had no idea, and Walter had not--"</p>
<p>"I knew it. Don't think that I have wronged either you or him. I knew that you were ignorant of all that had happened to me or you would have written to express your sympathy, though, if you had, I might not even have received your letter, for I have been homeless too," Mrs. Baines said, sadly. She stopped for a moment, then, watching Florence intently, she went on, in a choking voice: "Mr. Baines has been dead more than eight months. He died as he had lived, my darling. He thought of you both three weeks before his death"--and her left eye winked.</p>
<p>"It was very kind of him," Florence said, gratefully.</p>
<p>"And you, dear Aunt Anne," she asked, gently, "are you staying in London for the present? Where are you living?"</p>
<p>It seemed as if Aunt Anne gathered up all her strength to answer.</p>
<p>"My dear, I am in London because I am destitute--destitute, Florence, and--and I have to work for my living."</p>
<p>Her niece was too much astonished to answer for a minute.</p>
<p>"But, Aunt Anne," she exclaimed, "how can you work? What can you have strength to do, you poor dear?"</p>
<pb n="34     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>Aunt Anne hesitated a moment; she winked again in an absent, unconscious manner, and then answered, with great solemnity:</p>
<p>"I have accepted a post at South Kensington as chaperon to a young married lady whose husband is abroad. She has a young sister staying with her, and her husband does not approve of their being alone without some older person to protect them."</p>
<p>"It is very brave of you to go out into the world," Florence said, admiringly.</p>
<p>"My dear, it would be most repugnant to me to be a burden to any one--even to those who love me best; that is why--why I did it, Florence."</p>
<p>"And are they kind to you?--do they treat you quite properly?" Mrs. Hibbert inquired, anxiously.</p>
<p>The old lady drew herself up and answered, severely,</p>
<p>"I should not stay with them an hour if they ever forgot what was due to me. They treat me with the greatest respect."</p>
<p>"But why have you been obliged to do this, you poor Aunt Anne? Had Mr. Baines no money to leave you?"</p>
<p>Aunt Anne's mouth twitched as she heard the Mr. Baines, but Florence had never thought of him as anything else, and when the two last words slipped out she felt it would be better to go on and not to notice her mistake.</p>
<p>"No, my love, at his death his income ceased; there was barely enough for immediate expenses; and then--and then I had to go out into the world."</p>
<p>It was terrible to see how keenly Aunt Anne was alive to the sad side of her own position. Poor old lady!--it was impossible to help feeling very much for her, Florence thought.</p>
<pb n="35     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"And had he no relations at all who could help you, dear?" she asked, wondering that none should have held out a helping hand.</p>
<p>"No, not one. I married for love, as you did; that is one reason why I knew that you would feel for me."</p>
<p>There was a world of sadness in her voice as she said the last words; her face seemed to grow thinner and paler as she related her troubles. She looked far older, too, than she had done on the Brighton day. The little lines about her face had become wrinkles; her hair was scantier and grayer; her eyes deeper set in her head; her hands were the thin, dry hands of old age.</p>
<p>Florence ached for her, and pondered things over for a moment. Walter was not rich, and he was not strong just now; the hint of yesterday had sunk deep in her heart. Still, he and she must try and make this poor soul's few remaining years easy, if no one else could be found on whom she had a claim. She did not think she would care for Aunt Anne to come and live with them; she remembered an aunt who had lived in her girlhood's home, who had not been a success. But they might for all that do something; the old lady could not be left to the wide world's tender mercies. Florence knew but little of her husband's relations, except that he had no near or intimate ones left; but there might be some outlying cousins sufficiently near to Aunt Anne to make their helping her a moral obligation.</p>
<p>"Have you no friends--no relations at all, dear Aunt Anne?" she asked.</p>
<p>With a long sigh Mrs. Baines answered, "Florence"--she gave a gulp before she went on, as if to show that what she lad to tell was almost too sad to be put into words--"Sir William Rammage is my own cousin,
<pb n="36     AUNT ANNE"/>
he has thousands and thousands a year, and he refuses to allow me anything. I went to him when I first came to London, and begged him to give me a small income so that I might not be obliged to go out into the world; but he said that he had so many claims upon him that it was impossible. Yet he and I were babes together; we lay in the same cradle once, while our mothers stood over us, hand in hand. But though we had not met since we were six years old till I went to him in my distress a few months ago, he refused to do anything for me."</p>
<p>"Have you been in London long, then, Aunt Anne?"</p>
<p>"I have been here five months, Florence.  I took a lodging on the little means I had left, and then--and then I had to struggle as best I could."</p>
<p>"You should have come to us before, poor dear."</p>
<p>"I should have done so, my love, but my lodging was too simple, and I was not in a position to receive you as I could have wished. I waited, hoping that Sir William would see that it was incumbent on him to make me an adequate allowance; but he has not done so."</p>
<p>"And won't he do anything for you? If he is rich he might do something temporarily, even if he won't make you a permanent allowance. Has he done nothing?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Baines shook her head, sadly.</p>
<p>"He sent me some port wine, my love, but port wine is always pernicious to me; I wrote and told him so, but he did not even reply. It is not four years ago since he was Lord Mayor of London, and yet he will do nothing for me."</p>
<p>She lad lost her air of distress; there was a dogged dignity in her manner; she stood up and looked at her niece. It seemed as if, in speaking of Sir William Rammage, she remembered that the world had used her shamefully, and
<pb n="37     AUNT ANNE"/>
she had determined to give it back bitter scorn for its indifference to her griefs.</p>
<p>"Lord Mayor of London!" Mrs. Hibbert repeated, and rubbed her eyes a little. It seemed like part of a play, and not a very sane one--the old lady, her deep mourning, her winking left eye, and the sudden introduction of a Lord Mayor.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lord Mayor of London," repeated Mrs. Baines; "and he lets me work for my daily bread."</p>
<p>"Is Walter also related to the Lord Mayor?"</p>
<p>"No, my love. Your Walter's grandfather married twice. I was the daughter of the first marriage--my mother was the daughter of a London merchant; your Walter's father was the son of the second marriage."</p>
<p>"It is too complicated to understand," Florence answered, in despair. "And is there no one else, Aunt Anne?"</p>
<p>"There are many others, but they are indifferent as he is--the world is cold and hard, Florence; that is a lesson one has to learn when fortune deserts one"--and the old lady shook her head mournfully.</p>
<p>"But, dear Aunt Anne," Florence said, aghast at this sudden vista, "tell me who they are besides Sir William Rammage; let Walter try what can be done. Surely they cannot all be as cold and hard as you think."</p>
<p>"It is of no use, my love," Mrs. Baines said, sadly.</p>
<p>"But perhaps you are mistaken, Aunt Anne, and they will, after all, do something for you. Do tell me who they are."</p>
<p>Mrs. Baines drew herself up, proudly; the tears that had seemed to be on their way a minute ago must have retreated suddenly, for her eyes looked bright, and she spoke in a quick, determined voice.</p>
<pb n="38     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"My love," she said, "you must not expect me to give you an account of all my friends and relations, and of what they will or will not do for me. Don't question me, my love, for I cannot allow it--I cannot, indeed. I have told you that I am destitute, that I am a widow, that I am working for my living; and that must suffice. I am deeply attached to you and Walter; there is in my heart a picture that will never be effaced of you and him standing in our garden at Rottingdean, of your going away in the sunshine with flowers and preserve in your hands--the preserve that I myself had made. It is because I love you that I have come to you to-day, and because I feel assured that you love me; but you must remember, Florence, that I am your aunt, and you must treat me with proper respect and consideration."</p>
<p>"But, Aunt Anne--" Florence began, astonished.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baines put her hand on Florence's shoulder.</p>
<p>"There, there," she said, forgivingly, "I know you did not mean to hurt me; but"--and here her voice grew tender and tremulous again--"no one, not even you or Walter, must presume, for I cannot allow it. There--kiss me," and she pulled Florence's head down on to her breast, while suddenly--for there were wonderfully quick transitions of feeling expressed on the old wan face all through the interview--a smile that was almost joyous came to her lips. "I am so glad to see you again, my dear," she said; "I have looked forward to this day for years. I loved you from the very first moment I saw you at Brighton, and I have always loved your Walter. I wish," she went on, as Florence gently disengaged herself from the black cashmere embrace, "I wish you could remember him a little boy as I do. He had the darkest eyes and the lightest hair in the world."</p>
<pb n="39     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"His hair is a beautiful brown now," Florence answered, rather thankfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, my love, it is," the old lady said, with a little glee at the young wife's pride. "And so is yours. I think you have the prettiest hair I ever saw."</p>
<p>There was not a shade of flattery in her voice, so that Florence was appeased after the severe snub of a moment ago, and smoothed her plaits with much complacency. "And now, tell me when will your dear one be at home, for I long to see him?"</p>
<p>"He is very uncertain, Aunt Anne. I fear he has no fixed time, but I know that he will try and make one to see you when he hears that you are in town."</p>
<p>"I am sure he will," Mrs. Baines said, evidently certain that there was no doubt at all about that. "Are the dear children at home?" she inquired; "I long for a sight of them."</p>
<p>"Shall I call them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my love; it will do my heart good to look at them."</p>
<p>Nothing loath, Florence opened the door and called upstairs,</p>
<p>"Monty and Catty, are you there, my beauties? I want you, my chicks."</p>
<p>There was a quick patter-patter overhead; a door opened, and two little voices answered, both at once,</p>
<p>"We'll come, mummy, we'll come."</p>
<p>A moment later there entered a sturdy boy of six, with eyes like his father's, and a girl of three and a half, with nut-brown hair hanging down her back.</p>
<p>"We are come, mummy," they exclaimed, joyfully, as their mother, taking their fat hands in hers, led them up to Aunt Anne. The old lady took them in her arms and kissed them.</p>
<pb n="40     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Bless them," she said; "bless them. I should have known them anywhere. They couldn't be any one else's children. My darlings, do you know me?" Monty drew back a little way and looked at her saucily, as if he thought the question rather a joke.</p>
<p>"No, we don't know you," he answered, in a jovial voice; "we don't know you a bit."</p>
<p>"Bless him," exclaimed Aunt Anne, and laughed aloud for glee. "He is so like his father, it makes me forget all my sorrows to see him. My dear children," she went on, solemnly addressing them, "I did not bring you anything, but before the day is finished you shall have proof that Aunt Anne loves you. Good-by, my dears, good-by"--and she looked at their mother with an expression that said plainly, "Send them away."</p>
<p>Florence opened the door, and the children pattered back to the nursery. When they had gone Mrs. Baines rose.</p>
<p>"I must go too," she said, sadly, as if she had overtaken her griefs and sorrows again, "for I am no longer my own mistress. Remember that, dear, when you think of me, or when you and Walter converse together."</p>
<p>"But it is nearly one o'clock--will not you stay and lunch? Walter might come, and he would be so glad to see you," Florence said, anxiously, remembering that as yet she had done nothing to help the old lady, and without her husband she felt it was too awkward a task to attempt.</p>
<p>"No, my dear, no; but I shall come again when you least expect me, on the chance of finding you at home."</p>
<p>"And is there nothing I can do for you, Aunt Anne?" Florence asked, hesitatingly; "no way in which I can be useful to you?"</p>
<p>"No, my dear, no; but thank you and bless you for
<pb n="41     AUNT ANNE"/>
your tender heart. There is nothing I want. I wish you could see Mrs. North, Florence; she is kindness itself. I have been in the house five weeks, and they have never once failed to show me the attention that is due to me," she said, with grave dignity. "We went to Covent Garden Theatre last night--I refused to go to Drury Lane, for I did not approve of the name of the piece; they insisted on giving me the best place, and were most anxious when we reached home for fear I had taken cold while waiting for the carriage."</p>
<p>It seemed as if Aunt Anne had been extraordinarily lucky.</p>
<p>"And you like being with young people, I think," Florence said, noticing how her sad face lighted up while she spoke of the theatre.</p>
<p>"It is always a pleasure to me to witness happiness in others," Aunt Anne answered, with a long, benevolent sigh; "and it is a comfort to know that to this beautiful girl--for Mrs. North is only four-and-twenty, my dear--my presence is beneficial and my experience of life useful. I wish you would come and call on her."</p>
<p>"But she might not like it. I don't see why she should desire my acquaintance."</p>
<p>"She would think it the greatest honor to know anybody belonging to me," Mrs. Baines answered, with an involuntary wink.</p>
<p>"Is she an old friend, Aunt Anne--or how did you know her?" Florence asked, wondering at the great kindness extended to the old lady, and whether there was a deep foundation for it. She did not think it likely, from all that she had heard, that companions were generally treated with so much consideration. For a moment Aunt Anne was silent, then she answered, coldly,</p>
<pb n="42     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"I met her through an advertisement. But you must not question me--you must not indeed, Florence. I never allowed any one to do that, and I am too old to begin; too old, and feeble, and worn out to allow it even from you, my love."</p>
<p>"But, dear Aunt Anne, I did not mean to hurt or offend you in any way. I merely wondered, since these people were so kind to you, if they were new or old friends," Florence said, affectionately, but a little stiffly, for, now that she had been assured the old lady was so well provided for, she felt that she might defend herself.</p>
<p>"Then you must forgive me," Mrs. Baines said, penitently. "I know I am foolishly sensitive sometimes, but in my heart I shall never misjudge you or Walter; be assured of that, my darling."</p>
<p>She went slowly up to a little ebony-framed looking-glass that was over a bracket in an out-of-the-way corner--it was odd that she should even have noticed it--and stood before it arranging her bonnet, till she was a mass of blackness and woe. "My love," she said, "would you permit your servant to call a cab for me? I prefer a hansom. I promised Mrs. North that I would return to luncheon, and I fear that I am already a little behindhand."</p>
<p>"Oh, but hansoms are so expensive, and I have been the cause--" Florence began, as she put her hand on the bell.</p>
<p>"I must beg you not to mention it. I would spend my last penny on you and Walter, you know I would," Mrs. Baines answered, with the manner that had carried all before it at Brighton. It brought back to Florence's memory her own helplessness and Walter's on that morning which had ended in the carrying away of jam and yellow flowers from Rottingdean. She went downstairs with
<pb n="43     AUNT ANNE"/>
the old lady and opened the door. Mrs. Baines looked at the hansom and winked. "It is a curious thing, my dear Florence," she said, "but ever since I can remember I have had a marked repugnance to a gray horse."</p>
<p>"Shall we send it away, and get another?"</p>
<p>"No, my dear, no; I think it foolish to encourage a prejudice; nothing would induce me now not to go by that cab."</p>
<p>She gathered her shawl close round her shoulders and went slowly down the steps; when she was safely in the hansom and the door closed in front of her, she bowed with dignity to Florence, as if from the private box of a theatre.</p>
<p>That same afternoon there arrived a pot of maidenhair fern, with a card attached to it on which was written, <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Walter Hibbert, from Aunt Anne</hi>, and two smaller pots of bright flowers, <hi rend="italic">For the dear children.</hi></p>
<p>"How very kind of her!" exclaimed Florence; "but she ought not to spend her money on us--the money she earns too. Oh, she is much too generous."</p>
<pb n="[44]"/></div><div n="4" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER IV</head>
<p>"I wish we could do something for Aunt Anne," Mrs. Hibbert said to her husband that evening. "It was very kind of her to send us those flowers."</p>
<p>"Let's ask her to dine."</p>
<p>"Of course we will--she is longing to see you; still, asking her to dine will not be doing anything for her."</p>
<p>"But it will please her very much--she likes being treated with respect," Walter laughed. "Let's send her a formal invitation. You see these people she is with evidently like her, and may give her a hundred or two a year, quite as much as she wants, so that all we can do is to show her some attention. Therefore, I repeat, let's ask her to dine."</p>
<p>"It's so like a man's suggestion," Florence exclaimed; "but still, we'll do it if you like. She wants to see you. Of course she may not be able to come if her time is not her own."</p>
<p>"We must risk that. I'll tell you what, Floggie dear--ask her for next Thursday, with Fisher and Wimple and Ethel Dunlop. She'll make the number up to six, which will be better than five. It will please her enormously to be asked to meet people--in your invitation say, a small dinner-party."</p>
<p>"Very well. It will be a comfort if she takes Mr. Wimple off our hands. Perhaps she will."</p>
<p>So a quite formal invitation was sent to Aunt Anne,
<pb n="45     AUNT ANNE"/>
and her reply awaited with much anxiety. It came the next morning, and ran thus:</p>
<div type="letter">
<p>"MY DEAR FLORENCE,--It gives me sincere pleasure to accept the invitation that you and your dear Walter have sent me for next Thursday. It is long since I went into society except in this house, where it is a matter of duty. But, for your sakes, dears, I will put aside my sorrow for the evening, and try to enjoy, as I ought, the pleasure of seeing you both, and of meeting those whom you honor with your friendship.</p>
<p>"In the happiness and excitement of seeing you the other day, dear Florence, I forgot to mention one object of my visit. It is most important to me in my present unfortunate position to hide my poverty and to preserve an appearance that will prevent me from being slighted in the society in which--sorely against my will--I am thrown. Will you, therefore, my dear ones, send me a black satin sunshade, plain but good, lined with black in preference to white, and with a handle sufficiently distinctive to prevent its being mistaken for another person's if it is left in the hall when I am paying visits. There are many other things I require, but I do not like to tax your kindness too far, or, knowing your generous hearts, to cause you disquiet even by naming them. At the same time, dear Florence, I am sure you will understand my embarrassment when I tell you that I only possess four pocket-handkerchiefs fit to use in a house like this. If you have any lying by you with a deep black border, and would lend them to me till you require them, it would be a real boon.</p>
<p>"Kiss your sweet children for me. I sent them yesterday a little token that I did not cease to think of you all as soon as I had left your presence--as the world is only too prone to do.</p>
<closer><l>"Your affectionate Aunt,</l>
<signed>"ANNE BAINES.</signed></closer>
<postscript>"P.S.--I should be glad, my darlings, to have the sunshade without delay, for the afternoons are getting to be so bright and sunny that I have requested Mrs. North to have out the open carriage for her afternoon drive."</postscript></div>
<p>"Really, Walter," Mrs. Hibbert said, "she is a most extraordinary person. If she is so poor that she cannot buy a few pocket-handkerchiefs, why did she send us those presents yesterday? Flowers are expensive at this time of year."</p>
<pb n="46     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"It was very like her," Walter answered. " I remember years ago hearing that she had quarrelled with my uncle Tom because she sent his son a wedding present, and then he would not lend her the money to pay the bill."</p>
<p>"Of course we will send her the things, but she is a foolish old lady. As if I should keep deep black-bordered handkerchiefs by me; really it is too absurd."</p>
<p>"Yes, darling, it is too absurd. Still, send her a nice sunshade, or whatever it is she wants; I suppose a pound or two will do it," Walter said, and hurried off to the office.</p>
<p>But Florence sat thinking. The sunshade and the handkerchiefs would make a big hole in the money allowed for weekly expenses--could not, indeed, come out of it.</p>
<p>She wished she could take things as easily as Walter did, but the small worries of life never fell upon him as they did upon her. She was inclined to think that it was the small worries that made wrinkles, and she thought of those on poor Aunt Anne's face. Perhaps that was why women as a rule had so many more lines than men. The lines on a man's face were generally fewer and deeper, but on a woman's they were small and everywhere--they symbolized the little cares of every day, the petty anxieties that found men too hard to mark. She went through her accounts--she was one of those women who keep them carefully, who know to a penny how they spent their last five-pound note. But it was only because she was anxious to give Walter the very best that could be got out of his income that she measured so often the length and breadth of her purse. However, it was no good. The old lady must have her sunshade and her handkerchiefs. So Florence walked to Regent Street and back to buy them. She went without the gloves she had promised herself, and de-
<pb n="47     AUNT ANNE"/>
termined that Catty should wait for a hat, and that she would cut down the dessert for a week at the little evening dinner.</p>
<p>The brown-paper parcel was directed and sent off to Mrs. Baines. With a sigh Florence wished she were more generous, and dismissed the whole business from her mind.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Baines called, ma'am," the servant said, when she reached home that day. "She wanted the address of a very good dressmaker."</p>
<p>"Is she here? I hope you begged her to come in?" Florence asked, with a vision of Aunt Anne calling in a hurry, tired by her walk, and distressed at finding no one at home.</p>
<p>"Oh no, ma'am; she didn't get out of the carriage when she heard you were not in. I gave her Madame Celestine's address, and said that she had made your best evening gown, as she was very particular about its being a grand dressmaker."</p>
<p>"I suppose it was for Mrs. North," Florence thought. "Poor Aunt Anne is not likely to want Madame Celestine."</p>
<p>Then she imagined the spare old lady in a scanty black gown going out with the pretty, and probably beautifully dressed, girls to whom she was chaperon.</p>
<p>As a sort of amends for the unkindness of Fate, Florence made some little soft white adornments for throat and wrists, such as widows wear and that yet look smart, and, packing them in a little cardboard box, sent them, <hi rend="italic">With kind love to Aunt Anne</hi>. "Perhaps they will gratify her pride a little, poor dear--and it is so nice to have one's pride gratified," she thought. And then, for a little space, Aunt Anne was almost entirely forgotten.</p>
<pb n="48     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>The days slipped by anxiously enough to the Hibberts--to Walter, for he knew that Mr. Fisher meant to talk with Florence about something that had been agreed between them at the office; to Florence, because without increasing the bills she really could not manage to put that little dinner together. Walter was particular--liked luxuries, and things well managed, and she could never bear to disappoint him. However, the evening came at last. The flowers and dessert were arranged; the claret was at the right temperature; the champagne was in ice. Florence went up-stairs to say good-night to the children, and to rest for five minutes. Walter came in with a flower for her dress.</p>
<p>"It is so like you," she said, as she kissed it; "you are always the thoughtfulest old man in the world."</p>
<p>"I wished I had bought one for Aunt Anne as I came along in the hansom; but I forgot it at first, and then was afraid to go back because it was getting so late."</p>
<p>He dressed and went down-stairs. Florence leisurely began to get ready. Ten minutes later a carriage stopped; a bell rang; there was a loud double knock--some one had arrived.</p>
<p>"But it is a quarter of an hour too soon," she said, in dismay, to Maria, who was helping her.</p>
<p>The maid stood on tiptoe by the window to see who the early comer might be.</p>
<p>"It's only Mrs. Baines, ma'am."</p>
<p>They had learned to say "only" already, Florence thought. She was angry at the word, yet relieved at its not being a more important visitor.</p>
<p>"I am very vexed at not being dressed to receive her," she said, coldly, in order to give Mrs. Baines importance. "Make haste and fasten my dress, Maria."</p>
<pb n="49     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>There was a sound of some one coming up-stairs, a rustle of silk, and a gentle knock at the bedroom door.</p>
<p>"My darling, I came early on purpose. May I be allowed to enter, dear Florence?"</p>
<p>The voice was certainly Aunt Anne's, but the tone was so joyous, so different from the woe-begone one of ten days ago, that it filled her hearer with amazement.</p>
<p>"Come in, Aunt Anne, if you like; but I am not quite ready."</p>
<p>"I know that, my love. I hoped you would not be"--and Aunt Anne entered, beaming with satisfaction, beautifully dressed, her long robe trailing, her thin throat wrapped with softest white of some filmy kind, her shoes fastened with heavy bows that showed a paste diamond in them, her hands full of flowers. Florence could scarcely believe her eyes.</p>
<p>"Aunt Anne!" she exclaimed, and stood still, looking at her.</p>
<p>"Yes, my love," the old lady laughed, "Aunt Anne; and she has brought you these flowers. I thought they might adorn your room, and that they would prove how much you were in my mind, even while I was away from you. Would you gratify me by wearing one or two? I see you have a white rose there, but I am sure Walter will not mind your wearing one of his aunt's flowers; and, my love, perhaps you will permit your maid to take the rest down-stairs to arrange before the arrival of your other guests. I will myself help you to finish your toilette."</p>
<p>With an air that was a command, she gave the flowers to Maria and carefully watched her out of the room. Then, turning to Florence, she asked, with the joyousness still in her manner, "And now, my dear, tell me if you like my dress?"</p>
<pb n="50     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"It is quite beautiful, Aunt Anne, and so handsome."</p>
<p>"My darling, I am thankful to hear you say that, for I bought it to do you honor. I was touched to get your invitation, and determined that you should not be ashamed of me. Did the housemaid tell you that she gave me Madame Celestine's address?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But, Aunt Anne, I hope you bargained with her. She costs a fortune if you don't."</p>
<p>"Never mind what she costs. I wished to prove to you both how much I loved you and desired to do you honor. And now, my dear, I perceive that you are ready--let us go down. I have not seen Walter yet, and am longing to put my arms round his dear neck before any one else arrives and forces me into a formality which my heart would resent."</p>
<p>She turned and led the way down-stairs. Florence followed meekly, feeling almost shabby, and altogether left in the shade by the magnificent relation who had appeared for their simple party.</p>
<p>Aunt Anne trod with the footstep of one who knew the house well; she opened the drawing-room door with an air of precision, and going towards Walter, who met her half-way across the room, dropped her head with its white cap on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"My dear Walter, no words can express how glad I am to see you again, to meet you in your own house, in your own room. It makes me forget all I have suffered since we parted; it even forces me to be gay," she murmured, in an almost sobbing tone.</p>
<p>"All right, dear," he said, cheerily, giving her a kiss. "We are very glad to see you. Why, you look uncommonly well; and, I say,--what an awful swell you are--isn't she, Floggie?"</p>
<pb n="51     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"He is precisely the same--the same as ever," laughed out the old lady, just as she had at Brighton seven years before. "Precisely the same. Oh, my dear Walter, I shall--"</p>
<p>But here the door opened, and for the moment Mr. Wimple's arrival put an end to Aunt Anne's remembrances.</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple was evidently conscious of his evening clothes: his waistcoat was cut so as to show as much white shirt as possible; his tie looked a little rumpled, as though the first attempt at making a bow had not been successful. He shook hands solemnly with his host and hostess, then looked round, almost sadly, and in a voice that was full of grave meaning, said it was cold and chilly.</p>
<p>"Cough better?" Walter inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is better," Mr. Wimple replied, slowly, after a moment's consideration.</p>
<p>"That's right," his host said, cheerily; "and now, Alfred, I must introduce you to my aunt, Mrs. Baines. Alfred Wimple is an old school-fellow of mine, Aunt Anne."</p>
<p>The old lady put out her gloved hand, with the lace ruffle round the wrist.</p>
<p>"I am glad to meet you," she said. "It is always a pleasure to me to meet any one who has been intimately associated with my dear Walter."</p>
<p>"And to me to meet any one belonging to him," Mr. Wimple responded, with much gravity. "Walter is the oldest, and I may say the dearest, friend I possess."</p>
<p>"It makes us also friends," Aunt Anne said, with a smile. "For it would be impossible that any one loving my dear Walter should not possess my friendship."</p>
<p>The other guests entered; Ethel Dunlop, looking a little shy, but smiling as if aware that, being a girl, she had
<pb n="52     AUNT ANNE"/>
more business at dances than at dinner-parties, but was determined, nevertheless, to be a credit to her hostess. And then Mr. Fisher. Alfred Wimple stood on one side till Walter said,</p>
<p>"Fisher, this is a very old friend of mine. I want to introduce him to you."  There was something irritating in the over-deferential manner in which Mr. Wimple said, while he bowed low,</p>
<p>"Walter is always conferring benefits on me--but this is a great honor."</p>
<p>"I am glad you think so," the editor answered, curtly, and turned to Ethel Dunlop. She was fidgeting with her glove.</p>
<p>"Buttons always come off," she said, without looking up at him.</p>
<p>"But you at least can sew them on. My sex is not so accomplished." She seemed to be thinking of something else, and did not answer; a puzzled expression came over his face as if he thought a girl too difficult a problem to be solved. He was an odd-looking man, tall and pale, with a quantity of light hair pushed back from his high forehead; he had almost tender blue eyes, but something hard and firm about the mouth and square jaw belied them, and gave his face a look of obstinate strength. He was not a young man, and somehow it was difficult to believe that he had ever been younger or would grow older; he seemed to have been born for middle age, and the direction of people and affairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baines talked to Mr. Wimple till dinner was announced. Then Walter went up to his proud relation.</p>
<p>"It is so like a dream to be here with you, to be going down on your arm--dear children," she whispered, as they descended the narrow staircase.</p>
<pb n="53     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>Looking back, Florence always felt that Aunt Anne had been the heroine of that party. She took the lead in conversation, the others waiting for her to speak, and no one dared to break up the group at table into <hi rend="italic">t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</hi> talk. She was so bright and full of life and had so much to say that she carried all before her. Ethel Dunlop, young and pretty, felt piqued; usually Mr. Fisher was attentive to her, to-night he talked entirely to Mrs. Baines. That horrid Mr. Wimple, as she called him in her thoughts, had been quite attentive when she met him before, but now he, too, kept his eyes fixed on the old lady opposite; but for her host she would have felt neglected. And it was odd how well Aunt Anne managed to flirt with everybody.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Baines has given me some useful hints about birds," Mr. Fisher said to Florence, with a suspicion of amusement in his voice; "if I had been as wise before as she has made me to-night the white cockatoo might have been living still. We ought to have met years ago, Mrs. Baines," he said, turning to her.</p>
<p>"I think so too," she said, winningly. "It is such a pleasure to meet my dear Walter's and Florence's friends," she added, looking round the table and giving a strange little wink at the last word that made Mr. Wimple feel almost uncomfortable. "It is a privilege that I have looked forward to for years, but that living in the country has hitherto made impossible. Now that I am in London I hope I shall meet them all in turn."  Then she lowered her voice and went on, to the editor, "I have heard so much of you, Mr. Fisher, if you will forgive me for saying so, though a great career like yours implies that all the world has heard of you."</p>
<p>"I wish it could be called a great career, my dear
<pb n="54     AUNT ANNE"/>
lady," he answered, feeling that she was a person whose death would deserve a paragraph simply on account of the extraordinary knowledge of the world she possessed.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately it has been a very ordinary one, but I can assure you that I am most glad to meet you to-night. I ought to have been at a city dinner, and shall always congratulate myself on my happier condition."</p>
<p>"I should like to see a city dinner," Mrs. Baines said, sadly.</p>
<p>"I wish I could send you my invitations. I go to too many, I fear."</p>
<p>"I suppose you have been to a great many also, Mr. Wimple?" Aunt Anne inquired, careful to exclude no one from her little court.</p>
<p>"To one only, I regret to say, Mrs. Baines," Mr. Wimple answered, solemnly; "four years ago I went to the solitary one I ever attended."</p>
<p>"All, that was during the mayoralty of Sir William Rammage."</p>
<p>"Do you know him, Mrs. Baines, or do you keep a record of the lord mayors?" Mr. Fisher asked.</p>
<p>"I knew him well, years and years ago. I am afraid I should shock you--you are all so young--if I said how many years," she answered; and Mr. Fisher, who was well on in his forties, thought she was really a charming old lady.</p>
<p>"He is a great friend of my uncle's, Sir William, a very old client of his," Mr. Wimple said, looking at Mrs. Baines again, with his strange fixed gaze, while Ethel Dunlop thought that that horrid Mr. Wimple was actually making eyes at the old lady as he did at every one else.</p>
<p>"And may I ask if you also are on intimate terms with him?" Mrs. Baines said.</p>
<pb n="55     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"No; I have only met him at my uncle's. He is very rich," he added, with a sigh, "and rich people are not much in my way. Literary people and out-at-elbow scribblers are my usual associates; for," he went on, remembering that there was a possibility of doing some business with Mr. Fisher, and that he had better make an impression on the great man, "I never met any illustrious members of that profession till to-night--excepting our friend Walter, of course."</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher looked a little disgusted, and turned to the young lady of the party.</p>
<p>"Have you been very musical lately, Miss Dunlop?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"No," she answered, "not very. But we enjoyed the concert. It was very kind of you to send the tickets."</p>
<p>The editor's face lighted up.</p>
<p>"I am glad," he said; "and did you find a pleasant chaperon?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, thank you. I went with my cousin, George Dighton."</p>
<p>"Is that the good-looking youth I saw you with once?"</p>
<p>"Youth?" Ethel laughed--"he is three-and-twenty."</p>
<p>"A most mature age"--and a smile flickered over Mr. Fisher's grave face; "and does he often escort you to concerts?"</p>
<p>"Occasionally."</p>
<p>"He is fortunate in having the privilege, as well as the time to avail himself of it," the editor said, formally. His manner was always reserved, sometimes even a little stately. Now and then, oddly enough, it reminded one of Aunt Anne's, though it was a couple of generations younger, and he had not her faculty for long words.</p>
<p>"You never seem able to go to concerts. It is quite sad and wicked," Ethel said, brightly.</p>
<pb n="56     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>He looked up, as if he liked her.</p>
<p>"Not often. Perhaps some day, if you would honor me--only I am not a cousin; still, I have passed the giddy age of Mr. Dighton."</p>
<p>"We will, we will," she laughed, and nodded; "but only relations are able to survive the responsibility of taking me about alone--perhaps Mrs. Hibbert would--"</p>
<p>"Ah yes, Mr. Wimple," they heard Mrs. Baines say, "I have good reason to know Sir William Rammage. He is my own cousin, though for years and years we had not met till we did so a few months since, when I came to take up my residence in London."</p>
<p>The old lady's mouth twitched nervously, the sad note of a week ago made itself heard in her voice again. Mrs. Hibbert knew that she was thinking of the unsuccessful appeal to her rich relation, and of the port wine that had always proved pernicious to her digestion.</p>
<p>"Your cousin!" said Mr. Wimple, and he fixed another long, steady gaze upon Mrs. Baines; "that is very interesting"--and he was silent.</p>
<p>"Cousins seem to abound in our conversation this evening," Miss Dunlop said to Mr. Fisher; "it must be terrible to be cousin to the Lord Mayor."</p>
<p>"Like being related to Gog and Magog," he whispered.</p>
<p>"Even worse," she answered, pretending to shudder.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Hibbert was looking at Aunt Anne, for it was time to go up-stairs. Mrs. Baines went out of the door with a stateliness that was downright courage, considering how small and slight she was. Ethel Dunlop, standing aside to let her pass, looked at her admiringly, but the old lady gave her back, with the left eye, a momentary glance that was merely condescending. Unless Aunt Anne took a fancy to people, or made a point of being
<pb n="57     AUNT ANNE"/>
agreeable, she was apt to be condescending. Her manner to young people was sometimes impatient, and to servants it was generally irritating. She had taken a dislike to Miss Dunlop--she considered her forward; she did not like the manner in which she did her hair; she was of opinion that her dress was unbecoming. All these things had determined Mrs. Baines to snub Miss Dunlop, who ill-deserved it, for she was a pretty, motherless girl of one-and-twenty, very anxious to do right and to find the world a pleasant dwelling-place.</p>
<p>The old lady sat down on the yellow couch in the drawing-room again--the same couch on which, a fortnight before, she had sat and related her misfortunes. But it was difficult to believe that she was the same person. Her dress was spread out; her gloves were drawn on and carefully buttoned; she opened and shut a small black fan; she looked round the drawing-room with an air of condescension, and almost sternly refused coffee with a "Not any, I thank you," that made the servant feel rebuked for having offered it. Mrs. Hibbert and Ethel felt that she was indeed mistress of the situation.</p>
<p>"You are musical, I think, Miss Dunlop?" she asked, coldly.</p>
<p>"I am very fond of music, and I play and sing in a very small way," was the modest answer.</p>
<p>"I hope we shall hear you presently," Mrs. Baines said, grandly; and then, evidently feeling that she had taken quite enough notice of Miss Dunlop, she turned to her niece.</p>
<p>"My dear Florence," she said, "I think Mr. Wimple is charming. He has one of the most expressive countenances I ever beheld."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mrs. Baines, do you really think so?" Ethel Dunlop exclaimed.</p>
<pb n="58     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"Certainly I do"--and Mrs. Baines turned her back.</p>
<p>"Florence, are not you of my opinion?"</p>
<p>"Well, Aunt Anne, I hardly know--" and, happily, the entrance of the men prevented any further discussion.</p>
<p>Somehow conversation flagged a little, and silence threatened to fall on the party. Florence felt uneasy.</p>
<p>"Are we to have some music?" Walter asked, presently. In these days music after dinner, unless it is very excellent or there is some special reason for introducing it, is generally a flag of distress, a sign that dulness is near. Florence knew it, and, looking at Ethel, tried to cover it by asking for a song.</p>
<p>"Ethel sings German songs delightfully, Aunt Anne," she said; "I think you would enjoy listening to her."</p>
<p>"I should enjoy listening to any friend of yours," the old lady answered. But Miss Dunlop pleaded hoarseness, and did not stir.</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple roused himself a little. "I am sure Mrs. Baines plays," he said, standing before her. Aunt Anne gave a long sigh.</p>
<p>"My playing days are over," she answered.</p>
<p>"Oh no, Aunt Anne," laughed Walter, "we cannot allow you to make that excuse."</p>
<p>In a moment she had risen.</p>
<p>"I never make excuses, Walter," she said, proudly; "if it is your wish--if it will give you pleasure--I will touch the keys again, though it is long since I brought myself even to sit down before an instrument."</p>
<p>She took her place at the piano; she pulled out her handkerchief, not one of the black-bordered ones that Florence had sent her a week ago, but a dainty one of lawn and lace, and held it for a imoment to her forehead.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, with a strange, vibrating touch that al-
<pb n="59     AUNT ANNE"/>
most startled her listeners, she began to play "Oft in the stilly night."  Only for a moment did the fire last: her fingers grew feeble, they missed the notes; she shook her head dreamily.</p>
<p>"I forget--I forget them all," she said, to herself rather than to any one else; and then, quickly recovering, she looked round and apologized. "It is so long," she said, "and I forget."</p>
<p>She began, softly, some variations on "I know a bank," and played them through to the end. When they were finished she rose, and, with a little old-fashioned bow to the piano, turned to Florence, and saying, with a sweet and curious dignity, "Thank you, my dear, and your friends, too, for listening to me," went back to her seat.</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple was near her chair; he bent over her.</p>
<p>"You gave us a great treat," he said, as if he were stating a scientific fact.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baines listened to his words, gravely; she seemed to revolve them in her mind for a moment, tlen, with a wink, she looked up.</p>
<p>"I am sure you are musical, Mr. Wimple," she said; "I can see it in your face."</p>
<p>"Aunt Anne," Walter said, passing her, "should you mind my opening this window?"</p>
<p>"No, my darling, I should like it," she answered, tenderly.</p>
<p>Mr. Wimple gave a long sigh.</p>
<p>"Lucky beggar he is; you are very fond of him?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes," she answered, "he is like my own son"--and she looked across at Walter, who went back to a laughing conversation with Ethel Dunlop, while his wife was having what seemed to be a serious one with Mr. Fisher.</p>
<p>She looked round the room; her gaze rested on the open
<pb n="60     AUNT ANNE"/>
window. "I think the carriage must be waiting," she said, almost to herself.</p>
<p>"I will tell you"--and Mr. Wimple went on to the balcony. "It is a lovely night, Mrs. Baines," he said, and, turning back, he fastened his strange eyes upon her. Without a word she rose and followed him.</p>
<p>"Aunt Anne," Florence said, "you will catch your death of cold; you mustn't go out. Walter, dear, get my thick white shawl for Aunt Anne."</p>
<p>"Oh no, my love, pray continue your conversation. I have always made a point of looking up at the sky before I retire to rest; therefore it is not likely to do me harm."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't let it do you harm for the world," Mr. Wimple whispered.</p>
<p>She heard him; but she seemed to digest his words slowly, for she nodded to herself before, with the manner and smile that were so entirely her own, she answered,</p>
<p>"Pray don't distress yourself, Mr. Wimple; I am accustomed to stand before the elements at all seasons of the year, and this air is not likely to be detrimental to me; besides," she added, with a gentle laugh, "perhaps, though I boasted of my age just now, I am not so old as I look. Oh, dear Walter, you are too good to me--dear boy!"--and she turned and let him wrap the thick white slawl about her. He lingered for a moment, but there fell the dead silence that sometimes seems to chase away a third person; and feeling that he was not wanted, he went back to Ethel Dunlop. It was a good thing Aunt Anne liked Alfred, he thought. He had been afraid the latter would not wholly enjoy his evening, but the old lady seemed to be making up for Florence's rather scanty attentions.</p>
<pb n="61     AUNT ANNE"/>
<p>"It is impossible to you to be old," Mr. Wimple said, still speaking almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>The old lady appeared not to hear him; her hands were holding the white shawl close round her neck, her eyes were following the long row of street-lamps on the right. The horses, waiting with the carriage before the house, moved restlessly, and made their harness clink in the stillness. Far off, a cornet was playing, as cornets love to do, "Then you'll remember me."  Beside her stood the young man, watching. Behind in the drawing-room, dimly lighted by the shaded lamp and candles, the others were talking, forgetful of everything but the subject that interested them. Cheap sentimental surroundings enough, but they all told on the old lady standing out on the balcony. The stars, looking down on her, lighted up the soft white about her throat, and the outline of the shawl-wrapped shoulders, almost youthful in their slenderness. Mr. Wimple went a little closer; the tears came into her eyes, they trickled down her withered checks, but he did not know it.</p>
<p>"It is like years ago," she whispered--"those dear children and all--all; it carries me back to forty--more, eight-and-forty-years ago, when I was a girl. And now I am old, I am old; it is the end of the world for me."</p>
<p>He stooped and picked up the handkerchief with the lace border.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "don't say that. Not the end; age is not counted by years, it is counted by other things"--and he coughed uneasily and waited, as if to watch the effect of his speech, before continuing. "In reality," he went on, in the hard voice that would have jarred horribly on more sensitive nerves--"in reality I am older than you, for I have found the world so much colder than you can
<pb n="62     AUNT ANNE"/>
have done." he said it with deliberation, as if each word were weighed, or had been learned beforehand. "I wish you would teach me to live out of the abundance of youth that will always be yours."</p>
<p>She listened to him attentively; she turned and looked away into the distance, as if puzzled and fascinated by it, almost as if she were afraid of the blackness to which it reached. Then she gave a little nod, as if she had remembered that it was only the trees of Regent's Park that made the blackness.</p>
<p>"If you would teach me to live out of the abundance of youth that will always be yours," he said again, as if, on consideration, he were well satisfied with the sentence, and thougt it merited a worthy reply.</p>
<p>She listened, attentively, for the second time, and looked up, half puzzled.</p>
<p>"I should esteem myself most fortunate, if I could be of use to any friend of Walter's," she answered, with sad but almost sweet formality.</p>
<p>"You have so many who love you--" The voice was still hard and grating.</p>
<p>"No," she said; "oh no--"</p>
<p>"There is Sir William Rammage." He spoke slowly.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she said, sadly, "he forgets. And old association has no effect upon him."</p>
<p>"Has he any brothers and sisters?" he asked. It was a curious question.</p>
<p>"They are gone. They all died years and years ago."</p>
<p>"It is remarkable that he never married."</p>
<p>"I suppose his inclinations did not prompt him to do so."</p>
<p>"He seems to have no one belonging to him."</p>
<p>"There are hardly any left," she answered, with a sigh;
<pb n="63     AUNT ANNE"/>
"and, unhappily, he does not appreciate the companionship of those--"</p>
<p>"Aunt Anne, dear Aunt Anne," Florence said, "do come in; you will catch your death of cold."</p>
<p>"My love, the carriage is waiting and you must excuse me; it is growing late. It has been delightful to be with you, and to meet your friends."</p>
<p>She shook hands with Mr. Fisher, and bowed to Ethel Dunlop; then she went slowly out of the room on Walter's arm, the long train of Madame Celestine's dress sweeping behind her.</p>
<p>"Good-night, Mrs. Hibbert," Mr. Wimple said, and, shaking hands quickly, with the air of a man who has many engagements and suddenly remembered one that must be instantly kept, he too was gone.</p>
<p>He was just in time to reach the carriage door.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Baines," he said, "I think you said you were going to South Kensington--could you take me as far as Queen's Gate?"</p>
<p>"I wonder where he is going," Walter said to himself, as he went up-stairs again. "I don't believe he knows a soul in Queen's Gate."</p>

<head>CHAPTER V</head>
***
WALTER was going to India for the winter. It had all
been arranged while Aunt Anne sat out on the balcony
with Mr. Wimple. Mr. Fisher had explained to Florence
that the paper wanted a new correspondent for a time,
and that it would be an excellent thing for Walter to get
the change and movement of the new life. he was to go
out by P. and 0., making a short stay at Gibraltar, for
press purposes, as well as one at Malta. IIe had looked
anxiously enough at his wife wlhen they were alone again
that evening; but she had put out her two hands, as if in
congratulation.
" I am very glad," was all she said; " it will do you good
and make you strong."
"To live for you and the chicks, my sweet."
And so they arranged the getting ready; for he was to
start by the very next boat, and that sailed in ten days'
time.
"If your mother had been in England you might have
gone witl me as far as Gib," Walter remarked. "I sup-
pose you would be afraid to leave the servants in cllarge 2"
"I should like to go," she answered, as shle poured out
the coffee-it was breakfast-time; "but I couldn't leave
tlie children."
" By Jove !" Walter exclaimed, not heeding her answer.
"There's Aunt Anne in a hansom! I say, Floggie dear,
let inm escape. What on earth does she mean by coming





<pb n="65"/>AUNT ANNE                  G5
at this hour of the morning ? Say I'm not down yet, and
shall be at least three hours before I am; but keep the
breakfast hot somehow."
"Couldn't you see her ?"
"No, no; she would want to weep over me if she heard
that I was going, and I know I should laugh. Manage to
get rid of her soon "-and he flew up-stairs as the street-
door was opened.
" My dear Florence," Mrs. Baines said, as she walked in
with a long footstep and a truly tragic air, "let me put
my arms round you, my poor darling."
"Why, Aunt Anne, what is the matter?" Florence
asked, cheerfully, and witl considerable astonishment.
" You are very brave, my love," the old lady said, scan-
ning her niece's face; " but I know all-an hour ago I had
a letter, telling me of Walter's departure. My dear, it
will break your heart."
"But why ?"
"My love, it will."
"Oh no," Florence said, "I am not so foolish. Life is
full of ordinary events that bring out very keen feelings.
I have been thinking that lately; but one must learn to
take them calmly."
"You do not know what you will suffer when he is
gone."
" No, Aunt Anne. I shall miss him, of course; but I
shall hope that he is enjoying himself."
"My dear Florence, I expected to find you broken-
hearted."
"Tlat would be cruel to him. I am glad he is going
-it will do him good; and really I have not had time to
think of myself yet, I have been so busy."
Mrs. Baines considered for a moment.

<pb n="66"/>66                  AUNT ANNE
" That is the reason; I knew there was an explanation
somewhere," she said, in an earnest, emotional tone. " I
knew how unselfish you were from the first momenlt I
saw you, Florence. It is like you, my darling, not to
think of yourself. Try not to do so, for you will feel
your loneliness bitterly enough when he is gone."
"But don't tell me so," Florence said, half crying, half
laughing. "ILowv did you know about it, Aunt Anne i"
"Mr. Wimple told me."
"Mr. Wimple!-have you seen him then'?"
"My love, he is one of the most cultivated men I ever
met. We have many tastes and sympathies in common.
He wrote to ask me to meet him by the Albert Memo-
rial."
"To meet him!" exclaimed Florence.
"Yes," answered the old lady, solemnlly. "I-Ie agrees
with me that never was there in any age or country a
more beautiful work than the Albert Memorial. We ar-
ranged to meet and examine it together. IIe wrote to me
just now and mentioned that Walter was going to India.
I telegraphed to Mr. Wimple instantly that I could see
no one else to-day, for I knew that you would welcome
my loving sympathy. I came to offer it to you, Flor-
ence."  She said the last words in a disappointed and
injured voice.
"It was very kind of you, Aunt Anne; but indeed I
have only had time to be glad that he would get a rest
and pleasant change of work."
"I must see him before he goes; I may never do so
again," Mrs. Baines said, after a pause.
" Oh yes, you will, dear."
"I lave brought him two little tokens that I thought
of him as I hastened to you after hearing the news. I





<pb n="67"/>AUNT ANNE                   67
thought they would be useful to him. These are glycer-
ine lozenges, Florence; they are excellent for the throat.
Tlhe sea mist or the desert sand is sure to affect it."
"Thank you, it was very kind of you-you are much
too generous; you make us quite uneasy."  Florence was
miserable at the two evils suggested.
"My love, if I had thousands a year you should have
them," Aunt Anne answered, and, intent on her present-
making, slhe went on, " and here is a little case of scissors,
they are of different sizes. I know how much gentle-
men "-Aunt Anne always said gentlemen, never " men,"
as do the women of to-day--"like to find a pair suited to
their requirements at the moment; I tlought that they
might be useful to himn on tie voyage."  She gave a sigh
of relief, as though presenting her gifts lad removed a
load from her mind. "I suppose Walter is not down
yet, Imy love?"
"Ile is up-stairs," Florence said, a little guiltily, " I am
afraid lel will not be down just yet."
Aunt Anne gave a reflective wink, as though she per-
fectly understood the reason of Walter's non-appearance;
but if she did she lad far too much tact to betray it.
" If it be your wish, nly dear, I will forego thle pleasure
of saying a last good-by to hin."
"Well, dear Aunt Anne, when he does come down he
will have a great deal to do," Florence answered, still
more guiltily, for she could not lhelp feeling that Aunt
Anne saw through the ruse.
"My love, I quite understand," Mrs. Baincs said, sol-
emnly; "and he will know that it was from no lack of
affection that I did not wait to see him."
"Poor Aunt Anne!" Florence thought when she had
gone. "She would wring a tragedy from every daily trial





<pb n="68"/>68                  AUNT ANNE
if she were encouraged. " Oh, you wicked coward," she
said to Walter, " to run away like that !"
"Yes, my darling. But I am starved-and really, you
know, Floggie, confound Aunt Anne !"
" Oh, but she is very kind," Florence said, as she dis-
played the presents. "I ow did Mr. Wimple know that
you were going to India ?" she asked.
"I met him yesterday at the office. IIe went to see
Fisher; it was arranged that he should the other night."
"It is very extraordinary, his striking up a friendship
with Aunt Anne."
"Yes, very extraordinary," he laughed, and then the old
lady was forgotten.
Tile days flew by, and the last one came. To-mor-
row (Thursday) Walter was to start by an early train
for Southampton. All his arrangements were com-
plete, and on that last day he had virtually nothing to
do, "therefore, Floggie dear," he pleaded, "let us have
a spree."
"Yes," she answered, willingly enough, though her heart
was heavier than his. "H ow shall we manage it ?"
"Let us stroll about all day or go to Richmond, and
come back and have a cosey little dinner somewhere."
"Here," she pleaded; "let us dine here, in our own
home, on this last evening; we'll have a very nice din-
ner."
"Very nice indeed I"
"Very nice indeed, you greedy thing !"
"All right, darling, suppose you go and order it. Then
get ready, and let's start as soon as possible; we'll amuse
ourselves well, and forget that we have not a month to do
it in. Live and be happy in the present day, dear Flog-





<pb n="69"/>AUNT ANNE                   69
gie," he went on, in a mock-serious tone, "for there is al-
ways a chance that to-morrow will not declare itself."
So they went off, like the boy he was in spite of his
more than thirty years, and the girl that she sometimes
felt herself to be still in spite of the two children and
the eight years of matrimony. They walked a little way.
Then Walter had a brilliant idea.
"Let's get into a hansom," he said, "drive to Waterloo
Station, and take the first train that is going in any pleas-
ant direction; I think Waterloo is the best place for that
sort of speculation. This beggar's horse looks pretty good
-jump in."
As they drove up to the station, a four-wheeled cab
moved away, the cabman grumbling at the sum that had
been given him by two people, a man and a woman, who
still stood on the station steps looking after him.
"Why, there's Wimple," Walter exclaimed; "and who's
that with him, I wonder ?"
Florence looked up quickly. Mr. Wimple wore a shabby
gray coat, and round his neck and over his mouth there
was a gray comforter, for the October morning was slight-
ly chilly. In his hand he carried a worn brown portman-
teau. Beside him stood a tall, good-looking young woman
of five-and-twenty, commonly, almost vulgarly dressed.
She looked after the departing cab with a scowl on her
face that told it was she who had paid the scanty fare.
As they stood together, they looked poor and common
and singularly unprepossessing; it was impossible to help
feeling that they were nearly connected. They looked
like husband and wife, and of an indefinite and insignifi-
cant class. Suddenly Alfred Wimple caught Walter's eye;
lie nodded, gravely, without the least confusion, but he ev-
idently said something, quickly and in a low tone, to his





<pb n="70"/>70                  AUNT ANNE
companion, for they hurried away through one of the sta-
tion doors.
"That horrid Mr. Wimple seems to possess us lately,"
Florence thought.
As they went from the ticket office, she saw Mr. Wim-
ple and his friend hurrying along the platform. A min-
ute later they had entered a Portsmouth train which was
on the point of starting.
"If that's his Liplook friend, I don't think much of
the looks of her.  Alfred always picked up with odd
people," Walter thought, but he kept tlese reflections to
himself; all he said aloud was, "I say, Floggie dear, if
Wimple turns up while I'm away, don't be uncivil to him,
and give him food if you can manage it. Somehow lie
always looks half starved, poor beggar! Fisher is going
to give him some reviewing to do-perhaps that will
help him a bit."
There was a train going to Windsor in ten minutes; so
they went by it, and strolled down by the river, and looked
at the boats, and went into the town, and looked at the
slops and tlhe outside of the castle. Then they lunched
at the confectioner's, an extravagant lunch which Walter
ordered, and afterwards, while they were still drowsy and
happy, they hired an open fly and drove to Virginia
Water. They hurried back to Windsor in time to catch
tlie 6 P.M. train for town, by lhalf a minute, and congratu-
lated themselves upon finding an empty carriage.
" I shall always remember this dear day," Florence said,
as they sat over their last little dinner at home.
"That's a good thing," Walter said, " and so will I, dear
wife. When I come back we'll have another like it in
memory of this one's success."  Then he rememlbered
Alfred WimpTc: "I should like to know who that girl





<pb n="71"/>AUNT ANNE                    71
was," he thought; " wonder if she's the daughter of an-
other tailor he doesn't want to pay; and if I met him
to-morrow I wonder lwhat he le would tell me about
her-he always lied, poor beggar !" And this slows that
Walter's tlouglts were sometimes not as charitable as his
words.
Tlhe next day, very early, Walter departed for South-
ampton; Florence went to see him safely on board.
"We shall have the good little journey together," lie
said, dismally, for he was loatl enough to leave his wife,
now that the parting-time had come.
But it seemed as if the train flew along the rails in its
hurry to get near the sea, and the journey was over di-
rectly.  There was all the bustle of getting on board, and
almost before she knew it, Florence was on her way back
to London alone. As if in a dream she walked home
from the station, thinking of her husband watcling the
sea as it widened between him and England. She was
glad she had seen the ship; she could imagine lim seat-
ed at the long table in the saloon, witl the punkahs-use-
less enough at present-waving overhead, or in his cabin,
looking out through the porthole at the white crests of
the waves. Yes. She could see all his surroundings
plainly. She gave a long sigh. She was a brave little
woman, and had tried so hard not to break down before
Walter, though in the last moment on board, when she
had felt as if her heart would break, she had not been
able altogether to help it. But now, as she walked home
in the dusk without him, she felt as if she could not live
throughl the long montlis of separation.
" But I will, I will," she said to herself, wlile tlhe tears
trickled down her face. "Only it is hard, for tlere is no
one in the world like him-no one, no ond, and we have
never been parted before."





<pb n="72"/>72                  AUNT ANNE
Every moment, too, she remembered, took him farther
and farther away. She told herself again and again how
much good the journey would do him, how glad she was
that he would get the change; but human nature is human
nature still, and will not be controlled by argument. So
she quickened her pace, resolving not to give way till she
was safe in the darkness of her own room, hidden from
the eyes of the servants, and then she would let her mis-
ery have its fling.
She looked up at the house with a sigh. It would be
so still without Walter. There was a flickering light in
the drawing-room. Probably the servants had put a lamp
there, for the days were growing short-it was nearly dark
already. The children would be in bed, but they were
certain not to be asleep, and she thought of the little
shout of welcome they would give when they heard her
footstep on the stair as she went up to kiss them.  She
let herself in with Walter's latch-key-she kissed it as she
took it from her pocket, and nearly cried again-and then,
having entered, she stood still and wondered. There in
the hall were two square boxes-boxes of the sort that
were used before overland trunks came into fashion, and
when American arks were unknown. They were covered
with brown holland, bordered with faded red braid, and
corded with thick brown cord. Stitched on to each
cover was a small whlite card, on each of which was writ-
ten, in the hand Florence knew so well, [rs. Baines, care
of Mfrs. Walter ilibbert. While she was still contemplat-
ing the address, a servant, who had heard her enter, came
up.
"M rs. Baines has been here since eleven o'clock, ma'am,"
she said; "she's in the drawing-room, and has had noth-
ing to eat all day except a cup of tea and a little toast that





<pb n="73"/>AUNT ANNE                   73
nurse made her have at four o'clock. She's been waiting
to see you."
It was evident that there had been some catastrophe.
The next moment Florence had run up-stairs and entered
the drawing-room.
"Aunt Anne !" she exclaimed, " what has happened ?"
The old lady had been standing by the fireplace. Her
thin white hands were bare, but she still wore her cloak
and black, close-fitting bonnet, though she had thrown
aside the crape veil. Her face looked worn and anxious,
but a look of indignation came to her eyes as Florence en-
tered-a last little flash of remembered insult; then she
advanced with outstretched hands.
"Florence," she said, "I have come to you for advice
and shelter; I have been insulted-and humiliated "-a
quaver came into her voice; she could not go on till in-
dignation returned to give her strength. "Florence," she
began again, "I have come to you. I-I-"
"Aunt Anne, dear Aunt Anne," Florence said, aching
with fatigue, and feeling, ruefully, that her longing for
rest and quiet was not likely to be satisfied, yet thinking,
oddly enough too, even while she spoke, of Walter going
on farther and farther away across the darkening sea,
" what is the matter ?-tell me, dear !" There was a throb-
bing pain in her head. It was like the thud-thud of the
screw on board Walter's ship.
Aunt Anne raised her head and spoke, firmly,
"Mly love, I have been insulted."
"Insulted, Aunt Anne !-but how ?"
" Yes, my love-insulted. I frequently had occasion to
reprove the servants for their conduct-for the want of re-
spect they showed me. The cook was abominable, and a
reprimand had no effect upon her. To-day her imper-





<pb n="74"/>74                  AUNT ANNE
tinence was past endurance. I told Mrs. North so, and
that she must be dismissed. Mfrs. North refused-refused,
though her servant had forgotten what was due to me,
and this morning-I can't repeat her words."
"Well," said Florence, "but surely you did not let a
servant drive-"
"No, dear Florence; it was not the cook who drove me
out-I should not allow a subordinate to interfere with my
life-it was Mrs. North. She has behaved cruelly to me.
She listened to her servants in preference to me. I told
her that they showed me no respect, that they entirely
forgot what was due to me, and unless she made an ex-
ample, and dismissed one of them, it would be impossible
for me to stay in her house, that-tlhat, I can't repeat it
all, Florence; and, my love, there were other reasons-
that are impossible to repeat; but I am here-I am liere,
homeless, and miserable, and insulted. I flew to you. I
knew you would be indignant-that your dear heart would
feel for me."
"But you were so happy there 2"
"Yes, my love, I was."
"And Mrs. North was so kind to you," Florence went
on, regretfully; "could you not have managed-"
"No, my love, I must remember what is due to myself."
Oh, but, dear Aunt Anne, don't you think it would
have been better to have put up-"
"Florence, if you cannot sympathize with me I must
ask you not to discuss the matter," the old lady answered,
raising her head and speaking in a tone of surprise; " there
is no trouble you could have come to me with that I should
not have felt about as you did."
Aunt Anne had a remarkable gift for fighting her own
battles, Florence thought.





<pb n="75"/>AUNT ANNE                   75
"But don't you see, Aunt Anne, that-"
"I would prefer not to discuss the matter, my love,"
the old lady said, loftily. " Yo are so young and inex-
perienced that perhaps you cannot enter into my feelings.
Either the cook or I had to leave the house. There were
other reasons too, I repeat, why I deemed it unadvisable
to remain. Mrs. North has lately slown a levity of man-
ner that I could not countenance: her sister is no longer
with her, and her husband is thousands of miles away,
yet she is always ready for amusement. I cannot believe
that she loves her husband, or she would show more re-
gret at his absence. I have known what a happy marriage
is, Florence, and you know what it is too, my love. You
can, therefore, understand that I thought her conduct rep-
rehensible."
"Yes," Florence said, wearily, " I know, I know."
Then she rang the bell and ordered tea to be made
ready in the dining-room-a substantial tea of the sort
that women love and men abhor.
"Now rest and forget all the worries," she said, gently.
"You are tired and excited; try and forget everything till
you have had some tea and are rested. The spare room
is quite ready, and you shall go to bed early, as I will, for
it has been a long day."
" I know what you must have gone through "-and Mrs.
P3aines shook her head, sadly; "and that you want to be
alone to think of your dear Walter. But I will only in-
trude on you for one night; to-morrow I will find an apart-
nlent."
"You must not talk like tlat, for you are very wel-
come, Aunt Anne," Florence said, gently, though she
could not help inwardly chafing at the intrusion, and
longing to be alone.
<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 





<pb n="76"/>76                  AUNT ANNE
"Tell me, love, did Walter go off comfortably ?" Mrs.
Baines asked, speaking with the air people sometimes
speak of those who have died rather to the satisfaction of
their relations.
"Yes, he sailed a few hours ago. I have just come
back from Southampton."
"I know it," Aunt Anne answered, her voice full of
untold feeling. "Did he take my simple gifts with him,
dear ?"
"Yes, he took them," Florence answered, gratefully;
"but come down-stairs, Aunt Anne, you must be worn
out."
Then in a moment Aunt Anne recovered her old man-
ner, the manner that had some indefinable charm in it,
and looked at Florence.
"Yes, my love," she said, "I am very much fatigued,
and thankful indeed to enjoy your hospitality again. Be-
fore I retire to rest I must write some letters, if you will
permit your servant to post them."
Florence had to write one or two letters also. She gave
three to the little housemaid to post; as she did so, one of
Aunt Anne's caught her eye. It was addressed to Alfred
Wimple. "Perhaps she wanted to tell him something
about the Albert Memorial," she thought, wearily, and
dismissed the matter from her mind.





<pb n="77"/>CHAPTER VI
TIEN it was that Florence discovered that Aunt Anne
was really a charming person to have in the house, espe-
cially with clildrcn. She was so bright, so clever with
them, so full of little surprises. In her pocket there al-
ways lingered some unexpected little present, and at the
tip of her tongue some quaint bit of old-world knowledge
that was as interesting to grown-up folk as to the children.
To see her prim figure about the place seemed to Florence
like having lavender among her linen. She was useful
too-ready with her fingers to darn some little place in a
table-cloth that every one else had overlooked, to sew a but-
ton on Monty's little shoe, or to mend a tear in Catty's
pinafore. Above all, she was so complimentary, so full
of admiration, and it was quite evident that she meant
with her whole heart all the pretty things she said. She
did, too. Walter was the son of her favorite brother, and
to Florence she had really taken a fancy from the begin-
ning.
"I loved you from the first moment, my love," she said.
"I shall never forget the look of happiness on your face
that morning at Brighton I met you and your dear Walter
togetler. It endeared you to me. It was a happy day,"
she added, witl a sigh.
"Yes, a very lhappy day," Florence answered, affection-
ately, remembering how ungrateful both she and dear
Walter had been at the time. This was at breakfast one





<pb n="78"/>78                  AUNT ANNE
morning, a week after Walter's departure. She was pour-
ing out the coffee very quickly, because she longed to open
her letters, though she knew it was not possible to get yet
the one he had posted from Gibraltar.
Aunt Anne meanwhile was undoing a little packet that
had come by post, addressed to her. Catty and Monty,
having finished their porridge, were intently watching.
She stopped when she noticed the gravity of their faces.
"My love," she said, in the tone of one asking a great
favor, " have I your permission to give these dear children
some bread and jam ?"
" Ol yes, of course," Florence answered, not looking up
from the long letter she was reading.
Aunt Anne, quick to notice, saw that it had a foreign
postmark and an enclosure that looked like a check.
Then she cut some bread and took off the crust before
she spread a quantity of butter on the dainty slices and
piled on the top of the butter as much jam as they could
carry.
"01 !" cried the children, with gleeful surprise.
"Dear Aunt Anne," exclaimed Florence, looking up
when she heard it, "I never give them quite so much but-
ter with quite so much jam. It is too rich for them, and
we don't cut off the crusts."
"The servants will eat them."
" Indeed they will not," laughed Florence; " they don't
like crusts."
"You are much too good to them, love, as you are to
every one. They should do as they are told, and be glad
to take what they can get. I never have patience with
the lower classes," she added, in the gentlest of voices.
But the words gave Florence a sudden insight into the
reason of Aunt Anne's collapse at Mrs. North's, a catas-





<pb n="79"/>AUNT ANNE                   79
troplle to which the old lady never referred. Tlhe very
mention of Mrs. North's name made her manner a little
distant.
" And then, you know," Florence said, ever careful, and
now especially anxious to make the very short allowance
on which she had put herself in her husband's absence
hold out, "we must not let the children learn to be dainty,
must we? So they must try to eat up the crusts of their
bread, and we only give them a little butter when they
have jam. I never had butter and jam together at all at
home"--and she stroked Catty's fat little hand while she
went on reading her letter. " Grandma has written from
France, my babes," she said, looking up after a few min-
utes; "she sends you each a kiss and five shillings to
spend."
"I shall buy a horse and be a soldier," Monty declared.
"I shall buy a present for mummy and a little one for
Aunt Anne," said Catty.
"Bless you! my darling, for thinking of me," the old
lady said, fervently, and suddenly opening a tin of Devon-
shire cream, she piled a mass of it on to the bread and
butter and jam already before the astonished children.
Aunt Anne's nature gloried in profusion.
" Wy," said Florence, not noticing anything at table,
"here is a letter from Madame Celestinc-her name is on
the seal, at least. I don't owe her anythinfg. Oh no, it
isn't for me. .Mrs. Baines, care of Xirs. IWalter HIibbert.
It is for you, Aunt Anne."
"Thank you, my love."   Mrs. Baines took it, witl an
air of slight but dignified vexation. "It was remiss of
your servant not to put all my letters beside me. I am
sorry you should be troubled with my correspondence."
" But it doesn't matter," Florence answered. "I hope





<pb n="80"/>80                  AUNT ANNE
you have not found her very expensive; she can be so
sometimes." And through Florence's mind there went a
remembrance of the dress in which Aunt Anne had ap-
peared on the night of the dinner-party. A little flush, or
something like one, went across the old lady's withered
cheek.
"My love," she said, almost haughtily, "I have not yet
given her charges my consideration. I have been too
much engaged with more important matters."
"I only hope she does not owe for that dress," Flor-
ence thought, but she did not dare ask any questions.
"Madame Celestine is not a comfortable creditor, nor
usually a small one."
Then she understood Catty's and Monty's extreme si-
lence for the past few minutes. It had suddenly dawned
upon her how unusual it was.
"Why, my beloved babes," she exclaimed, " what are
you eating?" and she looked across, laughingly, at Aunt
Anne. "VWhere did those snowy mountains of cream
come from ?"
"They came by post, just now, my love," Mrs. Baines
said, firmly.
" Oh, you are much too kind, Aunt Anne; but you will
spoil the children, you will indeed, as well as their diges-
tions. You are much too good to them; but we shall have
to send them away if you corrupt them in this delicious
manner."
"It is most nutritious, I assure you," Aunt Anne an-
swered, witl great gravity, while with dogged and desper-
ate haste she piled more and more cream on to Monty's
plate. "I thought you would like it, Florence. I have
ordered three pounds to be sent in one-pound tins at inter-
vals of three days. I hoped that you would think it good





<pb n="81"/>AUNT ANNE                   81
for the dear children-tliat they would have your appro-
bation in eating it."
"Of course, of course, and I shall eat some too," Flor-
ence answered, trying to clase away Aunt Anne's earnest-
ness; "only you are much too good to them."
The old lady looked up, witl a tender smile on her face.
"It is not possible to be good enough to your children,
my darling-yours and Walter's."
"Dear Walter," said Florence, as she rose from the
table; "I shall be glad to get his letter. Now, my mon-
keys, my vagabonds, my darlings, go up-stairs and tell nurse
to take you out at once to see the trees and the ducks
in the pond; go along, go along"-and she ran playfully
after the clildrcn.
"May I go and buy my horse ?" asked Monty; "and I
think I shall buy a sword too. I want to kill a man."
"IIe is just like his father," exclaimed Aunt Anne.
" Wlat is Catty going to do with her money ?" she asked.
"Give it to mummy," the clild answered, softly.
"And she is just like you, dear Florence," said the old
lady, in a cloking voice.
"She is just like herself, and therefore like a dickie-
bird, and a wlite rabbit, and a tortoise-shell kitten, and
many other things too numerous to mention," Florence
lauglled, overtaking Catty and kissing her little round
face; "but go, my babes, go-go and get ready, your be-
loved mummy wants to turn you out of doors;" and,
shouting with joy, the children scampered off.
Florence took up the Times.
"Won't you lhave the paper, Aunt Anne, and a quiet
quarter of an hour?"
"Tlank you, no, my love; I rarely care to peruse it
until a more leisurely time of the day. With your per-
6





<pb n="82"/>82                  AUNT ANNE
mission I will leave you now; I have an hour or two's
business out of doors-are there any commissions I could
execute for you 2"
"No, thank you."
Aunt Anne was always thoughtful, Florence said to her-
self. Every morning since she came this question had
been asked and answered in almost the same words.
"By the way, Aunt Anne, Mr. Wimple called yester-
day. I am sorry I was not at home "-and this she felt
to be a fib.
"He told me that he intended to do so before he left
town."
There was a strange light on Aunt Anne's face when
she spoke of him; her niece saw it, with wonder.
"I dare say she takes a sort of motherly interest in
him," she said to herself. "IIe is delicate, and she has no
belongings; poor old lady ! how sad it must be to have no
belongings-no husband, no children, no mother, no any-
thing. I don't wonder her sympathies go out even to
Mr. Wimple." Then, aloud, she asked, " Is le going away
for long ?"
" IHe is going to some friends near Portsmouth by the
twelve Qtclock train to-day "-and Mrs. Baines glanced at
the clock, " from Waterloo," she added.
"Are you going to see him off, Aunt Anne?"
"My love, I have an engagement in the City at one
o'clock. I am going out now, but I cannot say what mv
movements will be between this and then."
In a moment Aunt Anne's voice was a shade distant.
Florence had only asked the question as a little joke and
with no notion that Aunt Anne would take it seriously.
"I didn't mean to be curious," she said, and stroked the
old lady's shoulder.





<pb n="83"/>AUNT ANNE                  83
"I know you did not, my darling. Yon are the last
person in the world to colmmit a solecism "-and again
there came a smile to Aunt Anne's face. It made Flor-
ence stoop and kiss her.
" And you did tell me of your expedition to the Albert
Memorial, remember," she went on, wickedly; "and I
know that you and Mr. Wimple are very sympathetic to
each other."
" You are right, Florence. We have many tastes and
sympathies in unison. We find it pleasant to discuss
them together. Good-by, my love; do not wait lunch-
eon for me. I shall probably partake of it with a friend"
-and she left the room. Florence took up the Times
again, but she could not read for thinking uneasily of the
bill which she felt convinced Madame Celestine had just
sent to Aunt Anne.
"I wish I could pay it," she thought; " but I can't, in
spite of mamma's present this morning. It is probably at
least fifteen pounds. Besides, Aunt Anne is such a pecul-
iar old lady that the chances are she would be offended
if I did."
She put down the paper, and sat thinking for a few
minutes. Then she went to the writing-table in the cor-
ner by the fireplace, unlocked the corner drawer and took
out a little china bowl in which she was in the habit of
keeping the money she had in the house. Four pounds
in gold and a five-pound note. She took out the note, put
in a check, locked the drawer, and waited.
When she heard the soft footsteps of Aunt Anne de-
scending the stairs she went to the door, nervously, un-
certain how what she was going to do would be received.
Mrs. Baines was dressed ready to go out. She was a little
smarter than usual. Round her throat there was some





<pb n="84"/>84                   AUNT ANNE
soft white muslin tied in a large bow that fell on her
chest and relieved tlle soiubreness of her attire. Tile
heavy crape veil she usually wore was replaced by a
thinner one that had little spots of jet upon it.
"Aunt Anne, you look as if you were going to a party."
The old lady was almost confused, like a person who is
found out in some roguish mischief of which she is half,
but only half, ashamed.
" My love, I only go to your parties," she said; " tlhere
are no others in the world that would tempt me."
" Can you come to me for five minutes before you start?
I won't keep you longer."
"Yes, witl pleasure," Aunt Anne answered ; "but it
must only be for five minutes, if you will excuse me for
saying so, for I have an appointment that I should deeply
regret not being able to keep."
Florence led the old lady to an easy-chair and shut the
door. Then she knelt down by her side, saying, humbly,
but with a voice full of joy, for she was deliglted at what
she was going to do, if Aunt Anne would only let her do it,
"I want to tell you that-tlhat I had a letter fronm ny
mother this morning."
"I know, my love. I hope she is well, and that you
have no anxiety about her."
"Oh no."
"She must long to see you, Florence dear."
"She does, she is such a dear mother-and she is coin-
ing to England in two or three weeks' tince."
" Ier society will be a great solace to you."
"Yes; but what I wanted to tell you is that she has sent
me.a present."
" I hope it is a substantial one," Aunt Anne said, cour-
teously.





<pb n="85"/>AUNT ANNE                   85
"Indeed it is."
"It rejoices me greatly to hear it, my love."
"It is money-a check. My mother says she sends it
to cheer me up after losing Walter."
"Slhe knew how your tender heart would miss him, my
darling "-but she was watching Florence intently, witl a
hungry look that a second self seemed trying to control.
"And as I have had a present of filthy lucre, Aunt
Anne, and am delighted and not too proud to take it, so I
want you to lhave a present of filthy lucre and not to be
too proud to take it; but just to have this little five-pound
note because you love me and for any little odd and end
on wliicll you may find it convenient to spend it. It
would be so sweet of you to let me share my present as
my children shared the cream witl you."
Florence bent her head and kissed the old lady's hands
as she pushed the bit of crisp paper into them. Aunt
Anne was not one whit offended; it seemed for a moment
as if she were going to break down and cry; but she con-
trolled herself.
"Bless you, my darling, bless you indeed ! I take it in
the spirit you offer it me. I know the pleasure it is to your
generous heart to give, and it is equally one to me to re-
ceive. I could not refuse any gift from you, Florence,"
she said, kissing Mrs. HIibbcrt, and wllen she departed, it
was with an air of having done a gracious and tender
deed. But, besides this, her footstep hlad grown lighter,
there was a joyfulness in her voice and a flickering smile
on her face that slowed how much pleasure and relief the
money had given her.
"I am so glad," Florence thought, as she noticed it.
"Poor old deal! I wonder if it will go to Madame Celes-
tine, or whlat she will do with it. And I wonder where
she is gone."





<pb n="86"/>CIAPTER VII
FLORENCE'S speculations concerning Aunt Anne were
brought to an end by the arrival of Mr. Fisller. She was
surprised at his paying her so early a visit, and for a
moment feared lest it should mean bad news from Wal-
ter. But his benevolent expression reassured ler.
"I hlope you will forgive my intruding on you at this
hour, Mrs. Itibbert," he said. "My visit is alnost a bus-
iness one, if I may venture to call it so, and I hope its re-
sult may be pleasant to us both."  Iis manner was a faint
echo of Aunt Anne's. " I would have written to ask you
to see me, but the idea that brings me only occurred to
me an hour or two ago."
" But of course I would see you," she answered, bright-
ly. " And I think the morning is a delicious time of day
to which we devote far too much idleness."
"I thoroughly agree with you," he said, and looked at
ler approvingly.  In spite of his bachelorhood he was
quite alive to the duties of domesticity. he bad noticed
quickly that all signs of breakfast had vanisled; he divined
that the clildren were out-of-doors, and that she herself,
with her slate and account books, was deep in household
matters. It was thus, he thought, that a woman should
chiefly concern herself. Her husband, clildren, and home
were her business in life. The rest could be left to the
discretion and management of men. He felt that it was
almost a duty on his part, in the absence of her husband,





<pb n="87"/>AUNT ANNE                   87
to discreetly manage Florence. Moreover, in the intervals
of editing his paper, he had a turn for arranging the lives
of other people, and he felt it almost an obligation to give
a good deal of time to the consideration of the private af-
fairs of his staff. IIe liked the Ilibberts, too, and was
really anxious to be good and useful to them. IIe liad
come to the conclusion that it was a pity that Florence
and her children should stay in London while Walter was
away. "She would be munch better in the country," lie
thouglht; " the children could run about; besides, vwhat is
the good of keeping that cottage near Witley empty?"
And then he remembered his own mother, wlio was sev-
enty years old and lived far off in the wilds of Nor-
thumberland. Iler sole amusement appeared to be writ-
ing her son letters, lamenting that he never went to stay
with her, and that, since he lived in small and incon-
venient bachelor chambers, she could not go and stay
with him. "It would not be a bad idea if I had the old
lady up for a couple of Inontlls, and took the Ilibberts'
house," he said to himself. The idea grew upon him.
He imagined the dinners he could give to his staff and
their wives-not to the outside world, for it bothered
him. "We might ask Ethel Dunlop occasionally," lie
thought; "a bright little minx would brighten up the
old lady."  "Little minx" he considered a befitting epi-
thet for a girl in her twenties. IIe remembered the
twenties with regret, and wislled they were thirties; tlen
lie would not have felt so keenly the difference in years
between them. But he reflected tlat, after all, he was
still in the prime of life; and he struggled to feel youth-
ful; but, struggle as he would, youthful feelings held aloof.
They were coy after forty, he supposed, and, looking back,
be consoled himself by thinking that they had been rather





<pb n="88"/>88                   AUNT ANNE
foolish. Then he thought of Ethel's cousin; confound
her cousin!-slie seemed to like going about with him.
Perhaps he made love to her; yet he was too much of a
hobble-de-loy for tlhat, surely-threc-and-twenty at lost-
a very objectionable time of life in the masculine sex, a
time of dash and impudence and doing of things from
slicer bravado at which wisdom, knowledge, and middle
age hesitated. Ethel was probably only amusing herself
witlh hiim. To fall in love with a cousin would show a
lack of originality of wliicli he was slow to suspect her.
lie wondered what the cousin did, and if he wanted a post
of any sort; if he lhad a turn for writing and adventure.
Perhaps he could be sent as special correspondent to the
Gold Coast, vwhere the climate would probably sufficiently
engross him. Ethel at any rate might be invited to see
his mother; it would cheer tlhe old lady up to have a girl
about ler. Yes, he had quite made up his mind. Mrs.
IIlibbert should go to her country cottage with hler two
children; he would take the house near Portland Road for
a couple of months; and the rest would arrange itself.
"I don't know whether Walter would like it," Florence
said, when Mr. Fisher had explained his errand.
"I'll answer for Walter," IMr. Fisher said, concisely.
Of course lie, a man, knew better than she did what Wal-
ter, also a man, would like; that was plainly conveyed in
his manner. " It will be better for you and the children,"
he went on, witli gracious benevolence, for as he looked at
Florence he thought how girlish she was. Iie felt, quite
strongly, that in her husband's absence it was his duty to
look after her, and to teaclh her, pleasantly, the way in
wliicll she should go. " I will send you plenty of novels
to read, and if you would allow me to introduce you to
her," he added, with a sllade of pomposity in his voice,





<pb n="89"/>AUNT ANNE                    89
" tlere is a friend of mine at Witley-Mrs. Burnett. You
would be company for each other, I should say, for her
husband comes up to town\ every morning, and-"
"I know her a little," Florence said; "a tall, slight
woman, with sweet gray eyes."
"I never looked at her eyes," Mr. Fisher said, quickly,
and Florence felt reproved for having mentioned them.
Of course he would not look at the eyes of a married
woman. Mr. Fisher had clear and distinct views about
the proprieties, which he thought were invented especially
for married and marriageable women. " lerhaps Miss
Dunlop would pay you a visit," he suggested.
"She has her father to take care of.  Besides, Mrs.
Baines is staying with me."
"I saw Mrs. Baines witli Wimple the other day. Ias
slhe adopted himi ?"
"Witl Mr. Wimple ?" Florence said, bewildered at the
sudden mention of the name again; and then, remembering
Walter, she added, loyally, "she likes him because he is
Walter's friend."
"lie writes well," Mr. Fisher answered, as if he were
making a remark that surprised himself. "IIe has done
some work for us, and done it very well, too."
Tlhen he unfolded the details in regard to the taking of
the house.
Florence found, to her surprise, that he had arranged
them all carefully.
"Let me see," he said, "this is Monday. You can go
by Saturday, I suppose? I think that would be the best
day for my mother to arrive."
"Oh yes. There are thlings to get ready and to put
away, of course."
"They won't take you long," he answered, shortly.





<pb n="90"/>90                  AUNT ANNE
"I suppose it will do the children good," she said, re-
luctantly.
" Of course it will."
"I might ask Aunt Anne to take tlhe children to-nor-
row-I am sure she would; then I could soon get the place
ready."
"Mrs. Baines? Yes, it would be an excellent plan to
send her on first."
" It is very kind of you; don't you tlink that you are
really paying too much rent, Mr. Fisher ?"
"Not at all, not at all; it is a fair one, and I shall be
very glad to have the house."
She was really a nice little woman, he thought-docile,
and far from stupid; she only wanted a little managing.
lie llad a suspicion that Walter was too easy-going, and if
so, this little experience would be excellent for her; it
would teach her that, after all, men were the governing
race.
"Very well then, Saturday. Good-by. Oh, by the way,
I should like to ask Miss Dunlop to come and see my
mother; do you think she would mind cheering her up
sometimes ?"
"O11 no. she is a nice girl, too."
" We might make a party to tlhe tleatre one night, per-
haps. By the way, Mrs. IIibbert," he exclaimed, a sudden
thought striking him, "I shall write to Walter as soon
as I get to the office and tell him of this arrangement. I
might as well enclose a note from you. The mail goes
out to-day from Southampton, so that it would be too late
to post, but I am sending specially by rail. I will wait
while you write a note, and enclose it in mine."
"I wrote by this mail last night," slhe answered. " But
I should like to tell him about the house-hle might be





<pb n="91"/>AUNT ANNE                   91
angry."  She laughed at the last words. She only said
them to keep up Walter's dignity.
"Oh no, he won't be angry," Mr. Fisher laughed back,
and Florence thought he was quite good-looking when he
was not too grave. he did not look more than forty,
either-perhaps Ethel might be happy witl him. Then,
when she had written a few lines, he departed, satisfied
with the result of his visit.
An odd thing happened about that note. Ile went
straight to the office and found a dozen matters of busi-
ness awaiting his attention, and all remembrance of the
ilibberts fled from him. Suddenly, an lour later, lie
dived into his pocket for a memorandum, and pulled out
an unopened white envelope. he did not look at the ad-
dress. " What's tlis?" he said, in utter forgetfulness, and
tore it open; and-for his own name caught his eye-lhe
read this passage in Mrs. IIibbert's note to her husband,
" -  he is a kind old fogy, and I think he likes .Ethel
D. Would it not be funny if he marfied her ?"
lie folded it up quickly, for fear he should read more.
" Why should it be funny, and a man isn't an old fogy at
forty-" he said to himself.
Meanwhile Aunt Anne was deeply engaged. She was
delighted at Florence's unexpected gift; it would enable
ler to do a few things that only an hour or two ago she
had felt to be impossible. She had not the least intention
of paying Madame Celestine. she looked upon her as an
inferior who must be content to wait till it was the pleas-
nre of her superior to rememlber her bill, and any remind-
er of it she resented as a liberty. She spent a happy and
very excited hour in Regent Street, and at eleven o'clock
stood on the curbstone critically looking for a hansom.





<pb n="92"/>92                   AUNT ANNE
She let several go by that did not please ler; but at last,
with excellent instinct, she picked out a good horse and a
smart driver, and a minute later was whirling on towards
Waterloo Station. She liked driving in hansoms; she
was of opinion that they were well-constructed, a great
improvement on older modes of conveyance, and that it
was the positive duty of people in a certain rank of life
to encourage all meritorious achievements witl their ap-
proval. She never for a moment doubted that she was
one of those vwhose approval was imnportant. She felt her
own individuality very strongly, and was convinced that
the world recognized it. She was keenly sensible of nmak-
ing effects-and it was odd, but, for all her eccentricities,
there was in her the making of a great lady; or it might
have seemed to a philosophical speculator that she was
made of the worn-out fragments of some past great lady,
and dimly remembered, at intervals, her former impor-
tance. Shec had perfect control over her manner, and
could use it to the best advantage; she had reserve, a
power of keeping off familiarity, a graciousness, a win-
'someness when she chose, that all belonged to a certain
type and a certain class. As slic went on swiftly to the
station she looked half-disdainfully, yet compassionately,
at the people who walked and the people wlo passed in
omnibuses. She told herself that the list were excellent
institutions; she wondered what the lower class would do
without them; it rejoiced her to think that they lhad not
got to do without them; it was a satisfaction to feel tliat
sle could enjoy her own superior condition without com-
punction.
At Waterloo, with an air of decision that showed a per-
feet knowledge of her own generosity, she gave the cab-
man sixpence over his fare and walked slowly into the sta-





<pb n="93"/>AUNT ANNE                    93
tion. She looked up and down the platform from which
the Portsmouth train would depart, but saw no one she
knew. She stood for a moment, hesitating, and winked
slowly to herself. Then she went to the book-stall and
bought a Times and a lIorning I'ost; and again her
mania for present-giving asserted itself, and, quickly, she
bought also a pile of illustrated papers and magazines.
"Gentlemen always like the Field," she said to herself,
and added it to the heap. she turned away with them in
her arms, and as she did so Alfred Wimple stood facing
her.
"I have ventured to purchase a few papers, hloping they
will beguile you on your journey," she said.
Mr. Wimple was as grave as ever, and as ricketty on his
legs. Iis face showed no sign of pleasure at the sight of
the old lady, but his manner was deferential; he seemed
to be trying to impress certain indefinite facts upon her.
"I never read in a train," he answered, " but I shall be
glad of them at the end of the journey. Thank you."
HIe said the last two words with a sigh, and put the pa-
pers in the corner he had already secured of the railway
carriage. he looked at the clock. Twenty minutes be-
fore he started. IIe seemed to consider soniething for a
moment, looking critically at the old lady wlile he did so.
"Cannot I persuade you to give me your address in
Hampshire ?" he coughed a little. " Have you got your
glycerine lozenges witl you ?" she asked, hurriedly.
"Yes," he answered; "tlhey are in my pocket. I will
write to you, Mrs. Baines; I may have sometling of in-
portance to say."
"Everything that you say to me is important," she an-
swered, nervously.
IIe got into the train and sat down.





<pb n="94"/>94                  AUNT ANNE
"I am tired," he said; "you must excuse me for not
standing any longer."  He shivered as he opened the
window. "I dislike third-class," he added, "but I go by
it on principle; I am not rich enoughlto travel by any
other, Mrs. Baines"-and he looked at her, fixedly.
She was silent, she seemed fascinated; she looked at
him for a moment and winked absently; tlcn a thought
seemed to strike her, and she started.
"Wait!" she exclaimed; "I will return in a moment,"
and she hurried away.
In five minutes she calme back, breathless witl excite-
ment. "I liave taken a great liberty," she said, humbly,
"but you must forgive me. I have ventured to get you
this ticket; will you please me by changing into a first-
class carriage. You must imagine that you are my guest"
-and she looked at him anxiously. "The guard is wait-
ing-"
"I cannot refuse you anything, Mrs. Baines"-and, with
a clastened air, he pulled his portmanteau from under the
seat. The guard was waiting outside for it and took it to
an empty carriage.  Mr. Wimple followed, Aunt Anne
carrying the papers. he took his place and looked round,
satisfied. The guard touched his hat to the old lady and
went his way. Mrs. Baines gave a sigh of satisfaction.
"Now I shall feel content, and you will not be dis-
turbed," she added, triumphantly.  "I have spoken-"
She stopped, for his hlacking cough came back; she seemed
to shrink with pain as she heard it.
" I am quite an invalid," he said, impressively.
" I wisl I were going witl you to nurse you."
"I need nursing, Mrs. Baines," he answered, sadly. "I
need a great many things."
"I wisl I could give them to you."





<pb n="95"/>AUNT ANNE                   95
He looked at her curiously; as if the words oame from
him without his knowledge, he said, suddenly,
"I see Sir Willianm Iammage is a little better."
"I am going to inquire after him this morning," she
answered, and then she drew a little parcel from beneath
her shawl. "I want you to put this into your pocket,"
she said, "and to open it by and by; it is only a trifling
proof that I thought of you as I came along."
"I always think of you," he said, almost reproachfully,
as, without a word of thanks, he put the parcel out of
sight.
"Not more than I do of you," she said, in a low, chok-
ing voice. " I hear you cough in my sleep, and it grieves
me to think how hard you have to work."
"I can't take care of myself," he said. "I was always
careless, Mrs. Baines-and I must work. Fisher is a very
fidgety man to work for; it has taken me three days to
review a small book on American law, and even now I
am not sure that he will be satisfied."
His voice never varied, the expression of his eyes never
changed, save once for a moment. she had taken off ler
gloves and was resting her hands, thin and dry, on the
ledge of. the carriage window while she leaned forward to
talk to him, and, suddenly, he looked down at them. Tley
seemed to repel him, he drew back a very little. She
saw the movement and followed his eyes; she understood
perfectly, for she had quick insiglht, and courage to face
unflinchingly even truths that were not pleasant. She
drew her hands away and rubbed them softly, one over
the other, as if by doing so she could put young life into
them. Suddenly, with a jerk, the train moved.
"Good-by," she said, excitedly. "Good-by; if I write
to the address in town, will the letter be forwarded ?"





<pb n="96"/>96                  AUNT ANNE
But he could only nod. In a moment he was out of
siglt. he did not lean forward to look after her, he sat
staring into space. "Slhe must be seventy," he said. "I
wonder-"    Then he felt in his pocket for the third-class
ticket he no longer needed. "Probably they will return
the amount I paid for it." A sudden thought struck him.
lie looked at the ticket Mrs. Baines had given him. "It
is for Portsmouth," he said, grimly.  The one he had
taken himself had been for Liphook.





<pb n="97"/>CHAPTER VIII
IT was not at all a bad thing to do, Florence thought, as
slle sat and considered over the arrangement Mr. Fisher
had so suddenly made in regard to the house in town and
the cottage at Witley. The country would do the clil-
dren good, and Aunt Anne would probably enjoy it. Of
course the latter would consent to go with them. Indeed
slie had, clearly, no other resource. Florence wondered
if she would like it.
But Mrs. Baines was so full of news herself when she
returned that she lad no time to listen to any one else.
"My love," she said, "I have passed a most important
day."
"Relate your adventures, Aunt Anne."   But at this
request Mrs. Baines winked and spoke slowly.
"I had an engagement in the morning," she began, and
hesitated. " When I had fulfilled it," she went on, " I
thought it right, Florence, to go and call on Sir William
Itammage. he has been ill, and I wanted to assure him
of my sympathy. Besides, I felt that it was due to you-
tlat it was an imperative duty on my part-to ask him
for an allowance, and that it was his duty to give it to
rle."
"But, Aunt Anne-"
"Yes, nmy love. I am living now on your generous
kindness; don't think that I am insensible to it. But for
your tenderness, my darling, I should have been alone in
7





<pb n="98"/>98                  AUNT ANNE
a little lodging now, as I was wllen-when I was first left
a widow."
"I should not like to think of you in a little lodging,
Aunt Anne," Florence said, gently; and then she added,
gayly, " But continue your adventures."
Mrs. Baines gave a long sigh, and was silent for a mo-
ment. she sat down in the easy-chair, and, as if she had
not heard Florence's interruption, went on, witl a strange
tragic note in her voice,
"I never told you about that time, Florence. I had
three pounds in the world when I caine to London-just
three pounds to maintain my position until I could find
something to do. I had a little room at Kilburn--a little
room at the top of the house; and I used to sit day after
day, week after week, waiting. I had no coals, only a lit-
tle spirit-lamp by whlich I made some water hot, then
poured it into a jug and covered it over and warmed
my hands by it; it was often an hour before it grew cold,
my love."
"But wlhy did you not come to us?"
"I couldn't," the old lady answered, in an obstinate
tone. "I felt that it would not be treating you proper-
ly to present myself before you while I was so poor and
miserable."  She paused and looked into the fire for a
moment, then suddenly went on, "Tle woman at tlhe
corner lwhere I went every morning to buy a newspaper
saw that I was poor, and presumed upon it. Once she
said I looked nipped up, and asked me to sit down and
get warm. I reproved her for her familiarity, and never
went to the shop again."
"But perlaps she meant it for kindness ?'
"She should have rememnbered her position, my love,
and asked me in a different manner. There is nothing





<pb n="99"/>AUNT ANNE                  99
more painful to lear than the remembrance of One's own
rank in life when one has to encounter thc hardslips tlat
belong by right to a lower class."  Aunt Anne paused
again for a moment, and gave a long sigh before she went
on, "We won't go over it, my dear. If Mrs. North had
shown less levity in her conduct and more consideration
to me, I should have been there still instead of living on
your charity."
"0O  no, Aunt Anne."
"Yes, my love, it is so; even though you love me and
I love you, it is charity; and I felt it keenly when you re-
sented my little offering of cream this morning-you, to
whom I would give everything I possess."
" Oh no, Aunt Anne-" interrupted Florence.
"And so-and so," continued the old lady, wvith a little
gasp, "I went to Sir William Rnamnage once more. I
told him-I told him"-slhe stopped-"I told him how
our mothers had stood over us together, years and years
ago."
"Yes, I know," Florence said, soothingly-she had
heard this so often before. "I liope he was good to
you ?"
"My dear, he listened with compunction, but he saw
the force of what I said. he will write and tell me how
much he will allow me," she added, simply.
"I am very glad, Aunt Anne. I lope he will write
soon, and be generous. I know it will make you hap-
pier."
"It will, indeed," and Mrs. Baines gave another long
sighl. "I slall not be dependent on any one much longer."
"Except upon him," Florence said, unwittingly.
"No, I shall not feel that I am dependent even npon
him," and she looked up quickly. "IIe will give it and





<pb n="100"/>100                 AUNT ANNE
I shall take it for the honor of the family. I told him ihow
impossible it was that I could go on living upon yolo and
Walter, that it would be a disgrace.  I could not live
upon him either. he has shown me so little sympathy,
my love, that I could not endure it. I sllall take the al-
lowance from him as I should take an inheritance, know-
ing tlhat it is not given to me for my own sake. I could
not take it in any other spirit; but it would be as wrong
in him to forget what is due to us, as it would be in me
to let him do so. It would slled dishonor on his name.
And again she was silent; shei seemed to be living
over the past, to be groping her way back among days tlat
were over before Florence was even born, to be seeing peo-
ple whose very names had not been heard for years.
"Tlhey would rise in their graves if I were left to
starve," she continued; "I have always felt it; and it
was but right towards them that I slould go to William.
It was due to them even tllat I should live on you and
Walter, my darling, till I received an adequate income."
Suddenly her voice changed again; thle wonderful smile
came back-tile happy look that always seemed as if it
lad travelled from tlhe youth she had left long years be-
hind.
" You understand, my love ?" she asked. " Bless you
for all your kindness, but I am not going to intrude upon
you much longer. I have already seen an apartment that
will, I think, suit my requirements."
"01, no."
"Yes, my love, it will be much better. You cut me to
the quick this morning, Florence," and her voice grew
sad; "you said tlhat you would have to send away your
dear children because my influence would spoil them."
"Aunt Anne!" Florence began, in consternation.





<pb n="101"/>AUNT ANNE                  101
"Yes, dear; yes," the old'lady said, solemnly. " It gave
me the deepest pain, as I sat and thought it over in the
privacy of my own chamber. But when I came down-
stairs and you shared your dear nother's gift with me, I
knew that you loved me sincerely."
"I do," said Florence, soothingly.
"I am sure of it, my darling," with even more solemnity,
"but it will be better that I should take an apartment. It
will rejoice your tender heart to know that by your gift
you have helped me to secure one, and when I receive my
allowance from Sir William I sliall feel that I am inde-
pendent once more. You must forgive me, my love; it
is not that I do not appreciate your hospitality-yours
and Walter's-I do. But I feel that it would sadden all
my dear ones who are gone, if they knew that I was alone
in the world, without a home of my own. that is why I
went to Sir William Rammage, Florence; and, though lie
said little, I feel sure that he saw the matter in a proper
light, and felt as I do about it."
"What did he say I"
" Ie said he would think it over, and when he had made
up his mind he would write to me. My love, would you
permit me to ring the bell?"
"Yes, of course. Why do you always ask me? Don't
you feel at home here, dear Aunt Anne ?" Florence asked,
thinking that Sir William's answer had, after all, commit-
ted him to little.
"I hope I shall never so far forget myself as not to treat
you witl the courtesy that you have a right to expect, my
darling. I will never take advantage of our relationship-
Jane," she said, witl quite another manner, and in a cold
and slightly lhaughty tone, to the servant who had entered,
" would you have the goodness to divest me of my cloak 





<pb n="102"/>102                 AUNT ANNE
-and if your mistress gives you permission, perlaps you
would carlry it up to my room '
"Yes, ma'am," said Jane, respectfully, but without much
willingness in her manner. (Tlhe servants had learned to re-
sent the tone in which Mrs. IBaines usually spoke to them.
" she treats us like dirt," the housemaid explained to the
cook; "and if we're made of dirt, I should like to know
what she's made of ? She give me a shilling the other day,
and another time a new apron done up in a box from the
draper's; but I don't care about her for all her presents.
I know she always sees every speck of dust that others
would be blind to; it's in her wink that she does.")
" And now, Aunt Anne, that you have told me all your
news, I want you to listen to mine," Florence said.
Then she gave an account of Mr. Fisher's visit, and of
the letting of the house for a couple of months.
" So, Aunt Anne," she continued, triumphantly, " I want
you to be very, very good, and to go witl the children and
two of the servants to the cottage at Witley to-morrow, and
to be the mistress of the great establishment, if you will,
and mother to the children till I come; that proves how
bad I think your influence is for them, doesn't it, you
unkind old dear" --and she stooped and kissed Mrs.
Baines.
Aunt Anne was deliglhted, and consented at once.
"I shall never forget your putting this confidence in
me. You have proved your affection for me most truly,"
she said. "MLy dear Florence, your children sllall have
the most loving care that it is in my power to give them.
I will look after everything till you come, more zealously
than you yourself could. Tell me, love, whlere do you say
the cottage is situated ?'
"It is near Witley; it is on the direct Portsmouth road





<pb n="103"/>AUNT ANNE                  103
-a sweet little cottage with a garden, and fir woods
stretching on either side."
"And how far is it from Portsmouth, my love ?" Mrs.
Baines asked, eagerly.
Florence divined the meaning of the question instantly.
"Oh, I don't know, Aunt Anne; after Witley comes
IIindhead, and tlln Liplhook, and then Petersfield, and
then-then I don't know. Liphook is the place where
Mr. Wimple "-the old lady winked to herself-"has
friends and sometimes goes to stay."
"And how far is that ?"
"About six miles, I think-six or seven." 
" Thank you, my love; and now, if you will allow me,
I will retire. I must make preparations for my journey,
which is, indeed, a delightful anticipation."
Florence never forgot the late September morning on
which she took Aunt Anne and the children to Witley.
They went from Waterloo Station. She thought of Wal-
ter and the day they had spent at Windsor, and of that
last one on which they had gone togetler to Southamp-
ton, and she had returned alone. "Oh, my darling," she
said to herself, " may you grow well and strong, and come
back to us soon again."
Mrs. Baines, too, seemed full of memories. She looked
up and down the platform; she stood for a moment,
dreamily, by the book-stall before it occurred to her to
buy a cheap illustrated paper to amuse Catty and Monty
on the journey.
"My love," she said to Florence, with a little sigh, "a
railway station is fraught with many recollections of meet-
ing and parting-"
"And meeting again," said Florence, longingly think-
ing of Walter.





<pb n="104"/>104                  AUNT ANNE
" Yes, my love," the old lady answered, tenderly, " and
may yours with your dear one be soon."
There were three miles to drive frolm Witley to the
cottage. A long white road, with fir woods on either side;
gaps in the firs, and glimpses of thle Surrey hills, distant
and blue, of hanging woods and deep valleys. The firs
came to an end, and tllere were cliffs of gravel full of tile
holes of sand-martins. More woods, then liedges of black-
berry-bushes, bare enough now; gorse full of late bloom;
heather faded and turning from russet to black. Iere
and there a solitary house; masses of oak and larch and
fir; patches of sunshine; long wastes of slladc, and tile
road going on and on.
"IIere we are at last," Florence said, as they stopped
before a red-brick cottage that stood only a few yards
back from the road. On either side of it was a fir plan-
tation. Tllere was a gravel pathllay round the house, but
the other patlls were covered with tan. Behind stretcled
a wilderness of garden almost entirely uncultivated.
There was a little footway that wound through it in and
out among beeches and larches and firs and oaks, and
stopped at last on the ridge of a dip that could hardly be
called a valley.
" Sometimes," said Florence, as they walked about, half
an hour later, while the servants were busy witllin, " we
go down the dip and tip the other side, and so get over to
HIindhead. It is nearer than going tlhere by the road."
"Our house is over there," the children said.
" Their house," explained Florence, " is a little, lonely,
thatched shed, half a mile away. We don't know wlho
made it. It is in a lovely part on the otlier side of the
dip, among the straggling trees. Perhaps some one
tethered a cow in it once. The children call it their





<pb n="105"/>AUNT ANNE                   105
house now, because one day they had tea there. After I
return next week, we must try and walk across to it."
But the old lady's eyes were turned towards the dis-
tance.
"And the road in front of the house," she asked,
"where does that go to?"
"It winds round the Devil's Punch Bowl, and over
IIindhead, and on, through Liphook and Petersfield, to
Portsmouth."
Aunt Anne did not answer; she looked still more in-
tently into the distance, and gave a long sigh.
"It is most exhilarating to be out of London again, my
dear Florence," she said. "I sincerely trust it will prove
beneficial to your dear ones. I was born in the country,
and I hope that, some day, I shall die in it. London is
most oppressive after a time.
"I like London," Florence answered; "still, it does
now and then feel like a prison."
"And the rows and rows of houses are the prison bars,
my love. May we enter the cottage?" she asked, sud-
denly. she was evidently tired; she stooped, and looked
older and more worn than usual.
"Poor old dear!" Florence thought. "I hope slc is
not worrying about Madame Celcstine's bill, and that she
will soon ]hear from Sir William Ranmmage. then she
will be happier."
It was a little house, simple inside as well as out, with
tiny rooms, plainly furnished. Tlie dining-roonm had been
new\ly d(one up, with cretonne curtains and a dado, and
a bnttrcy-hatch, in whlich Florence took a certain pride as
solnetlling rather grand for so small a place. Tlie draw-
ing-room was old-faslioned-a stiff, roomy sofa, witl lhard,
flat cushions, at one end; at the other a sweet jangling





<pb n="106"/>106                  AUNT ANNE
piano. There were corner cupboards with china bowls
of pot-ponrri on themn; on either side of the fireplace a
gaunt, high-backed easy-chair, and on the left of each
chair an old-fashioned screen on which was worked a pea-
cock. Aunt Anne stopped on the threshold.
It seemed to Florence as if the room recognized the
old lady-as if it had been waiting, knowing that slle
would come. There was something about it that said,
more plainly than any words could have said, that the
hands were still that had first arranged it, and many foot-
steps had gone out froml its doorway that would never
come in at it more.
"It always depresses me," Florence explained; "Lbut
it is just as we found it. We refurnished the diining-
room, and sit tlere a good deal. It is more cheerful tlan
this. Come up-stairs"-and she led the way.
The bedrooms were all small, too, save one in front, tlat
seemed to match the drawing-room. It looked like a
room to die in-a quaint, four-post bedstead with dark
chintz curtains, a worm-caten bureau, a sampler worked
in Berlin wool and framed in black cherry-wood hanging
over the fireplace.
"This is the best room," Florence said, "and we keep
it for visitors. There is a little one, meant to be a dress-
ing-room, I suppose, leading out of it"-and she went to
a bright little nook with a bed in it. "I always feel that
the best bedroom and the drawing-room belong to a past
world, and the rest of the house to the present one."
"It is like your life and mine, my darling--mine to
the past and yours to the present."
"I think you ought to sleep in the best room, Aunt
Anne."
"No, my love," the old lady interrupted, "let me have

this little one whllich is next it. When you require the
other, if I ani still with you, I can lock the door between.
The best one is too grand for nme; but sometimes while it
is empty I will go il, if you have no objection, and look
out at the fir-trees and the road that stretches riglit and
left-"
"I like doing that," Florence interrupted. "It always
sets me thinking-thl road from the city to the sea."
"From the city to tlhe sea," tlle old lady repeated,
" from the voices to the silences."
"Aunt Anne, we mustn't grow sentimental-" Florence
began. There was the sound of a tinkling bell. It
seemed to come at an opportune moment. " 01, happy
sound !" she laughed; "it means that our meal is ready.
Catty, darling," she called, " Monty, my son, roast chicken
is waiting down-stairs. Auntie and mummy are quite
ready; come, dear babes "-and patter, patter, calne the
sound of the little feet, and together they all went
down.
An hour later the fly came to the door; it was time for
Florence to start on her way back to town.
" I shall be witl you at latest on Tuesday. Perhaps,
dear Aunt Anne, if you don't mind taking care of the
had children so long, I may go on Saturday for a day or
two to an old school-fellow," she said. "Then I should
not be here till the middle of next week."
"Dear child, you do, indeed, put confidence in me,"
Mrs. Baines answered, quaintly.
"And, Aunt Anne, I have ordered most things in, but
the tradespeople come every day, if there is anything
more you want, and here is some money. Four pounds,
I think, will carry you tll'ouglh; and here is a little book
in which to put down your expenses. I always keep a

most careful account-you don't mind doing so eitler, do
you ?"
" My love, anything you wish will be a pleasure to me."
"If you please, ma'am," said Jane, entering, " the
driver says you must start at once if you want to catcl
this train."
"Then good - by, dear Aunt Anne; good - by, dear
dickie-birds; be happy together. You shall see me very
soon again; send me a letter every other day "-and with
many embraces Florence was allowed to get out of the
door. But Aunt Anne and the children ran, excitedly,
after her to the gate, and helped her into the little wag-
onette, and kissed their hands and waved their handker-
chiefs as she drove off, and called "Good-by, good-by"
-and so, watcling them, Florence went along the wllite
road towards the station.





<pb n="109"/>CHAPTER IX
TIE days that followed were busy ones for Florence-
busy in a domestic sense, so that the history of them does
not concern us here. Mr. Fisher called one afternoon; by
a strange coincidence it was vwlle Ethel Dunlop was help-
ing Florence with an inventory of china. Miss Dunlop
readily promised to visit his mother, but she did not show
any particular interest in the editor.
"lie has been so kind," Florence said; "and don't you
think he is very agreeable ?"
"Oh1 yes; but you know, Florrie dear, he has a very
square face."
"Well?"
"It is a good thing he never married, he would have
been very obstinate."
"But why do yon say never did ?-as if he never would.
lie is only forty-odd."
"Only forty-odd !" laughed Ethel; "only a million.
If a man is over eight-and-twenty he might as well be
over eighty, it is Inere modesty that he is not."
"Walter is over thirty, and just as fascinating as ever."
Florence was rather indignant.
"Ali, yes, but he is married, and married men take
such a long time to grow old. By the way, Mr. Fisher
said something about a theatre-party, lwhen his mother is
here. Do you tlink I miglit ask him to invite George
Dighton as well? George is very fond of theatres."





<pb n="110"/>110                 AUNT ANNE
Before Florence could reply a carriage stopped at the
door; it looked familiar, it reminlded her of Aunt Anne
in her triumphant days. But a strange lady descended
from it now, and was shown up-stairs to the drawing-
room, in which Aunt Annie had sat and related her woes
and known her triumphs.
" Mrs. North, ma'am," said the servant, and then Flor-
ence understood.
She left Ethel in the dining-room with the inventory,
and went np to receive the visitor. Mrs. North was as
pretty as Aunt Anne had declared her to be-a mere girl
to look at, tall and slim. Florence thought it was quite
natural that her husband should like her to have a chap-
eron.
" I came to see Mrs. Baines," slhe said, coming forward
in a shy, hesitating manner, "but hearing that she was
in the country, I ventured to ask for you. What have
you done witl the dear old lady ?"  Florence looked at
her, fascinated by her beauty, by her clothes, that seemed
to be a mixture of fur and lace and perfume, by the soft
brown hair that curled low on her forehead, by the sweet
blue eyes-by every bit of her. "You know, probably,
tlhat she was very angry when she left me? I thought,
by this time, that she would, perhaps, forgive me and
make it up; so I came."  She said it with a penitent air.
"I am afraid she is very angry," Florence answered,
half laughing, for the pretty woman before her did not
seem like a stranger. "Do you want her again ?"
"Oh no!"-and Mrz. North shook her head, enphati-
cally. " No, indeed, that would be impossible ; sli led us
a terrible life. But we loved her. I think we could have
put up with anything if she had not quarrelled witl the
servants."





<pb n="111"/>AUNT ANNE                   111
"I was afraid it was that."
"01  yes," sighed Mrs. North, "she was horribly auto-
cratic with them-' autocratic' is her own word. At last
she quarrelled witl eIctty and wanted me to send lier
away-to send away Iletty, who is a born treasure, and
cooks like an angel. It would have broken our hearts;
we couldn't let her go, it was impossible, so the old lady
fled. Besides she did not approve of Ime-"
"I am very sorry. You were so very kind to her, slle
always said that."
"I loved her," Mrs. North answered, with a little sigh;
"she was so like iny dear dead mother grown old-that
was the secret of her attraction for us; but she ruled us
with a rod of iron that grew more and more unyielding
every day; and yet she was very kind. she was always
giving us presents."
"Oh yes," said Florence, in a despairing voice.
"We have had the bills for them since," Mrs. North
went on, with a comical air. " she used to say that I was
very frivolous," slhe added, suddenly. "She thought it
wicked of me to enjoy life while my husband was away.
But lie's fifty-five, Mrs. IIibbert; one may have an affec-
tion for a husband of fifty-five, but one can't be in love
with him."
"If she were very nice she would not have made tlat
remark to me, whom she never saw before," Florence
thoulght, beginning to dislike her a little.
"Of course I am sorry he is away," Mrs. North said, as
if she perfectly understood the impression she was imaking.
"But I shall not be glad when he returns. he is cominig
almost immediately-" she gave a little gasp as she said it.
" I don't know w]hy; it is much sooner than I had expected.
I took Mrs. Baines because he wished me to have an old





<pb n="112"/>112                 AUNT ANNE
lady about me; but I wanted my own way. I liked her to
have hers when it amused me to sec her have it; when it
didn't I wanted to lave mine."  And Mrs. North looked
up witl two blue eyes that fascinated and repelled, and
laughed a merry, uncontrolled laugh like a child's. "11h,
she was very droll."
"Perhaps it is very rude of me to say it," Florence said,
primly, for deep in her heart there was a great deal of
primness, "but I can understand Mr. North wishing you
to have a chaperon; you are very young to be left alone."
"Oh yes, and very careless, I know that. And Mrs.
Baines used to provoke menc into shocking her. I could
shock her so easily, and did-don't you know how one
loves power for good or ill over a human being?"
"No, I don't," Florence answered, a little stiffly.
"I do, I love it best of all things in thle world, whether
it leads me up-hill or down-lill. But I am intruding,"
for she saw a set, cold look coming over Florence's face.
"Let nc tell you whly I asked for you. I have been so
embarrassed about Mrs. Baines.  She gave us presents,
and she bought all sorts of tlings-but she didn't pay for
them. These bills came, and the people wanted their
money." She pulled a little roll out of her pocket. "She
probably forgot them, and I thought it would be better to
pay them, especially as I owed her some money when she
left which she would not take;" and she laughedl out
again, but this time there was an odd sound in her voice.
"Tlhey are from florists and all sorts of people."
Florence looked over the bills, quickly and almost guiltily.
There were the pots of fern and the flowers that had been
sent to her and the children after Aunt Anne's first visit;
and there were thle roses with whicl she lhad triumphantly
entered on the night of the dinner-party. "Oil, poor old
lady !" she exclaimed, sadly.





<pb n="113"/>AUNT ANNE                    113
"They are paid," Mrs. North said. " Don't be distressed
about them ; and miany otlers --lace-landkerchief, shoes,
all sorts of things. Don't tell ler. She would think I lad
taken a liberty or conmmitted a solecism"-and she made
a little wry face. " But what I really wanted to see you
about, Mrs. Ilibbert, was Madame Celestine's bill. I am
afraid I can't pay that all by myself; it is too long. Ma-
dame Celestine, of course, is sweetly miserable, for site
thinks the old lady has vanished into space. she came to
me yesterday. It seems tllat she went to you a few days
ago, but you were out; and site was glad of it when she dis-
covered that Mrs. Baines was your aunt, for site doesn't
want to offend you. she came to me again to-day. She
is very miserable. I believe it will turn her hair gray. Ol,
it is too funny !"
" I don't think it is at all funny."
"But indeed it is, for I don't believe Mrs. Baines will
ever be able to pay the fifteen pounds; in fact, we know
that site won't. Probably it is worrying her a good deal.
I have been wondering whether something could not be
done; if you and I, for instance, were to pay it between
us."
" You are very good, Mrs. North," Florence said, against
her will.
" Oh no; but I am sorry for her, and it vexes and worries
me to think of her being annoyed. I want to get rid of
that vexation, and will pay soniething to do so. That is
what most generosity comes to," Mrs. North went on, with
mock cynicism-" tlle purchase of a pleasant feeling for
one's self, or the getting rid of an unpleasant one. There
is little really unselfish goodness in the world, and wlen
one meets it, as a rule, it isn't charming, it isn't fascinating
-one feels that one would rather be without it." She rose
8





<pb n="114"/>114                 AUNT ANNE
as she spoke. "Well," she asked, " what shall we do?
I'll pay one half of the old lady's bill if you will pay the
other half."
"You are very goodl," Florecl(e relpea:ted, wonderingle.
"No; but I expect yon are"'-and Mrs. North showed
two rows of little white teeth. "1 shoulld think you are a
model of virtue," she added, with an almost childlike air
of frankness, which made it impossible to take offence at
her words, though Florence felt that at best she was only
regarded as the possessor of a quality that, just before, ller
visitor had denounced.
" Why," she asked, smiling against her will, " do I look
like a model of virtue?"
"Oh yes, yon are almost Madonna-like; my hulsband
would entirely approve of you. I have a dim notion that
lie is hurrying lhome because he does not approve of me,"
Mrs. North said, witl a sigh. "I wish I were like you,
only-only I think I should get very tired of myself. I
get tired now, but a reaction comes. But a reaction to
the purely good must be tame at best."
"You are very clever," Florence said, almost witlout
knowing it, and shrinking frolm her again.
"IHow do you know ?  My husband says I am clever,
but I don't think I am. I am alive. So many people are
merely in the preface to being alive, and never get any
further. I am well in the middle of the book; and I am
eager, so eager that sometimes I long to eat up the whole
world, so that I may know the taste of everything. Do
you understand that ?"
"No. I am content witl my slice."
" Ah, that is it. I am not content witl mine. You
have your liusband and your children."
" But you have a  husband."





<pb n="115"/>AUNT ANNE                  115
"Yes, I liavc a husband, too-a funny old husband, who
cares as little for me as I do for him, I think"-Florence
hated her-"and no children. I amused myself with the
old lady-Mrs. Baines-till she fled from me. Now I try
other things. Good-by."
" Good-by," Florence said.
As Mrs. North was going out of the door she turned
and asked, "IHave you mlany friends-women friends?"
"Yes, a great many, thank you," Mrs. Hibbert said,
with a little haughty inclination of the head. The haughti-
ness seemed to amuse I-rs. North, for the merry look came
over lher face again, but only for a moment.
"I thought you had," she answered. "I liave none; I
don't want them. Good-by."
It was nearly dark, and the one servant left to help Flor-
ence get the house ready had neglected to light tlhe gas on
the staircase. Mrs. North groped her way down.
"I want to tell you something," she said. " You said
just now that I was clever. I don't think I am, but I can
divine people's thoughts pretty easily. You are very good,
I think; but consider this-your goodness is of no use if
you are not good to others; good to women, especially.
The good of goodness is that you can wrap others inside
it. It ought to be like a big cloak that you have on a cold
night, while the shivering person next to you has none.
If you don't make use of your goodness," she went on wiith
a catch in her breath, " what is the good of it ?-I seem to
be talking paradoxes; you prove how beautiful it is, per-
haps, but that is all; you make it like the swan that sings
its own death-song. One listens and watches, and goes
away to think of things more comprehensible, and to do
them. Good-by, Mrs. Hibbcrt," she said, gently-and, al-
most as if she were afraid, she held out her hand. Florence





<pb n="116"/>116                  AUNT ANNE
took it, a little wonder-struck. "You are like a Madonna,
very like one, as I said just now ; but, though you arc older
than I am, I think I know more about sonic things than you
do-good and bad. Madonnas never know the world very
well. Give my love to the old lady, and say I liope slie
has forgiven me. Tell her my husband has suddenly sent a
very disagreeable telegram to say he will be home this week.
It will please her. She will think he will keep me in order.
Tell her I was dismayed when I had it-that will shock
her. I like to shock her"-and with a last little laugh she
went out-into the darkness, it seemed to Florence.
But the next minute there were two flashing lamps be-
fore the house; tlere was the banging of a door, and Mrs.
North was driven away.
Florence went slowly back to the dining-room and the
inventory. Ethel Dunlop had gone. she was glad of it,
for she wanted to think over her strange visitor.
"I don't understand her," she said to herself. "Slhe is
unlike any one I ever met; she fascinated and repelled
me. I felt as if I wanted to kiss her, and yet the touch of
her hand made me shiver." Then sie thought of Madame
Celestine's bill, and of Aunt Anne, and wished that the
dress lad not been bought, especially for the dinner-party;
it made her feel as if she bad been the unwitting cause of
Mrs. Baines's extravagance. She looked into the fire, and
remembered the events of that wonderful evening, and
tlouglht of Walter away, and the bills at lhome that would
have to be paid at Christmas. And she tlouglit of her
winter cloak, that was three years old and shabby, and of
the things she had longed to buy for tlhe children. Above
all she tlougllt of the visions she had had of saving little
by little, and putting her savings away in a very safe place,
until she had a cosey sum with which some day to give Wal-
ter a pleasant surprise, and suggest that they should go off





<pb n="117"/>AUNT ANNE                     117
together for "a little spree," as he would call it, to Paris
or Switzerland. Tlhe fire burned low; the red coals grew
dull; tlhe light froil the street-lamp outside seemed to come
searching into the room, as tlougli it were looking for some
one whlo was not there. She thought of Walter's letter, safe
in her pocket. IIe himself was probably at Malta by this
time-getting stronger and stronger in the sunshine. Dear
Walter, how generous he was; lie, too, was a little bit reck-
less sometimes.   She wondered if he inherited this last
quality from Aunt Annc. She thought of her children at
Witley having tea, most likely with cakes and jam in abun-
dance; and of Aunt Anne in her glory.   She wondered if
Mr. Wimple had turned up.      "Poor Aunt Anlne!" she
sighed, and there was a long bill ill her mind.  Presently
she rose lighited a candle, drew down the blild--sliuttiln
out tilhe glare from the street-lanmp-and going slowly to tile
davenport in tlie corner, unlocked it, opened a little secret
drawer, and looked in. There were   three five-pound notes
there-the remainder of her mother's gift. "I wonder if
Mrs. North ha     ad ame Celestine's bill," she tlouglt.
" But it doesn't matter; she said it was fifteen pounds. I
can send her the amount."
A couple of hours later, while she was in the very act
of putting a check into an envelope, a note arrived. It
had been left by hand. It was scented with violets, and
ran thus:
"DEAR MRs. IInnErtT,-I have ventured to pay Madame Celestinc.
I determined to do so whlile I was with you just now, but was afraid
to tell yo3u; that was why I clhanged the conversation so abruptly.
Please don't let the old lady know that it is my doing, for she might
be angry; but she was very good to me, and I am glad to do this for
her. Forgive all the strange things I s.iid this afternoon, and don't
trouble to acknowledge this.    " Yours sincerely,
"E. N'ORTII."
"P.S.--I enclose receipt."





<pb n="118"/>ClIAPTER X
IT was not till Tuesday afternoon in the week following
tlhat Florence got back to Witley.
Mrs. Burnett was at the station, sitting in a little gov-
erness-cart drawn by a donkey.
"I am waiting for my husband," she explainecd; "lie
generally comes by this train, and I drive him Ihoime, don-
key permitting. It is a dear little donkey, and we are so
fond of him."
"A dear little cart, too," Florence answered, as sihe
stood by its side, talking. "I have been hoping tihat you
would come and see me, Mrs. Burnett; we are going to
be here for six or seven weeks."
" I know ; Mr. Fisher told me," Mrs. Burnett replied, in
her sweet and rather intense voice, "and we are so sorry
tihat your visit takes place just while we are away. I amn
going to Devonshire to-morrow morning to stay witlh my
mother while my husband goes to Scotland. I am1 so-o
sorry"-she had a way of drawing out her words, as if to
give them emphasis. Florence liked to look at Mrs.
Burnett's eyes whil e she spoke; they always seemed to at-
test that every word she said expressed tlhe absolute mean-
ing and intention in her mind. IHer listeners gained a
sense of restfulness which comes from being in the pres-
ence of a real person from whom they might take bitter
or sweet, certain of its reality. "I hoped from Mr. Fish-
er's note that you had arrived before, and ventured to call
on Satiurdaiv.





<pb n="119"/>AUNT ANNE                   119
"Did you see Mrs. Baincs ?"
"Only for a imoment. What a charming old lady!-
sucll old-fashioned courtesy. It was like being sent back
fifty years to listen to her. She wanted'ine to stay, but I
refused, for she was just setting off for a drive with your
children and her nephew."
"Setting off for a drive ?" Florence repeated.
"Yes, she had Steggall's wagonette from  the Blue
Lion, and was going to Guildford shopping. She said
she meant to buy some surprises for you."
"Oh," said Florence, meekly, and her heart sank. "Did
you say that she lad a nephew with her ?"
" Well, I supposed it was a nephew, unless she has a son
-a tall, fair young man, who looks delicate, and walks as
if his legs were not very strong."
"Oh yes, I know," Florence answered, as she signed to
the fly slhe had engaged to come nearer to the donkey-
cart, so that slhe might not waste a minute. "IIe is a
friend; he is no relation. Good-by, hMrs. Burnett; I am
sorry you are going away. I suppose you are waiting
for the fast train, as Mr. Burnett did not come by this
one "
"Yes, it is due in twenty minutes. Good-by; so sorry
not to have been at home during your visit. Oh, Mrs.
Ilibbert, do you think your children would like to ]ave
tile use of this cart while we are away ? the donkey is
so gentle and so good."
"It is too kind of you to think of it-" Florence be-
gan, beaming; for she thought of how Catty and M1onty
would shout for joy at having a donkey-cart to potter
about in; and in her secret soul, though she felt it would
not do to bletray it, she was nearly as much pleased as they
would be. Florence often lad an inward struggle for tile





<pb n="120"/>120                 AUNT ANNE
dignity Aith which she felt her matronly position should
be supported.
"It will be such a pleasure to lend it tllem. It's a
dear little donkey-so good and gentle. It doesn't go
well," Mrs. Burnett added, in an apologetic tone; "but
it's a dear little donkey, and does everything else well."
And over tlis remark Florence pondered much as she
drove to the cottage.
As she cauglt sight of the lhouse she wondered if slhe
had been absent more than half an hour, or at all. She
had left it in the afternoon more than a week ago, and
the children hlad stood out in the roadway, dancing and
waving their handkerchiefs till she was out of sight. As
she came back, there they stood, dancing and waving their
handkerchiefs again. They shouted for joy as she got
out of the fly.
"Welcome, my darling, welcome," Aunt Anne, wllo
was behind them, exclaimed. "Tlhese dear children and
I have been watching more than an hour for you. Enter
your house, my love. It is indeed a privilege to be here
to receive you."
"It is a privilege to come back to so warm a wel-
conme," Florence said, whenr, having embraced elr chil-
dren and Aunt Anne, she was allowed to enter the cot-
tage; "and hlow comfortable and nice it looks!" she
exclaimed, as she stopped at the dining-room doorway.
Tleire was a wood-fire blazing, and thle tea set out,
and the water in the silver kettle singing, and hot cakes
in a covered disli in the fender.  Flowers set off tile
table, and in the pots about the room were boughs of
autumn leaves. It all looked cosey and inviting, and wore
a festival air-festival that, Florence knew, had been
made for her. she turned and kissed the old lady, grate-





<pb n="121"/>AUNT ANNE                    121
fully. " Dear Aunt Anne !" she said, and that was thanks
enonglh.
"I thought, my love, that you would like to partake of
a substantial tea with your dear children on your return.
Your later evening meal I lIave arranged to be a very
slender one."
"But you are too good, Aunt Anne."
"It is you who have been too good to me," the old lady
answered, tenderly. " And now, my darling, let me take
you up to your chamber; it is ready for your reception."
There was a triumphant note in her voice that prepared
Florence for the fire in her grate and the bouquet on the
dressing-table, and all the little arrangemnents that Mrs.
Baines had devisep to add to her comfort. It was very
cheery, she thought; Aunt Anne had a knack of making
one enjoy a home-coming. She pulled out Walter's letter
and sat for a few moments alone over the bedroom fire, and
read it, and kissed it, and put it back into her pocket.
Then she looked round the cosey room again, and noticed
a little packet on the corner of the drawers. Aunt Anne
must have placed it there when slhe went out of the room.
On it was written, For my darling Florence. " Oh," she
said, "it's another present "-and, regretfnllv, her fingers
undid the string. Inside the whlite paper was a little pii-
cushion, covered witl blue velvet, and having round it a
rim of silver filigree work. Attachcd to it was a little
note, which ran thus:
"MY DAILLING,-Accept this little token of my love and gratitude.
1 feel that there is no way in which I can better prove how much I
appreciated your generous gift to me than by spending a portion of it
on a token of my affection to you. I trust you will honor my little
gift with your acceptance."
" Oh1," said Florence :again, in despair, " I wonder if shte





<pb n="122"/>122                  AUNT ANNE
has once thought of Madame Celestine's bill or the others.
What is the good of giving her money if one gets it back
in the shape of presents ?"
But she could not bear to treat the old lady's generos-
ity with coldness. So Aunt Anic was tlianked and the
cushion admired, and a happy little party gathered round
the tea-table.
"And have you had any visitors except Mrs. Burnett ?"
Florence asked, artfully, when the meal was over.
"We have had Mr. Wiimple," Aunt Anne said; "lie is
far from well, my love, and is trying to recruit at Lip-
hook."
" Oh yes, he lhas friends there."
"No, my love, not now. he is at present lodging with
an old retainer."
"And have you been to see him ?'
"No, dear Florence. IIe preferred that I should not
do so."
"We took him lots of rides," said Monty.
"And Aunt Anne gave hin a present," said Catty;
" and he put it into his pocket and never looked at it.
lie didn't know whlat was inside the paper-- we did,
didn't we, auntie ?"
"MIy dear children," Mrs. Baines said, "if your mother
will give you permission you had better go to the nursery.
It is past your hour for bed, my dear ones."
Tlhe children looked a little dismayed, but they never
dreamed of disobeying.
"Was it wrong to say you gave him a presenlt?" asked
Catty, witl the odd perception of childhood, as she put
up her face to be kissed.
My dears," answered Aunt Anne, sweetly, " in myl day
children did not talk with their elders unless they were
inv1ited to do so."





<pb n="123"/>AUNT ANNE                   123
"We didn't know," said Catty, ruefully.
"No, my darlings, I know that. Bless you !" continued
the old lady, sweetly; "and good-night, my dear ones.
Under your pillows you will eacli find a clocolate wlicl
auntie p)laced there for you this morning."
"And did you enjoy the drives ?" Florence asked, when
tle children had gone.
" Yes, my dear, thank vou."  Mrs. Baines was silent
for a moment. Then she raised her lhead, and, as if slie
had gathered courage, went on, in a slightly louder tone,
"I thought it would do your children good, Florence, to
see the country, and therefore I ventured to take them
sonie drives. Occasionally Mr. Wimple was so kind as to
accompany us."
" And I llope they (lid himn good, too," Florence said,
trying not to betray her amusement.
"Yes, my love, I trust they did."
Then Florence remembered the bills paid by Mrs.
Northl. They were all in a scaled envelope in her
pocket, but she could not gather the courage to deliver
it. She wanted to ask after Sir William Iamlmagc, too,
to know whether he had written yet and settled the ques-
tion of an allowance; but for tlat, also, her courage failed
-the old lady always resented questions. Then she re-
nembered Mr. Fisher's remark about Alfred Wimple's
writing, and thought it would please Aunt Anne to hear
of it.
" Mr. Fisher says that Mr. Wimplel writes very well;
lie has been doing somne reviewing for the paper."
Mrs. Baines winked with satisfaction.
"I am qnite sure hie writes well, 1my love," she an-
swered, quickly; "lie is a miost accomnplislhed man."
"And is tlere no more newvs to relate. Atnlt Anne" 
Florence asked; "'i o more doings dllrirneg Imy absellme ?"





<pb n="124"/>124                 AUNT ANNE
"No, my love, I think not."
"Then I have some news for you. I hole it won't
vex you, for I know you were very angry with her. AMrs.
North has been to sec nc. She really came to see you;
but wlen site found you hlad gone out of town, she asked
for nmc."
Mrs. Baincs looked almost alarmed, and very angry.
"It was most presumptuous of her !" she exclaimed.
"But wly, Aunt Anne?" Florence asked, astonished.
She had no riglht; she had not my permission."
"But, dear Aunt Anne, she came to see yon-and why
.should it be presumptuous ?"
"I should prefer not to discuss the subject. I have
pxpressed my opinion, and that is sufficient," Mrs. Baines
said, haughtily. " I repeat that it was most presumptuous
of her to call upon you-a liberty, a-  Florence," sle
went on with sudden alarm in her voice, "I hlope you did
not promise to go and see her ?"
" She never asked me."
"I should have put my veto on it if she had. My dear,
you must trust to my more mature judgment in some
things. I know the world better than you do. Believe
me, I have my reasons for every word I say. I treated
Mrs. North with the greatest clemency and consideration,
though she frequently forgot what was due to me. I
was blind whlile I stayed wvith her, Florence, and did not
see many tlhings that I do now; for I am not prone to
think ill of any one. You know that, my love, do you
not ? I murst beg that you will never, on any account,
mention Mrs. North's name again in my presence."
Florence felt as if the envelope would burn a hole in
her pocket. It was impossible to deliver it now. Per-
haps, after all, thle wisest way would be to say nothing





<pb n="125"/>AUNT ANNE                   125
about it. She had an idea that Aunt Anne frequently
forgot all about her bills as soon as she had come to the
conclusion tJlat it was impossible to make tlem any long-
er. she searched about in her mind for some other topic
of conversation. It was often difficult to find a subject to
talk about witl Aunt Anne, for the old lady never sug-
gested one herself, and, except of past experiences and
old-world recollections, she seldom seemed sufficiently in-
terested to talk miucih. IIappily, as it seemed for the mo-
ment, Jane entered witl the housekeeping books. Thcy
were always brought in on a Tuesday, and paid on a
Wednesday morning. Florence was very particular on
this point. They usually gave her a bad half-hour, for
she could never contrive to keep them down as much as slie
desired. That week, however, slhe reflected that they could
not be very bad; besides, she had left four pounds witl
Aunt Anne, wliiclh must be almost intact, unless the drives
hlad been paid out of them; but even then there would
be plenty left to more tllan cover the books. The pros-
pect of getting through her accounts easily cheered Flor-
ence, for slhe always found a satisfaction in balancing
them.
"They are heavy this week, ma'am," Jane said, not
without a trace of triumph in her voice, "on account of
the chickens and the cream and tlle company."
"' the chickens and the creali and the company,'"
lalglhed Florence, as Jane went out of the room-"it
sounds like a line from a comic poem. What does she
leanll 
Aunt Anne winked, as if to give herself nerve.
" Jane was very impertinent to nme one day, my love,
because I felt sure that after tlle fatigue of the journey
from town, and thle clhange of air, you would prefer that





<pb n="126"/>126                  AUNT ANNE
your delicately nurtured children should cat chicken and
have cream with their second course every d;ay for dinner,
instead of roast mutton and milk pudding. \Vhite meat
is infinitely preferable for delicate digestions."
"Yes, dear Aunt Anne," Florence said, sweetly-and
she felt a sudden dread of opening the books-" you are
quite right."  What did a few chickens and a little cream
matter in comparison to the poor old lady's feelings, she
thoughlt. "And if you had company too, of course you
wanted to have a smarter table. Whom have you been
entertaining, you dear and dissipated Aunt Anne ?"
" My dear Florence, I have entertained no one but Mr.
Wimple. He is a friend of yours and your dear Walter's;
and I tried to prove to hlin that I was worthy to belong
to you, by showing him such hospitality as lay in my
power."
"Yes, dear, and it was very kind of you," Florence
said, tenderly. After all, wly should Aunt Anne be
worried through that horrid Mr. Wimple? Walter would
liave invited him if he had found him in the neighbor-
hood, and why should not Aunt Anne do so in peace if
it pleased her? Of course, now that she herself had re-
turned, she could do as she liked about him. She looked
at the books. They were not so very bad, after all.
"Shall we make up our accounts now, and get it over,
or in the morning ?" slre asked.
" I should prefer the morning," Aunt Anne said, meek-
ly. " To-night, love, you must be tired, and I am also fa-
tigued witl the excitement consequent on seeing you."
"Whlat a shame, poor Aunt Anne !" Florence said,
brightly. "I have worn you out."
"Only with happiness, my dear," said the old lady,
fondly.





<pb n="127"/>AUNT ANNE                  127
Florence put away her books, and stroked Aunt Anne's
shoulder as slic passed.
" We will do our work in tlle morning," she said.
"Yes, mly darling, in the morning. In the afternoon
I may, possibly, have an engagement."
Florence longed to ask where, but a certain stiffness in
Aunt Anne's manner made it impossible.
"Ilave you any news from London ?" she ventured to
inquire, for slic was longing to know about Sir William
iRamnmagc.
"iNo, my love, I have no news from London," Mrs.
aaines answered, and she evidently meant to say no more.
In tlhe morning much time was taken up with the ar-
rival of the donkey-cart and the delight of the children.
A great basket of apples was inside the cart, and on tile
top was a little note explaining that they came from Mrs.
Burnett's garden, and she loped the children might like
themn. Aunt Anne ,;as as much pleased with the donkey
as the rest of the party.
\ "There is a rusticity in the appearance of a donkey,"
she explained, "tlhat always gives me a sense of being
really in the country."
" Not when you meet him in London, I fear," Florence
said.
Mrs. Baincs considered for a moment. she seemed to
resent the observation.
"No, my love, of course not in London-I am speaking
of the country," she said, reprovingly; then she added,
"I should enjoy a little drive occasionally myself, if you
would trust me with the cart, my love. It would remind
me of days gone by. I Q metimes drove one at Rotting-
dean. You are very fortthnate, my dear one, i' hlaving so





<pb n="128"/>128                 AUNT ANNE
few sorrows to remember-for I trust you lhave few. It
always saddens me to think of the past. Let us go in-
doors."
Florence put her arm through the old lady's, and led
her in. Then she thought of the books again; it would
be a good time to make them up.
"I am always particular about my accounts, you know,
Aunt Anne," she said, in an apologetic tone.
"Yes, my love," answered the old lady; "I admire you
for it."
Florence looked at the figures; they made her wince a
little, but she said nothing.
"The bill for the wagonettes, Aunt Anne ?" she asked.
"Tlat belongs to me, my dear."
"Oh no, I can't allow that."
"My love, I made an arrangement witl Mr. Steggall,
and that is sufficient."
Again Aunt Anne's tone forbade any discussion. Flor-
ence felt sure that one day Steggall's bill would arrive,
but she said nothing.
"Do you mind giving me the cliange out of the four
pounds ?" she asked, very gently. Mrs. Baines went slow-
ly over to her work-basket, and took up a little dress she
was making for Catty.
"Not now, my love; I want to get on witl nly work."
"Perhaps I could get your account-book, Aunt Anne;
then I should know how much there is left."
Mrs. Baincs began to sew.
"I did not put anything down in the account-book,"
she said, doggedly. "I considered, dear Florence, that my
time was too valuable. It always seems to me great non-
sense to put down every penny one spends."
" It is a great check on one's self."





<pb n="129"/>AUNT ANNE                  129
"I do not wish to keep a check on myself," Mrs. Baines
answered, scornfully.
"Could you tell Inc how much you have left?" Flor-
ence asked, mneekly. "I lhope there may be enough to
help us through til week."
She did not like to say that she thought it must be
nearly all left.
"Florence," burst out the old lady, with the injured
tone in her voice that Florence knew so well, "I have
but ten shillings left in the world. If you wish to take it
from me you must do so; but it is not like you, my dar-
ling."
" O, Aunt Anne," Florence began, bewildered, " I am
sure you-   I did not mean-I did not know-"
"I'm sure you did not," Mrs. 13aines said, with a sense
of injury still in her voice; " but there is nothing so ter-'
rible or so galling to a sensitive nature like mine-and
your dear Walter's takes after it, Florence, I am sure-as
to be worried about money matters."
"But, indeed, Aunt Anne, I only thoughlt that-thlat-"
but here she stopped, not knowing lhow to go on for a
moment; "I thought that perhaps the unpaid books
represented the household expenses," she added, at last.
Really, something must be done to make the old lady
careful, she thought..
"My love," Mrs. Baines said, wvith an impatient shake
of her head, "I cannot go into the details of every little
expense. I am not equal to it. Everything you do not
find charged in the books lias either been paid, or will be
clarged, by my request, to my private account-and you
must leave it so. I really cannot submit to being made
to give an explanation of every penny I spend. I am not
a child, Florence-  I am not an inexperienced girl. I
9





<pb n="130"/>130                  AUNT ANNE
had kept house before, my love-if you will allow me to
say so-before you were born."   The treble note had
come into Aunt Anne's voice; it was a sign that tears
were not far off.
But Florence could not feel as compassionate as she de-
sired. She smarted under the loss of her money. The/C
was nothing at all to represent it, and Aunt Anne did not
seem to have the least idea that it had been of any conse-
quence. Florence got up and put the books away, look-
ing across at Aunt Anne while she did so. The expres-
sion on the old lady's face was set, and :almost angry;
her lips were firmly closed. She was working at Catty's
little dress. She was a beautiful needle-woman, and em-
broidered little cuffs and collars on the children's things
tlat were a source of joyful pride to Florence. But even
tle ]lost of stitcleis would not pay tlhe week's bills. If
only Aunt Anne could be made to understand the value
of money, Florence thonlght-but it was no use thinking,
for her foolish, housekeeping heart was full of domestic
woe. she went up-stairs to her own room, and, like a real
woman who makes no pretence to stroncg-mindedness, sat
down to cry.
"If Walter were only back," she sobbed, as she rubbed
lier tearful face against the cushions on the back of the
basket-chair by the fireside. "If he were here I should
not mind-I might even laugh then. But after I have
tried and tried so hard to save and to spend so little, it is
hard-and I don't know what to do."   She pulled out
Waltcr's letter again and kissed it, by way of getting a lit-
tle comfort, and as she did so, felt the envelope contain-
ing the receipts of the bills Mrs. North had paid. She
did not believe that Aunt Anne cared whether they were
paid or not paid. She always seemed to think that the





<pb n="131"/>AUNT ANNE                   131
classes, who were what she pleased to consider beneath
her, were invented simply for her use and convenience,
and that protest in any shape on their part was mere im-
pertinence.
The day dragged by. 'The children prevented the din-
ner-hour from being as awkward as it miight have been.
Mrs. Baines was cold and courteous. Florence had no
words to say. She would make it up witl the old lady
in the evening, when they were alone, she thought. Of
course she would have to make it up. Meanwhile she
would go for a long walk-it would do her good. She
could think things over quietly, as she tramped along
a lonely road between the hedges of faded gorse and
heather. But it was late in the afternoon before she had
energy enough to start.         ,
Mrs. Baines was in the dining-room, reading the morn-
ing-paper, which had only just come, when Florence put
ler head in at the door. She was evidently excited and
agitated; she held tie paper in one hand, and looked out
towards the garden. But she seemed to have forgotten
all the unpleasantness of the morning when she spoke.
"My love, are you going out ?" she asked.
"I thought you hadl an engagemen t, Aunt Anne, and
would not want mle."
"That is true, my dear; and I shall be glad to be alone
for a little while, if you-will forgive me for saying it.
There is an announcement in the paper tliat gives me
tlhe deepest pain, Florence. Sir William Rammnage is ill
:,gain-lle is confilned to his room."
Oh, poor Aunt Anne !"
"I must write to him instantly. I felt sure there was
some good reason for his not having told me his decision
in regard to the allowance." Then, as if slc ]lad suddenly





<pb n="132"/>132                 AUNT ANNE
remembered the little scrimmage of the morning, she went
on, quickly, " My love, give me a kiss. Do not tlink that
I am angry with you-  I never could be that; but it is
unpleasant at my time of life to be Imade to give an exact
account of money. You will rememlber that, won't you,
dear? I should never expect it from you. If I had hun-
dreds and hundreds a year I would share them witl you
and your darlings; and I would ask you for no accounts,
dear Florence. I should tlink that the money was as
much yours as mine. You know it, don't you, my love?"
" Yes, dear, I think I do," Florence answered, and sle
kissed the old lady, affectionately, thinking that perhaps,
after all, she had made rather too mucll fuss.
"Then let us forget about it, my darling," Mrs. Baincs
said, with the gracious smile that always lad its influence;
"I could never remember anything long of you, but your
kindness and hospitality. Believe me, I am quite sure
tlat you did not mean to wound me this morning. It
was your zealous care of dear Walter's interests that made
you for a moment forget what was due to me. I quite
understand, my darling. Now go for your walk, and be
assured that Aunt Anne loves you."
And Florence wvas dismissed, feeling as tlhe children hlad
felt the evening before, when they had been sent to bed
and told of the chocolate under their pillows.





<pb n="133"/>ClUHATER XI
TIE gray sky and the dilm trees, the black hedges and
tile absolute stillness-all tliese proved excellent comfort-
ers to Florence. Tlcy made her pliilosopliical and almost
smiling again. It was only when an empty wagonette of
Steggall's passed her that site remembered the vexations
of the morning. "Poor old lady!" she said to herself,
with almost a laugh-"-in future she must not be trust-
ed with money, tlhat is all. If shle only would not scold
me and treat me like a clild, I should iot mind it so
much. Of course when Walter does it, I like it; but I
don't like it from Aunt Anne."
Slie lad walked quite a long way. she was getting
tired. the messengers of night were abroad-the stray
breezes, the dark-flecked clouds, the shadows loitering by
the trees, the strange little sounds among tlie hedges by
the wayside. Far off, beyond tlle wood, sihe heard a clock,
belonging to a big house, strike six. It was time to hurry
homie.  If she walked the two miles between herself and
the cottage quickly, slic would be in by half-past six. At
seven, after the children llad gone to bed, she and Aunt
Anne were to sit down to a little evening meal they called
supper. They would be very cosey that nigiht; they would
linger over their food; and Aunt Anne should talk of by-
gone days, and the quaint old world that always seemed to
be just belhind her.
It was rather dull in the country, Florence tholugt. In





<pb n="134"/>131                  AUNT ANNE
the summer, of course, the out-door life made it delightful,
but now there was so little to fill the days-only the chil-
dren and the housekeeping, wonderings about Walter, and
the writing of thd bit of diary, on very thin paper, which
she had promised to post out to hili every w1eek. She
was not a wioman who miade an intellectual atmosphere
for herself. She lived her life tllrough her husband, read
tihe same books, and direw her concluisions by the light of
lis. Now that he had gone, the world seened lialf empty
and very dull and tame. There wsas no glamour over any-
thing. Perhaps it was this that had helped to make her a
little unkind to Aunt Anne, for gradually she was persuad-
ing herself that she had been unkind. She wished Aunt
Anne had an income of her own and the ]home for which
she had said slic longed. It would be so much better for
everybody.
When siec was nearly home, a sudden dread seized her,
lest 3Mr. Wimple should be there; but this, slic reflected,
was not likely. It was long past calling-time, and Aunt
Anne was too great a stickler for etiquette to allow hliln
to take a liberty, as siec would call it. So Florence quick-
ened her steps, and entered her home, bravely, to the sound
of the children's voices up-stairs, singing as they went to
bed. A lire was blazing in the dining-room, and every-
thing looked comfortable, just as it had the night before.
But there was no sign of Aunt Annc. Probably she was
up-stairs "getting ready," for a lace cap and bit of white
at her throat, and an extra formal, though not less affec-
tionate, manner tlian usual, Aunt Anne seemed to think
a fitting accompaniment to the evening Ineal. Florence
looked round tlhe dining-room, with a little pride of own-
ership. She was fond of the cottage; it was their very
own-hers and Walters; and how wise they had been to do





<pb n="135"/>AUNT ANNE                   135
up that particular rooml-it made every meal they ate in it
a pleasure. that buttery-hatch too-it was absurd that it
should be so, but really it was a secret joy to her. Sud-
denly her eye caught a package that had evidently come
in her absence. A parcel of any sort was always exciting.
This could not be another present fronl Aunt Anne?-
and she drew a short breath. Oh no, it had come by rail.
Books. She knew what it was-some novels from Mr.
Fisher. "lHow kind he is," she said, gratefully; "lie
says so few words, but he does so many things. I really
don't see wly Ethel sliould not love him. I don't think
shel would find it diflicult to do so," she thought, with the
forgetfulness of womanhood for the days of girlish fancy.
"Mrs. Baines has not yet returned," the servant said, en-
tering to arrange the table.
" Not returned ? Is she out, then ?"
"Yes, ma'am; she started lialf an hour after you did.
Steggall's wagonette came for her."
Florence groaned inwardly.
" )o you know where she lh:s gone ?"
"I think she has gone to Guildford, na'ainL, shopping;
she often did wllile you were away. I heard her tell the
driver to drive quickly to the station, as she feared she
was late."
"Oh! Did any one call, Jane ?"
" No, ma'am."
Then, once more, Florence delivered herself over to de-
spair. Aunt Anne must have gone to buy more surprises,
and if she had only ten shillings in the world it was quite
clear she would have to get them on credit. Something
would have to be done. The tradespeople would have to
be warned. Walter inust be written to, and, if necessary,
asked to calle over advice.  'cihaps Sir William Ranla-





<pb n="136"/>136                  AUNT ANNE
mage would interfere. In the midst of all her perturba-
tion seven o'clock struck, and there was no Aunt Anne.
Florence was a healthy young woman, and she had had
a long walk. The pangs of hunger assailed her vigorously,
so, after resisting them till lialf-past seven, she sat down
to her little supper alone. Food lad a soothing effect on
an agitated mind, and a quarter of an lour later, though
Aunt Annie had not appeared, Florence had come to the
conclusion that she could not get very deeply into debt,
because it was not likely that the tradespeople would trust
ler. Perhaps, too, after all, she has not gone to Guildford.
Still, what could keep her out so late?  The roads were
dark and lonely; she knew no one in the neighborhood. It
was to be hoped that nothing bad happened to her; and, at
this thouglht, Florence began to reproach herself again for
all her unkindness of the morning. But while she was
still reviewing her own conduct with much severity, there
was a soft patter, patter, along the gravel patl outside, and
a feeble ring at the bell. "Tllat dissipated old lady!"
laughed Florence to herself, only too deliglted to tlink
that she had returned safely at last.
A moment later Aunt Anne entered. She was a little
breathless; her left eye winked more frequently tlan usual;
there was an air of happy excitement in lier manner. She
entered the room quickly, and seated herself in the easy-
chair witl a sigll of relief.
"My darling," she said, looking fondly at Florence.
"I trust you did not wait for me, and that I have not
caused you any inconvenience. But if I have," she added,
in an almost cooing voice, "you will forgive me when you
know all."
"Oh yes, dear Aunt Anne, I will forgive you "-and
Florence signed to Jane to bring a plate. ' You must be





<pb n="137"/>AUNT ANNE                  137
shockingly hungry," she laughed. "Where have you
been-may I know ?"
"I will tell you presently, my darling; you shall know all.
But I can't eat anything," Aunt Anne answered, quickly.
Even the thought of food seemed to make her impatient.
"Jane," she said, with the little air of pride that Jane re-
sented, "you need not bring a plate for me. I do not re-
quire anything."  Then, speaking to Florence again, she
went on, with half-beaming, half-condescending gentleness,
"Finish your repast, my darling; pray, don't let nmy in-
trusion-for it is an intrusion when I am not able to join
in your meal-hllrry you. When you have finished, but
not till then, I have a communication to make to you. It
is one I feel to be due to you before any one else, and it
will prove to you how much I depend on your sympathy
and love."  She spoke with earnestness, unfastening ler
cloak and nervously fastening it the while. Florence
looked at lier with surprise, with pity. Poor old lady,
slhe thought, hlow easily she worked herself into a state
of excitement.
"Tell me lwhat it is now, dear Aunt Anne," she said,
gently. "IIas anything occurred to worry you ? Iave
you been to Guildford ?"
"To Guildford? No, my dear. Something lias oc-
curred, but not to worry me. It is something that will
make me very happy, and I trust that it will make you
very happy to hear it. I rely on your sympathy and Wal-
ter's to support Ine."  Florence was not very cnrious-
Aunt Anne had always so nmuch earnestness at licr com-
mand, and was i;lways prodigal of it. Besides, it did not
seem likely that anything important had happened; some
trifling pleasure or vexation, probably, nothing more.
At last the little meal was finished; the things pushed





<pb n="138"/>138                 AAUNT ANNE
through the buttery-hatch ; tie crumbs sw-ept off the cloth
by Jane, who seemed to linger in a manner that Mrs.
Baines in her own mind felt to be wholly reprehensible
and wanting in respect towards her superiors. But the
cloth was folded and put away at last, the buttery-hatch
closed, the fire adjusted, and the door shut. Aunt Anne
gave a sigh of relief; then, throwing her cloak back over
the chair, she rose and stood irresolute on the hearth-rug.
Florence went towards her.
" Iave you been anywhere by train ?" she asked.
"No, my love.   I went to the station, to meet some
one."  She trembled with excitement while she spoke.
Florence noticed it with wonder.
"What is it, Aunt Anne ?" she asked, gently. the old
lady stretched out hicr two thin hands, and suddenly
dropped her head for a moment on Florence's shoulder;
but she raised it quickly, and evidently struggled to be
calm.
"IMy darling," slhe said, "I know you will sympathize
witlh nme; I know your loving heart. I knew it the first
day I saw you, whlen you were at Rottingdean, and stood
under the pear-tree with your dear Walter-"
" Yes, oli yes, dear-"  Florence had so often heard of
that pear-tree. But wlat could it have to do with tile
present situation ?
"I shall never forget the picture you two made," tile
old lady went on, not heeding the interruption; "I knew
all tlhat was in your dear heart then, just as I feel that you
will understand all tihat is in mine now."  Iler face was
flushed, her eyes were almost bright, and there were tears
in them; the left one winked tremuclously.
Florence looked at her in amazement. "What is it,
Aunt Anne?    l)o tell me; tell me at once, dear?'" slhe





<pb n="139"/>AUNT ANNE                   139
said, entreatingly. "And tell me wlhere you have been, so
late and in the dark."  For a moment Aunt Anne liesi-
tated ; then, with a gasp and a strong effort to be firm and
dignified, she raised her head and spoke.
"My dear-my dear, all this time I have been with Al-
fred Wimple. IIe loves nme."
"He loves you ?" Florence repeated, her eyes full of
wonder; "lie loves you ? Yes, of course he loves you-
we all do," she said, soothingly, too much surprised to
speculate further.
" Yes, he loves me," Aunt Anne said again, in an almost
solemn voice, "and I lave promlised to be his wife."
"Aunt Anne !-to marry him !"
"Yes, dear, to marry him "-and shle waited, as if for
congratulations.
"But, Aunt Anne, dear-" Florence began, in aston-
islhment, and then slic stopped; for, tloughl she had liad
some idea of the. old lady's infatuation, she lad never
dreamed of its ending in matrimony. Mrs. Baines w'as
excited and strange ; it might be some delusion, some joke
that had been played on her, for Mr. Wilnple could not
liave seriously asked her to marry iim. Florence waited,
not knowing wllat to say. But Aunt Anne's excitement
seemed to be passing, and, with a tender, pitiful expres-
sion on her face, sllc waited for her niece to speak. "But,
Aunt Anne, dear," was all Florence could say again in lier
bewilderment.
"' But what, Florence ?" lMrs. Baines spoke with a half-
tragic, lialf-resentful manner. " IIave you nothing more
to say to me, my love ?"
" But you are not really going to marry lim, are you ?"
Florence asked, in an incredulous voice.
The old lady answered, in a terrill y earnest one.





<pb n="140"/>140                  AUNT ANNE
"Yes, Florence, I am; and never shall nan have truer,
more loving helpmeet than I will be to him," she burst
out, heroically, holding herself erect and looking her
niece in the face. Tlere was something infinitely pa-
thetic about her as she stood there, quivering with feel-
ing and aching for sympathy, yet old, wrinkled, and
absurd, her poor, scanty hair pushed back and lier weak
eyes full of tears. For a moment there was silence.
"'But, dear Aunt Anne, lie--lie is so much younger
tlhan you," Florence said at last, bringing out her words
slowly, and hating herself for saying them.
"Age is not counted by years, my darling," Aunt
Anne answered, "and if he does not feel my age a draw-
back, why should I count his .youth one? HIe loves me,
Florence-I know he loves me," shc l)roke out, in a pas-
sionate, tearful voice; "and you would not have me throw
away or depreciate a faithful heart that lias been given
mle?"
Then the practical side of Florence's nature spoke up,
in despair. "But, Aunt Anne, he is very poor."
" I know he is poor, but he is young and strong and
liopeful; and he will work. IIe says he will work like
a slave for me; and if he is content to face poverty with
me, how can I be afraid to face it witl him ?"
"But you want comforts, Aunt Anne?"
"Ohl no, my love, my tastes are very simple, and I shall
be content to do without them for his sake."
"But at your time of life, dear Aunt Anne, you do
want them-you are not young, as he is."  Then Aunt
Anne burst into tears, tears that were evidently a blessed
relief, and had been pent up in her poor old heart, waiting
for an excuse to come forth.
"Florence, I did not tlink you would tell me of my





<pb n="141"/>AUNT ANNE                  141
age. If I do not feel it, and le does not, why should you
remind nc of it ? And whly should you tell me that lie
is poor? Do you suppose that I am so selfish or-or tlhat
I would sell myself for comfort and luxury ? If he can
face poverty witl me, I can face it witlh him. I did think,
Florence, that you would have been kind to me, and have
understood and sympathized. I told lim that on your heart
and Walter's I could rely. You know how lonely I have
been-how desolate and how miserable. But for your
bounty and goodness I should have died-"
" 0  no, dear Aunt Anne-"
"And now, in this great crisis-now, when a young,
brave, beautiful life is laid at my feet; now that I am
loved as truly as ever woman was loved in this world, as
tenderly as Walter loves you, Florence-you fail me, as-as
if"-she putS her hand to her throat to steady her quiver-
ing voice-" as if you would not let me taste tlhe cup of
.:appiness of which you drink every day."
" But, Aunt Anne, it isn't tlat, indeed," Florence an-
swered, thinking, despairingly, of Walter, and wishing tlat
she could begin writing to hlil that very minute, asking
lim what on earth she ought to say or do. " It is tlat-
tlat-it is so unexpected, so strange. I knew, of course,
that you liked lini, that you were good friends; but I
never dreamed that he was in love with you."
Aunt Anne's tears seemed to vanish as if by magic; her
left eye winked, almost fiercely; her lips opened, but no
sound came. With a great effort she recovered lier voice
at last, and, witl some of her old dignity, dashed witl se-
vere surprise, she asked,
" My darling, is there any reason why he should not love
me?"
She stood, gravely waiting for a reply, while Florence





<pb n="142"/>142                 AUNT ANNE
felt that she was managing badly-that she was, somehow,
hurting and insulting Aunt Anne. After all, the old lady
had a right to do as she liked ; it was evident that she was
incapable of taking in the absurdity of the situation.
"But, Aunt Anne-" she began, and stopped.
" My dear Florence," Mrs. 13aincs repeated, still more
severely, " will you tell Imc if there is any very obvious
reason why he should not love me? I am not an ogress,
my darling-I am not an ogress," she cried, suddenly
breaking down and bursting into floods of tears, while
her head dropped on to her black merino dress.
She looked so old and worn, so wlretched and lonely, as
she stood there, weeping bitterly, that Florence could
stand it no longer, and, going forward, she put her arms
round the poor old soul, and kissed her fondly.
"No, dear Aunt Anne," she said, "you are not an
ogress-you are a sweet old dear, and I love you. Don't
cry-don't cry, you dear."
"My love, you are cruel to me," Aunt Anne sobbed.
"Ol no, I am not, and you shall marry any one you
like. It was a little surprising, you know, and of course
I didn't-I didn't think that marrying was in your
thoughts," she added, feebly, for she didn't know what
to say.
" Bless you, my darling, bless you !" the old lady gasped,
gratefully; "I knew you would be stanch to imc when
you had recovered from t.le surprise of my comnmunica-
tion; but-" and she gently disengaged herself from Flor-
ence's embrace and spoke in thle nervous, quivering voice
tlat always came to her in nmoments of excitement-- " but,
Florence, since the first moment we met, Alfred Wil)ple
and I have felt that we were ordained for cach other."
"Yes, dear," Florence said, soothingly.





<pb n="143"/>AUNT ANNE                   143
" He says he shall never forget the moments we sat to-
gether on your balcony that night when your dear Walter
fetched the white shawl of yours, Florence, to put round
my shoulders," the old lady vwent on, carnestly. " And the
sympathy between us is so great that we do not feel the
difference of years ; besides, he says lic has never liked
very young women; he lhas always felt that the power to
love accumulated vithl timec, as my power to love lias done.
Few of the women whlo have been loved by great men
have been very young, my darling."
"I didn't know," Florence began, for Aunt Anne had
paused, almost as if she were repeating something she hlad
learned by heart.
"IIe asked me to-night," she went on, with another lit-
tle gasp, " if I remembered-if I remembered-I forget-
But all the great passions of history have been concen-
trated on women in tleir prime. Petrarch's Laura had
eiglit children when the poet fell in love with h1er, and
Ielen of Troy was sixty when-wxhen-I forget "-slle
said again, shaking her hlead; "iLt he remembers ; lie
went through them all to-night. Besides, I may be old
in years, but I am not old at heart; you cannot say that I
am, Florence."
She was getting excited again. Almost without her
knowledge Florence led her to the easy-chair, and, gently
pushing her down into it, undid the strings and tried to
take off her bonnet; but the old lady resisted.
"No, my dear, don't take off my botinet," she said-" un-
less you will permit me to ring," she added, getting back
to her old-fashioned folrmality, "and request Jane to bring
me my cap from up-stairs."
But Florence felt that Jane might look curiously at the
wrinkled face that still showed signs of recent agitation,





<pb n="144"/>144                 AUNT ANNE
so she put her hand softly on the one that Aunt Anne
hlad stretched out to toucli tlhe bell.
" I will get it for you, dear," she said, and in a moment
slhe hiad tripped up-stairs and brought down the soft lace
cap put ready on the bed, and tihe cashmere slippers edged
with fur and lined with red flannel, in which Aunt Annc
liked to encase her feet in the evening. "There, now,
you will feel better, you poor dear !" she said, when they
were put on, and the old lady sat silent and composed,
looking as if she were contemplating her future and the
new life before her. Florence stood by her silently for a
moment, thinking the past weeks over, in which Aunt
Anne, with her poverty and dignity, her generosity and
recklessness, had formed so striking a figurc. Then slh
thought of the lonely life the poor old lady had led in
the little lodging.
After all, if she only had even a very little happiness
with that horrid Mr. Wimple, it would be something; and
of course, if he didn't behave properly, Walter could take
her away. The worst of it was, she had understood that
Mr. Wimple had no money. she had heard that he lived
on a small allowance from an uncle, and the uncle might
stop that allowance when he leard that his neplhew had
married an old woman whlo had not a penny.
"Aunt Annc," she asked, gently, "does he know that
you are not rich ?"
"Florence, I told him plainly that I had no fortune,"
the old lady answered, with a pathetic, half-hunted look
on her face that made Florence hatc herself for her lack
of sympathy. But she felt that she ought to ask some
questions. Walter would be so angry if she allowed her
to go into misery and fresh poverty without making a
single effort to save liher.





<pb n="145"/>AUNT ANNE                  145
"And has he money, dear-enough to keep you both,
at any rate ?"
The tears trickled down Aunt Anne's face again while
she answered,
"If I did not ask him that question, Florence, it is not
for you to ask it me. I neither know nor care what lie
lias. If he is willing to take nc for myself only, so am I
willing to take him, loving him for himself only, too. I
am too old to marry for money, and he is too noble to
do so. We are grown-up man and woman, Florence, and
know our own hearts; we will brook no interference-we
will brook no interference, my darling, not even from
you."
She got up tremblingly.
"I must retire," she said; " you must allow me to re-
tire, and in the privacy of my own room I sliall be able to
reflect."
The long'words were coming back; they were a sign
that Aunt Anne was herself again.
"Yes, dear Aunt Anne; I am sure you must want to
be alone, and to think," Florence said, bgntly.
The old lady was not appeased.
" You know, you remember what you felt yourself when
your Walter first loved you, Florence," she said, distantly.
"Yes, I nust be alone; my heart is full-I must be alone."
Florence led her l)-stairs to her room. Mrs. Baines
stood formally in the doorway.
"Good-night, my love," she said, with cold disappoint-
ment in her voice, which she seemed unable to control.
"Can't I help you, Aunt Anne?" Florence asked, al-
most entreatingly.
"No, my love, I must be alone," Mrs. Baines repeated
firmly, and, retreating into her room, she shut the door.

<pb n="146"/>CrAPTER XII
THE next morning Aunt Anne did not appear. She
sent word that she would like her breakfast carried up, a
fire lighted in her room, and to be left alone for a couple
of hours.
Florence was distracted. she had written to Walter;
but, as the mail did not go out till three days later, noth-
ing was gained by her haste. She had considered things
all round, and the more she did so the more amazing did
Mr. Wimple's proposal seem. It was all nonsense to sup-
pose, as Aunt Anne evidently believed, that he was in
love witl a woman more than twice his age. Florence
mentally reviewed Aunt Anne's charms. She was not
even a round, plump old lady, with rosy cheeks and a
stray dimple that seemed to have found her company so
good it was loath to vanish altogether. She was wrinkled
and thin and feeble-looking. Her eyes were small and
weak; the left one had the nervous affection that so often
provided an almost droll accompaniment to her talk. IIer
skin was withered and sallow. Florence tried to feel like
a young man about to marry Aunt Anne, and the idea
was not pleasant. she felt that it was almost a duty to
prevent the marriage if possible-tlhat Aunt Anne owed it
to her past years, to her own dignity, to her relations, to
every one and everything, not to make a fool of herself.
The childrlen vent out at ten o'clock. Florence listened
to their shouts of joy as they drove off in the donkey-cart.





<pb n="147"/>AUNT ANNE                  147
Then, hurrying through her domestic affairs, she sat down
in one of the gaunt easy-chairs by the drawing-room fire
to consider matters. It somehow seemed fitting to sit in
the old-world little room while she thought over Aunt
Anne's romance. She could hear the old lady moving
about overhead, but was afraid to go up to her again, for
she had been refused admittance two hours ago. Jane,
who was overwhelmed with curiosity, had managed to go
in and out once or twice, and reported that Mrs. Baines
was dressed and looking through the contents of her
trunks, "just as if she was packing up."  Florence won-
dered what it meant, and a dim suspicion of the truth
crossed her mind. She felt, too, as if in the little cottage
by the lonely roadside a tragedy was beginning in which
Aunt Anne would play central figure. She shut her eyes
for a moment, and, as if in a dream, could see the old lady
wringing her thin hands, then stretching them out, almost
imploringly. "h01, dear Aunt Anne," she cried, "some-
thing must be done. No good can come of this wild non-
sense."
Suddenly, on the gravel footpath outside, she heard a
footstep, just as she had heard Aunt Anne's footstep the
night before. She got up quickly and looked out. It
was Mr. Wimnple. he must have come up from the dip
at the end of the garden, the short way from IIindhead
and the Liphook road. he was going round the house.
Florence darted out and opened the front door before lie
had time to ring. All in a moment it had struck her that
if she could get a talk with him, some explanation, per-
haps some good, might come of it. Yet her heart ached,
she felt cruel and treacherous, as if she were trying to
cheat Aunt Anne of a promise-even though it was a
ridiculous promise--of happiness. She thought of the
I





<pb n="148"/>148.                AUNT ANNE
poor old lady's tears, of her pleading, of her piteous "as
if you grudged me the cup of happiness of which you
taste every day."  After all, she had a right to do as she
pleased; but that was a foolish argument. She had a
right to put lerself on the kitchen fire if she pleased, but
it would be distinctly the duty of the nearest person to
pull her off and prevent her from being burned.
Mr. Wilnple stared at Florence. "Iow do you do,
Mrs. IIibbert," he said, with extreme gravity. I-e did not
hold out his hand or look as if he expected to enter, but
stood still on the door-step.
"I saw you coming and wanted to speak to you, Mr.
Wimple," she said, almost breathlessly-" won't you come
in?"  Without a word he entered. She led the way to
the drawing-room and shut the door. She pointed to one
of the chairs beside the screen witl a peacock on it, and
he sat down, still without a word, and waited for her to
speak. She took the other chair and faced him. The
light was full upon him, but there was no expression in
his eyes, not even one of inquiry.
"Mr. Wimple," she said, in a low voice, for she was
afraid of Aunt Anne, above, hearing the hum of conversa-
tion, "I wanted to speak to you about Aunt Anne-M rs.
Baines." ITe looked at her tlen, but still he said notling.
"I am very fond of her," she added, as if in excuse for
her interference.
" I am sure you are," he answered, and waited. Florence
was forced to go on.
" She came home last night, and she surprised me so-
she told me-  Oh, Mr. Wimple, it cannot be truel?"
" What cannot be true, Mrs. Hibbert ?" he asked, speak-
ing like an automaton.
"That-that-tlhat-that you asked her to marry you ?"





<pb n="149"/>AUNT ANNE                   149
"It is quite true," he said, and looked at her unflinch-
ingly; his face wore an expression of slight surprise.
"But it is so strange, so unsuitable-she is so much older
than you ?"
"I know she is much older."  IIe seemed to unlock his
lips every time he spoke.
"And, Mr. Wimple, do you know that she is not rich?
-that-tlhat she has no money-nothing? She is poor."
"I know she is poor, Mrs. IIibbert."  he seemed to be
afflicted with an utter destitution of language, an incapac-
ity to say anything but the shortest, most cut-and-dried
sentence. It affected Florence. But again she struggled
on; though she felt her own words come witl difficulty.
"And you-forgive me, but I am fond of her-and you,
I believe, are not rich. Walter told me that you were not.
And, and-" She was beginning to despair of making any
way witl Mr. Wimple. Iis eyes were dull and uninterest-
ed; he seemed insepsible to everything except the burden
of his own gravity.
"I am not rich, Mrs. Ilibbert," he said. The manner
in which he repeated her name at the end of every sen-
tence irritated ler.
"Aaid, oil, Mr. Wimple," she went on, "it is so unsuit-
able!"  But he said nothing, though she wait-'d. "It is
so strange, and Walter will be so angry !"
"It is not Walter's affair, Mrs. IIibbert; it is mine," he
said.
"And hers-and Aunt Anne's too."
"And hers," he repeated.
"And she is old; she wants comforts and luxury-oh,
I cannot bear to think of it. It seems so cruel."
"We have talked it all over, Mrs. IIibbert; she knows
best herself what she wants," he l  swered, without tile
sliglhtest change in his manner.





<pb n="150"/>150                  AUNT ANNE
" But are you really in love with her ?"
"I am very fond of her," he said, blankly.
Florence put her hand to her throat to steady her utter-
ance.
"But you are not in love with her ? You can't be-
she is old enough to be your mother? She is a dear, sweet
old lady, but you can't be in love with her!"
"I don't see the necessity of our discussing this," lie
said, witl extreme gravity.
"But she is my aunt-at least shte is Walter's, which is
all the same."  IIe gave a little dry cough.
"Mrs. Baincs and I have settled our affairs, Mrs. Ilib-
bert," he said. " There is no necessity to go over them."
"But it is so ridiculous."
"Then we will not talk about it."  Suddenly he looked
at her; there was no change in his tone, but he opened his
eyes a little wider as if to impress upon her the impor-
tance of his next words. "We don't wish our private af-
fairs made known to the world," he said; " there is no
necessity to talk of them at all; they are of no impor-
tance except to ourselves. We don't wish to talk about
them or to hear of their being talked about. Will you
remember this, Mrs. IIibbert ?"  It was quite a relief to
get tlrce consecutive sentences out of him.
"But, Mr. Wimple, do tell me that, if you persist in
marrying her, you will make her happy, you will be good
to her, and-that you can keep her in some sort of com-
fort," Florence said, in despair.
" I will talk to her about tlis, Mrs. IIibbert. It is ler
affair," he said, solemnly, and Florence felt altogether
worsted, left out in the cold, put back, and powerless.
She sat silently by the fire, not knowing wlat to do or
say. Mr. Wimiple made no sign. she looked up at him.





<pb n="151"/>AUNT ANNE                   151
What could Aunt Anne see to like in him, in his dull eyes,
his thin lips, his straggling sandy hair and whiskers, his
pinl-and-white, yet unhealthy, complexion. he met her
gaze steadily. "Is there anything more you wish to say
to me ?" he asked; " I have not much time."
"No," she answered, chokingly, "there is notling-if you
would only be a son to her, a friend-anything, rather tlan
marry her. Oh, Mr. Wimple, if you really do care for
her, don't make her ridiculous in her old age, don't make
her unhappy. Iappiness cannot come of an absurd mar-
riage like this. You ought to marry a girl, a young woln-
an. One day Walter and I saw you at Waterloo-"
IIe fixed his eyes upon hier, and there was a slight look
of curiosity in them now, but he was absolutely calm.
" Well, Mrs. Hibbert ?" he said.
" We thought that perhaps she was-was some one you
liked; she was young, it would have been much more
suitable-"
"I must know what I desire, and what is most suitable
for myself, Mrs. Ilibbert," he answered, witlout a shade
of vexation, but with quiet determination in his voice.
Tlen Jane, evidently to her own satisfaction, entered.
" If you please, ma'am, Mrs. Baines says she would like
to speak to Mr. Wimple when you have quite finished
with him."
"Tell Mrs. Baines I will go up to her in a moment; I
want to speak to her."  she turned to Mr. Wimple again
when Jane was gone. Ile rose, as if to signify that lie
considered their conversation at an end. "I fear there is
nothing more to say," she said, lamely, for tlis man, with
his silence and utter lack of response, had made every
word that suggested itself seem weak and hopeless.
"I think not, Mrs. Ilibbert," he said.





<pb n="152"/>152                  AUNT ANNE
"But for your own happiness, Mr. Wimple," sihe said,
suddenly struck with a new way of putting it-" you sure-
ly can't want to marry Mrs. Baines for the sake of your
own happiness ?"
"I want to marry Mrs. Baincs as much for my own
sake as for hers "-and he looked at her in a manner that
was almost a dismissal. It had an influence over her that
she could not help: almost against her will she rose, feel-
ing that tlhere was no excuse for prolonging the interview.
"I will send Mrs. Baines to you," she said, in despair.
"Thank you, Mrs. IIibbert, if you will," he said, and
held open the door for her to pass out.
Aunt Anne heard the drawing-room door open and
Florence's footstep on the stairs. She waited eagerly in
the doorway of her own room. She wore her best dress;
round her throat tliere was an extra handkerchief; in her
manner more than the usual nervous agitation. Glancing
in at the bedroom, Florence could see that she had been
packing, making ready for a journey.
"011, Aunt Anne-" she began.
"Yes, my love, I am going to town," the old lady said,
witl a cold reserve in lier tenderness that showed clearly
she was displeased. "I cannot stay longer under your
roof-you must not ask me to do so," she went on. "I was
cut to the quick by your want of sympathy last night, I
cannot recover from it; I could not expose myself to it
again. My luggage is ready, and when I have seen my
dear Alfred I shall be able to tell you the time of my de-
parture."
" 01, Aunt Anne, it is cruel," Florence said, dismayed.
"No, my love, it is not cruel, but 1 must respect my-
self. I would not hurt you for the world, Florence, but
you have hurt me."





<pb n="153"/>AUNT ANNE                  153
" I wouldn't hurt you, either, for the world, but-"
"Where is Mr. Wimple, my love ?" the old lady asked,
interrupting her niece, with a long sigh.
"ITe is down-stairs; I have been talking to him."
"Yes, my love, I understand. I appreciate all your
solicitude for my happiness, but you should allow those
whlo are older and wiser than you to know what is best
for themselves. I will see you again when he is gone,
Florence "-and, almost imperiously, Mrs. Baines went
down-stairs.
She entered the drawing-room and shut the door. Mr.
Wimple was standing on the hearth-rug. She looked at
him nervously for a moment, and winked solemnly as
usual with her left eye.
" My darling!" she said, and, putting her arms round
his neck, she kissed his face on both sides. "My darling
Alfred, are you glad to see me?" IIe submitted to ler
caress, almost formally, then drew back a little. Iis man-
ner was no warmer than it had been to Florence.
" Yes, I am glad to see you," he said, and looked at her
with his eyes wide open, as if to show that he perfectly
understood his position.
"My darling, I have suffered terribly-Florence had
no sympathy for us. She said it was an unsuitable mar-
riage, that you had no fortune, and that I had none.
My poverty is hard enough to bear without being told
of it. What did she say to you, Alfred ?-my dear one,
she has not turned your love from me?"  She put out
her arms again, as if to gather him to her, but le looked
blindly past her.
"Sit down," he said, and pushed her gently on to tlhe
chair beside the peacock-screen.
" She has not taken your love from me ?-tell me that,"





<pb n="154"/>154                 AUNT ANNE
Mrs. Baines said, entreatingly. "A few hours ago you
assured me of your devotion-sllc lias not taken it from
me ?"
"No."
"I am just the same to you ?" she asked. he turned
his eyes on her again.
"You are just the same," he said, with a gulp, and there
was no tenderness in his manner. Ile seemed to be speak-
ing almost under compulsion.
"My darling, my darling," she said, softly, " bless you for
those dear words! I will be truer to you, Alfred, than ever
woman was to man before. But I cannot stay here; you
must take me away. I have already packed my things; I
cannot remain another night, not knowing to what treat-
ment I may be subjected. I love Florence most sincerely
-slie and Walter and their children are very dear to me-
but after her coldness to me last niglt, when I came in
full of your love and my own happiness, and she denied
me all sympathy, I cannot stay. You must not ask me to
do that, Alfred !" There was more interest in his manner
now, though his gravity never relaxed.
"Where will you go ?" he asked.
"I shall go to London, my darling," she said, stretching
out her llands; "but I cannot go alone, after all I have
suffered during the last twenty-four hours." he looked
at her, questioningly.
"Suffered? What have you suffered? " le asked. "I
thought you were happy about it."
" About you ?-yes, my darling; but Florence lias tort-
ured me-"
"It does not take much to torture you, Anne," he in-
terrupted. " What did she say ?"
"I have told you already-1 cannot go over it again.





<pb n="155"/>AUNT ANNE                  155
Don't ask me to do so. You could torture me, Alfred,
with a word or a look-if you ceased to love me."
" We need not discuss that improbability now," lhe said,
solemnly; " wlat about your going to London ?"
"I sllall go by the quarter-past-one-o'clock train this
afternoon," she answered; "you will take me, will you
not ?"
"I cannot go to-day," he said, firmly; "I must get
back to Liphook now." IIe pulled out his watcl, a dull,
worn Waterbury one, at whicl Aunt Anne looked keenly.
"But I will go to-miorrow; I want to see my uncle
very much." IIis thoughts seemed to be intent on busi-
ness matters. She waited a moment, after he had fin-
ished speaking, and winked slowly to herself before she
answered.
"Alfred," she asked, "you do truly love me?"  IIe
looked at her steadfastly.
"Yes," he answered, " I told you so last night."  She
lhalf rose from her chair again, but he waved her back.
"Sit down," he said, and she obeyed.
"I know you did, and I will never doubt it. In by-
gone days, my darling, I was foolish and wicked, and
played with the truest love ever given to woman. But I
am wiser now. You must never doubt me. Promise ine
that you never will."
" I promise you," and he closed his lips.
"My dear, my dear," she said softly to herself, and
stopped for a moment before she went on, aloud, "I must
go to town this afternoon, and you must take me. My
colurage is not equal to encountering the journey alone.
You will take me, my darling ?"
"    CWhere will you go when you get to London ?"
"I know of some apartments-two rooms; I saw then

the day before I came away. If they are still unlet I
shall rent them. But when we arrive I shall go straight
to Sir William Rammagc. I have business with him.
He is very ill, Alfred-it was in the paper yesterday; but
lie will see me, and when he knows all-"
"You will tell him nothing about me," he said, in his
slow, determined voice. She winked indignantly.
"Alfred," she answered, " I must tell him. I shall
tell him that you love me; that I lave won a true
and noble heart, and that we are going through life to-
gether."
"You will tell him nothing," Mr. Wimple repeated,
with something like fright in his dull eyes. "If you did
my uncle would hear of it, and would think 1 was mad."
He added the clause about his uncle as if he thought an
explanation due to lier.
"MIad to marry lme ?"
" Mad to think of marriage at all. IHe objects to it on
principle."
"But if he knew how tenderly and truly I loved
you-"
"You must not say one word about it, to him or to any
one," came the firm, hard voice.
"Is it because you are-you are ashamed of loving me,
Alfred " she asked, quivering.
"No. But it is my wish. That should be enough."
She was silent for a mnonment. "It is enough," she an-
swered, slowly; "your wish shall be my law, in this as in
all things. But you will take nme up to town, Alfred?"
slhe pleaded. " You can go to tlc Plue Lion, to Steggall's,
and tell thcnl to drive you back to Liphook now. It will
go down to my account, darling. You can take the quar-
ter-to-one train from Liphook to London; it stops at Wit-





<pb n="157"/>AUNT ANNE                  157
ley. I will be on the platform, and we will go on togeth-
er."  She ventured to stand now, and she held out her
hands again, almost entreatingly.
"And you will say notling to Sir William ?"
"Alfred, you are my lord and master"-and she bowed
'her head on her breast. But he was wholly untouched.
"Very well," he said, "I will drive back at once-
there is not too much time-and meet you as you say.
Good-by." he kissed her forehead, and, as before, swiftly
drew back again.
"Will you order a wagonette for me too, Alfred?"
she asked, as she followed him to the door; "I shall want
one to take me to the station. Tell them to put it all
down to me." IHe did not answer till the street door was
open, and he saw the dark trees against tlhe sky and the
withered leaves beneath lying on the garden pathway.
Then a smile crossed his lips; his face wore an air of re-
lief, he looked like a free man. IIe crossed the thresh-
old with a light step, and stopped and looked over his
shoulder at her.
"Good-by," he said; "I will order the wagonette. It
is lovely weather. We shall enjoy the journey to town."
"My darling," she said, with a world of tenderness in
her voice. " I shall enjoy anything witl you as long as I
live." IIe looked at her for a minute, with the strange,
dumb expression that was so peculiarly his own, and
walked away.
Mrs. Baines went back to the drawing-room and shut
the door with a manner that conveyed to the whole house
that she wanted to be alone for a little space. She stood
tlouglltfully beside the chair on whiclh he had sat. Sud-
denly she caught sight of her own face in the chimney-
glass. she looked at it critically and winked slowly; slte





<pb n="158"/>158                  AUNT ANNE
pulled the white hlandkerchief np a little higher round
her throat and turned away, satisfied. "IIe loves me,"
she said; "I know he loves ime; and no power on earth
shall separate me from hiin. I will marry hlim if I walk
to church witlout my shoes. I was faithless once, but
this time I will be true."  She crept softly up-stairs, and
when she came down, an hour later, she was dressed and
ready to depart. She went to the dining-room, where
Florence, in despair, had had a little luncheon-tray brought
in, with sandwiches and biscuits on it.
"My love," she said, " I have finished the preparations
for my journey. Will you permit your servants to bring
down my luggage? Steggall's man is coming immediately
to drive me to the station. Thank you, but I do not need
any refreshment."
" Aunt Anne, I can't bear you to go," poor Florence
said, entreatingly.
"I must go-I cannot stay," the old lady answered,
solemnly; "and I beg you not to ask me to do so again."
"But you will come back ?"
"No, I cannot," Aunt Anne answered, in the same
voice. "You did not mean it, but you cut me to the quick
last night; I have had no sleep since, my love. I must
go away; I want to be alone. Besides, I have private
business to transact. Thank you for all your goodness
and hospitality to me-yours and your dear ones'. It las
been a great privilege to be witl you and the dear chil-
dren since Walter went away, and to come here to see
your second homne."  She sat down for a nmoment by tie
buttery-llatcl, turning a quick, sharp glance as she did so,
to see that it was well closed, for one of her firm beliefs
was that "servants were always ready to listen to the
private speech of their employers."  As she seated her-





<pb n="159"/>AUNT ANNE                  159
self, she looked as if she were trying to practise some of
Mr. Wimple's firmness.
But Florence knelt lovingly by the old lady's side, and
put her pretty head down on the black merino dress. "I
would not be unkind to you for the world," she said; " you
know I would not."  Mrs. Baines winked sorrowfully, Iut
did not falter.
"You were very unkind. You hurt more than I can
say," she said, coldly.
Florence turned her lips towards the old lady's hands
and kissed them. " Aunt Anne, dear," she said, very soft-
ly, "you hlave no money-"
Mrs. Baines stiffened herself, her voice became polite and
distant. "Thank you, my love, but I lhave sufficient to
defray the expenses of my journey, and at the other end I
shall be in a position to meet all demands upon my purse."
"Let mc lend you a little," Florence said, humbly.
"No, my love "-and Mrs. Baincs shook her head; "I
cannot take it."
But Florence tlhought of the ten shillings that consti-
tuted all Aunt Anne's funds, and felt miserable.
" You could pay Ime back," slec pleaded. " And don't
be angry, dear Aunt Anne; but you told me how poor you
were in that lodging last year and how cold-it makes my
heart ache every time I think of it; and the winter and
tle cold are coming again. Ol, do stay here! You shall
do anything in the world that makes you happy! I can-
not bear to think of you in London-and it's unkind of
you to go, for we slall miss you so muchl-the children
and I."  And she burst into tears.
Tlhen Aunt Anne melted.
" Florence," she said, tenderly, " that was like your dear
self."





<pb n="160"/>160                 AUNT ANNE
"Then stay with us. You shall do as you like in all
ways."
"Thank you, my love; bless you for all your goodness.
But I cannot stay. I love you, and I will believe that your
heart feels for me in this great crisis of my life. You must
not think that because I love hiin, I shall love you less-
that would be impossible. But you must allow me to ter-
minate my visit now. I want to be alone-to be in retire-
ment for a little while; besides, I have, as I said just now,
imperative business to transact in town. You must not
ask me to prolong my time here, love."
"Let me, at any rate, be a little useful to you, Aunt
Anne. I know you are not rich."
For a moment Aunt Anne was silent. then she winked
her loft eye very slowly, and looked np.
"Florence," she said, "I know that you always mean
your words, and I slould not like to hurt your generous
heart. I will prove my affection for you by letting you
lend me two sovereigns. Don't ask me to take imre,
my love, for it would be impossible. Tlere-" and site
gave a long sigh as she put the coins into her glove.
"Now I hope you are satisfied. Remember, I only take
them to prove my affection for you. Let me kiss those
dear children "-and, quickly opening the door, she called
them by their nanms, and laughed in an absent, excited
manner as they came running down the stairs. " Coime,
my darlings,' she said, "Aunt Anne is going away, and
wants to say good-by."
"But we don't want you to go," said Monty.
" We don't want you to go at all," echoed Catty.
"You dear children !" she exclaimed, "I must go, but
I shall not forget you; and to-night when you look lun
der your pillows you will find some clhocolates as usual.





<pb n="161"/>AUNT ANNE                  101
I have put them there, ready for you, so that some day
you might remember that, even in the midst of her own
happiness, Aunt Anne thought of you."  she said the last
words almost mechanically, while with one eye she watched
her trukns being carried out, and with the other looked at
the children. Suddenly she turned to Florence, "I should
like to wisl you good-by quite alone; there is something
I must say to you."  She turned quickly and entered tile
drawing-room. The fire lhad burned low, the room had
grown chilly, and Florence shivered a little as she stood
waiting for Aunt Anne to speak. " My dear," tie old lady
said, "will you try not to think nc ungrateful for all your
care of me-for all your solicitude for my happiness? I
know you think that I am in my dotage--"
"Oh no-"
"That I am doing a foolish thing in marrying a man
so much younger than myself; tllat-"
"You must do as you like, Aunt Anne. It is a free
country, after all, and we can all do as we like."
"Yes, my love," Mrs. Baincs answered, witl a sudden
wink which showed that this was a new bit of argument
to her, and one that she would try to use to her own ad-
vantage if she had the opportunity. " We can all do as
we like-as you did when you married your dear Walter;
as I shall when I marry Alfred Wimple-for, as you say,
it is a free country."
"I only hope you may be happy," Florence said,
earnestly.
"Yes, my love," Mrs. Baines said, and her eyes filled
with tears. "I hope so, too, and that I may make him
happy."  She was silent for a minute, and then it seemed
as if what she said were forced from I Jr. "I wanted to
tell you," she began, with a little gasp--"I want you to
11





<pb n="162"/>162                  AUNT ANNE
know something in my past life, so that you may better
understand the reason of what I am doing. When I was
a girl, Florence, a very true love was given to me. I won
it heedlessly, and did not know its value; I played wvitl
it, and threw it away-a fresh young life like Alfred Wim-
ple's. It was in lly power to make him lhappy, but I
made hlin miserable. he was taken ill and died. Some-
times I tljnk that I am answerable to God for the loss of
that life; had I acted differently, it might have been in
the world now. I never had a young love offered to nc
since; I thought that it had been denied me as a pnnish-
ment-for Mr. Baines's youth had gone when I married
him; it was the marriage of his middle age. But, through
all the years, I have not grown old; all thlings that have
youth in them are precious to me. One reason wlly I love
you all-you and Walter and the children-is that I am
young, too, at heart. It is only the lines on my face that
make me look old, and the years I can count that make
me feel so. I am young still in all else."  she stopped
for a moment as if waiting for some response, but Florence
could think of notliing to say; she only looked at the old
lady wonderingly, and put her own hand on the nervous
ones that rested on the chair-back. "I remember the
night of your party," Mrs. Baines went on; "I thought
of the past all the evening whlile I sat there-your guest,
my darling; it came back again and again; it enveloped
me, one year after anotler. I went on to the balcony,
and all my dear ones who had gone gathered round nc
in the darkness. I heard your fresh young voices behind,
but the years had set a mark on me that cut me off from
you, and death had taken most of tllose I remembered,
but left my heart young and longing for love-longing
to live again just as you loved and as you lived. I said





<pb n="163"/>AUNT ANNE                  163
to myself, 'I am old! I am old!' Alfred Wimple was
standing by me and whispered, 'You are not old!' He
was like my dead come back-like the one who had loved
me Nthen I was young; I felt as if through all the years
I had been waiting by a dead man's side, and that now,
perhaps, out of his life that loved me, this other had
grown, or that God had sent him back into the world again
to love me once more and to prove I was forgiven. Do
you understand, Florence? I could not refuse the beau-
tiful life that was laid at my feet; the love that has come
to bless me once more after all the long years. We are
young man and young woman to each other, Florence, and
we love each other with all our hearts. It is like you and
your dear Walter. I wanted to say this to you; I thought
it would help you to understand, to sympathize witl me.
You cannot be sorry that I am going to be less lonely, or
grudge me the love that will make my life happier. That
is all, and now, my darling, I must go-and so, good-by
once more."
Florence could not speak; a lump had come to her
throat.
"God bless you, Aunt Anne!" she said at last, with
something almost like a sob.
"And God bless you, dearest Florence!" the old lady
said, and she kissed her niece's face and stroked her head.
"You know I always admire your hair, my love," she
said, and, pulling Florence forward, she kissed it; then
she went out to tlhe wagonette. Jane held open the door.
" This is for you," Mrs. Baines said, haughtily, and slipped
a half-crown into the servant's hand; "there are some old
slippers in my bedroom-I don't klow if you will deem
them worthy of your acceptance."
" Thank you, ma'am," said Jane, unwillingly.





<pb n="164"/>1G4                  AUNT ANNE
"I trust you will study your mistress's comfort and
interests in every way," Mrs. Baines continued, as she put
a shawl over her knees, "and that you will be good to
those dear children."  The next moment she was on her
way to Witley Station.





<pb n="165"/>CIIAPTICR XIII
PORTSEA PLACE, Connaught Square, is composed of
very small houses, most of which are let out in apart-
rients. It was to one of tlhese that Mrs. Baines drove on
her arrival in town. IHer two canvas-covered boxes, care-
fully corded, were on the top of the cab, her many small
packages piled up inside. Mr. Wimple was not witli her.
Hle had left her at Waterloo Station, but it hadl been
arranged that he was to see her later on in Portsea Place,
and that if she failed to take rooms there she was to leave
a message whlere she was to be found.
" Well, Mrs. IIooper," she said to the landlady, smiling-
ly, but with the condescending air of a patroness, " you
see I have not forgotten you, and if your rooms are still
at liberty I should like to inspect them again."
"Yes, ma'am, certainly; they are at liberty," said Mrs.
IIooper, wllo felt convinced tlat, in spite of the shabby
cloak with a steel clasp, tlhe spare old lady must be some
grand personage in disguise. " I shall be only too glad
if they please you."
Mrs. Baines inspected them carefully. Two little rooms
on the drawing-room floor-a bedroom and a sitting-room.
She looked at the pictures; she winked at herself in tlhe
looking-glass; she gently shook tlhe side-table, to see if it
were rickety. She tried the springs cf the easy-chair, and
tlhe softness of the sofa-cushions. S/e asked if the chim-
ney had been properly swept, and whether there was a
draught fromn the windows.





<pb n="166"/>166                  AUNT ANNE
" I think a guinea a week is an ample rent, Mrs. Hooper,
considering that it is not the season," she said. " How-
ever, I will take the rooms for a week."
"I don't usually let them for so short a time-" tile
landlady began, meekly.
"I might not require them for longer," answered Mrs.
Baines, imperiously; " but I can make them suit my pur-
pose for a week."
" Very well, ma'ali "-and Mrs. Ilooper gave way, over-
awed by Aunt Anne's unflinching manner; "would you
like a fire lighted ?"
"Certainly, and at once; but first, will you be good
enough to have the luggage carried in? And tell the
cabman to wait-lie can drive me to Portman Square.
There will be a gentleman here to dinner to-night."
"I didn't tlink you would want late dinner, ma'amn-
ladies so often have tea and something with it-and com-
pany the first night-" but the landlady stopped, with a
little dismay in her voice, for Mrs. Baines looked dis-
pleased.
"I am accustomed to dining late," she said, distantly,
feeling acutely the superiority of her own class, "and I
have frequent visitors. Cabman, will you put tlose boxes
into the bedroom; and be careful not to knock the walls.
Men are so often careless," she said, witli a smile, to tlhe
landlady that completely subjugated her, "and it is so
very annoying to have one's place injured."
Yes, ma'am, it is," Mrs. Ilooper replied, gratefully;
"if you will give your orders we will get in what you
want for this evening, while you are gone to Portman
Square."  the address had evidently impressed her.
" I must consider for a moment"-and Aunt Anne sat
down and was silent. Then she ordered a little dinner





<pb n="167"/>AUNT ANNE                  167
that she thought would be after the iheart of Mr. Wimple,
and gave many domestic directions, and with, " I trust
to you to make everything exceedingly comfortable, Mrs.
IIooper'," departed in the four-wheeled cab.
Sir William Rammage lived in a big house in Portman
Square. The windows looked dull, the blinds dingy, the
door-step deserted. IIalf the square seemed to hear the
knock which Mrs. Baines gave at the double door. A
servant in an old-fashioned black suit appeared, with an
air of surprise.
"Is Sir William Ralnmage at home?" Mrs. Baines
asked. The man looked her swiftly up and down.
" Yes, ma'am."
"I wish to see him "-and she walked into the wide
stone hall before the servant could prevent her.
"It's quite impossible, ma'am," he said, firmly; "Sir
William keeps his room, and is too ill to see any one."
"You will be good enough to take limn my card," Mrs.
Baines said. "If he is able to do so, you will find that
he will see me."
"I'll take it to Mr. Boughton, ma'am," said the man,
hesitatingly, for he, too, was overcome by the visitor's im-
perious manner; "he has been with Sir William just now,
and will know if it is possible for any one to see him."
" Who is Mr. Boughton ?" she asked, almost tontempt-
uously.
" Ie is Sir William's solicitor."
" Very well, that will do," said Mrs. Baines, and she was
shown into a large, empty dining-room, that looked as grim
and gloomy as the outside of the house had promised that
all should be within. In a few niinutes)ie returned.
Mr. Boughton will be with you, directly, ma'am," lie
said, respectfully.





<pb n="168"/>168                  AUNT ANNE
In five minutes' time there appeared a little dried-up
man, bald and shrewd-looking, but with a kindly expres-
sion in his pinky face.
"Mr. Boughton," Mrs. Baincs said, "I am most glad
to make your acquaintance "-and she shook hands. " Is
it possible to see Sir William Rammage  IIe is my cous-
in, and we have known each other since we were children
together."
" Quite impossible, my dear madam, quite impossible,"
the lawyer answered, briskly.
"Is he very ill?"
"Very seriously ill."
"Dear William !" the old lady said, tearfully, " I feared
it was so. I knew him too well to suppose that he would
leave my letters unanswered had it been otherwise."
" If it is any business matter, madam, I am his confi-
dential lawyer, and have been for thirty years."
"Mr. Bougllton, I am Sir William's own first cousin."
"Indeed !" Mr. Boughlton instantly became interest-
ed.
"Our mothers were sisters," Mrs. Baines went on, witl
deep emotion.
" Dear me, dear me," answered the lawyer, thought-
fully.
"When we were children we were rocked in tlhe same
cradle-"
"Most toucling, I am sure"-lhe appeared to be turn-
ing something over in his mind.
"I know that he has a sincere affection for me, but of
late years he has been so frequently indisposed that he
las not been able to show it as he wished."
"Frequently the case, my dear lady, frequently the
case," Mr. Boughlton said, soothlilgly. " May I ask you





<pb n="169"/>AUNT ANNE                   169
to tell me what other members of his family survive? I
amn a little uncertain in tlhe matter."
"Mr. Bougllton, I amn his mother's sister's child and the
nearest relation he lhas in the world. The others have been
dead and gone these many years. Tlere may be some dis-
tant cousins left, but we have never recognized them."
"I understand," he said, "most interesting. And you
wish to see himn on family business, I presume ?"
"I did," she replied.
"I am sorry to refuse you, my dear lady, but I am
afraid he is too ill to see you."
"I am not rich," Aunt Anne began, and her voice falter-
ed a little," and he promised to make me an allowance."
"He has never done so yet?"
"No," she said, sadly, " le lias had it under considera-
tion. Perliaps he was reflecting what would be an ade-
quate sum to defray my necessary expenses."
"Perlhaps so," Mr. Boughton said, thoughtfully. "If
you will excuse me one moment, I will see if by any possi-
bility my client can see you "-and he left the room.
But in a few minutes he returned.
" It is quite out of the question," he explained-" quite.
I don't wish to distress you, but I fear that our friend is
much too ill to attend to his worldly affairs."
"I have been waiting many months for his decision,"
tlhe old lady said, with a world of pain in her voice; " it
las been most difficult to maintain my position."
"Quite so, quite so, my dear lady, and I feel sure
tlat Sir William would wish this matter to be attended to
without delay. I think I understand you to be tlhe daugli-
ter of his mother's sister-"
"IIis dear mother's sister Iarriet." '
"Quite so"-and Mr. Boughton nodded approvingly.





<pb n="170"/>170                 AUNT ANNE
"Well, my dear lady, suppose I take it upon myself, hav-
ing the management of his affairs for the present, to allow
you just a hundred a year, say, till he is able to settle mat-
ters himself. Would that enable you to await his recov-
ery or-"
A little lump came into Aunt Anne's throat, a slow wink
of satisfaction to her left eye; her voice was unsteady
when she spoke. " Mr. Boughton," she said, " I know Sir
William will be mast grateful to you. My circumstances
must have been the cause of much anxiety to him."
"Tlhen we will consider the matter arranged until he is
in a condition to attend to it himself, or-  By the way,
perhaps you would like to have a check at once?"
" Perlaps it would be advisable," Aunt Anne said, but
she seemed unable to go on. Try to conceal it as she would,
the sudden turn in her fortune was too much for her.
"You must forgive me," she said, gently, sitting down,
"I have had a journey from the country, and I am not so
young as I was years ago."  She looked up witl a little
smile, as if to belie her words.
"Of course," answered Mr. Boughton, feelingly, "age is
a malady we all inherit if we live long enough. Let me
get you a glass of wine; there is some excellent port in
the sideboard"-and in a moment he found a decanter, and
having filled a glass, handed it to her. But she shook her
head, while she looked up at him gratefully.
" You must forgive me," she said; " port-wine is always
pernicious to me."  But he persuaded her to take a little
sip, and then the glass was set down beside her while he
wrote the check.
"You will tell dear William," she said, " when he is
well enough, vith wliat solicitude I think of him. And,
Mr. Boughton, you must permit me to say how much in-





<pb n="171"/>AUNT ANNE                  171
debted I feel to your courtesy and to the consideration
with which you have treated ime."
Five minutes later Mrs. Baines was walking along Port-
man Square feeling like a woman in a dream, or a million-
naire carrying his entire capital. She bought some flowers
to put on the little dinner-table, and two little red candle-
shades, for, with characteristic quickness, she had noticed
the old-fashioned plated candlesticks on the mantelpiece,
and remembered that gas above the table was unbecom-
ing; and then she bought a yard or two of lace to wear
round her throat, feeling a little ashamed, yet happy, while
she did so. She thought of her lover, and looked long-
ingly round the shop, but there was nothing that even she
could inagine would be an acceptable present to a man.
"Welcome, my darling," she said to Alfred Wimple,
when he arrived, an hour or two later. "'This is tlic first
time I have had the hlappiness of receiving you in a place
of my own. I trust our repast will be ready punctually."
" How is Sir William Rainmmage " he asked.
"In a most precarious condition."
"No better ?"
" From what I could gather, Alfred, he must be worse"
-and she winked solemnly.
"Whom did you see ?"
"I saw a solicitor-Mr. Boughton."
"That's my uncle. And he said he was worse?"
"Hle was so ill, Alfred, that Mr. Boughiton even paid
tme my quarter's income out of his own pocket."  A little
smile hovered on Mr. Wimple's face.
" You didn't say anything about me "
"No, my darling, you had desired me not to mention
your name, and that was sufficient." 
"And he paid you out of his own pocket ?"





<pb n="172"/>172                  AUNT ANNE
" Yes, my love; he was most anxious that I should not
he inconvenienced-but our repast is ready. Come "-
and she motioned himi to the place opposite her, and, with
happy dignity, went to the lcead of the table. " I hope
you will do it justice."
Mr. Wimple ate his dinner with much solemnity. IIe
always accepted his food as if it was a responsibility that
demanded his most serious attention. Presently he looked
at her across the dinner-table-at the lace about her throat;
at the little crinkly gold brooch whlicl Florence llad seen
first, years before, at Rottingdean; at the lines and wrinkles
that marked the tender old face; at the tlin wliite liands
with the loose skin and the blue veins-but no expression
came into his dull, full eyes. When the meal was over lie
got up and stood by the fireplace.
"My dear one," she said, "are you tired with the
journey 2"
" No."
"Did you find your rooms quite comfortable and ready
for you ?" she asked, and went over to his side.
"Yes," he answered, with a little gulp peculiar to him.
iHe seemed to be considering something of wlicli he was
uncertain whether to speak or be silent. But he kept his
eyes fixed full upon her.
"Are they in the Gray's Inn Road, dear Alfred ?"
"Near there," he said, and his lips closed. For a
minute he was silent.  Her eyes dropped beneath his
gaze; she seemed to be trembling; and fragile, oh so
fragile! a little gust of wind might lhave swept the slight,
thin form away. He opened his lips to speak, but no
sound came from them.
"You are so thoughtful," she said, gently.  "I have
not vexed you ?"





<pb n="173"/>AUNT ANNE                   17 3
"No"-and there was a long pause. Then he spoke
again.
"Anne," he said, and went a little farther from her, "I
tlink, perhaps, it would be as well if we were married at
once." The tears came into her eyes; her mouth twitched;
tlere was a pause before she found nerve to speak.
" My dear one," she said, " is it really true that all your
hcart is mine, are you sure, dear Alfred ?"
"Yes," he answered, in a voice he tried to make gentle,
but that, oddly enough, sounded half defiant, ' I told you
so last night."
"I know," she answered, "only I have not deserved
such happiness "-and the tears stole down her cheeks. " I
have lived so long alone, my darling; but all my life is
yours, Alfred, all my life, and the truest love that woman
can give I will give you." She clasped her hands wlile slie
spoke; slhe seemed to be making the promise before some
unseen witness to whom she owed account of all her doints.
A week later Alfred Wimple and Mrs. Baines were mar-
ried from the little lodging in Portsea Place. It was a
sensation in Mrs. IIooper's monotonous life. she would
have laughed and made fun of the wedding, but that Aunt
Anne's dignity almost forbade a smile. the old lady
seemed to be in a dream, the beginning of wllicl she
hardly remembered-to be living through tlhe end of a
poem, the first part of which shle had learned in her youth.
IIer poor weak eyes looked soft and loving, and the bright
smile that came and went about her mouth lad something
in it that was patletic rather than ridiculous. She had
conjured a gray wedding-dress from somcewhel and a
gray bonnet to match, but the cold caused her to wrap her-
self round in the big cloak she always wore. She pulled





<pb n="174"/>174                  AUNT ANNE
on her gloves, which were large and ill-fitting, and stood
before the glass, looking at herself, but all the time her
thoughts were straying back to forty years ago. If only
time could be conquered and its cruel hand held back-
if flesh and blood could change as little as sometimes do
tlhe souls they clotlie, how different would be the lives of
men and women. The woman who went down the stairs
was old and wrinkled outwardly, but witlin she was as full
of tenderness as any girl of twenty going forth to meet
her lover. She stepped into the four-wheeled cab alone;
the biting wind swept maliciously over her face; and,
quickly, shie pulled up the window. It was only a little
way to the church. It stood in the middle of an open
space. she started when she caugllt sigllt of it, then
turned away her head for a moment with a strange dread.
IIer courage almost gave way as she stopped before the
deserted doorway. Alfred Wimple heard her arrive and
came to meet lier, with the hesitating, half-doubtful look
that his face always wore when he was with her. There
was no tenderness in his manner; there was something al-
most like shame. But he seemed as one impelled by fate
and unable to turn back. The old lady's heart was full; the
tears came into her eyes. she took his arm, and togetller
they walked up the empty aisle. The two odd people
who had been pressed into service as witnesses came for-
ward; the clergyman appeared; he looked for a moment
at the couple before him, but it was no business of his to
interfere, and slowly he began the service.
A quarter of an hour later Aunt Anne and Alfred
Wimple were man and wife.
" I think we had better walk back," were the first words
lie said to her when they were ontside. His manner was
almost cowering, little enough like a bridegroom.





<pb n="175"/>AUNT ANNE                   1 5
"My darling, don't you think people would guess ?' sle
whispered.
"You need not be afraid. VWe don't look much like a
wedding-party," he answered, grimly.
"No, my love, I fear not. But you do not mind? I
feel, my darling, as if I could not have borne it if there
lad been more signs of our joyousness. It is too sacred-"
" I hope there will be some sunshine at Iastings," lie
said, as if he did not in the least understand what she was
talking about. IIe lad hardly listened to her.
" I hope so, my darling," she answered, gently, " and in
your life, too. I will try and put it there, Alfred."  He
turned and looked at her, with an expression that seemed
half shame and half gratitude.
"It will be warmer at Hastings," he said, as if at a loss
for words. Aunt Anne had arranged a honeymoon trip.
It was she who made all the arrangements, and he who
reluctantly consented to them. They were to go to Ilast-
ings by a late afternoon train, stay tlhere a few days,
and then return to town; but everytling was vague be-
yond. "'It will be better to wait," Wimple said, when
she wanted to settle some sort of hlome. " I must con-
sider my work, Anne. I cannot be tied down. You must
understand that."
There was a little wedding-breakfast set out in the
drawing-room. A cold chicken and a shape of jelly, and
a very small wedding-cake, with some white sugar over it,
put almost shyly on one side. In the middle of the table
was a pint bottle of champagne. The gold foil over the
cork made the one briglt spot in the room, and gave it an
air of festivity. A cheerless meal toughl on a winter's
day, but not for worlds would Aunt Anne have had an
ordinary one on such an occasion. And so they sat down





<pb n="176"/>176                  AUNT ANNE
to their cold chicken and the cllcap, stiff jelly; and Alfred
Wimple opened the clhampagne; and Aunt Anne, quick to
see, noticed that he gave her three quarters of a glass and
drank the rest himself, and she felt that she was married,
indeed.
"Bless you, my dear one, bless you!" she said, as she al-
ways did, when she raised lier glass to lier lips; " and may
our life be a happy one!"
" Tlank you," he answered, solemnly-and then, as if lie
remembered what "jas expected of himi, he drank back to
her.
"Good health, Anne, and good luck to us!" he said.
The meal ended, tlhe things were taken away by Mrs.
IIooper herself, and they were left alone.
Mr. Wimple loitered uneasily round the room.
"I think we must go to IIastings by a later train," lie
said ; " I shall have to get to my chambers presently."
"Must you go to-day ?" she asked, meekly.
"Yes," he answered, "I sha'n't be long, but there are
some things I must see to."
" Couldn't I go witl you, Alfred-in a cab?"
"No "-and his lips locked.
"Are the rooms in thle Gray's Inn Road ?" she asked,
again.
"They are near there," he said, once more; he looked
at her steadfastly, and something in his eyes told her that
he did not mean to give her thle address. For a few mo-
ments there was silence between themn. he stood on thle
hearth-rug by thle fire-slie a few paces from  lini, seem-
ingly lost in tlougllt. Suddenly she looked up.
"Alfred, my darling," she cried, sadly, "you do love
me, do you not? You seem so cold to me to-day-so re-
served and different. I have taken this great step for





<pb n="177"/>AUNT ANNE                   177
you, but you have not said a tender word to me since we
returned from the churcll-yet this is our wedding-day "-
and she stopped.
"I am not well, and it's so cold," ihe said; "and I am
worried about money matters, Annc."
"I will take care of you," she said, and stood up beside
him, "and nurse you and make you strong; I will study
your every wish. If I had millions of money they should
all be yours, my darling; I should like to spread out gold
for your feet to walk on."
"I believe you would," he said, with something like
gratitude in his voice, and he stooped and kissed her fore-
head. Even this meagre sign of affection overcame her;
she put her head, thankfully, down on his shoulder and let
it rest there a minute from slicer weariness and longing.
He put his arms round her and his face touched her head,
as a man caresses his mother. Still, for a moment the
weary old heart found rest.
" You are all my world," she whispered.
"I'm not good enough for you, Anne," he said, un-
easily. Then she raised her head and the bright smile
came back.
"Oh yes," she said, joyfully-" much too good. It shall
be the study of my life to be good enough for you. My
darling," she broke out, suddenly, "I have a wedding-
present for you; you must have thought me very remiss
in not giving you one already."
"I have nothing for you," he answered. But she did
not hear him. She was fumbling in a travelling-bag at
the end of the room. Presently she came back with a
large, old-fashioned gold watch.       |
"This belonged to my brother Jolln, who died," she
said. " I want you to wear it in memory of this day."
12





<pb n="178"/>178                 AUNT ANNE
" It's a very handsome watch," he said; "I never saw it
before-where has it been ?"
She was silent for a moment, and her left eye winked.
"My love," she said, " I had it kept in a place of safety
till I required it "-and he asked no more questions.
IIe put on his great-coat to go out; but he hesitated
by the door, and half reluctantly came back. "Anne,"
he said, "even if we have no money, we ought to be pru-
dent and business-like; I meant to have told you so yes-
terday."
"Yes, my darling," she said, half wonderingly.
"People usually sign their wills on their wedding-day.
You see, I am not strong and may die"-and he looked
at her keenly.
"Yes, my love; or I might die, which would be far
more natural."
"I have made a will, leaving you all I have. How do
you wish to leave anything that you possess ?"
"To you, of course, Alfred-everything I have in the
world."
" I don't wisl to influence you," he said, " but I thought
you might wish to make your will in substance the same
as mine. So, after I left you yesterday, I had them botl
drawn up. They are in my great-coat pocket now; we
might as well get them signed and done with. The land-
lady and the servant will witness them." IIe produced
the two deeds from his pocket, and Mrs. IIooper and the
servant were called.
" Alfred," Aunt Anne said, when they were alone again,
and she had read over tlhe documents, "your name is in my
will, but in yours you only say you 'leave everything to
my wife.'"
"Surely that is sufficient," he said, shortly.





<pb n="179"/>AUNT ANNE                  179
"Of course, dear, for I am "- the voice dropped as al-
most a flush came upon the withered cheek, "your wife
now."
Mr. Wimple put his lips together again, after his favor-
ite manner, and said nothing. She watched him curiously;
a little fear seemed to overtake ler; her hands, half-trem-
bling, sought each other. "Iave I displeased you, Al-
fred," she asked, gently; "my darling, have I displeased
you ?"
"No," he answered, dryly; "but I am not very senti-
mental, Anne. Perhaps you had better remember that"
-and he put the wills carefully into his pocket. "We
will go by the 5:35 train. By the way, you might meet
me at the station "-and he looked at her steadfastly.
"If you do not come back for me I shall not go at all"
-and something like an angry flash came from her eyes.
He hesitated a moment.
"Very well," he answered, "I will come back for you."
She watched him go down the stairs; she listened while lie
opened the street door and closed it, and to his footsteps
growing fainter along the pavement outside. Then she
went back into the little drawing-room and shut herself
in, and put her head down on the lumpy sofa-cushion, and
sobbed with bitter disappointment and the hopelessness
that had suddenly opened itself out beforo her.

<pb n="180"/>CIrAPTER XIV
Six months later. Walter was back in England, better
in health, brown and handsome. Florence was in a seventh
heaven of happiness. Her husband was her very devoted
lover; the children were as good as gold; the little house
near Regent's Park was decorated with all manner of
Indian draperies and bric-d-brac-wllat more could tile
heart of woman desire?
"Really," she said, "it was worth your going away to
know the delight of getting you back again."
"Yes, darling; shall I go away again 2"
"No, you dear stupid! Walter, why doesn't Mr. Fish-
er come and see us; he lias only been once since you
returned, and then he seemed most anxious to go away
again."
"I suppose he was afraid Ethel Dunlop would come in."
"I wish he hadn't fallen in love with her," Florence
said; " I shall always reproach myself about it. But, really,
lie was so good and kind that I half hoped she would
like him."
"A woman under thirty doesn't marry a man because
he is good and kind."
"I can't help thinking it might have been different if
lie had spoken to her," Florence said; "it is so stupid of
a man to write. I wouldn't have accepted you if you had
proposed in a letter."
" Oil, wouldn't you ?" he laughed ; " that was a matter in





<pb n="181"/>AUNT ANNE                   181
which you wouldn't have been allowed to decide for your-
self. One must draw the line somewhere. It is all very
well to let women do as they like in little things; but in
a big one like marrying you, why-"
"Don't talk nonsense," Florence laughed, putting her
hand over his mouth. he kissed it, and jerked back his
head.
"I wonder what Fisher said in his letter, Floggie ?"
"I should think it was very proper and respectful."
"The sort of letter a church-warden or an archbishop
would write. Poor chap! I expect he feels a little sore
about it.
"I wish ho would come here again," Florence said;" lie
was so very kind about taking the house, and I always
liked him."
"I am afraid," Walter said, with a sigh, "lie hasn't
quite forgiven me for putting Winmple on to him. It
really was a ghastly thing for The Centre to get reviews
from other papers palmed off on it as fresh ones. I can't
think, setting aside the lowness of cheating, how Wimple
could be sucll a fool as to suppose that Fisher wouldn't
find out that they had been prigged."
"He was quite taken in at first. I remember his telling
me that Mr. Wimple wrote very well."
" You see, tlose Scotch papers are uncommonly clever.
Iow Wimple expected not to be found out I can't im-
agine. If he had prigged from the Tinbuctoo Journal,
of course he might have escaped. Fisher must have sworn
freely. It made him look such an ass"-and Walter
laughed, in spite of himself.
"Is there a Timbnuctoo Journal ?" Florenciysked, inno-
cently.
" No, you sweet idiot-perhaps there is, though. Should





<pb n="182"/>182                 AUNT ANNE
think it would be interesting. Probably gives an acconnt
of a roast-missionary feast now and then."
"You horrid thing !" said Florence. "I wish Mr. Wim-
ple were in Tirnbuctoo, and that I knew how poor Aunt
Anne was getting on."
"Poor, dear old fool!-we never dreamed what would
come of that introduction, cither, did we?"
"Oh, Walter, I slall never forget what I suffered about
ler at the cottage whlen she told me she was going to
marry Mr. Wimple. And then, after she had vanished,
tlere were the bills at Witley and Guildford. I can't im-
agine what she did with all the things she bought, for she
was only at the cottage a week or so without me."
"Probably she sent them to Wimple at Liphook."
"She could't send him clickens and claret, and cakes
and chocolate, and a dozen other things."
" Oh yes, she could-trust her," laughed Walter. "It
is very odd," he went on, "but I have always had an
idea, somehow, that there was a feminine attraction at
Liphook. If it was the young lady we saw with him
that morning at Waterloo Station, I don't think much of
her. How did you manage to pay all the bills, Floggie
dear? You didn't owe a penny wllen I came back, and
had saved something too-I never knew such a frugal
little woman."
"Steggall's bill was the worst," Florence said, "there
were endless wagonettes."
"Probably she spent her time in slowing Wimple the
beauties of the country. I-ow did you manage to pay
them all, Floggie."
"Lived on an egg one day, and nothing the next."
"That's what a woman always does. A man would
have robbed Peter to pay Paul. You ought to have a





<pb n="183"/>AUNT ANNE                  183
reward. It is too cold at Easter, but if I could get away
for a fortnight this Whlitsuntide we might take a run to
Monte Carlo."
" Monte Carlo makes me think of     Irs. North.  I
should like to see her again; she fascinated me that time
she was here."
"Why didn't you go and see her ?"
"I was not sure that you would like it. There was
evidently something wrong."
He was silent for a few minutes. " Do you know," lie
said, presently, "when there is something wrong with a
woman I tlink it is a reason for going, and not for stay-
ing away.   It's the only chance for setting it right.
What is the use of goodness if it isn't used for the bene-
fit of other people ?"
"Walter," Florence said, and she stood up and clasped
ler hands-" she said nearly the same thing to me that
evening she was here.   There was something almost
desperate in her manner; it has haunted me ever since;
and I should lave gone to see her but that I was afraid
of your being angry."
"What, at your going to see a woman who perhaps
needed your help? If she were up a moral tree, you
might have done her some good."
" I can't bear to think I missed a clance of doing that.
Walter," she added, with a sigh, "sometimes I fear that I
aml very narrow."
" No, dear, you are only a little prim Puritan, and I love
you for it as I love you for everything; so please, Flog-
gie, will you take me to Monte Carlo tils Whitsuntide, or
may I take you ?"
"You are a wicked spendthrift," she laughed-" as
bad as Aunt Anne; I believe it runs in the fa-tlily. What





<pb n="184"/>184                 AUNT ANNE
is to be done with the children while we go to Monte
Carlo ?"
"We'll leave them with the mother-in-law."
"I wish you wouldn't call my mother that horrid name."
"I thought it would make you cross," he laughed. " I
say, I really do wish we knew what had become of the
Wimples."
"I think they must be all right, somehow," Florence
said, "or else-"
"Or else she would have arrived to borrow a five-
pound note. I wonder how Wimple likes it. Well, dar-
ling, I must be off to the office. It's all agreed about
Whitsuntide, then, Fisler permitting."
"Go away," Florence laughed; "go to the office, you
bad person."
"Very well, I will," he said, in a patient voice; "but
I really do wish Aunt Anne would turn up. I want some
more scissors; I lost all those she gave me, and some one
stole the case."
"And Catty broke my little velvet pincushion. It is,
clearly, time that she turned up."
When Walter had gone, Florence thought of Mrs. North
again. "It was rather unkind of me not to be nice to
her, for she was generous to Aunt Anne," she said to her-
self. "I wonder whether I could go and call upon her
now. I might explain that 1 never dared to mention
Madame Celestine's bill."
But she had no time any longer to think of Mrs. North,
for there were the inevitable domestic matters to arrange;
and then Ethel Dunlop came in, full of her engagement
to George Diglhton.
"I always imagined it was merely friendship," Florence
said, tlinking regretfully of the editor.





<pb n="185"/>AUNT ANNE                    185
"Did you ?" said Ethel, brightly. " We tlought so our-
selves for a long time, I believe, but we found out that
we were mistaken. By the way, Florence, you can't think
how good Mr. Fisher has been to us."
"Mr. Fisher ? Well, you don't deserve anything from
him."
"No, I don't. Still, it wasn't my fault that he pro-
posed; I never encouraged himn. Iow droll it was of him
to come and pour out his troubles to you."
"I think it was manly and dignified," Florence said;
"it proved that he wasn't ashamed of wanting to marry
you. Did he write a nice letter, Ethel ?"
" Yes, very, I think."
" IIow did he begin ?"
"IIe began, 'My dear Miss Ethel,' and ended up,
' Yours very faithfully.' "
"I am afraid you did lead him on a little bit."
"Indeed I did not. he asked me to come and see his
mother when she had this house, and he was always here."
" That was very nice of hlim," Florence said; "it shows
tlhat he is very fond of his mother."
" Ohl yes, it was very nice of hlim," Ethel answered,
"and he is very fond of his mother; but I found that lie
generally came a little before I did, and he always saw me
home. I couldn't refuse to let lIim do so, because he
seemed to think it a matter of duty to see that I arrived
safely at my own street door. Middle-aged men always
seem to tliink that a girl must get into misclief the mo-
ment she is left to her own devices."
" How did he know of your engagement ?"
"I wrote and told him. he had been so kind that
I felt it was due to hiim. I told him we should be as
poor as church mice, as George would be in a govern-





<pb n="186"/>186                 AUNT ANNE
ment office all his life, with little to do and less to spend,
after tlhe manner of those officials; and he wrote back
such a nice letter, inquiring into all our affairs and
prospects-you would have thought he was our god-
father, at least."
" Ie does that sort of thing to everybody," Florence
said; "lie is astonishingly kind. IIe always seems to
think he ought to do something for the good of every
one he knows."
" Perhaps he mistakes himself for a minor providence,
and goes about living up to it."
"Oh, Ethel !"
"And then," Ethel went on, altogetlier ignoring the
slightly shocked look on her friend's face, "lhe said that,
perhaps, a word might be put in somewhere and something
done for George. Ile didn't say any more, but I gathered
that cabinet ministers occasionally range themselves round
a newspaper office, seeking whom they may oblige."
"Oh, Ethel !" exclaimed Florence again, "that is/just
your little exaggerated way."
" Well, at any rate, he thinks he can do something, and
he evidently wants to be good to us.,
"IIe seems to delight in doing kind things," Florence
answered; "you know how good he was about Walter."
"He ought to have married Mrs. Baines. he would
have been much better than Alfred Wimple "-witl which
wise remark Ethel went away, full of her own happiness,
and Florence sat down and thought over Mr. Fisher's
generosity.
"IIe is always doing kind things," she said to herself.
"It was he wllo sent Walter to India, and perhaps set
him uip for the rest of his life; and he who gave that hor-
rid Mr. Wimple work, only to find himself cheated and





<pb n="187"/>AUNT ANNE                    187
insulted in return. I can't think what I shall do when-
ever I meet Mr. Wimple." But she swiftly dismissed that
disagreeable person from lher mind, and returned to the
consideration of Mr. Fisher's virtues. "lie is so unself-
isl," she thought. "It isn't every one who would try to
lhelp on the man for whom he had been refused. Yet it
is very odd that, with all his goodness, Mr. Fisher is not
a bit fascinating; I quite understand Ethel's refusing
him. I have an idea that few go out of their way to be
good to him. Some people seem to live in the world to
give out kindness, and others only to take it in."  The
reflection felt like a self-reproach. She did so little for
others herself, and yet she was always longing to do more
in life than merely to take her own share of its enjoy-
ment. She wanted most to help Aunt Anne; she longed
to see her, to comfort and soothe her, and perhaps to lend
her a little money.  she felt convinced that Aunt Anne
must want some money by this time, and that she was
miserable with Mr. Wimple. "I am so afraid he isn't
kind to her," she said to herself; "I am certain he hasn't
married her for love-tlhere is some horrid reason that
we are not clever enough to guess. I only wish she had
never left Mrs. North; she was so happy there, and looked
so grand driving about and giving presents; and perhaps
if she had stayed she might, eventually, lhave been able
to pay for them."   Then, almost against her lvill, Mrs.
North's face was before her again. She could see it quite
plainly, lovely and restless, but with a sad look in tlhe blue
eyes that was like an appeal for kindness. "I feel as if
there were an aching ing i er heart for something she hlas
missed in life. But perlaps that is nonsense, or it is only
tlat I don't understand her-we are so different. I have
lialf a mind to go and call on her. I wonder if she would
care to see nc 2"





<pb n="188"/>188                 AUNT ANNE
Some more hesitation, some curiosity and kindly feel-
ing, and then Florence put on lier prim little bonnet and
her best furs, for she remembered Mrs. North's magnif-
icent array and felt that it would not do to look shabby.
She took the train from Portland Road to South Kensing-
ton, and walked slowly to Cornwall Gardens.
"I won't leave Walter's card," she thought, "or any
cards at all if she is out; for, though I am glad to go and
see lher, I don't want to be on visiting terms."
But Mrs. North was at home, and Florence was shown
into a gorgeous drawing-room, all over draperies, and bits
of cofor, and tall palms, and pots of lovely flowers. In
tle midst of them sat Mrs. North, a little lonely figure
by a piled-up wood fire, for the early Spring day was
cold and dreary. she rose as her visitor entered, and
came just a step forward. She was lovelier than ever.
With a cry of joyful surprise, she lheld out her lhands to
Florence.
"You!" she exclaimed. "Olh, Mr//IIibbert, I never
thought you would come and see nc at all; but now-
oh, it is good of you ! Did you think how glad I should
be?"
"I didn't know whether you would care to see me or
not," Florence said, surprised at her deliglt.
"Care?" Mrs. North almost gasped, and Florence fan-
cied that her lip quivered; "indeed I do, only no one-
won't you sit down ?"-and she made a cosey corner on a
low couch, with a pile of soft, silk-covered cushions.
"I was so sorry not to be alle to come and see you last
year-"
"I quite understand," Mrs. North said, and the color
rushed to her face. "I did not expect it."
"You vere so kind about Madame Celestine"- Flor-





<pb n="189"/>AUNT ANNE                   189
cnce went on, thinking that she, too, would have a heap
of down cushions in her drawing-room, and not noticing
Mrs. North's confusion-"and about all those dreadful
bills."
"Yes, I remember. then you did not stay away on
purpose ?"  Mrs. North leaned forward while she asked,
and waited breathlessly for the answer.
" Why, of course not."  Then a happy look came over
the girlish face.
"And did you come now to tell me about Mrs. Baines ?
I should love to hear about her. Of course I knew she
would not write. Was she very angry at my paying the
bill ?"
" Well, no-" and Florence hesitated.
"Do tell me. I don't in the least mind if she was.
Iow furious she would be with me now, and how she
would gather her scanty skirts and pass me by in scorn-
ful silence."  Mrs. North laughed, an almost shrill laugh
that seemed to be born of sorrow and pain. she was very
strange, Florence thought, and her manner was oddly al-
tered. "Do tell me," she asked again-" was she very
angry ?"
"I am ashamed to say that she never knew you hlad
paid it."
" You were afraid to tell her ?"
" I never had a good opportunity."
" It doesn't matter a bit. It saved her from being wor-
ried, poor thing!-that was the chief point. So long as a
thing is done, it doesn't matter who does it-unless it's a
bad thing. It matters then very mucll-especially to the
person who does it," Mrs. North added, witl a little bitter
lalugl. " The pain of it-" she stopped again, and went on
suddenly," Tell me mlore about Mrs. Baines. Where is she ?"





<pb n="190"/>190                 AUNT ANNE
"I don't know."
" ave you not seen her lately ?"
" Not for a long time."
" But what lias become of her ?"
Florence hesitated again. "I cannot tell you."
"Dear lady !" said Mrs. North, her face merry with sud-
den fun. "You have not quarrelled witl her? A Ma-
donna doesn't quarrel, surely? Ol, how rude I am-but
you will forgive me, won't you ?" She got up from the
other end of the couch and rang the bell. "Bring some
tea," she said to the servant, "and quickly."
"Don't have tea for me, please-" Florence began.
"Oh yes, yes," Mrs. North said, entreatingly. "I feel,
dear Mrs. Hibbert, that we are going to talk scandal-
therefore we must have tea, I have had enough scandal
lately," she added, witl a sigl, "but still when it isn't
about one's self it is so exhilarating, as Mrs. Baincs would 
have said; now, please, go on."
' Go on with whallt ?"
Mrs. North pulled out her little perfumed lace hand-
kerchief and twirled it into a ball in her ,xcitement.
"About Mrs. Baines. There is some exciting news-I 
know it; I feel it in the air, Ah, here's the tea! I will
pour it out first, and then, while we drink it, you must tell
me all about ler. Some sugar and creamr?-there, now
we look more cosey. Where is the old lady? What have
you done with her ? You have not locked her up ?" she
asked, demurely.
"No," laughed Florence, thinking how good the tea
was, and how pretty were the cups and the little twisted  A
silver spoons. " I have not locked her up."
"And you have really not quarrelled with her?" "
" No," answered Florence, a little doubtfully. "Though





<pb n="191"/>AUNT ANNE                   191
I sometimes fear that she is angry with me for what she
called my lack of sympatlhy. Rally, Mrs. North, I don't
know how to tell you; but the fact is, she is married
again."
"No, no?" cried Mrs. North. "Oh, it's too lovely!
And who is the dear old gentleman ?"
"It's a young one," Florence laughed, for she could
not help being amused. "I don't know if you ever saw
hlin-Mr. Wimple ?" Mrs. North rocked to and fro, with
wicked delight, till tlhe last two words came; then she
grew quite grave.
" Oh, but I am sorry," she said, "for I have seen him;
and he didn't look nice; he looked-rather horrid."
"I am afraid he did," Florence answered, regretfully.
"Do tell me all about it"--but the only account that
Florence was able to give did not satisfy Mrs. North.
"You must have seen sometlling of the love-making be-
forehand ?" she said.
"I am afraid I saw nothing of that either," Florence ex-
plained, " for I was in London, and she was at the cottage."
"I thought she liked him when she was here," Mrs.
North said; "but, of conrse, I never dreamed of her be-
ing in love with him. She used to meet himn and go to
contemplate the Albert Memorial.  Sometimes, when I
was out alone, I drove by them; but I pretended to be
blind, for I did not want to invite him ihere-lhe was so
unattractive.  Ile called once, but I did not encourage
him to come again. I would give anything to see them
together. If I knew where she lived, I would brave every-
thing, and call upon her, though she probably wouldn't let
ime in."
Tlhen Florence began to be a little puzzled. What did
Mrs. North mean    IIad she done anything-anything





<pb n="192"/>192                  AUNT ANNE
bad?   Almost without knowing it she looked up and
asked, "Is Mr. North quite well?"  the color flew to
Mrs. North's face again.
"Oh yes, I suppose so," slhe answered, coldly. " Natur-
ally I don't inquire after his health."
"You lad had a telegram last time I saw you-"
"I remember-" it was said bitterly. "I wondered
why he was coming so suddenly."
"I thought perhaps he was at home still ?'
"At home?    IIe may be. I don't know where he is.
I have not the least idea. It is no concern of mine."
"Thln lhe did not return after all?" Florence said, be-
wildered. Mrs. North looked at her for a nmoment in si-
lence. Then she got up and stood leaning against the
mantelpiece, whicl was covered witl flowers and bric-ti
brac.
" Mrs. IIibbert," she said, and it seemed as if her lips
moved reluctantly, but she showed no other sign of emlo-
tion-" you know what has happened to me, do you not "
"No," answered Florence, breathlessly, and she stood
up, too. Mrs. North glanced quiekly at the door, almost
as if she expected to see/her visitor flee towards it.
"Mr. North divorcel mne," she said, very slowly.
"I didn't know," Florence answered, and began to put
on her glove.
"I thought you didn't," and there came a bitter little
laugl. " I knew you didn't; and yet, deep down in the
bottommost corner of my heart, I hopcd you did."
" You must forgive me for saying that, if I had, I shpuld
not have come, though I am very, very sorry for you."
"As a judge is when he sends a prisoner into solitary
confinement, or to be hanged, and turns away to his own
comfortable life?"  Florence buttoned her glove. "And





<pb n="193"/>AUNT ANNE                  193
you will never come and see me again, of course?" she
added, with another little burst.
"I do not think I can," Florence said, gently.
"I don't want you," Mrs. North answered, quickly,
while her checks burned a deeper and deeper red. "It
was only a test question."
"I am very sorry for you," Florence said again, "very,
very. You are so young; and you seem to have no one
belonging to you. But there are some things that are im-
possible, if-"
"Oh, I know," burst out Mrs. North again; "I know.
My God! and this is a Christian country-yes, wait," she
said, for she fancied Florence was going. "I know you
are kind and gentle, and you are-good," she added, al-
most as an after-thought; " and you and the women like
you try very hard to keep your goodness close among
yourselves, and never to let one scrap of it touch women
like me. Tell me," she asked-" did you marry the man
you loved best in the world?"
"Yes," Florence answered, unwillingly, afraid of being
dragged into an argument.
"Then you have never known any temptation to do
wrong. Where does the merit of doing right come in ?"
"I would rather not discuss it," Florence said, gently
but coldly.
Oil, but let me speak-not for my own sake, for I shall
be strong enough to make some sort of life for myself
after a time; but for the sake of other women who may
be in my position and judged as you judge me. My
mother died when I was sixteen; when I was eighteen I
was persuaded to marry a man old enough to be my father.
After a time he grew tired of me. I suppose I wasn't
much of a companion to him. He went abroad and left
13





<pb n="194"/>194                 AUNT ANNE
me alone, again and again. At first my sister was with
me; she married and went away. Mrs. Baines came a
little while before that-" she stopped, as if unable to
go on without some encouragement.
"Yes?" Florence said, listening almost against her will.
"And I was young and inexperienced. Iow could I
know the danger in so many things that amused me ? At
last I fell in love; I had been so lonely, I was so tired,
and I had never loved any one in my whole life before."
"But you knew that it was wrong. You were mar-
ried."
' "Ohi yes, but the paths of virtue had been deadly dull,
and trodden with a man I did not love and whom I had
been made to marry. The man I loved was young and
handsome, and a soldier. The rest of the story was natu-
ral, even if it was wicked."
"And then ?" asked Florence, wonderingly.
"Then my husband came back, and there were the
usual details. IHe heard something that sent him flying
home to look after his honor. Ile had forgotten to look
after mine-or my happiness."
"And the man ?"
"He had gone to India with his regiment. IIe tele-
graphed over, 'No defence,' and that was the end of it."
"I hope he will come back and make you reparation."
"IIe has not written me a line," Mrs. North said, and
the tears came into her tJ.s for a moment-" not a word,
not a sign.  Perhaps he is dead-India is a country that
swallows up many histories; or, perhaps," she added, des-
perately, "lie, too, despises me now. People flee from me
as if I had the plague," she added, with the bitter laugh'
again. " Oh, there are no people in the world who en-
courage wickedness as do the strictly virtuous."





<pb n="195"/>AUNT ANNE                  195
"Don't say that," Florence answered, "for, indeed, it
is not true."
" But it is," Mrs. North said, eagerly. "I have proved
it: once do wrong, and men and women seem to combine
to prevent you from ever doing right again. You can't
make a Magdalen of ine"-and she held out her hands.
"I am young; I am a girl still; you can't expect me to
go in sackcloth and ashes all my life-and that in solitude.
I want to be happy; I am hungry for happiness."
"I hope yot will get some still, but-"
"How can I   Men shun me, unless they want to make
me worse; and women fly from me, as if they feared their
own respectability would vanish at the mere sight of me.
It seems to be made of brittle stuff."
"It is not that," Florence interrupted-" but a differ-
ence must be made; there must be some punishment-
something done to prevent-"
"That is why so many women go on doing wrong,"
Mrs. North continued, as if she had not heard the inter-
ruption; " they cannot bear the treatment of that portion
of the world which has remained unspotted or unfound-
out. Oh, the cruelty of good women! I sometimes think
that it is only the people who have sinned or who have
suffered who really know ]how to feel."
"That is not true-" Florence began, but still Mrs.
North did not heed her.
"Do you know," she said, speaking under her breath,
"I am so sorry for women now that I believe I could
kneel down beside a wicked, drunken creature in a gutter,
and kiss her, and bring her back, and be tender to her in
the hope of making her better. For I understand not
only the sin, but the pain and the misery, and the good
people, and all else that have driven her there."





<pb n="196"/>196                 AUNT ANNE
"But some difference must be made-you cannot ex-
pect to be received as if people thought you now what
they thought you once ?"
"I know that," Mrs. North said, scornfully. "People
can't ask me to their parties. I don't want to go to them.
They may not want me for the friend of their daughters,
though I should not harin them-" and she burst into
tears.
"It isn't possible," Florence said, helplessly.
"But need men and women flee from me as if I were a
leper? People who have known me for years, and might
make me better, women especially, who might make me
a little happier and ashamed of having done wrong. But
no-no-they gather their skirts and do not see me as they
pass, though a year ago they crowded here. They are wait-
ign to hear that I am dead or have grown wickeder still.
They would feel a sort of pleasure in hearing it, and feel
glad they did not risk their spotless reputations by trying
to prevent it."
"I think you must let me go away," Florence said,
gently, determined to end the interview.
" Oh yes, you had better go !"-and Mrs. North put the
backs of her hands against her flushed cheeks to cool
them. "My tea has not poisoned you, and I have not
'contaminated you,' as Mrs. Baines would say. If you
ever think of me in tPplmidst of your own successful life,
believe this, that if I had had all that you have had, I
might have been as good as you-who knows ? As it is, I
have my choice between isolation with a few breaths of
occasional scorn, or the going farther along a road on
which, no doubt, you think I am well started."
"Please let me go," Florence said, gently, almost carried
away by Mrs. North's beauty when she looked up at her





<pb n="197"/>AUNT ANNE                   197
face, but feeling that slic ought to stand by the principles
that had been almost a religion to her. "This has been
so painful, I am sure you must want to be alone."
"Oh yes, it has been painful enough, but it has been
most instructive also," Mrs. North said, and then she add-
ed, gently, "I think I would rather you go now. Yes,
please go," she entreated, suddenly, while a sob choked
her, and she dabbed her tears with her little lace hand-
kerchief, vainly struggling to laugh again.
"I think it would be better," Florence said; "but per-
haps some day, if I may-I will-"  She stopped, for she
felt that she ought to consult her husband before she
promised to come again.
"Oh yes, I understand," Mrs. Nortl said; "you will
come again if you can; but if you don't, it will only in-
crease my respect for goodness. I shall think how pre-
cious it is, how valuable-it has to be guarded like the
Kohinoor. Good-by, Mrs. Iibbert, good-by."  Slhe rang
the bell and bowed almost haughtily, so that Florence felt
herself dismissed.
"Good-by," the latter said, and slowly turned from the
room. Somehow she knew that Mrs. North watched her
until the door had half closed, and then threw herself, a
little miserable heap, among the silk cushions. But she
was half-way down the stairs before she realized this, and
then the servant was waiting to show her out.
" Oh, I was cold and cruel," she thought, when the street
door had closed behind her, "but I could not help it;
there is no sin in the world that seems so awful as that
one."





<pb n="198"/>CHAPTER XV
"I CAN understand what you felt," Walter said, when
lie heard of Florence's interview with Mrs. North; "still,
I wish we could do something for her."
"It has made me miserable; but I don't quite see wlat
we can do. We can't invite her here-whlo would come
to meet her? As for my going to see her again, I would
go willingly if I thought I should do her any good; but I
don't think she would care about seeing me. She im-
agines I am good and disagreeable."
"Poor Floggie ! Perhaps you might write her a little
letter, and then let it drop."
" I'll wait till I hear some news about Aunt Anne; tlen
I will write, and try and make my letter rather nice."
This excuse was soon given her.
Mrs. Burnett, Mr. Fisher's Witley friend, called to see
Florence one afternoon.
"I thought perlaps you would come for a drive with
me," she said; "it is lovely in the Park to-day--such
beautiful sunshine."
"It would be delightful.:'  Florence answered, for she
always liked Mrs. Burnett; "but I am afraid I must go
to tea with a cousin in Kensington Gore. I promised to
meet Walter there, and go for a walk afterwards."
"Let me take you there, at any rate ?"
' That would be very kind," Florence said, and in five
minutes they were on their way.





<pb n="199"/>AUNT ANNE                   199
"Have you seen Mr. Fisher lately ?" Mrs. Burnett
asked, as they drove across the l'ark.
"I saw him two or tlrec weeks ago."
"He has grown very grave and silent. I have an idea
that he fell in love with a rather handsome girl who used
to come and see his mother. I tlink she was a friend of
yours, Mrs. Hibbert."
" le doesn't look like a man to fall in love," Florence
said, trying not to betray Mr. Fisher's confidence.
" 01, but you never know what is going on inside peo-
ple-their feelings are so often at variance with their ap-
pearance.  My husband said once that he sometimes
thought that people drew lots for their souls, for they
so seldolm matched with their bodies."
"Perhaps they do, and for their hearts as well. It
would account for the strange capacity some people
have for loving, though you have only to look at them
to see it is hopeless that they should be loved back
again."
"I know, and it is terrible that love should so often
depend, as it does, on the chance arrangement of a little
flesh and blood-for that is what beauty amounts to."
"Ohl, but we don't always love beauty."
"No, not always," Mrs. Burnett answered; "but tle
shape of a face, for instance, will sonetilmefprevent our
love going to a very beautiful soul."
"And a few years and wrinkles will make love ridicu-
lous or impossible," Florence said, tlinking of Aunt Anne.
-Oddly enough, Mrs. Burnett-evidently thought of her too,
for she asked,
"Ias your aunt been at the cottage at Witley late-
ly ?"
"No," answered Florence; but she did not want to dis-





<pb n="200"/>200                 AUNT ANNE
cuss Aunt Anne. "My children so often remember the
donkey-cart," she said; "it was a great joy to them."
"Oh, I'm very glad. Wh len you go to Witley again, I
hope you will use the pony."
" What has become of the donkey?"
"We were obliged to sell it. It would not go at all
at last. We are not going to Witley ourselves till July;
so, meanwhile, I hope you will use the pony.  Only,
dear Mrs. Ilibbert, you won't let him go too fast uphill,
for it spoils his breath; and we never let him gallop
downhill, for fear of his precious knees."
"I will be very careful," Florence said, rather amused.
"I'm afraid we don't let him go too fast, even on level
ground," Mrs. Burnett laughed; "for lie's a dear little
pony, and we should be so grieved if he came to any
harm."
"Perhaps he would be safer always standing still,"
Florence laughed back.
"Oh, but he might catch cold then; but do remember,
dear Mrs. Ilibbert, when you are going to Witley, that
you have only to send a card the night before to the
gardener, and he will meet you at the station."
"Thank you, only I should be rather afraid to use him
for fear of accidents."
"O11, but you needn't be; and we are so glad to have
him exercised. Perhaps Mrs. Baines would like to drive
him? Why, we are at Kensington Gore already. It has
been delightful to have you for this little drive. Good-
by, dear Mrs. Hibbert."
Walter was waiting for Florence at her cousin's. He
gave her a sign not to stay too long.
"We so seldom get a walk together," he said, when
they were outside, "that it seemed a pity to waste our





<pb n="201"/>AUNT ANNE                   201
time under a roof. Let us get inside the Park;" and they
crossed over.
"How lovely it is," Florence said, "with the tender
green coming out on the trees. The brown boughs look
as if they were sprinkled with it. And what a number of
people are out. The Park is beginning to have quite a
season-like look."
"Do you remember how Aunt Anne used to come
here and contemplate the Albert Memorial?" Walter
asked. "By the way, Fisher was talking of Wimple to-
day; le is very sore about him."
"It was very vexing; I wish we had never seen him,
don't you?"
"What, Wimple?    I should think so! I asked Fisher
if he knew the fellow's address; he says the last time
he heard of iln he was somewhere near the Gray's Inn
Road. I wonder if she was with him."
" Walter !" exclaimed Florence, and she almost clutched
his arm, " I believe she is over there. Perhaps that is why
she has been running in our thoughts all day."
A little distance off, on a bench under a tree, sat a spare
black figure, with what looked like a cashmere shawl
pulled round the slight shoulders. Limp and sad enough
the figure looked. Tlere was an exprlsion of loneliness
in every line of it.
" It is very like her," Walter said. They went a little
nearer; they were almost beside her; but they could not
see her face, which was turned away from them.
"Oh, it must be she," Florence said, in a whisper.
Perhaps she heard their footsteps, for the black bonnet
turned slowly round, and, sure enough, there was the face
of Aunt Anne. Thin and sad and woe-begone enough it
looked.





<pb n="202"/>202                 AUNT ANNE
"Aunt Anne! Dear Aunt Anne! Why have you
left us all this time without a sign ." and Florence put
her arms round the thin form.
"Aunt Anne! Why, this is good luck," Walter ex-
claimed.
"My dear Florence, my dear Walter," the old lady
said, looking at them with a half-dazed manner; "bless
you, dear children; it does me good to see you."
"You don't deserve it, you know," said Walter, tender-
ly, "for cutting us." 
"It wasn't my fault, dear Walter," she answered; "you
and Florence and the dear clildren have been constantly
in my thoughts; but we have had many unavoidable anx-
ieties since our marriage; besides, I was not sure that you
desired to see me again."
"Why, of course I did. But you don't deserve to see
us again after leaving us alone all this long time. Where
is Wimple ?"
" le is at Liphook," she answered. "Ice is not strong,
and finds the air beneficial to him." 
"It was always beneficial to him," Walter said, dry-
ly.
"He ought not to leave you alone, dear Aunt Anne;
you don't look well," I lorence said.
"I am very frail, my love, but that is all. London air
is never detrimental to me, as it is to Alfred. IIe finds
that Lipllook invigorates him, and he frequently goes
there for two or three days; but, as our means are not
adequate to defray the expenses of much travelling, I
remain in town. Walter," she asked, looking up with
a touch of her old mapner, "did you enjoy your visit to 
India? I hope you have most pleasant recollections of
your journey."
!





<pb n="203"/>AUNT ANNE                  203
"I'll tell you what, Floggic dear," Walter said, not an-
vering Aunt Anne's question-" we'll take her back with
us at once."
" 01 no, my love," the old lady began; "it is impossi-
ble-"
" How can it be impossible?" Florence said, gayly; " you
are evidently all alone in London; so we'll run away witl
you. The children are longing to see you, and I want to
show you all the tllingsWalter brought from India. There
is a little ivory elephant for you."
" It was just like him to think of me," the old lady said,
with a flicker of the old brightness; but in a moment her
sadness returned, and Walter noticed that there was al-
most a coved expression on her face. It went to his
heart, and gave him a mighty longing to thrash Wim-
ple.
"You must come at once," he said, putting on an author-
itative manner; " then you can tell us all your news, and
we will tell you all ours. There, put your arm in mine,
and Florence shall go the other side to see you don't es-
cape."
"He is just the same. He makes me think of his dear
father," she said, as she walked between them ; "and of
that happy day at Brighton, years and years ago now,
when I met you both on the pier. Do you nemember, my
dear ones ?"
"Of course we do !" said Walter; "and how victorious-
ly you carried us off then, just as we are carrying you off
now."
" 01l, lie's just the same," the old lady repeated.
'"Here's a four-wheeler," Walter said, as he stopped
one. " This is quite an adventure; only," he added, gen-
tly, "you don't look up to much."





<pb n="204"/>204                 AUNT ANNE
"I shall be better soon," she said, and dropped into
silence again.  She looked, almost vacantly, out of the
window as they went along, and they were afraid to
ask her questions, for, instinctively, they felt that things
had not gone well with her. Presently she turned to
Florence. "Did you say the children were at home, my
love ?"
"Yes, dear."  The old lady looked out of the iwin-
dow at the green trees in the Park, and almost furtive-
ly at the shops in Oxford Street. Then she turned to
Florence.
"My love," she said, "I must take those dear chil-
dren a little present. Would you permit the cabman
to stop at a sweetmeat-shop? We shall reach one in a
moment."
"Oh, please don't trouble about them, dear Aunt
Anne."
"I shouldn't like them to think I had forgotten them,
my love," she pleaded.
"No, and they sha'n't think it," Walter said, patting
her hand. " Hi! stop, cabby. Stay in the cab; I'll go
and get something for them." In a few minutes he re-
appeared with two boxes of chocolates. "I think that's
the sort of tiling," he said. She looked at them carefully,
opened them, and examirlJ the name of the maker.
"You have selected them most judiciously, dear Wal-
ter," she answered.
"That's all right. Now we'll go on."  She looked at
the boxes once more and put them down, satisfied.
"It was just like you, to save me the fatigue of getting
out of the cab," she said to her nephew. "I hope the
children will like them' they were always most partial to
chocolates. You must remind me to reimburse you for





<pb n="205"/>AUNT ANNE                  205
them presently, my dear." And once more she turned to
the window.
"Aunt Anne, are you looking for any one ?" Walter
asked, presently.
"No, my love, but I thought the cabman was going
through Portman Square, and that he would pass Sir
William Rammae's house."
"That worthy was at Cannes the other day, I saw."
"He is there till next month," she explained, and then
they were all silent until they reached the end of their
journey. It was impossible to talk much to Aunt Anne;
it seemed to interrupt her thoughts. Silence seemed to
have become a habit to her, just as it had to Alfred Wim-
ple. She was a little excited when they stopped at the
house, and lingered before the entrance for a moment.
Almost sadly she looked up at the balcony on which she
had sat with Alfred Wimple, and slowly her left eye
winked, as if many things had happened since that happy
night of which only she had a knowledge.
They sat her down in an easy-clair, and gave her tea,
and made much of her, and asked no questions--only
showed their delight at having her with them again.
Gradually the tender old face looked happier, the sad
lines about the month softened, and once there was quite
a merry note in her voice, as she laughed and said,
"You dear children, you are just the same."  Then
Catty and Monty were brought in, and she kised them,
and patronized them, and gave them their chocolates,
and duly sent them away again, just as she always used
to do.
"I began to work a little hood for Catty," she said,
"but I never finished it; it was not that I was dilatory,
but that my eyes are not as good as they were."  She





<pb n="206"/>206                  AUNT ANNE
said the last words sadly, and Florence, looking up quick-
ly, wondered if they were dimmed front weeping.
"Poor Aunt Anne!" she said, soothingly; "but you
are not as lonely as formerly?"
"No, my love, only Alfred has a great deal of work to
do. It keeps him constantly at his chambers; and his
health not being good, he is obliged to go out of town
very often, so that, unwillingly "-and she winked sadly
-" he is much away from me."
"What work is he doing ?" Walter asked.
"My dear," she said, witli gentle dignity, "you must
forgive me for not answering that question, but I feel
that he would not approve of my discussing his private
affairs."
"Have you comfortable rooms in town?" Florence
asked, in order to change the subject.
"No, my love, they are not very comfortable, but we
are not in a pecuniary position to pay a large rent."  She
paused for a moment, and her face became grave and set.
Florence, watching her, fancied that there was a little
quiver to the upper lip.
" Aunt Anne, dear Aunt Anne, I am certain you are
not very happy-jell us what it is. We love you. Do
tell us-is anything the matter ? Is Mr. Wimple kind to
you? Are you poor ?"
" Yes, do tell us!" Walter said, and put his arm round
her thin shoulder, and gave it a little affectionate caress.
She hesitated for a moment. "My dears," she said,
gratefully, but a little distantly, " Alfred is very kind to
me, but he is very much tried by our circumstances. He
is 'hot strong, and he is obliged to be separated from me
very often. It causes him much regret, although he is
too unselfish to show it."





<pb n="207"/>AUNT ANNE                  207
"But you ought not to be so very poor, if Mr. Wimple
has lots of work," Walter said.
"I fear it is not very profitable work, dear Walter, and
though I have an allowance from Sir William Rammage,
it does not defray all our expenses"-and she was silent.
Walter and Florence were silent, too.  They could not
help it, for Aunt Anne had grown so grave, and she
seemed to lose herself in her thoughts. Only once did
she refer to the past.
"Walter, dear," she asked, " did you find my little gifts
useful when you were away?"  Aunt Anne always used
to inquire after the wear and tear of her presents.
"Indeed I did," he answered, heartily. "I was speak-
ing of them only to-day-wasn't I, Floggie?"  But lie
concealed the fact that all the scissors were lost, lest she
should want to give him some more.
"Aunt Anne," Florence asked, "isn't tlere anything
we could do for you ? You don't look very well."
"The spring is so trying, my love," the old lady said,
gently.
"I expect you want a change quite as much as Mr.
Wimple."
" Oh no, my love. I lave been a little annoyed by my
landlady, who was impertinent to Inc this morning. It
depresses me to have a liberty taken with me."  Perhaps
the rent was not paid, Florence thought, but she did not
dare to ask. Aunt Anne shivered anul pulled her shawl
round her again, and explained that she had not put on
her warm cloak, as it was so sunny and bright, and the
people in the Park might have observed that it was shab-
by; and while she was talking a really brilliant idea came
to Walter.
"Aunt Anne," he exclaimed, "why should not you





<pb n="208"/>208                 AUNT fANNE
and Wimple go to our cottage at Witlcy for a bit ? Oh!
but I forgot-he stays with friends at Liphook, doesn't
he "
"No, my love, he lodges with an old retainer."
"Oh," said Walter, shortly, remembering a different
account that Wimple had given him the year before, on
the memorable morning when they met in the Strand.
"I think it would be an excellent tiling, if you and lie
went to our cottage. It is standing empty; we don't
want it just yet, and there you could be together." Aunt
Anne looked up with keen interest.
"Yes, why not?" exclaimed Florence. "I wish you
would. You would be quite happy there."
"My love," said the old lady eagerly, "it would be de-
lightful. But I'm afraid there are reasons that render it
impossible for ne to accept your kindness."
"What reasons ?-do speak out," Florence said, entreat-
ingly, " because, perhaps, we can smooth them away."
"Florence," said the old lady, "I must be frank with
you. I am indebted to some of the tradespeople there,
and I am not ir-n position to pay their bills."
"They are all paid," Walter said, joyfully-"so don't
trouble about them; and moreover, we told them that
they were never to give us any credit, so I am afraid they
won't give you any next time, any more than they will us,
but you won't mind that."
"And then, my love," the old lady went on, to Florence,
"I have no servants."
"I can arrange tlat," said Florence. "I can telegraph
to Jane Mitchell, the postman's sister, who always comes
in and does for us when we go alone, from Saturday
to Monday, and take no servant. Do go, Aunt Anne;
it will do you a world of good. I shall take you back





<pb n="209"/>AUNT ANNE                  209
to your lodgings, and get you ready, and send you off
to-morrow  morning."  Aunt Anne stood up, excited-
ly.
"My dears," she said, " I will bless you for sending me.
I can't ',ear this separation. I want to be with him, and
lie wants me-I know he does; it makes him cross and
irritable to be away from me."  There was almost a wild
look in her eyes. They were astonished at her vehemence.
But suddenly she seemed to remember something, and all
her excitement subsided. "I cannot go until Sir William
Rammage returns to town, or his solicitor does.  My
quarter's allowance is not due for some weeks, and un-
fortunately-"
" We'll make that all right, Aunt Anne; leave it to us,"
said Walter. "Florence will come round in the morning
and carry you off, and Wimple will be quite astonished
when you send for him."  Aunt Anne looked up, almost
gayly.
" Yes, my love, he will be quite astonisled. You have
made me happy," she added, witl almost a sob; "bless
you for all your goodness. Now, my dear ones, you
must permit me to depart, I shall have so many arrange-
ments to make this evening. Bless you for all your kind-
ness."
"I am going to take you back in a hansom," said
Walter. And in a few minutes they were driving to the
address she had given, a florist's shlo\in a street off the
Edgeware Road.
"I think her rooms were on the top floor," Walter said
to Florence, when he returned, " for she looked up at the
windows with a mournful air when we arrived.   The
house seemed neglected, and the shop had a dead-and-gone
air; nothing in it but some decayed plants and a few stray
14





<pb n="210"/>210                 AUNT ANNE
slugs. It is my opinion that she is left in a garret all by
herself, poor dear; and that Wimple takes himself off to
his chambers, or to his Liphook friends, and has a better
time."
"He's a horrid thing !"
"Floggie, do you know that he is our Uncle Alfred ?"
Walter asked, wickedly. She looked at him for a mo-
ment in bewilderment, then she understood.
" Walter," she said, "if you ever say that again I will
run away from you. I shall go and write a line to Mrs.
Burnett's gardener," she added, " and tell him to meet us
with the pony to-morrow; she said I was to use it, and I
think it would be good for Aunt Anne not to be excited
by the sight of Steggall's wagonette. I am certain she is
very unhappy."
"I don't know how she could expect to be anything
else," he answered. " Poor thing ! what the deuce did he
marry her for? There is some mystery at the bottom of
it."
Walter had divined rightly.  Aunt Anne's lodging
was at the top of the house. When he left her she went,
slowly, up the dark staircase that led to it. On the land-
ing outside her door were her two canvas-covered boxes,
one on top of the other. She looked at them for a
moment, P-If-hesitatingly, as if she were thinking of the
journey they would take to-morrow, and of the things
she must not forget to put into them. She turned the
handle of the front-room door and walked in. Alfred
Wimple was sitting by a cinder fire, over which he was
trying to make some water boil. he looked up as she
entered, but he did not rise from the broken cane-bot-
tomed chair.





<pb n="211"/>AUNT ANNE                  911
" Why did you go out, Anne ?" he asked, severely, with-
out giving her any sort of greeting.
"My dear one," she said, excitedly, going forward, "I
did not dream of your being here; it is, indeed, a joyful
surprise."  She put her hlands on his shoulder and leaned
down. He turned his head away with a quick movement,
and her kiss brushed his cheek near the car; but she pre-
tended n t to see it. " When did you come, my darling ?"
"Two hours ago," he said, solemnly, "and I wanted
some tea."
"I am so sorry, but I did not dream of your coming.
Are you better, my dear one ?" she tried to pull the fire
together with the little poker.
"I am a little better," he answered. " You will never
make the water boil over that fire."
"Yes, I will"-and site looked into the coal-scuttle.
Have you come up to town for good, dear Alfred ?" The
scuttle was empty, but she found some little bits of wood
and tried to make a blaze.
"I don't know; I am going back to my chambers pres-
ently to do a night's work."
"And to-morrow ?" shle asked, anxiously.
"Perhaps you will see me to-morrow," he answered.
"Can you give me something to eat ? I wish you would
make a decent fire."
"I will, my dear one," she said ; "if you will rest here
patiently for a few minutes, I will go down-stairs and ask
the landlady to let me have some coals."
"I have no money," he said, sullenly-" understand
that." 
" But I have, my darling," she answered, joyfully; " and
I am quite sure you require nourishment. Will you let
me go out and buy you a chop ?"





<pb n="212"/>212                 AUNT ANNE
"Give me some tea; I can get dinner on my way back."
"Won't you stay with ime this evening, Alfred? I
have some news for you, and I have been so lonely."
She looked round the shabby room, as if to prove to him
how impossible it was to find comfort in it.
"No, I can't stay," he answered, shortly. " Iow much
money have you got ?"
"I have a sovereign. Walter slipped it into my glove
just now. I have been to see them both, Alfred."
"What did they say about mc '!"
"They spoke of you most kindly, mny darling," she an-
swered and winked, very timidly.
"Why couldn't he give you more ?-a sovereign isn't
much," Wimple said, discontentedly. "I see Rammage
is not coming back from Cannes just yet," he added.
"My dear," she said, gravely, "you are fatigued with
your journey and hungry, and it makes you unhappy. If
you will excuse me a moment, I will make some little prep-
arations for your comfort."  And, witl the dignity that
always sat so quaintly upon her, she rose from tlhe rug
and left the room. She returned in a few minutes, fol-
lowed by the landlady with a scuttleful of coals. Tlen
sle made sonic tea, and cut some bread and butter, and set
it before Alfred Wimple, all the time putting off, nervous-
ly, the telling of her great bit of news. she looked at himn
while he ate and drank, and her face showed that she was
not looking at the actual man before her, but at some one
she had endowed with a dozen beauties of heart and soul:
slie wished he could realize that he possessed them; they
might have given him patience and made hinm happier.
"Did you enjoy the country ?" she asked, gently.
"Yes"-lie coughed uneasily-"but I was not well.
I shall go there again soon."

"What do you do all day ?" she asked. "l ave you
any society?" he was silent for a moment, as if strug-
gling with the destitution of speccl that always beset
him.
"I can't give you an account of all my days, Anne," he
said, and turned to the fire.
"I did not ask it, Alfred; you know that I never in-
trude upon your privacy. I had some news," she went
on, with a patlletic note in her voice, " and hoped it would
be pleasing to you."
"What is it "  the expression of his face had not
changed for a moment from the one of sulky displeasure
it had worn when she entered, and her manner betrayed a
certain nervousness, as if she felt that he was witl her
against his will, and only by gentle propitiation could she
keep him at all.
" Walter and Florence have offered to lend us their cot-
tage at Witley. We can go to it to-morrow-if it is con-
venient to you, Alfred," she added, meekly.
-"I shall not go there," he said, sullenly-and for a
moment he looked her full in the face witl his dull
eyes.
" I thought the air of that locality was always beneficial
to you," she said, in the same tone in which she had last
spoken.
"Thank you, I don't wisl to go to that 'locality,' and
be laughed at." Ile half mocked her as he spoke.
"Why should you be laughed at?" she asked, witl al-
most a cry of pain in her voice, for she knew what the an-
swer would be, beforehand; but the words were forced
from her-she could not help them. Ie coughed and
looked at her again.
"People generally laugh at a young man who marries





<pb n="214"/>214                 AUNT ANNE
an old woman, Anne."  She got up and went to the end
of the room, and came back again, and put her hand upon
his shoulder.
"No one is there to laugh," she said. " There is no
one there to know. We need not keep any society."
She did not see the absurdity of the last remark, and made
it quite gravely. "There are only a few people in tile
neighborhood at all, and tlose of an inferior class. It
does not matter what they think."
"It matters to me what every one thinks."
"We cannot remain here much longer," she went on.
"The landlady was most impertinent to-day. I think
Florence and Walter would help to pay her if we went
to the cottage to-morrow. They said they would arrange
everything."
"It is a long way from Liphool," he said, almost to
himself; "if any one saw us, they wouldn't suspect that
we were married. They would think you were my aunt,
perhaps."
"They may think what they please, Alfred," she an-
swered, "if you are only with me."   Then her voice
changed. "My dear one, I cannot bear life unless you
are gentle to me," she pleaded; " and I cannot bear it here
alone any longer, always away from you, day after day.
I am your wife, Alfred, and, if I am an old woman, I love
you with all the years I remember, and all the love that
has been stored up in me since my youth. I want to be
near you to take care of you, to see that you have coml-
forts. You can say that I am your aunt, if it pleases you.
I never feel that I am your wife, only that it is my great
privilege to be near you and to serve you." She stopped,
as if unable to go on, and he was silent a moment or two
before he answered,





<pb n="215"/>AUNT ANNE                  215
"It might be a good idea; as you say, there is no one
about there to know."
"Are you ashamed of me ?"
"I don't want to look ridiculous." Then a flash came
into her eyes, and the old spirit asserted itself.
"Alfred," she said, "if you do not love me, I think at
least you should learn to treat me with respect. If I am
so distasteful to you we had better separate. I cannot go
on bearing all that I have borne patiently for months.
Let me go to Florence and Walter-they will be kind to
me, and I will never be a burden upon you. The allow-
ance that Sir William Rammage gives me would keep me
in comfort alone, and it struck me the other day that, when
he dies, perhaps he will leave me something."
He looked at her with sudden alarm. The cowed look
seemed to have gone from her face to his, and as she saw
it she gathered strength, and went on, " I cannot be in-
sulted, Alfred-I cannot and will not."
" Don't be foolish, Anne; I am irritable sometimes, and
I am not strong-"
"That is why I have borne so much from you."
"I will go to Witley with you," he said, ignoring her
remark altogether; " that is, if you like, and can raise the
money to go. I have none."

" FIshER was quite pleased when I asked him if we could
get off to Monte Carlo at Whitsuntide for a fortnight,"
Walter told Florence a few weeks later.
"Wasn't he shocked at your gambling propensities?"
" Not a bit. IHe looked as if he would like to go too
-said, in rather a pompous manner "-anld Walter imi-
tated his editor exactly-" ' Certainly, certainly; I think,
Ilibbert, your wife deserves a little treat of some sort after
your long absence in the winter, and I am very glad if it
is in my power to help you to give it to her.' IIe looked
like the King of the Cannibal Islands making an Act of
Parliament all by himself."
" You are a ridiculous dear."
" Thank you, Floggie. Fisher's a nice old chap, and I
am very fond of him."
"Do you know," said Florence, in rather a shocked
tone, " Ethel Dunlop said one day that she believed lie
looked upon himself as a sort of minor providence ?
"Well, he does go about minor-providencing a good
deal-which reminds me that he said he was coming, in a
day or two, to ask you to take him out to buy a wedding-
present for Ethel."         
' Ie'll buy her a Crown Derby tea-set, or a sugar-basin
with a very large pair of tongs, see if he doesn't. Ethel
said he ought to have married Aunt Annc."
"He would have been a thousand times better than





<pb n="217"/>AUNT ANNE                  217
Wimple. I wonder how those gay young people are get- 
ting onl at Witley, and whether they want anything more /
before we start."
"I think they must be all right at present," Florence
said. " We sent them a good big box of stores when they
went to the cottage; and I know you gave her a little
money, dear Walter, and we paid up her debts, so that she
cannot be worried. Then, of course, she has her hundred
a year from Sir William to fall back upon, and Mr. Wim-
ple probably has something."
"Oh, yes, I suppose they are all right; besides, I don't
feel too generous towards that beggar Wimple."
"I should think not," Florence said, virtuously. "Do
you know, Walter, once or twice it has struck me that
perhaps he won't live; he doesn't look strong, and he is
always complaining. Aunt Anne said that he wanted
constant change of air."
" Oh, yes, I remember she said Liphook was 'beneficial'
to him."
"If he died she would have her allowance, and be
free."
"No such luck," said Walter. "Besides, if he died,
there would be nowhere for him to go to-he'd have to
come back again. Ieaven wouldn't have him, and, after
all, he isn't quite bad enough for the devil to use his coals
upon."
"Walter, you mustn't talk in that way-you mustn't,
indeed "-and she put her ]land over his mouth r4ain.
"All right," he said, struggling to get free; " beg par-
don, Floggie, I won't do it again."
Mr. Fisher duly arrived the next afternoon. he was a
little breathless, though he carefully tried to conceal it, and
wore the air of deference, but decision, which he always





<pb n="218"/>218                  AUNT ANNE
thought the right one to assume to women. With much
gravity he and Florence set out to buy the wedding-pres-
ent. It resolved itself into a silver butter-dish with a
silver cow on the lid, though Florence tried hard to make
him choose a set of apostle spoons.
"A   butter-dish will be much more useful, my dear
lady."
"It will be very useful," Florence echoed, though she
feared that Ethel would be a little disappointed when she
saw tlie cow.
"And now," said Mr. Fisher, in a benevolent voice, as
they left the silversmith's in Bond Street, "we are close to
Gunter's-if you would do me the honor to eat an ice ?"
"I will do you tlhe honor with great pleasure "-and
she thought to herself, " His manner really is like Aunt
Anne's this afternoon. If she had only married him in-
stead of that horrid Mr. Wimple, we would have called
hlim uncle with pleasure."  She sat eating her very large
strawberry ice, while he tasted his at intervals, as if he
were rather afraid of it.
"Did the white cockatoo die ?" she asked. IIe almost
started, he was so surprised at the question.
" The white cockatoo ?"
"You spoke of it last year-tllat night when Mrs.
Baines dined with us."
"I remember now," he said, solemnly; "yes; it died,
Mrs. Hibbert. For five years it was perhaps my most in-
timate friend, and the companion of my solitude."
"Why did it die ?"
"It pulled a door-nmat to pieces, and we fear it swal-
lowed sonle of the fibre. My housekeeper, who is a se-
vere woman, beat it with her gloves, and it did not re-
cover."  He spoke as if he were recounting a tragedy,





<pb n="219"/>AUNT ANNE /                 219
and became so silent that Florepce felt she had ventured
on an unlucky topic. But it was always rather difficult
to make conversation for Mr. Fisher when she was alone
with him; there were so few things he cared to discuss
with a woman. Politics he considered beyond her, on
literary matters he thought she could form no opinion,
and society was a frivolity it was as well not to encourage
her to consider too much. Suddenly a happy thought
struck her.
" I am so happy about our holiday, Mr. Fisher," she
said; "it is a long time since Walter and I had a real one
together."
"I am delighted that it has been arranged. I feel sure
that Walter will enjoy it with so charming a companion,"
he answered, with an effort at gallantry that touched her.
"Are you going away this Whitsuntide ?" she asked.
"No. I seldom go away from London, or my work."
"I wish you were going to ]lave a holiday, witl some
one you liked," she said.
" My dear lady "-and he gave a little sigh as he spoke,
"I fear the only society I am fitted for is my own."
" Oh, no, you are much too modest "-and she tried to
laugh. "Some day I hope to buy you a butter-dish. I
shall like going to get it so much, dear Mr; . Fisher."
"I think not," he answered, almost sadly.
"Ethel says you hlave been very kind to her about
George," Florence said, in a low voice, for Ahe was almost
afraid to refer to it-" but you are kind to everybody."
Mr. Fisher turned and looked at her with a grateful ex-
pression in his clear blue eyes; but she knew that he did
not want to make any other answer. Gradually he put on
his editorial manner, as if to ward off more intimate con-
versation, and when lip left her at the door of her house,





<pb n="220"/>220                  AUNT ANNE
for he refused to come in, she felt, while she looked after
him, as if she hlad been present at the ending of the last
little bit of romance in his life.
The IIibberts were in higl spirits when they started for
their holiday.
"Two days in Paris," he said, as they drove to tlhe hlotel;
"and then we'll crawl down France towards the south, and
I will introduce you to the Mediterranean Sea. It's a pity
we can only eat one dinner a nighlt, considering the number
of good ones there are to be had here. To be sure, if we
manage carefully, we can do a little supper on the Boulc-
vard afterwards, still, that hardly counts. But I don't
think we can stay any longer, dear Floggie, even to turn
you into a Parisian."
Forty-eight hours later saw tlhem in the express for
Marseilles, where they stayed a night, in order to get the
coast scenery by daylight, as they went on to Monte
Carlo.
"It's a wonderful city," Walter said, with a sigh, as they
strolled under tihe trees on tlhe Prado.  "Tlie Jew, and
the Turk, and the Infidel, and every other manner of man,
has passed through it in his turn. Doesn't it suggest all
sorts of pictures to you, darling ?"
"Yes," she answered, a little absently; "only I was
thinking of Monty and Catty."
" We ought to wait a day, and go to see Monte Christo's
prison."
"Yes"-but she was not very eager. HIer thoughts
were with her children. Walter was always able to enjoy
things, and to garnish them with tlhe right memories. "I
wonder if we shall find letters from home when we get to
Monte Carlo," she said.





<pb n="221"/>AUNT ANNE             x    221
"I hope so," he answered, gently, but he said no more
about the associations of Mlarseilles.
As they were leaving the big lotel on the Cannebikre,
the next morning, a lady entered it. she had evidently
just arrived--her luggage was being carried in.
"I shall be here three nights," they heard her say to
the manageress. "I leave for England on Thursday
morning."
At the sound of her voice Florence turned round, but
she had gone towards the staircase. The Ilibberts had to
catcl their train, and could not wait.
"It was Mrs. North, Walter," Florence said, as they
drove to the station; " I wish I could have spoken to her.
She looked a lonely little figure entering that big hotel."
"But there was no time," he answered; "if we lost our
train we should virtually lose a day."
"I wonder why she has come here 2"
" The ways of women are inscrutable."
"I meant to have written and told her about Aunt
Anne, but I had so much to do before we left London
that I really forgot it."
"You might send her a line from Monte Carlo; you
heard her say that she was to be at Marseilles three days;
and then, perhaps, it would be better to leave her alone."
"I should like to write to her just once, for I am afraid
I was not very kind that day; but she took me by sur-
prise."
"Very well, then; write to her from Monte Carlo. It
will give her an idea that we are not such terrible pat-
terns of virtue ourselves, and perhaps she'll find that a
consolation; but I don't see what more we can do for her.
It is very difficult to help a woman in her position. She
has put out to sea in an open boat, and, even if she doesn't





<pb n="222"/>222                 AUNT ANNE
get wrecked, every craft she runs against is sure to hurt
her."
Tlhe letter was duly written and sent to the hotel at
Marseilles. It found Mrs. North sitting alone, in her big
room on the first floor. She was beside the open window,
watching the great lighted cafEs and the happy people
gathered in little groups round the tables on the pave-
nient.
"Oh, what a pity it is," she said to herself, "that we
cannot remember. I always feel as if we had lived since
the beginning and shall go on till the end-if end there
be; but if one only had a memory to match, how wonder-
ful it would be. If I could but see this place just once
as it was hundreds of years ago, with the Greek people
walking about and the city rising up about them! Now
it looks so thoroughly awake, witl its great, new build-
ings and horrible improvements; but if it ever sleeps, how
wonderful its dreams must be! If one could get inside
them and see it all as it once was !" . .  She turned her
face longingly towards the port, at the far end of the Can-
nebi6re. " I a  so hungry to see everything, and to know
everything," she said to herself-"so hungry for all the
things I have never had ... I wonder if I shall die soon
-I can't go on living like this, longing and waiting and
hoping and grasping nothing . . . I wisl I could see the
water. If I had courage I would drive down and look at
it-or walk past those people sitting out on the pavement,
and go down to the sea. There might be a ship sailing
by towards England, and I should know how his ship will
look if it ever sails by. Or a ship going on towards India,
and I could look after it, knowing that every moment it
was getting nearer and nearer to him. To-morrow I will

find out precisely where tlec P. & O.'s sail from for Bom-
bay; then I shall be able to guess what it all looked like
when he set his foot on board, a year ago. Oh, thank
God! I may think of hlim a little-that I am free-that
it is not wickedness to think of him-or to love him," slie
added, with almost a sob.
She got up and looked round the room. It was nearly
dark. She could sec the outline of the furniture and of
her own figure dimly reflected in the long glass of tile
wardrobe.
" The place is so full of shadows they frighten me; but
I am frightened at everything."  She flung herself down
again on the couch at the foot of the bed. "I wonder if
the people who have always done right ever for a moment
imagine that the people who have done wrong can suffer
as much-oh, a thousand times more than themselves.
They seem to imagine that sin is a sort of armor against
suffering, and it does not matter how many blows are ad-
ministered to those who have gone off the beaten track."
Shle pillowed her head on her arms and watched the mov-
ing reflection of the light from the street. In imagina-
tion she stared through it at the long years before her,-
wondering, almost in terror, how they would be filled. " I
am so young, and I may live so long."  There was a
knock at her bedroom door.
"Come in," she cried, thankful for any interruption.
"A letter for Madame."                /
"For me!"   she seized it with feverish haste and
looked at the direction by the window'while the candles
were being lighted. " I declare," she said, when the door
was closed behind the gar'on, "it is from the immaculate
Mrs. Hibbert. May the saints have guarded her from con-
tamination while she wrote it to me!" Her happy spirits





<pb n="224"/>224                    AUNT ANNE
flashed back, and the weary woman of five minutes ago
was almost a light-hearted girl again.
"It is rather a nice letter," she said, and propped up the
wicks of the flickering candles with the corner of the en-
velope.  "I believe she wrote merely out of kindness;
it proves that there is some generosity in even the most
virtuous heart. I'll write to Mrs. Wimple-" she stopped-
and reflected for a minute or two.   "Poor old lady! she
was very good to me; she was like a mother-no woman
has called me 'my love' since she went away."         She
walked up and down the room for a moment, and looked
out again at the wide street and the flashing lights.  Sud-
denly she turned, seized her blotting-book, and knelt down
by the table in the impulsive manner that characterized
her. "I'll write at once," she said.   "Of course it will
shock her sweet old nerves; but I know she'll be glad to
hear from  me, though she won't own it even to herself."
" DEAREST OLD LADY,-I have been longing to know what had be-
come of you. I only heard a little while ago that you were a happy
bride, and I have just succeeded in getting your address. A thousand
congratulations. I hope you are very much in love, and that Mr.
Wimple is truly charming. he is, indeed, a most fortunate man and
to be greatly envied by the rest of his sex.
"I fear you will be shocked to hear that Mr. North has divorced
me. I never loved him, you know. I told you that when you were
so angry with me that day in Cornwall Gardens, and it was not my
fault that I married him. I have been very miserable, and I don't
suppose I shall ever be happy again. But the world is a large place,
and I am going to wander about; I have always longed to see the
whole of it: now I shall go to the cast and the west, and the north
and the south, like a Wandering Jewess. But before I start on these
expeditions I shall be in England for a few weeks and should like to
see you. Would you see me ? I don't suppose you would come near
me or let me go near you, though I should like to put my head down
on your shoulder and feel your kind old arms round me again.
"I am afraid you have eaten up all your wedding-cake, dear old





<pb n="225"/>AUNT ANNE                   225
lady, and even if you have any left you would, no doubt, think it far
too good for the likes of me. I wonder if you would accept a very
little wedding-present from me, for I should so much like to send
you one ? 3Iy love to you, and many felicitations to both you and
Mr. Wimple.                Yours always,
" E. NORTI."
When it was finished, her excitement gave way; ler
spirits ran down; she went, wearily, back to the sofa and
pillowed her head on her arms once more. "I wonder
what the next incident will be, and how many days and
nights it is off."  She shut her eyes, and in tllought hur-
ried down the street to the old port. She saw the masts
of ships, and the moving water, and the passing lights in
the distance. " 0 God !" she said to herself, " how terri-
ble it is to think that the land is empty for me from end
to end. Though I walked over every mile of it, I should
never see his face or hear his voice, and there is not a
heart in the whole of it that cares one single jot for me.
And the great sea is there, and the ships going on and on,
and not a soul on board one of them who knows that I
live or cares if I die. It frightens me and stuns me, and
frightens me again. I am so hungry, and longing, and
eager for the utter impossibilities. Oh, my darling, if you
had only trusted me; if you could have believed that the
sin was outside me and not in my heart; if you had writ-
ten me just one little line to tell nc that some day, even
though it were years and years ahead, you would come to
me and take me into your life forever, I would have been
so good-I would have made myself the best woman on
earth, so that I might give yon the best love that ever
Heaven sent into a human heart."   There was another
knock at the door, and something like a cry escaped from
her lips.
15





<pb n="226"/>220                 AUNT ANNE
"Come in "-and again the garqon entered with a let-
ter. This time it was a thick packet.
"This is also for Madame," he said; "it is from Eng-
land."  She waited until the door had closed behind himn
before she opened it.
The envelope contained a dozen enclosures. They looked
like bills and circulars sent on from lher London address.
Among themn was a telegram.
"I suppose it is nothing," she said, as, witl trembling
hands, she opened it. It was from Bombay, and contained
five words-
"Sailing next month in Deccaln."
She fell down on her knees by the table and, putting
her face on her hands, burst into passionate weeping.
" 0 dear God," she prayed, " forgive me and be mer-
ciful to me. I have not meant to do wrong, I have only
longed to be happy. 0 dear Father, let me be so. I will
try to do right all my life long, and to make him do right,
too-only let him love me still. I have never been happy
-let me be so. I have suffered so-I have suffered so!
O dear God, is it not enough? Forgive me and let me be
happy."





<pb n="227"/>CHAPTER XVII
IT was chilly as only an English spring knows how to
be. The fir-woods were deserted-the pathways through
them wet and slippery. But overhead there was fitful
sunshine and patches of blue sky, though the Surrey hills
were misty and the fields were sodden with many rains.
The leaves were beginning to unfold, fresh and green;
the primroses were thick in the hedges; and here and
there the little white stitchwort showed itself, tearful and
triumphant. The thrushes and blackbirds were making
ready for summer, though as yet there was not a sign of it.
Alfred Wimple and Aunt Anne had been a month at
the cottage. The latter pottered about the garden, look-
ing at every up-coming plant with absent recognition;
but that was all. She was too sad to care any more for
the delights of the country. She had grown feeble, too,
and could not walk very far-even the garden tired her.
Mrs. Burnett's governess-cart had beer her great comfort.
She had no fear of doing the pampered pony, as she called
it, any harm, and had driven herself for hours along the
lonely roads between the fir-trees and the hedges of awak-
ening gorse and heather. The straggling population for
three miles round knew her well-the lonely old lady, with
the black bonnet and the long black cloak fastened with
the steel clasp. Alfred Wimple never went with her; he
had refused from the very first. But he had a way of
disappearing by himself for long hours together. Where
k





<pb n="228"/>228                  AUNT ANNE
lie went she could never divine; and to ask him questions,
she told herself once, was like trying to look at the bottom
of the sea by pushing away the water witl her two hands.
Still it was a mystery she was determined to unravel
sooner or later; she felt that the solution lay at Liphook,
and dreaded to think what it might be. Into her heart,
against her will, there lhad sometimes crept, lately, a sus-
picion that was shame and agony; but she vwold not
own, even in the lowest, most secret whisper, that it was
possible. Slh never went to Liphook, though it would
liave been easy enough to drive there; she never dared;
something seemed to hold her back from that whicl she
felt to be only a few miles away, on the other side of
IIindhead. She would not try to put into any slape at
all what her dread was; least of all would her pride let
hler for a single moment imagine that it was the one thling
of which the huniliation would kill her. But, silently, slie
watclied, and hour after hour she sat wondering wliat was
in the lieart of tlhat strange, inscrutable young man, wllo
spoke so few words, and seemed to be always watchingl
and waiting for the accomplishment of some mysterious
plan he revolved again and again in his mind, but to whicl
he had no intention of giving a clue.
HIe could hire no more wagonettes at Steggall's witlout 
paying for them, or witliout her knowledge; but once or
twice she had seen him going along a by-path tow:trds
tlhe station, so that he would arrive there just about tle
time there was a train to Liphook. She remembered tlat
on the first occasion, he lad pulled a sliilling out of his
pocket an hour or two before he started and looked at it,
as if wondering whether it would be enough for a return
ticket.
"Alfred," she asked one day, " will you take me to see
I





<pb n="229"/>AUNT ANNE                  229
your country quarters, my love? I should like to visit
the place which has been of so much benefit to you '?
"No," he answered, looking at her steadfastly, as lie
always did; "I don't wish you to go there."
" May I ask your reason ?"
"My wish should be sufficient."
"It is," she said, gently; "for I know, dear Alfred,
that you have always a reason for wlat you wish, and you
would nuo prevent me from seeing a place for which you
have such a preference if you had not a good one."
He was soothed by her conciliatory manner.
"I owe some money there," he said, "and if you went
they might expect you to pay it "-an answer wliich satis-
fied her for a time on account of its obvious probability.
But still his disappearances tormented her, and his silence
stifled all questions she longed to ask.
She liked being at the cottage; she liked being the vir-
tual mistress of a certain number of rooms and of a ser-
vant of her own; and, on the whole, the first month had
gone smoothly. Florence and Walter had been generous,
and made many provisions for their comfort, and she had
been separated less from Alfred than when she was in
town, and here, too, she was better able to keep some ac-
count of his movements. Moreover, if he disappeared for
hours together here, it had been for days together there.
He always went off silently, witliout warning or hint, and
as silently reappeared.
o " Have you been for a walk, my love ?" she asked hlim
one evening. Ile turned and looked at her; there was
no anger in his dull eyes, but he made her quail inwardly,
though outwardly she slowed no sign.
"Yes"-and slic knew, perfectly, he would tell her no
more. Still, hopelessly, she persevered.





<pb n="230"/>230                 AUNT ANNE
"In what direction did you bend your steps, dear Al-
fred ?"
"I dislike being asked to give an account of my move-
nents, Anne," he said, and locked his lips in the manner
tlat was so peculiar to him.
"I quite understand, my love," she answered, gently;
"it is also extremely repugnant to me to be questioned.
I merely asked, hoping that you felt invigorated by your
walk."  He looked at ler, and said nothing.
It was nine o'clock. Jane Mitclell, the postman's sis-
ter, who acted as their daily servant, came in to say she
was going home till tlhe morning. Aunt Anne followed
her, as she always did, to see that tlhe outer door was made
fast. She looked out at tlhe night for a moment, with a
haunting feeling of mistrust-of what, she did not know-
and listened to the silence. Not a sound-not even a foot-
step passing along the road. The fir-trees stood up, dark
and straight, like voiceless sentinels. She looked at the
stars and thought how far they were away. They gave
her a sense of helplessness. She was almost afraid of the
soft patter of her own feet as she went back to the draw-
ing-room. she winked, nervously, and looked, quickly and
suspiciously, round, then sat down, uneasily, before the fire
and watched Alfred Wimple. She knew that again and
again his eyes were fixed upon her, though his lips said
no word.
"Are you sleepy, my love ? she asked.
"I am very tired, Anne; good-night"-and, taking up
a candlestick, he went slowly up-stairs while she stayed
below, looking at the deadening fire, knowing that one
night, suddenly, everything would be changed; but how
and when it would be changed she could not guess. She
did not dare look forward a single day or hour. She ex-





<pb n="231"/>AUNT ANNE                   231
tinguished the lamp and shut the drawing-room door and
locked it, remembering for a lmoment the unknown people,
in the by-gone years, who had gone out of the room never
to enter it more.
Gradually tlhe money in their posssssion was coning
to a sure and certain end. She knew it, and her reck-
lessness and extravagance vanished. She guarded every
penny as if it were her heart's blood, though she still
did her spending witl an air of willingness that concealed
her reluctance. Hour after hour she racked her brains
to think of some new source of help; but no suggestion
presented itself, and lhe and she togetller faced, in silence,
the bankruptcy that was overtaking tlhen. IIe went less
often towards the station now; he stayed, discontentedly,
in the drawing-room, sitting, uneasily, by the fire on one
of the easy-chairs witl the peacock screen beside it. Some-
times, after he had brooded for a while in silence, he would
get up and write a letter, but he always carefully gave it
"himself to the postman, and no letters at all ever arrived
for him to Aunt Anne's knowledge.
"Alfred," she asked one day, "what has become of
your work in town ?-tlhe work you used to go to your
chambers to do ?"
"I am resting now, and do not wish to be questioned
about it. I require rest," he said; and that was all.
-Then a time calne when he took to walking in the gar-
den, and she knew that while he did so he kept a watch
on thie house, and especially on the window of the room
in which she was sitting. When he thought she did not
see him he disappeared down the dip belind and along
the patlway between thle fir-trees and larches towards the
short cut to Ilindlhead. she remembered that the way
to Hindhlead was also the way to Liphook. It was, of
7t





<pb n="232"/>232                  AUNT ANNE
course, too far to walk tliere, but perhaps there were some
means of obviating that necessity. she said nothing, but
she waited. It seemed to her as if Alfred Wimple waited
too. For what? Was it for her to die? slic sometimes
asked herself, though she reproached herself for her sus-
picions. Then all her tenderness would come back, and
she hovered round him lovingly, or stole away to com-
mune with herself.
" I am sure he loves me," she would think, as she sat
vainly trying to comfort herself-" or wliy should he have
married me? Iis love must be the meaning of mine for
him, and the forgiveness of the past, after all the long years
of waiting. It is different from what it was then ; he is
changed, and I am cllanged, too. I am old witl waiting,
and he does not yet understand the reason of his own
youth. I wonder whicl it is," she said one day, almost
in a dream, as she rocked to iand fro over the fire-" is he
disguised with youth of wllich le does not know thle mean-
ing; or am I disguised witl years, so that he docs not
know that under them my youth is hidden ?"
Closer and closer came the ills of poverty. The trades-
people trusted them to some extent, in spite of the warn-
ing they had received from the Iibberts, but at last they
refused to do so any longer. The stores that Florence
had sent in, too--Aunt Anne had said, "You must allow
me to remain in your debt for them, my dear"-had
gradually run out. Dinner became more and more of a
difficulty, and at the scanty meal it was Alfred Wimple
who ate, and Aunt Anne who looked on, pretending slhe
liked the food she hardly dared to taste. He knew tlat
slie was starving herself for his sake, but he said noth-
ing. It gave him a dull gratification to see her doing it.
Iri his heart there was a resentment that deatlh had not





<pb n="233"/>AUNT ANNE                   233
sooner achieved for his benefit that which from the first
lie had meant it to accomplish. Not that it was within
his scheme to let Aunt Anne die yet; but when lie
married her he had not realized the awful shrinking that
would daily grow upon him-the physical shrinking that
youth sometimes feels from old age. In his nature there
was no idealism, no sentiment. He could not give her
the reverence that even mere age usually provokes, or the
affection, as of a son, that some young men in his posi-
tion might possibly have bestowed. IIe saw everything
concerning her years with ghastly plainness-tlhe little
lines and the deep wrinkles on her face, the tremulous
eyelids, the scanty hair brushed forward from places the
cap covered. Even the soft folds of muslin round her
withered throat made him shiver. IIe thought once, in
one mad moment, low swiftly he could strangle the lin-
gering life out of her. Her hands with the loose dry
skin and the bloodless fingers and wrists that were always
cold, as if the fire in them were going out, sent a thrill of
horror through his frame when she touched him. Tile
mere sound of her footstep, the touch of her black dress
as she passed him by, insensibly made hliml draw back.
He had played a daring game, but he lad an awful pun-
ishment. IIe lived a brooding, secret life, full of dread
and alertness lest shame should overtake hlim, and his
]heart was not less miserable because it was incapable of
generosity or goodness.
At last it became a matter of shillings.
"Yon had bettwr go to London, Anne," he said, "and
borrow some money."
" Of whom am I to borrow it ?" she asked. " Florence
and Walter are at Monte Carlo."
\k





<pb n="234"/>234                  AUNT ANNE
"Walter is very selfish," he answered; "I nursed
himn through an illness, years ago, at the risk of my own
life."
"I know low tender your heart is, dear Alfred."
"I believe he resents my having borrowed sonic money
frolm him once or twice. IIe forgets that if he were not
in a much better position than I am he couldn't have
lent it."
"Of course he could not, my love," she said, agreeing
with hliin, as a matter not merely of course but of loyalty
and affection.
He gave one of his peculiar little gulps. "We can't
go on staying liere, unless we have enough to cat," lhe
said; "you must get some money. You had better go
to London." IIe looked at her fixedly, and she knew that
lie wanted to get rid of her for a space.
"Go to London, my love ?" she echoed, almost humbly.
"Yes, to get money."
"Alfred," she said, "how am I to get money? We
disposed of everything that was available before we came
here."
" You must borrow it; perhaps you can go and persuade
my uncle to let you have some."
"If you would let me tell hinm that I am your wife,"
she pleaded.
"I forbid you telling him," he said shortly. "But you
might ask himn to advance your quarter's allowance."
"I might write and request him to do that," she sug-
gested.
No," he said; "it is easy to refuse in a letter, and lie
must not refuse."
"But if he will not listen to me, Alfred ?" she asked,
watching him curiously.





<pb n="235"/>AUNT ANNE                  235
"Tell him that Sir William Rammagc is your cousin,
and that he has no right to refuse."
"But if he does?" she persisted.
"Then you must get it elsewhere. There are those
people you stayed with in Cornwall Gardens."  She
looked up quickly.
"I cannot go to Mrs. North," slhe said, firmly. " There
are some things due to my own self-respect; I cannot for-
get them even for you."
"You can do as you like," he answered. "If you can-
not get money, I must go away."
"Go away!" she echoed, with alarm; he saw his advan-
tage and followed it up.
"I shall not stay here to be starved," he repeated.
"I should starve, too," she said, sadly; " are you alto-
gether oblivious of that fact, Alfred ?"
"If you choose to do so it is your own business, and
no reason why I should. I have friends wllo will receive
me, and I shall go to them."
"Would they not extend a helping hand to us both ?"
" No," he said, doggedly.
"They cannot love you as I do," she pleaded.
"I cannot help that; I shall go to them."
"I give you all I have."
"I want more than you give me now," he answered;
"and if you don't give it me, I shall not stay here. You
had better go to London to-morrow, and look for some
money. My uncle will let you have some if you are per-
sistent."
"I think I will go to-ay," she said, witl an odd tone
in her voice. " I should be in time for the twelve-o'clock
train."
"You will go to-morrow !" he replied, decisively.
vk





<pb n="236"/>236                 AUNT ANNE
"Very well, my love "-and she winked quickly to her-
self. " I  ill go to-morrow."
"Unless you bring back some money, I sliall not stay
here any longer. You inust clearly understand that,
Anne. I am tired of this business," he said, in his hard,
determined voice.
"It's not worse for you tllan it is for me, Alfred. I can
bear it with you; cannot you bear it with me?" IIe
looked at her-at her black dress, her white handkerchief,
at the poverty-stricken age of which she seemed to be the
symbol; and he shuddered perceptibly as he turned away
and answered, "No, I cannot, and I want to go."
" Alfred !" she said, witl a cry of pain, and going to his
side she put her hand on his arm; but he shook her off,
and went a step farther away. "Stay there," he said.
" Why do you recoil from ine ?" she asked; "am I so
distasteful to you?" But he only shuddered again, and
looked at her with almost terror in his eyes, as though lie
dumbly loathed her.
"Have I forfeited your love, Alfred ?" sll asked,
11umbly.
"I dislike being touched."
" You will break my heart!" she cried, witl a dry sob
in her throat. " Iy dear one," she went on, "I have
given you all I possess; I have braved everything for
you. Ias all your love for me gone ?"
"I don't want to talk sentiment," he said, drawing back
still a little farther from her, as though he shrank from
being wvithin lier reach.
"Do you remember that night when we walked along
the road by the fir-trees, and you told me you would al-
ways love me and take care of me? What have I done
to make you change? I never cease thinking of you, day





<pb n="237"/>AUNT ANNE                  237
or night, but it is mlonths since you gave me a loving
word. What liave I done to change you so?"
Ile looked down at her; for a moment there was an
expression of hatred on his face.
"You are old-and I am young."
"My heart is young," she said, piteously. Still he was
merciless.
"It is your face I see," he said, "not your heart."
She let her hands fall by her side. "I cannot bear it
any more," she said, quickly; "perhaps we had better
separate; these constant scenes will kill me. You must
permit me to retire; I cannot bear any more"-and she
walked slowly away into the little drawing-roonm, and shut
the door. she went np to the glass, and looked at ler
own face, long and sadly; she put her wrists together, and
looked at them hlopelessly.
"Oh, I am old !" she cried, witl a shiver; " I am old !"
-and she sat down on the gaunt chair by the fireplace,
still and silent, till cold and misery numbed her, and all
things were alike.
Presently, she heard his footsteps; he had left tile
dining-room, and seemed to be going towards the front
door; she raised her head and listened. he hesitated,
turned back, and entered the dlrawing-roomn. IIe stood
for a moment on tlhe threslold and looked round the
little room-at the hard, old-fashioned sofa, at the cor-
ner cupboard witl the pot-pourri on it, the jingling piano,
the chair on which she sat. he remembered the day of
his interview with Florence, and afterwards with Aunt
Anne, and he looked at the latter now half doubtfully.
She did not move an inch as he entered, or raise her
eyes.
"Anne!"   There was no answer. She Vurned a little





<pb n="238"/>238                  AUNT ANNE
more directly away from him. "Anne," he said, "we had
better make it up. It is no good quarrelling."
"You are very cruel to me, Alfred," she said, with gen-
tie indignation; "you forgot everything that was due to
me. You frequently do."
"I cannot always be remembering what is due to you,
Anne. It irritates inc."
"But you cut me to tlhe quick. I sometimes feel du-
bious as to whether you have any affection at all for me."
"Don't be foolish," he said, with an effort that was
rather obvious; "and don't let us quarrel. I dislike pov-
erty-it makes me cross."
" I can understand that," she said, " but I cannot under-
stand your being cruel to me."
"I didn't mean to be cruel," he answered; "we had
better forget it."  she stood up and faced him, timidly,
but witl a slight flush in her face.
" You said I was old; you taunted me witl it; you
often taunt me," she said, indignantly.
"Well, but I knew it before we were married."
"Yes, you knew it before we were married," she re-
peated.
" Then I couldn't have minded it so much, could I ?" lh
said, with a softer tone in his voice, though it grated still.
" No, my love "-and she tried to smile, but it was a sad
attempt.
" Well, is it all right ?" le asked. " We won't quarrel
any more."
" Yes, my love, it is all right," she said, lovingly, and,
half doubtfully, she put up her face to his.
Involuntarily he drew back again, but he recovered in
an instant and forced himself to stoop and kiss her fore-
head.





<pb n="239"/>AUNT ANNE                  239
There," he said, "it's all right. To-morrow you shall
go to London, and we will be more sensible in future." lie
touched her hand, and went out into the garden. When
she had watched him out of sight, she sat down once more
on the chair by the fire.
" I am old !" slhe cried; " I am old, I am old !"-and, with
a quick movement of fear, she hid her tlin hands out of
sight. "I cannot bear it-I am old."

BEFORE nine the next morning, Aunt Anne was ready
to set out on her journey to London. Mrs. Burnett's
governess-cart was at the gate with Lucas, the gardener, in
it, to drive her to the station. Alfred Wimple looked on
at lier preparations to go with an anxiety that was almost
eagerness; and, stealthily, the old lady watclhed his every
look and movement.
"Jane can prepare the dinner after my return. I shall
bring back some little dainty with me, hoping that it
may tempt you, my love."
"I am very tired of the food we have had lately," he said,
ungraciously. " What train are you coming back by ?"
"Tlhat will depend on my occupations in town," she
answered, after a moment's consideration.
" I will go to the station at half-past six. You can leave
Waterloo Station at five fifteen."  Aunt Anne winked
slowly.
" I will try to come by an earlier train, my love, if you
will be there to relieve me of the packages witl which I
hope to be burdened."
"No. Come by the five fifteen," he said, decisively.
"I have some letters to write."
"Very well, my love," she answered, with tender cour-
tesy. " It is always a pleasure to study your wishes, even
in trifles. Would you assist me with my cloak, dear Al-
fred ?"





<pb n="241"/>*     AUNT ANNE                   241
" It isn't cold, and you have your shawl. Why are you
taking this heavy cloak ?"
,, I have my reasons."
IIe understood perfectly. IIe felt a gleam of almost
fiendish triumph as, one by one, she divested herself of her
belongings to buy him food and comfort. As she was go-
ing out of the doorway an idea seemed to strike him.
"Anne," he said, "remember it is no good bringing
back a few shillings-you must bring back a few pounds
at least."
"Have you any anxieties?-any payment it is impera-
tive that you should make 2" she asked, anxiously.
"Yes," he answered, with a little smile to himself, as if
an idea had been suggested to him. " I have a payment to
make."
"I will do all I can--more for your sake than my own,
dear Alfred "-and she turned to go. They were in the
drawing-room.
She hesitated for a moment by the door. " My love,"
she said, going up to him doubtfully, "will you kiss me?
You will never know how much I love you-you are all I
have in the world."  the cashmere slawl clung to her
and the heavy cloak swung back from her arms as she put
them up round his neck and kissed him, first on one side
of his face and then on the other; but even as she did so,
and though for once he strove to hide it, she felt that, in-
wardly, he was shrinking.
" I will be back by half-past six o'clock," she said, with a
hopeless tone in her voice, and, slowly letting go her hold,
she went out of the house.
On her way to the cart she stopped for a moment to
look at a pile of fagots that were stacked in a partly con-
cealed corner inside the garden gate.

<pb n="242"/>242                  AUNT ANNE
"Jane," she said, "I think there have been some depre-
dations among the wood lately."
"I saw two lads stealing a bit the other morning," Jane
answered.
"We must take steps to prevent it occurring again."
"There's plenty of wood, too, about here," said Jane;
"I don't see why they should take ours; but I tlink they
were tramps and wanted to make a fire. I thougllt I'd
speak to the policeman-but I couldn't catch him lwhen
lie went by on his beat last night."
"I slould like to speak to him myself; at what time
does he pass?"
" Well, ma'am, he is generally pretty punctual at about
half-past eight."
"If you see him this evening you can tell me"-and
she got into the governess-cart. "Jane," she said, look-
ing back," I forgot to tell you that your master and I will
dine at lialf-past seven. I shall probably bring back a
chicken."  She said the last words almost recklessly as
she set off to the station.
Sle looked back towards the cottage, but tlough Al- ,
fred Wimple had strolled down to the gate after she had
left it, his face was turned towards Liphook. There was
something almost fierce in her voice as she spoke to the
gardener, who was driving,
"The pony seems inclined to procrastinate-you liad
better cllastise him."
"Tlhey have spoiled him up at the house," said Lucas,
"till he won't go nohow unless he gets a bit of the
whip."
"He goes very well witl me," she snapped.
" Ie knows your hland, most likely-they do get to know
lbands."





<pb n="243"/>AUNT ANNE                   243
She made no answer, but looked at the holes of the
sand martens in the cutting on one side of the road-
they always fascinated her-and at the bell heather which
was just beginning to show a tinge of color. "He's a
bad 'un to shy, he is," Lucas went on; "and lie's not par-
ticular what it's at-whleelbarrows, and umbrellas, and per-
ambulators, and covered carts, and tramps-lie don't like
tramps, he don't-and bicycles, and children if there's a
few of 'em together, and bits of paper on the road-lie's
ready to be afraid of anything. There's Toin Mitchell
coming along with the letters-would you like to stop ?"
"I do not expect any, but I may as well put the ques-
tion to him," the old lady said, very distantly, for she was
of opinion that Lucas talked too much for his station.
But he was not to be abashcd easily.
"Them beeches is coming on," he said. Aunt Anne
looked up, but made no answer. "Everything is so late
this year on account of the cold. Tom, have you got any
letters for Mrs. Wimple at thli cottage ?"
" There's one, I know, with a foreign post-mark." The
man stopped and took a packet out of 'he leather wallet
by his side.
Aunt Anne, leaning over the cart, saw, as he pulled out
the letter with the French stamps on it for her, that there
was another beneath, directed, in an illiterate-looking hand,
to "A. Wimple, Esq.," and that it had the Liphook post-
mark. Her eyes flashed; she could hardly make her voice
steady as she said,
"I see you have one there for Mr. Wimple; you will
find him at the cottage."  Then she drove on. She
looked at her own letter, a little bewildered. "It is not
from Walter or Florence," she said, " yet I know the hand-
writing"-and gazed vacantly at the hedges again, while





<pb n="244"/>244                 AUNT ANNE
Peter the pony, urged by arguments from the whip, went
on more swiftly towards the station. Lucas's remarks fell
unheeded on her ears. Sometling was tightening round
her heart that made her cheeks burn with a fire they had
not felt for long years past.
" I think we'll have more rain-them clouds over there
seem like it," the man said, wondering why she was so
silent, for she generally liked a chat with himn. "Maybe
she wanted to drive him herself," he thought; "I forgot
to offer her the reins, and it's no good changing now, we
are so near the station. The train's signalled," he said, as
they pulled up; " but you are in plenty of time."
" I calculated that I should have sufficient time," she
answered.
" Would you like me to meet you this afternoon ? I
will, if you tell me what train you are coming down by."
Sle was silent for a minute, tlen, suddenly, she seemed to
find courage.
"I slall leave London by the four thirty train," she
said. "It is due at Witlcy at a quarter past six, and I
shall expect to find you there."  She walked into the sta-
tion, with almost a hunted look.
She managed to get into an empty carriage, shut the
door, and stood up by the window, winking sternly at the
passengers whlo, in passing, hesitated whether or not to
enter. As the train moved off she shut the window, and,
sitting down with a sigh, stared out at the fir-woods and
tle picturesque Surrey cottages. She did not see them;
she saw nothing and heard notling but the rattle of tlhe
train, that gradually shaped itself into the word Liphook-
Liphook-Liphook-till she was maddened. "It might
have been some one writing to importune lim for money,"
she said, thinking of the letter. But if the difficulty at





<pb n="245"/>AUNT ANNE                  245
Liplook were only debt, she felt certain that Alfred Wim-
ple would not have spared her the annoyance of knowing
it. It was a mystery of which her indomitable pride re-
fused her the suggestion of one solution, which yet seemed
gradually, and from without, to be getting burned upon
her brain. A despair that was half dread was taking pos-
session of her. A desperate knowledge was bearing down
upon her that the only chance she had of keeping the
man to whom she hlad bound herself was by giving him
money. Ile was evidently at his wit's end for it, and had
no resource of his own, and whatever was the attraction
at Liphook it did not seem to include money. HIer one
clance was to give it him, and to let him see that she
would not fail to give it him-then, perhaps, he would stay
with her. She stretched out her arms for a moment as if
she were drowning, and trying to save herself by holding
on to him, but she stretched them only into space, and
clutched nothing. " Perhaps he thinks because I am old
I cannot love properly. Oil, my dear one, if you would
only speak to me out of your own heart, or if you could
only look into my heart-for that is not old; it is young.
Age makes no difference if he did but know it-I feel the
same as wlen I was twenty, and we walked between the
chestnuts to the farm. It is only the years that have
marked me." And then anger and pride chased away her
misery and tenderness. "I will have it settled," she said;
" I will know wlhat it means; and if he has not treated me
properly he shall be called to account. If Walter and Flor-
ence were only in England, I should not be in this sad
dilemmla."  The mention of their names made her re-
member the letter in her pocket. She pulled it out and
opened it; it was the one Mrs. North had written from
Marseilles. At another time she would have liked the





<pb n="246"/>246                 AUNT ANNE
congratulations, or have been indignant at the divorce.
Now she passed the news by witl little more than a scorn-
ful wink. " It is most presumptuous of her to have writ-
ten to me; she has taken a great liberty; she has commit-
ted a solecism," she said, almost mechanically. As she
put the letter back into her pocket her hand touched some-
thing she did not remember to have placed there. Site
looked puzzled for a moment, then drew it out. It was a
little necktie of Alfred Wimple's, blue witl white spots 
on it. She understood-it was soiled and frayed; she had
put it into her pocket to mend. She looked at it, wonder-
ingly, for a moment, then kissed it with a vehemence that
was almost passion.
" He thinks I cannot love," she said; " I am convinced
that is it. If he did but know; if he did but know."
The servant who opened the door at Plortman Square
instantly recognized her, and was disposed to treat her
with more respect than on a former occasion.
" Mr. Boughton is not here, ma'am," he said, in answer
to her inquiry.
"Would you give me the address of his office ?"
"I can give you the address, but he is away in Scot-
land, and not expected back for another fortnight."  Aunt
Anne stood dumfounded for a moment, then, slowly, she
looked up at the servant, with a little smile that had its
effect.
" It is very unfortunate," she said; " my business with
him is most pressing. Have you good accounts of Sir
William ?"
" Sir William is back, ma'am. He returned last week,
but he is confined to his room with another attack."
"Does he keep his bed ?"
"Well, he is sitting by the fire just now, ma'am, writ-





<pb n="247"/>AUNT ANNE                   247
ing some letters."  In a moment Aunt Anne had whisked
into the house; she felt quite exhilarated.
B" e good enough to take my name to him, and ask if
lie is sufficiently well to see his cousin, Mrs.--Mrs. Baines"
-she hesitated over the last word; "say that I am ex-
trernely solicitous to have a few minutes' conversation
witl him.
" I am afraid he won't be able to see you-" the servant
began.
" Have the goodness to take up my name."
" I am afraid-" the servant began again.
"And say I wish to see him on a matter of great im-
portance," she went on, imperiously, not heeding the in-
terruption. She walked towards the dining-room door, as
if she had a right to the entire house, but suddenly turned
round.
" I feel certain Sir William will see me," she said, "and
I will follow you up-stairs." Ielplessly the servant obeyed
her, and, unfalteringly, the soft footsteps pattered after hlim
up to the second floor. There he entered the front bed-
room, while she remained on the landing.
"Mrs. Baines wishes to know if she can speak 'to you,
sir," site heard him say.
" Tell her I am too ill to see any one," a thin, distinct
voice answered.
" Slhe says it is a matter of cxtreme importance, sir."
" I am writing letters, and don't wish to be disturbed;
bring my chicken-broth in twenty minutes."
But a moment later, and Aunt Anne hlad whisked also
into the room, passing the servant who was leaving it.
"William," she said, " you must not refuse to let me
see you once again. I cannot believe that you are too ill
to shake hands with your cousin, Anne."  As she spoke
N





<pb n="248"/>248                  AUNT ANNE
she looked round the room, and took in all its details at a
glance. It had three windows, a writing-table and a book-
case between them, a big four-post bedstead witl dark
hangings facing them. To the left was a tall wardrobe
of rosewood that had no looking-glass let into its panelled
doors. By the fireplace was a roomy easy-chair in which
sat Sir William RIammnage. He was dressed in a puce wool-
len dressing-gown, and half rolled up in a colored blanket.
By his side was an invalid table, with writing materials on
it, and a flap at the side that stretched over his knees.
In the large fireplace blazed a cheerful fire, and on the
other side of the fireplace, and facing Sir William, there
was a second easy-chair. IIe was evidently a tall man-
thin, nervous, and irritable. His manner was cold and dis-
agreeable, but it conveyed a sense of loneliness, a remem-
brance of long, cheerless years, that in a manner excused it.
He looked like a man who had probably deserved respect,
but had made few friendships. Ite was not nearly as old as
lie appeared at the first glance; illness, and work, and lack
of human interests had aged him more than actual years.
"  ow do you do ?" he said, dryly.
"I have been so grieved to hear of your illness, Will-
iam. I hope you received my letters-I wrote tlree or
four times to tender you my sympathy."  She looked at
the servant in a manner that said, "Go away "-and he
went, carefully shutting the door.
" I am not well enough to receive visitors," Sir William
said, in the same dry voice.
" My dear William, you must let me stay with you five
minutes; I will not intrude longer on your privacy "-and
she seated herself on the chair facing him.
" If what you have to say is of a business nature, I am
not well enough to enter upon it now."





<pb n="249"/>AUNT ANNE                  249
"Did you derive benefit from your stay at Cannes ?-
you,,were constantly in my thoutghts."
"Thank you, thank you."
" I fear you have had to abandon many of your City oc-
cupations," she went on, in a sympathetic voice; "it must
be a great regret to the Corporation. I was speaking of
your mayoralty some months ago to Mr. Fisher, the edi-
tor of The Centre."  Aunt Anne was talking to gain
time. Her throat was choking; her mouth twitched with
restrained excitement.
"Where did you meet hiln?" Sir William asked, in a
judicial manner, tapping the arm of his chair with his thin
fingers.
" I met him at Walter Hibbert's."
IIe was silent and seemed to be waiting for her to go.
For a few moments she could not gather courage to speak
again. IIe looked up at her.
"I am much obliged for this visit," he said, coldly,
"but I cannot ask you to prolong it."
"William," she said, " I came to see you on a matter of
necessity. I would not have intruded had it been other-
wise. On the occasion of my last visit I saw Mr. Bough-
ton, but I nnderstand that he is now away."
" he will be back in two or three weeks; you will then
be able to see him."
She hesitated for a moment, and then went on, doubt-
fully, " I have been deeply touched at your kindness."
" Yes ?" he said, inquiringly.
"That it has been the greatest help to me I need hardly
say; but I have had so many expenses this winter, it was
inadequate to meet them all."
"I don't quite understand ?" IIe was becoming inter-
ested.





<pb n="250"/>250                 AUNT ANNE
" There are some weeks yet before the next quarter is
due. I am staying in a country-lhouse, and the expenses I
have to meet-"
" What country-house ?"
"Walter and Florence IIibbert's. It is a cottage most
charmingly situated in Surrey."
"I suppose it costs you nothing to stay there ?"
"They have been most kind. But they are now abroad,
and, naturally, I have appearances to maintain and the ne-
cessities of the table to provide."
"For whom? Only for yourself, I suppose ? You have
not a large establishment."  Iis thin fingers wandered
beneath the papers on the table, as if they were seeking
for something. They found it, and drew it a little for-
ward. Aunt Anne, following the movement with her
eyes, saw the corner of a check-book peep out from be-
neath the blotting-paper. "You have not a dozen ser-
vants?" he asked, ironically.
"I have only one servant "-she was getting a little
agitated.
"And yourself a?"
"And some one who is with me." 
"And doesn't the some one who is with you keep you?
-or do you keep her ?"-and he pushed back the cleck- 
book. Aunt Anne was silent for a moment. "I suppose
it doesn't cost you anything to live. What do you want
money for?" He put his hands on the arms of his chair
and looked at her.
"William," she said, "I cannot discuss all my expendi-
tures, or enter into every detail of my household"-and
there was as much pride in her tone as she dared put into
it. "I came to ask you if you would have the great kind-
ness to advance the quarter's allowance you are so kind as
to give me. It will be due-"





<pb n="251"/>AUNT ANNE                 251
" Quarter's allowance I give yon ? I don't understand.
I told you some time ago that I was not in the habit of
giving away money. I believe you had sonle of your
own when you started in life, and if you made away with
it that is your own business."
"But, William, I am speaking of the hundred a year
you have allowed me lately through Mr. Boughton."
IHe was fairly roused now, and turned his face full upon
her. There were cruel, pitiless lines upon it, though she
fought against them bravely.
"I have allowed you no hundred a year," he said, an-
grily, " and I intend to allow you none. Do you mean to
tell me that Boughton has paid you a hundred a year on
my account ?"
" I understood so," she gasped, shaking witl fright.
"I suppose he had some reason for it. If he has done
it out of his own money, it is his own business. If lie
has done it out of mine, I shall have a reckoning up with
him, and probably you wvill have one, too."
"But, William, have you been under the impression
that I was left to starve ?"
"I was under no impression at all concerning you.
Once for all, Anne, you must understand that it is not
my intention to give away the money for which I have
worked to people who have been idle."
" I have not been idle," she said; "and you forget that
I am your cousin, that our mothers-"
"I know all that," he said, interrupting her; " your peo-
ple and you had your own way to make in life, and so
had I and my people."
" But if you do not help me-" she burst out, for she
could bear it no longer-- "if you do not help me, I shall
starve."





<pb n="252"/>252                  AUNT ANNE
"I really don't see what claim you have upon me."
"I am your cousin, and I am old, and I slhall starve," she
repeated. "I must have money to-day. If I don't take
back money this afternoon my heart will break."  Again
his fingers went for a moment in the direction of the
check-book and tantalized her. She stood up and looked
at him, entreatingly. " I am not speaking only for myself,"
she pleaded, "but for another-" and she broke down.
"For whom else are you speaking, then?" he asked,
withdrawing his fingers.
" For one who is very dear to me, and who will starve,
too, unless you help us. William, I entreat you to remem-
ber-"
"But wllo is this pauper you are helping, and why
should I help her, too ?"
"It is not a pauper," she said, indignantly. "It is
some one who is dearer than all the world to me; and,
once more, I entreat you to help us."
" Well, but who is it ?-is it a child ?"
"No," she answered, in a low voice, full of infinite ten-
derness, and she clasped her hands and let her chin fall
on her breast.
"Who is it ?" he repeated, sternly.
"It is my husband !"-and almost a sob broke from her.
"Your husband !-I thought he was dead ?"
"Mr. Baines is dead-long ago; but-I have married
again."
"Married again ?" he repeated, as if he could hardly be-
lieve his ears.
"Yes, married again, and that is why I implore you to
help me, so that I may give the young, tender life that is
joined to mine the comforts that are necessary to him,"
she said, with supplicating misery.





<pb n="253"/>AUNT ANNE                  253
"Do you mean to say"-and he looked at her as if lie
thoulght she was mad-" that some young man has married
you "
"Yes," she answered, in a low voice; " we have been
married nearly eight months."
"And has he got any money ?-or does he do anything
for a living ?"
"lie is a most brilliant writer, and has given the great-
est satisfaction to Mr. Fisher; but he has been ill, and lie
requires country air and nourishment and luxuries-and I
implore you to help me to preserve this young and beauti-
ful life that has been confided to me."
" Is he a cripple or mad ?"
Slie looked up, in astonishment.
" le is a fine, tall young man !" she said, with proud in-
dignation. " I should not have married a cripple, William,
and I have already told you that he is a writer on The
Centre, though he is not able at present to do his talents
justice."
" So you have to kdep lin ?"
" He kept me when he had money; he gave me him-
self, and all he possessed in the world."
"What did he marry you for?" Sir William asked, gaz-
ing at ler, in wonder, and almost clutching the arms of his
chair.
"He married me-" her voice trembled and she
drooped her head again-"lie married me because-be-
cause he loved me."
"Loved you! What should he love you for ?"
" William, do you wish to insult me? I do not see
why he should not love me, or wliy he should pretend to
do so if he did not."
"And I suppose you love lim ?" he said, pulling the





<pb n="254"/>254                  AUNT ANNE
blanket farther up over his knees and speaking in a scorn-
ful, incredulous voice.
"Yes, William, I do-I love him more than all the
world; and unless you will help me so that I may give
him those things that he requires and make our little
home worthy of his residence in it, you vill break my
heart-you will kill him, and you will break my heart,"
shie repeated, passionately. "I will conceal nothing from
you-we are starving. We have not got a pound in the
world-we have not even food to eat. HIe is young, and re-
quires plenty of nourishment; he is not strong, and wants
luxuries."
" And you want me to pay for them ?"
But she did not seem to hear him, and swept on-
" He must have them or he will die. We have spent
every penny we had-I have even borrowed money on my
possessions. I can conceal things from strangers, but you
and I belong to the same family, and what I say to you I
know is sacred-we are starving, William, we are starving,
and I implore you to help me. He says he cannot stay
unless I take back money-that he will go and leave me."
Something seemed to gather in her throat-thlere was a
ring of fright and despair in her voice as she said the last
words. "He will leave me, and it will break my heart,
for he is all the world to me. It will break my heart if
he goes, and unless I take back money he will leave me !"
"And let you starve by yourself?-a nice man to
marry."
" William," she said, " he must remember what is due
to himself. He cannot stay if he has not even food to
eat."
"And, pray, who is this gentleman ?"
" I have told you that he is a brilliant writer."





<pb n="255"/>AUNT ANNE                  255
"What is his name ?"
"I don't think I am justified in telling you-lie does
not wish our marriage to be known."
"I can quite understand that," Sir William answered,
ironically. "Did he tell you to come to me for money ?"
[     "Yes, he told me to do so," she said, tragically, " lie
knew your good heart."
" Knew my good heart, did he ?"  There was a deadly
pallor spreading over Sir William's face that frightened
her. For a moment his lips moved without making a
soundi, then h]1 recovered his voice, "Tell me his name-
what is it?"
"William-" she began.
" What is it ?" he cried, and his breath came short and
quick.
She was too scared to demur any longer.
"It is Alfred Wimple "-and her heart stood still.
He gazed at her for a moment in silence.
"Wimple," he said-" wllat, Boughton's nephew ? That
skunk he had to turn out of his office ?"
" le is Mr. Boughton's nepllew; and he left his uncle's
office because the duties were too arduous for his health."
"Hle left his uncle's office because he was kicked out
of it. Do you mean to tell me that you have married
him-a man who never did a day's work in his life or
paid a bill that he owed ? And as for writing, I don't be-
lieve one word of it. It's not a month ago that his uncle
told me of some old woman, his landlady, forsooth! wlho
had been to him with a long bill-"
"It was for his professional chambers. A man in his
position requires them."
"Yes; and he'd been sponging on the woman's mother,
too, in the country. Were you with him ?"





<pb n="256"/>256                 AUNT ANNE
"No,Willian, I was not"-and, suddenly, a load was
lifted from Aunt Anne's heart. The mystery of Liphook
appeared to be solved, and Alfred Wimple's account of his
debts to be verified. A world of tenderness rushed back
into her heart and gave her strength and courage to fight
her battle to the end. "No, I was not with him," she re-
peated; and as she looked np a smile, a look of almost
happiness, was on her face, that made her cousin more 
wonder-struck than ever. " He required country air to in-
vigorate him, and our means would not admit of-"
"Boughton has been allowing you a hundred a year,"
said Sir William, "and this Wimple has married you," lie
went on, a light seeming to break upon him. "I am be-
ginning to understand it. I presume he knows that you
are my cousin ?"
" Yes, I told lim that you were-lie spoke of you witli
admiration," Aunt Anne added, always more anxious to
say something gratifying to her listener than to be strictly
veracious.
" I ave no doubt he did. Pray, wlen did this fine love-
making begin ?" Sir William asked, scornfully.
"Nearly a year ago," she answered, in a faltering voice,
for slhe was almost beaten in spite of the relief that liad
been given her a minute or two ago.
" And when did Boughton begin to allow you this hun.
dred a year ?"
"About the time of my marriage."
"I perfectly understand. I'll tell you the reason of
your marriage and of his love for you in a moment."
With an effort he stretched out his liand and touched tle
bell. " Charles," he said, when the servant entered, "un-
lock my safe."
The man pulled back a curtain that lad been drawn





<pb n="257"/>AUNT ANNE                  257
across a recess to hide an iron door. "On the top of the
slhelf to thle left you will see a blue envelope labelled ' Last
Will and Testament.' Give it to me," Sir William said.
A scared look broke over Aunt Anne's face.
" Lock'the safe and go-no, stop-give me some brandy
first."
The servant poured a little into a glass from a bottle
which stood on the writing-table between the windows.
The old man's hand shook while he took it. Aunt Anne,
looking at him like a culprit waiting for punishment, no-
ticed a blackness round his mouth and that the lines in his
face were rigid.
"Shall I bring you some chicken-broth, Sir William?"
the servant asked.
" When I ring. Go."  Then he turned to Aunt Anne.
"Now I will tell you why this young man loved you." Ie
said the last words witl an alnost fiendish chuckle. " ITe
loved you because, being a clerk in his uncle's office, the
office froln which he had to be kicked, he probably knew-
in fact, I am certain that he knew, for he came to ask me
your Christian name when the instructions were being
given-tliat I lad provided for you in my will. I do
not choose to pauperize people while I live, but I consid-
ered it my duty to leave some portion of my wealtl to
my relations, no matter how small a claim they had upon
me. IIe kalcw that you woulld get a fourth slare of my
noney-probabjy he reckoned it up and calculated that it
would amount to a good many thousand pounds, so he and
Boughton concocted a scleme to get hold of it together."
"Mr. Boughton knew notling of our marriage."
"I tell you it was all a scheme. What should Bough-
ton allow you a hundred a year for ?" IIe was grasping the
will while he spoke.

"He knew nothing about it, William-neither did Al1
fred."
"Well, we'll put his disinterestedness to the test"-and
he tried to tear the will in half, but his fingers were too
weak.
" Oh no," she cried, "no-no-"
"Do you suppose a youpg man would marry an old
woman like you for any reason but gain ? That you
should have been such a fool! And for that nnwhole-
some-looking cur with his long, rickety legs and red hair-
wly, he looks like a stale prawn," the old man said, de-
risively, and made another effort to tear the will.
"I cannot bear it-William, I implore you "-and sle
clasped her hands witl terror.
lie leaned forward, witl an effort, and put the will on
tile fire.
"Oh no, no," she cried again, and, kneeling down, al-
most snatcled it from the flames.
HIe took the poker between his two wlite hands, and
held the paper down witl it.
"It is cruel-cruel-" she began, as she watclled it dis-
appear from lher sight.
" I tlink I have made the case clear," he said; "and
that you will see there is nothing to be gained by staying.
My money was not made to benefit Mr. Alfred Wimnple.
I shall make another will, and it will not contain your
name."  IIe rang tie bell again.
" You have treated me cruelly-cruelly-but Heaven
will frustrate you yet-"  Anguish and dignity were
strangely blended in her voice, but she hesitated a mo-
ment and it seemed as if the latter had gained the victory
wheln she went on, " Yon and I will probably never meet
again, William ; you have insulted me shamefully, and





<pb n="259"/>AUNT ANNE                   259
you will remember it whlen it is too late to ask my forgive-
ness. You liave insulted me and treated me heartlessly,
yet it was beside us when we were children that our moth-
ers-_-" the servant entered with a cup of chicken-brotll.
" Good-by, Mrs. Alfred Wimple," Sir William said, po-
litely. " Chlarles, show Mrs. Wimple down-stairs."
The man was bewildered at the strange name, and looked
at Aunt Anne doubtfully. Sir William clutched at the
arms of his chair again, and his head sank back upon the
pillow.
"William-" she began.
"Go !" he said, hoarsely. For a moment she lhesitated,
a red spot had burned itself on her check, and slowly she
followed the servant down tlhe stairs.





<pb n="260"/>CHAPTER XIX
AUNT ANNE went slowly along Portman Square. She
felt, and it was a cruel moment to do so, that she was
growing very old. IHer feet almost gave way beneath
her; her hands llad barely strength to hold her cloak to-
gether over lier clhest. There was a little cold breeze
passing by; as it swept over her face she realized that
she was half stunned and sad and sick at heart. But she
dragged on, step by step, stopping once, to hlold by the
iron railings of a house, before she could find strength
enough to turn into a side-street.
" I won't believe it," she said ; "it was not for the
money. IIe could not have known ; lis uncle would not
liave told limn-it is not likely that he would have be-
trayed the confidence of a client."  And then she remen-
bered wlhat Sir William had said about the debt to the
landlady in the Gray's Inn Road and to the mother ih
the country. Of course that meant Liplook. It gave
ler a world of comfort, lad lifted a terrible dread from
her heart, so that, even in spite of the insults of the last
hour, she felt that her morning visit lad not been wholly
thrown away. She had not the faculty of looking for-
ward very far, and it did not occur to her as yet that, by
revealing her marriage, she had ruined her prospects with
her cousin. It was the insults tliat had enraged her; the
going back to Witley, thle day's dinner, and the very near
future, that perplexed her. A month, even a week, lence





<pb n="261"/>AUNT ANNE                   261
might take care of itself, provided to-day were made easy;
it had always been so with her.
She was bewildered, staggered, for want of money; she
liad just two shillings in the world. Florence and Walter
were still away; she could think of no one of wlom to
borrow. she came to a confectioner's shop, and looked
at it hesitatingly, for she was tired and exhausted. Even
though Alfred Wimple waited at the other end, merciless-
ly ready to count the coins witl wlich she returned, sle
felt tlhat he must buy a few minutes' rest for herself. She
wanted to sit down and think. She tottered into the
shop, and having asked for a cup of tea, waited for it,
with a sigh of relief, in a dark corner. But she was too
mDuch stupefied and beaten to think clearly. When thle
tea came, hot and smoking, in a thick white cup, to which
her lips clung gratefully, she felt better. She began to
burn witl indignation, which was an excellent sign; she
crushed Sir William Ramnmage out of her thoughts, and
winked almost savagely, as tloughl she lad felt him under
her foot. she told herself again that Alfred could not
have known about the will, and had not deceived her
about Liphook. she even tried to think of hlin affection-
ately, but tlhat was difficult, with tlhe dread of his face
before her if she returned empty-handed. But she did
not think of the money question as despairingly now as
slie had done a few minutes since; she had a firm belief
in her own power of resource. She felt certain that when
slie had reflected, calmly, something would suggest itself.
Slie remembered Mrs. Northl; but it was not possible to
borrow of her, for she had forfeited all consideration to
the regard Aunt Anne thought it necessary to feel for
any one from whom she could accept a loan.
" I cannot do tlat, even for Alfred," she said. "I hlave





<pb n="262"/>262                 AUNT ANNE
always held my head high; I cannot lower it to Mrs. North,
even for him."  But slic took the letter from her pocket
and read it over again. " she does not seem to compre-
liend the difference in our positions," shle said, as she put
it back into the envelope, though not before she had no-
ticed, with a keen eye, that Mrs. North had said she
would be back in England very soon, and calculated that
that could not mean just yet. " If Walter and Florence
were in London I should be relieved of this anxiety im-
mediately," she thought. Then a good idea seemed to
strike her. She considered it from every point of view,
and felt at last that it was feasible. " I am quite sure,"
shie told lierself, " tiat Florence would say I was justified
in going to her mother in her absence. I will explain to
her tlhat there are some tlhings her daughter would wish
me to bny, and ask her to let me ihave sufficient money
to defray their cost. Besides," slhe added, as an after-
thought, "I must see those dear children; Florence, I
know, would wish me to do so; and it is an attention I
ouglit not to onmit, after all the regard and kindness that
she and dear Walter have always shown me."  she got
up and looked longingly at the buns and tarts in the win-
dow; though she had only one unbroken shilling left, she
could not wholly curb her generosity.
"Would you put ine a couple of sponge-cakes into a
bag?" sihe said to the young woman. "I liope they are
quite fresh; I prefer them a little brown."  She walked
away, justified and refreshed, holding the paper bag by
the corner.
But wlien she arrived at the house near Regent's Park,
it was only to be told that Florence's mother had gone out
for the day, and that the children had not yet returned
from their morning walk. The servant, seeing how dis-





<pb n="263"/>AUNT ANNE                   263
appointed sihe looked, begged her to come in and wait for
a little while. "I don't think they'll be long, ma'am,"
slhe said, almost gently. " For," as she explained to her
fellow-servants afterwards, "I could not llelp being sorry
for an old lady who had made a stupid of herself like
that."  Aunt Anne hesitated a nmoment. " There's a nice
fire in the dining-room," the servant continued, and, having
persuaded her to enter, site turned the easy-chair round,
an asked if slec should make a cup of tea.
lThank you, no," said Aunt Anne, in a tone that showed
she was sensible of the desire to please her, but was, never-
tlieless, aware of her own position in society. " I do not
require any refreshment; I have just partaken of an early
liunch."  She turned, gratefully, to the fire when she was
alone, and, putting her feet on the fender, faced her diffi-
culties once more. She could not remember any human
being in London from wihomn, under any pretext whatever,
she could borrow. She was baffled and at bay. The mem-
ory of Sir William's taunts vanished altogether as, with a
fright that was gradually becoming feverish, she went
over in her mind every possible means of raisiig even a
few shillings-tlhoulg  a few shillings, slhe knew, would be
virtually useless against the tide she had to stein. Of a
very small sum she wlas already certain, for she had de-
vised a means of raising it, but she feared it would only
be sufficient to provide food for the evening, and perhaps
for to-morrow-and then? She folded her hands and
looked into the fire, shaking her head once or twice, as if
various s  ms vschem ere presenting themselves, only to be
rejected. Tlhe clock on the mantelpiece struck half-past
one; at lialf-past four her train left Waterloo Station.
There was little time to lose. she got up, took off ler
cloak, and examined it carefully, tllen put it round her once





<pb n="264"/>264                  AUNT ANNE
more, fingering the clasp, while she fastened it, as if it
were a thing sihe treasured. As she did so, her eye caught
a little pile on the mantelpiece; it consisted of seven
slillings in silver, with a half-sovereign on the top. She
looked at it as if fascinated, and calculated precisely all
it would buy. Slic remembered, witlh dismay, that Jane
Mitclell's weekly wages were due that evening, that Jane's
mother was ill, and the money was necessary. she heard
again the hard voice in which Alfred had said, " Unless
you bring back money, I shall not stay here any longer."
Sle could see his eyes, dull and unrelenting.
"I know they would give it to me; I know that Walter
and Florence would deny me notling that was really for
my happiness," she thouglit, and rang the bell. " I fear
I shall not be able to stay and see the children," she said,
haughtily, to the servant, but with a little excitement slle
could not keep out of her voice; "my train is, unfortu-
nately, an early one. And would you tell their grand-
mother I have ventured to borrow this seventeen shillings
on the mantelpiece? I came up to town with less money
than I find I require; I will write to her in a day or two,
and return it."
"It's the children's money, ma'ain ; I heard their grand-
mother say they were to save it up for Christmas."
" Dear children !" said the old Jady, with a little smile;
"they will be delighted to hear that I have borrowed it.
Tell them that Aunt Anne is their debtor. Give them
these two sponge-cakes-they will think of nc while tliey
eat them."  she snapped her purse as she put the money
into it, and left the liouse with a light footstep.
She walked on towards Portland Road. There was
only one tiling more to do, and that must be done quickly.
It would add perhaps ten shillings to her purse, but even





<pb n="265"/>AUNT ANNE                   265
that would be a precious sum. she hesitated a moment.
A threat of rain was in the air, but she did not feel it.
The chilly wind touched her face, but it did not make her
shiver, now that her courage had returned. She looked
up and down Great Portland Street, doubtfully, then
went slowly, but with decision, towards a street she knew
well.
A quarter of an hour later she was in an omnibus, going
to Watlrloo Station. The cloak with the steel clasp had
disappeared; on her face was an expression that betrayed
sle had gone through an experience that depressed ler.
Slhe watclled the people hurrying by in hansoms, and re-
membered the day she had driven in one herself to sec
Alfred Wimple off to the country-the day on wlicl
Florence had given her the five-pound note. She was
very weary, and beginning to long for home. She planned
the evening dinner, and got out a little before sel reached
Waterloo, in order to buy it at the shops near the station.
There hlad been concealed beneath her cloak all the morn-
ing a square bag, made of black stuff, whicl now she car-
ried on lier arm. When she stood on the platform wait-
ing for her train it was no longer flat and empty, but
bulged into strange shlapes that were oddly suggestive.
In her hand she carried three bunches of primroses, and
a smaller one of violets; under lier arm were some even-
ing papers. She looked satisfied, and almost happy, for
sle felt that a few hours at least of contentment were
before her. She entered her third-class carriage, thinking
of the day she had seen Alfred Wimple off to Liphook;
slhe remembered, with a little triumph, how she had ex-
changed his ticket. " I am sure the papers will be a sol-
ace to him," she said; "writing for the press must give
him a deep interest in public affairs-it must have been a





<pb n="266"/>266                  AUNT ANNE
great deprivation to himn not to know what was going on.
My dear Alfred!-these violets shall be my offering to
him as soon as I arrive; I cannot do enough to compensate
bim for William's cruel aspersions on his character. My
darling, if I only had tlousands I would give them to you;
I would make them into a carpet for you to walk ipon !"
She was alone in the carriage; she put her bag down
beside her on the hard scat, and shut the windows, for
the drizzling rain was coming in, aslant, and chilled her.
Once or twice a sharp pang of pain darted through her
shoulders, but slic did not mind; shec was dreaming among
illusions, and found a passing spell of happiness that
brought a smile to her lips and a wink of almost merry
anticipation to her eye, as she saw the little dinner slie
had devised set out, and Alfred facing her at table. Slce
imagined limn saying, in the solemn- manner in whicl lie
said everything, " I feel better, Anne," when he ad fin-
ished, and she knew that in those few words she would
find a baln for all the insults and misery of the last few
hours. She repented now that she was returning by tile
early train; it seemed like treachery to him. It had been
almost noble of him to conceal from her the embarrass-
inmg debt he had at Lipliook. "IIe has evidently been
reticent," she thought, " from a desire to save me pain.
My dear one !-I have wronmged him lately, but I will mnake
it up to him this evening. I will tell himii that there is
no poverty or sorrow I should not think it a privilege to
slare with him."  she peered out of the window at the
landscape dulling with tlhe rain. " I hope he is not in
tlhe garden," she thought. "IIe will catch cold, and his
cough was so bad last week. I am glad I remembered
to bring some lozenges for him."
The train sped on past Woking and the fir-woods be-





<pb n="267"/>AUNT ANNE                   267
yond; they reminded lier of the trees round the cottage
at Witley. When it was dark to-niglit, she would look
up at them before she bolted the door after Jane Mitchlll.
And then she and Alfred would sit over the fire and talk;
lie would feel so much better after his dinner, she was
sure he would be kind to her. IIe had been worried late-
ly with poterty, but just for a little while he should for-
get it. With the future she did not concern herself, for
sle had already devised a plan that would make it easy.
She would go and see Mr. Boughton5 and of course lie
would help them when he heard that Alfred was her hus-
band. IIe would continue the allowance he had given
them, and when Sir William Rammage made a Inew will lie
would take care that it was not an iufiquitous one. It had
never seriously occurred to her that William would leave
her money, though, once or t\ice, the possibility Ilad
crossed her mind. But she had never been able to look
forward at all for herself. " Now," she thought, "I must
give the future my consideration. I must think of it for
my dear Alfred. Luxuries are necessary to hlim; he cannot
divest himself of his longing for them. Perhaps when
Mr. Boughton returns he will make William ashamed of
lis conduct to me to-day, and he will do something for
us before he dies; it would be very detrimental to his
pride that we should starve, and I did not mince words
to-day." The train passed Milford Station; in a few min-
utes she would l)e at Witley. " I hope Alfred won't be
angry witl me for coming by the earlier train," slie
thoughlt, with some misgiving. " I will explain to him
that I had finished my commissions in town sooner than
I lad anticipated, and, seeing that the weather was not
likely to improve, I thought it better to return, even at
the risk of his displeasure."





<pb n="268"/>268                  AUNT ANNE
The governess-cart was waiting for her.
" I brought an umbrella," Lucas said, " as it was rain-
ing. I noticed you went without one this morning, and
tile weather has come on that unexpected bad, I was
afraid you would get wet through."
"I am most grateful for your thoughtfulness," Aunt
Anne said, with distant graciousness. she put her bag
out of reach of the rain, and cared little for herself. She
was too full of other matters to trouble about the weather.  :
As slhe went along the straight road, of which by this
time slio knew every yard, she mentally counted up tile
shillings in her pocket, and considered that she ought to
give one of them to Lucas. " Ie has been most atten-
tivc," she said, and she managed to extract tie coin from
her pocket, and put it into her black silk glove, ready for
the end of tlle journey, which she considered would be
tlhe right moment to present it. Tie rain came down
steadily. It was no longer aslant or fitful, and in tile
sky overhead there were no changing clouds. "I fear
you have had an unfavorable day," slhe said to Lucas.
"It has rained mostly all the time. I hope you won't
catch cold, ina'am. I tlought I saw you with a cloak
this morning; have you left it behind "
Aunt Anne resented the question ; she thought it was
unduly familiar, and she answered, coldly,
"I have left it behind-for a purpose. It required ren-
ovating," she added.
"I might have brought you a shawl, or something, if I
iad known. I called at the house as I passed to sec if
Mr. Wimple would like to come and meet you. But lie
wasn't in."
"I hope he is not out in the rain," she said to herself.
Did tlhe servant say if he had been out lon ?'" she asked.





<pb n="269"/>AUNT ANNE                  269
"Sle said he had been gone half an hour. It's a pity
I missed him."
" Ie probably lad an engagement," she said, and a lit-
tle uneasiness stole over her. Another mile. she could
scarcely conceal her impatience. "Couldn't the pony run
up this little lill ?" she asked.
"It could," said Lucas, rather contemptuously; "but
Mrs. Burnett don't like him to run uphill, she don't-she
thinks it's bad for him."  Aunt Anne was too much en-
grossed in her own thoughts to answer. " Ie goes faster
tlhan the donkey did last year, anyhow, ma'am ; do you
mind the donkey ?"
"I frequently drove him."
"IHe was a deal of trouble, he 'vas," Lucas went on;
"and they didn't do well by himn-gave four pound ten
for him, and when they come to sell him a year later they
only got two pound five."
"So that they were mulcted of just half the sum for
which they had purchased him," she said, absently, having
quickly done the sum in her head. " Was tlere any rea-
son for tlhat ?"
"Well, you see, this was it," said Lucas-" when gentry
first come to live about here they took to keeping don-
keys, so donkeys went up; then after a bit they found
they wouldn't go, and they took to selling them and buy-
ing ponies, so donkeys went down. I am afraid you are
getting very wet, ma'aln. I wisl I had thought to bring
a rug to cover you. But here we are at the house, and
you'll be able to dry yourself by the fire."
"Thank you, Lucas, thank you," and she slipped the
shilling into his hand, and, taking her bulging bag from
under the seat, walked into the house by the back door.
"Jane," she asked, the moment she crossed the thresh-
old, " where is Mr. Wimple ?"





<pb n="270"/>270                  AUNT ANNE
"He went out an hour and a lialf ago, ma'ain."
"Do you know in what direction he went ?"
"Well, last time I saw him he was in the garden; then
I see him going down the dip."
She was silent for a moment, then she asked, gently,
"Was he at home all the morning?" and received an
answer in the affirmative. She was silent, and seemed to
turn something over in her mind.
"      You are quite sure he went down the dip, and not
more than an hour and a lialf ago?"  she stood by the
kitchen fire, and she spoke absently. "I have brought a
sole for dinner," she said. " I must ask you to cook it
more carefully than you did the last one, Jane. Mr.
Wimple is most particular about fish-lhe cannot eat it
unless it is quite dry. After the sole there is a chicken
and some asparagus. Give me my bag-thlere are some
other tliings in it, and a bottle of claret at tlhe bottom,
which I wish put on the dining-room mntel-slelf for an
hour. I trust you have made a good fire, Jane?"
" Yes, ma'am; but I had to do it of wood, for the coals
are nearly out."
" I prefer wood; it is not my intention to liave more
coal just yet," said Aunt Anne, firmly. " Where lave you
put the primroses I brought? I wisl to arrange them in
a bowl for the centre of the table."
"Iadn't you better take off your shlawl first, ma'am
-it's wringing wet-and let nme make you a cup of
tea ?"
"No, thank you, I will not trouble you to do tlhat,"
Aunt Anne said, gently. "But put Mr. Wimple's slippers
by the fire in the dining-room." She went into the draw-
ing-room and held a match to the grate, and stood beside
it wliile the paper blazed and the wood crackled, thinking





<pb n="271"/>AUNT ANNE                   271
tliat she and Alfred would sit over the fire cosily that
evening after dinner.
"I am sure he is worried about money," she said to
herself, "and that he is in debt; but he shall not have
tlese anxieties long-it is much better that his uncle
should know about our marriage."  IIer eyes turned tow-
ards the window ani the garden and the trees with the
rain falling on them. "I wonder if he has gone far; I
hope he is not depressed. I fear he worries himself un-
duly," she said, and went into the dining-room. The slip-
pers were toasting in the fender; she turned the easy-
chlair towards the fire and put beside it a little table from
the corner of the room. Then she went for the papers
she had brought from London, and arranged them on it,
and put the little bunch of violets in a glass and set it
by the papers. She drew back and looked at the cosey
arrangement with satisfaction. "Mly darling Alfred !"
slhe said to herself; and tlhen, softly, as if she were afraid
of Jane hearing her, she crept out of the front door and
under the veranda that went round the house, and looked
out at the cweather. Thlc rain had nearly stopped, but the
sky was gray and the air was cold. She pulled her shawl
closer, and, trying to shake off the chill that was overtak-
ing her, went swiftly down the garden pathway. At the
far end the grass was long and wet; the drops fell from
the beeches and larches above. she found the narrow
patlway that led to the dip, and went along it. She
looked anxiously ahead, but there was no sign of Alfred.
"I know he will be glad to sec me," she thought. " I
know the silent tenderness of his heart-my darling-my
darling, you are all I have in the world !"
On she went among the gorse, between the firs, and
over the clumps of budding heatler, a limp black figure





<pb n="272"/>272                 AUNT ANNE
in the misty twilight.  She had no definite reason for
supposing he would return that way; but she knew it to
be a short cut from  the Lipliook direction, and some
strange instinct seemed to be sending her on; she did not
hesitate or falter, but just obeyed it. The patlway was
very narrow, the wet growth on either side brusled her
skirts as she passed by-down and down-lower and
lower-towards the valley. On the other side, a quarter
of a mile away, she could see the little thatched shed the
children called their "house," where perhaps in past days
a cow had been tethered. There was not a sign of Al-
fred. " Perhaps he is a little farther on, over the ridge,"
she said, and sped on. A miserable aching was upon her;
she had been out of doors many hours; she was wet and
cold through and through. Every moment the long grasses
and the dead bracken of a past year swept over her feet.
The mist was everywhere. The drops fell from    the
leaves above on to her shoulders. " He must be so cold
and wet," she thought ; "I know he will make his cough
worse; I am glad I kept the lozenges in my pocket."
Slhe hesitated at the bottom of the valley for a moment,
and then began the upward path. "I know he wants
me," she said aloud, witl an almost passionate note in her
feeble voice; "I can feel that he wants me." She looked
through the straggling firs that dotted the ground over
which she was now making her way. Still, tlere was not
a sign of Alfred. Only the trees and the undergrowth,
sodden with the long day's rain.
Suddenly tlere was the sound of a woman's laughter.
She stopped, petrified. It came from the little thatched
shed twenty yards away. The side of the shed was tow-
ards her and only the front of it was open, so that she
could not see who was within it. But she knew that two
people were there. One was a woman, and something





<pb n="273"/>AUNT ANNE                   273
told her that the other was Alfred Wimple. For a min-
ute she could not stir. Theni, as if it had been waiting
for a signal, the rain began to fall, with a soft, swishing
sound, upon the thatched roof of the slled ; upon Aunt
Anne's tlin cashmere shawl; upon all the drooping vege-
tation. The mistiness grl'v deeper, and from the dis-
tances the night began to gather. The black figure stand-
ing in the mist knew that a few yards off there was hidden
from her that wlhicln meant life or deatll. She went a
little nearer to the slied, but her feet almost failed her,
her heart stood still, a sickening dread had laid hold of
her. " I will go round and face them," she thought, and
dragged herself up to the slied. But as--she reached the
corner she heard Alfred Wimple's voice,
"You know it's only for her money that I stay witl
the old woman, Caroline"-and she stopped, resting ler
head and hands against the back and sides of the shied,
from slicer fright at what was coming next.
"Well, but you don't give me any of it," the woman
answered.
"I don't get any myself now."
"Then what do you stay with her for?"
"Because it won't do to let eIcr slip."
"It's mother that makes such a fuss-it's not me;
tlhouglh, of course, it's hard, you always being away like
this."
"Tell her she won't gain anything by making a fuss,"
Alfred Wimple said, in the hard voice Aunt Anne knew
so well.
" she says all the four years we have been married, you
have not kept me decently three months together."
Aunt Anne held on to the shied for dear life, and her
heart stood still.

<pb n="274"/>274                 AUNT ANNE
"I shall keep you decently by and by, Caroline."
"And then she's always going on about what you owe
her. I daren't go up to London any more, she leads me
such a life."
"Tell her I'll pay her by and by," Alfred Wimple said.
"I'm sure if it wasn't for grandmother being at Lip-
hook, I don't know wlat I'd do. Sometimes I think I'd
better get a place of some sort-then I'd be able to help
you."
"But your grandmother doesn't lead you a life, Caro-
line?"
" Well, you see, it was slhe made us get married, so she
can't well, and she has kept mother quiet on that account;
but couldn't you come to us again, Alfred ? I don't be-'
lieve grandmother would mind. She thinks you are very
wise to stay with your aunt if you're going to get her
money, and often tells me I am impatient, but I can't
bear being parted like tllis."
"And I can't bear it either"-something that was
equivalent to tenderness came into his voice. Aunt Anne
drew her breath as she heard it. "You know I am fond
of you; I never was fond of anybody else."
"Mother says whlen you first had her rooms in the
Gray's Inn Road, there was some girl you used to go out
with ?"
"Sle was fond of me," he said; "I didn't care about
her."
" My goodness! look at the rain," said the woman, as
it came pouring down; " we must stay here till it's over
bit. Alfred, you are sure you are as fond of me as ever?"
"I am just as fond of you; I am fonder. You don't
suppose I stay witl an old woman from cloice, do you?
I do it just as much for your sake as mine, Caroline."





<pb n="275"/>AUNT ANNE                  275
"Call me your wife again-you haven't done it lately
-and kiss me, do kiss me!"
" You are my wife," he said, " and you know I am fond
of you, and-"  Aunt Anne heard tlie sound of his kisses.
"I like holding ydu again," he went on, "it's awful being
always with that old woman."
" Well, you don't have to kiss her, as she's your aunt,"
she said, witl a laugh.
"I have to kiss her night and morning," he answered;
"but I get out of lier way as much as possible-you can
bet that."
"Mother and grandmother are always saying, perhaps
she will give you the slip and-leave her money to some-
body else."
" I don't think she'll do that," he said; "but that's one
reason why I keep a sharp look-out."
" Hasn't she got anything now ? You don't seem to
get much out of ler, if she has."
"She's a close-fisted old woman. Come up closer on
my shoulder-I like feeling your face there."
"Suppose she died to- morrow," the woman said-
"wlhere would you be then?"
" Of course there's that danger. One must risk some-
thing."
" And is she sure to get money when this-whlat is it ?
-her cousin-dies?"
" Sle'll get five-and-twenty tlousand pounds. I have
seen his will, so I know it's true."
"Does she know herself ?"
" No"-and he laughed a little short laugh.
Aunt Anne, listening and shuddering, remembered,
oddly, that she had hardly ever heard him laugh in ler
life before.





<pb n="276"/>276                 AUNT ANNE
" But how did you manage to see the will ?"
" I told you before, Caroline, I saw it in my uncle's office;
so there is no mistake about it, if that is what you mean."
Aunt Anne nodded her weary llead to herself. "Will-
iam Rammage was right," she thouglht; " he is justified. I
might have known that at least he would not deceive me."
"And lias she left it all to you, Alfred ?" the girl's
voice-for it was a girl's voice-asked.
" Every penny. I took good care of that; and I'll take
good care she doesn't alter it, too."
" But when do you think she'll get it ?"
"As soon as this cousin of hers dies. he has been
dying these ever so many months," Alfred Wimple said,
discontentedly; "only lie's so long about it."
"But she won't give it to you right away when she has
got it herself. You'll have to wait till she dies."
"I don't think she'll live long," he said, grimly; " I'm
half afraid, sometimes, that slic won't last as long as lie
will, unless he makes haste."
"We'll have good times, Alfred, once we've got our
money ?"
"Yes, we will," he answered, witl determination.
"You mustn't think that I care only for the money,"
the girl went on; "it's your being away that I care about
most."
"I care about money; I want money, Caroline-I don't
like being poor."
" You see, I have always been poor, and don't mind so
mulch."
" You won't be poor by and by, when the old woman is
dead. I hope it won't be long, for I can't stand it much
longer."
"Isn't she kind to you ?"





<pb n="277"/>AUNT ANNE                  277
"I suppose she means to be kind," he said, gratingly.
"She whines about me so, and is always wanting to kiss
me"-and he made a harsh sound in his throat; "I can't
bear being kissed by an old woman."
" It doesn't matter lwen she is your aunt; it isn't as if
you were married to her. Wouldn't it be awful to be
married to an old woman ?"
"Ugh! I think I should kill her, Caroline. Let me
kiss you."
" Let's say all we'll do when we get our money, Alfred,
dear," the girl said, in a wheedling voice. "I am glad
of this rain, fct we can't go back till it leaves off a bit;
let's say all we'll do when wegffet lier money."
"I believe you care more about her money than you
do about me," he said, in the grumbling voice Aunt Anne
knew well.
" No, you don't"-and she laughed a little; "you don't
think that a bit. I am fonder of you than the day I was
married."
" You were fond enough then," he said, almost tender-
ly; "I shall never forget you kissing your wedding-gown
as you sat and stitched at it the night before."
" I thought I'd never get it done in time."
"You were determined to have a new one, weren't you 2"
" I thought it would be unlucky if I didn't, though there
wasn't anybody bnt you to see it. It isn't that I care for
money, Alfred," she went on-" don't tlink it. It's only
mother that makes the fuss. We'll pay lier up quick
when we've got it, and we'll be awfully good to grand-
mother; but, as for me, I wouldn't care if you hadn't a
penny. It's only you I want."
" And it's only you I want," he said, with a little cough
that belied his words.





<pb n="278"/>278                 AUNT ANNE
"What is that rustling, Alfred?-is there any one
about ?"
"It's only the rain among the grass and leaves; I wish
it'd leave off-I ought to be getting in."
"What time is she coming back from London ?"
"I expect she'll be here soon now. You had better
give me that money, Caroline."
"It's hidden in my dress-wait till I get it out; I hope
mother won't hear I was paid, or she'll wonder what I've
done with it."
"I can't do without a little money," he said, in the
tone Aunt Anne had often heard; "and the old woman
is so close-fisted slhe expects me to account for everything
she gives me."
"Well, there it is-twenty-two shillings and sixpence.
I don't want grandmother to know, for she said last time
she wondered you liked taking it."
"A man has a right to his wife's earnings," he said,
firmly.
" Well, I've got three dresses in the house to do; they'll
come to a good bit. It isn't that I mind giving it. Al-
fred, there's some one against the back of the shed."
"It's only the branches of the trees brushing against
it," he said. "I must go back-the old woman will be
coming home."
"Don't go till it stops raining a bit," she pleaded;
"and put your arms tighter round me, I am not with you
so often now. Aren't you glad I am not an old woman ?"
" Ugh!"-and he made a sound of disgust. " Old
women make me sick."
" Well, you'll be old long before I am," she said, with
a triumphant laugh. " My goodness! look at the rain."
Aunt Anne went slowly along the narrow pathway,





<pb n="279"/>AUNT ANNE                  279
down into the valley, and up towards the larch and fir-
trees again. IIcr strength was almost spent when she
reacled the garden. She bent her head beneath the down-
pour, and dragged herself, in such frightened haste as she
could manage, to the house. She stopped for a moment
beneath 1e veranda, as if to be sure that she was awake.
She looked, half incredulously, down at her wet and cling-
ing clothes, and then into the darkness and distance. Be-
yond the trees and across the valley she knew that two
people were saing their good-byes. She imagined their
looks and words and their caresses. It seemed as if
tle whole world were theirs-it had been pulled from
under her feet to make a heaven for them. she was
trembling wltlh cold and fear, but she told herself that
there was one thing left at which she must clutch a little
longer-her self-control and dignity.
"I thought," she said, bewildered, and with the strange
hunted look on her face, as she entered the cottage-" I
thought God had forgiven me and sent him back, but it
is all a mistake. Perhaps it is part of my punishment."
Everything looked strange to her: as if years had passed
since she had left it only an hour ago, She stood by the
drawing-room door for a moment, looking in at the fire that
had burned up and made a cheerful blaze, but she was
afraid to go nearer to it. she felt like an outcast from
everywhere; there was no place for her in the world, no
one who wanted her, nothing left to do. And there was
no love for her, and no forgetfulness; she had to bear
pain-that alone was her portion. She wanted to lie
down and die, very much, but deatl and love alike are
often strangely difficult to those who need them most.
She meandered into the kitchen, without any settled plan
of what she was going to do.





<pb n="280"/>280                 AUNT ANNE
"Jane," she said, " the moment you have finished tak.
ing in the dinner, I want you to go up-stairs and follow
the directions I will give you."
" Yes, ma'am," Jane answered, witl some astonishment
when she had listened to themn; "but do you mean to-
night ?"
"Yes, I mean to-night," Aunt Anne said, and turned
away.
"Let me take your shawl, ma'am; it is wringing wet."
"I shall be glad if you will divest me of it," the old
lady said, gently, "and if you will bring me my cap and
slippers; I am fatigued, and cannot ascend the stairs."
She sat down for a minute, and listened to Jane's foot-
steps going and returning. It seemed as if the whole
hlouse were full of sliame and agony; a single step in any
direction might take her into its midst-she did not dare
venture there till she had finished the task that was before
her. She went into the dining-room, with a strange, be-
wildered air still upon her, as if she were doubtful whetler
it was the room that she lad known so well, or if it had,
somehow, been cllanged in the last hour. The cloth was
laid; the prinroses were in their place; the candles
were lit, for it was nearly dinner-time; the blinds
were down, and the curtains drawn. She looked at the
easy-chair she had put ready for Alfred, with the little
table beside it, and the papers and the violets. Then she
went up to the mantelpiece and rang a hand-bell that stood
on it.
"Jane," she said, "take away Mr. Wimple's slippers-
he will not require themn; put them with the other thlings
as I told you."  She pushed the easy-chair to its place,
away from the fire, put the little table back into the cor-
ner, and hid the papers and the violets out of sight, for





<pb n="281"/>AUNT ANNE                   281
she could not bear to see them. She looked at the cloth
again, and taking up the things that had been laid for ler
carried them to the sideboard.
" You need not set a place for me," she said to Jane,
who still lingered, half wonderingly. "I dined early in
town; it is only for Mr. Wimple "-and she went back to
tlei drawing-room. She hesitated for a moment by tlic
door; she felt as if the dead people who had known it in
by-gone years were softly crowding into it now, as if they
would witness the scene that was before her, and look on
at all she lhad to bear, just for a little while, before she
became one of them. she gathered courage to walk to
one of the chaits; she put the peacock screen beside ler
and waited. A quarter of an hour went by, while she
stared at the fire with her hands clasped and her head
drooping, or at the darkness outside the windows that
looked towards the garden. But she could scarcely bear
to turn her head in that direction. All the time she was
listening, curiously and with a shrinking dread, for tile
sound of footsteps. Jane came to her.
" The dinner is ready," she said; "it's a pity Mr1. Wim-
ple don't conme-I wanted to get home to mother a bit
early to-night. IHer cough was worse this morning."
"You can go as soon as you have finished your duties,"
Aunt Anne said; "and remind me to pay you your wages,
for I am often oblivious-" the words died away on her
lips. She heard the handle of tlhe hall-door turn.





<pb n="282"/>CHAPTER XX
TlHE rain showed no signs of abating, but Alfred Wim-
ple was chilly and hungry. Moreover, he was tired of
the tete-d-tete in the sihed, and he had a dull curiosity to
hear the result of Aunt Anne's visit to town. It was cer-
tain to provide some sort of excitement for the evening.
If she had brought back money he would reap the bene-
fit of it; if she lad not, he could at least make her suffer,
and to watclh her suffer would provide hlim a satisfaction
over which he gloated more and more with every experi-
ence of it. Ile buttoned his coat, turned up the bottoms
of his trousers, and looked for his umbrella; then hesitated
a moment and looked out at the weather. I-e hated rain.
"I wish I had tlouglt to bring myself an umbrella,"
his companion said; "it's a long way across. Joe Pook
is over at the King's IIead with his cart, and he'll drive
me back, but it's a good bit to there."
Alfred Wimple coughed.
"I can't let you have mine"-and he held it firmly;
" my chest is not strong."
"I wasn't saying it for that," she answered; "I was
only tlinking it was a pity I didn't bring one. Good-
by; you'll take care of yourself, won't youl?"
"I will try," he said, in his most sombre manner, as
though he felt it to be an important undertaking.
"Good-by, Caroline."
Before they were many yards apart she turned and





<pb n="283"/>AUNT ANNE                  283
went after him. IIer jacket was already wet with rain;
her black straw liat was shliing. There was an anxious
excitelment ill her manner.
Alfred "-slie put her hand on his shoulder and looked
at his face while she spoke-"you care about me really,
don't you ?"
"Why do you ask that now ?" he asked, severely.
"I don't know. Motler said once that you had love
for nothing but yourself. It isn't true, is it? Sometimes
I think I would liave done better if I had married Albert
Spark. I believe lie's fonder of me now tlhan you are."
Ile looked impatient and at a loss wllat to do. lie
could tot understand unselfish love; self-protection was
his own strongest feeling; everything else was merely a
means, a weapon to be used in attaining it.
"You mustn't keep me in the rain," he said; "the old
woman will be back by this time. Why do you think I
don't care for you ?"
"I don't know"-and as she spoke the tears came into
her eyes; "I tlink it was because you just let me go in the
rain and didn't see that I'd get wet through. It doesn't
matter, but I'd like you to have seen it."
" You are stronger than I am. It is dangerous for me
to get wet; I came out in the rain to meet you."
"And then, perhaps I oughtn't to say it, but you took
the money and didn't offer me a shilling to keep for my-
self."
" I didn't know you wanted it. You can't expect me
to go without anytiling in my pocket ?"
" No"-and she burst into tears; " it's only sometimes I
get dissatisfied," she added, apologetically.
"You should have done it in the slied. You ought not
to keep me here in the rain. You know that."





<pb n="284"/>284                  AUNT ANNE 
"No, I oughtn't; you go on, dear "-tlere was sudden
repentance in her voice. "Just kiss me and say you are
fond of me again." IHe leaned over her, and for a moment
his eyes flashed, as he kissed her with a loathsome eager-
ness that left the woman's heart more hungry than before.
"I am fond of you," he said; "you know I am fond of 
you-when I see you. But I can't come to Liphook to be 
dunned for money."
" I always do the best I can to get tllings for you; and
if I have plenty of work I'll take care it's more comfort-
able, if you'll only come. Tlire, go now, Alfred dear.
I don't want to keep you in tlhe wet. It's only that we
have been married tlhese four years, and, somehow, we
never seem to have got any good of it yet." she put her
arms round his neck for a moment. "I am awful fond of 
you!" she said, and turned away.
Something in her voice touched him; or it miglit have 
been that he was fonder of her than he supposed, for as
he went by the pathway that poor Aunt Anne had hir- 
ried along, bowed down with insult and despair, only
twenty minutes before, there was a less sullen expression
than usual on his face. he thought of tlie clinging hands
and tearful eyes, and the undisguised love written on her 
face, with something like satisfaction. IIe would settle 
down withli her, once he possessed the money. he liked 
tle idea of it; it -would be good to be waited upon by  1
her, to go abroad with lier perhaps, to buy comfort and
luxury, and to feel her hanging about him. He lingered
in thought over her caresses; he remembered Aunt Anne's
and shuddered. IIe lad said truly enough that he could
not bear the latter much longer; toleration had grown to
endurance, endurance to dislike, and dislike to loathing.
He was sensible of even being beneath the same roof with





<pb n="285"/>AUNT ANNE                   285
lier; her voice irritated hlin, her touch produced a feel-
ing that was almost fear. Every step he made now tow-
ards the house that contained her was reluctant and al-
most shrinking. IIe could just bear life with her if she
gave limn good food and comfort and money he could not
obtain elsewhere; but unless she gave him these things,
wlich he counted worth any price that could be paid, lie
felt it would be impossible to stay witl hler longer.
Warmth and idleness and comfort were gods to him;
but his loatlling for the poor soul who had struggled
for months to give them to liiln was developing into hor-
ror. IIe waited, doggedly, day after day for Sir William
Rammtge's deatl. When that happened he would seize
the money that would be hers and, without mercy, leave
her to her fate; he and Caroline would get away till she
were dead. If she would not give it himi easily, then he
would make life impossible for lier to bear. IIe had not
the least intention of murdering her, but in imagination
lie often put his hands round her tlroat, and all his fin-
gers felt her life growing still beneath tlhem. he resented
everything she did: her voice, her footstep, her tender,
wrinkled face; he felt as if lier winking left eye were
driving him mad-as if tlere was poison in her breath.
IIe considered her life an offence against hiln, except as
a means of giving him mioney. When once she ihad done
tlhat, when she lad given him the thousands for wlich lie
liad married lier, he wanted lier forever out of his sight,
and underground; he gloated in imagination over thle
..deepness of thle grave into which he would have lier put,
and the silence and darkness that would surround her.
He was at the bottom of the dip. IIe reflected, witl
triumph, that it was too late for any question of going to the
station to meet tlhe half-past-six-o'clock train. He thought





<pb n="286"/>286                 AUNT ANNE
of the rain that would fall upon her as she drove to the cot-
tage. IIe wondered if she had left her cloak behind, and
imagined the cold and pain she would suffer without it.
IIe could see her in the open cart, bending her head and
shoulders beneath the gray storm, carrying the bag that
contained the dinner for him, and he imagined the bulging
condition in which the bag would return. If she had not
brought back all he considered necessary for his comfort,
slie would tremble to see him, and he would not spare
her one single pang. IIe was among the firs and larches,
witlin siglit of the cottage windows. Ile hated to think
tlat she was behind them-that almost immediately he
would be in the same room with ler, sitting opposite to
her at table. IIe thought of himself as a martyr, and of
her as a loathsome burden, a presence that had no right
to be inflicted on him; one that he would be justified in
using any means within his power to remove. IIis feel-
ing for lier had grown in intensity till it threatened to
burst the bonds of reserve and silence in which he had
wrapped himself. It was only witl an effort that lie
could keep in all the lashing words that hatred could
suggest. Ie went up the pathway, as slowly as she her-
self had done, and walked round the house under the
veranda. Unknowingly, in putting the easy-chair back
into its place, Aunt Anne had pushed aside a little bit of
the dining-room curtain. IIe looked in and saw the table
laid, the candles lit, and the bowl of primroses; they were
a sign that she had returned, and had not returned empty-
handed. IIe noticed that only one place was laid, and he
wondered vaguely wlat it meant. IIe thought of Aunt
Anne's face, and a sickening feeling came over him. If
it had only been a girl's face to which he was going in,
a young woman who would come to meet him, and put





<pb n="287"/>AUNT ANNE                   287
her arms round his neck, and call him endearing names,
instead of the old woman, shrivelled and wrinkled, to
whom in a moment or two he would lave to submit him-
self? he went towards the front door, vaguely deter-
mining that he would make her miserable that niglht. He
had q right to everything she could give, but she had no
riglt tto intrude herself upon his sight, and he would make
her feel it.
There was a click at the gate. Some one had entered
tle garden from the road. Ile stopped. A boy came up
to him tlrouglh the darkness.
"Wimple? A telegram, sir. There is sixpence for
porterage." he felt in his pocket among the silver tlle
woman had given him in the shed; he found the six-
pence, and the boy departed. he opened the yellow en-
velope, and stood still for a moment, with the telegram
in his hand. Ile gussed what it meant. He took a
match from his pocket, struck a light, and, protecting it
from the wind with his hat, read:
"Died at five o'clock from sudden attack."
He screwed it up into a ball and put it carefully into
his pocket. His feeling for Aunt Anne changed in a
moment: he felt that for this one evening, at any rate, he
would endure her-he would even be civil-since it was
tlrouglh her that he was about to gain all he wanted. IHe
looked up at the cottage before he entered it with the
almost pleasant feeling with which a prisoner sometimes
looks at his cell before he departs into freedom. Aunt
Anne was sitting by the drawing-room fire; he lingered
by the doorway.
" You are hlome then ?" he said. There was something
exalted in his voice, that at another time would have made





<pb n="288"/>288                 AUNT ANNE
ler look up at him lovingly, as he expected to see her do
now. But, instead, she answered coldly and without any
words of greeting,
"Yes, Alfred, I am home."
"What did you do in town ?"  She winked haughtily
and did not speak. " What did you do " ihe repeated.
"I did a great deal, and learned many things of whicl
I will tell you when you have finished your dinner. It is
quite ready-you will be good enough to go to it, Al-
fred."
lIe looked at her searchingly, and felt a little uneasi-
ness.
"Are you coming " he asked, seeing that she did not
move.
"No, I have dined; but I trust you will be satisfied
with what I have provided for you," she said, coldly.
Something in her manner forced him reluctantly to obey.
He went into the dining-room; she shut the door tlat
led into it and waited in the fire-light. Jane came in
after she had served the sole, and drew down the blinds
and arranged the curtains and threw some wood on the fire.
"There is only one candle left," she said, "till the two
in the dining-room are done with."
"It is quite sufficient; you can light it and put it on
the table. As soon as you have finished waiting upon
Mr. Wimple you will go up-stairs and do vwhat I have told
you "-and she was left alone again. Wllile she looked
at the fire she could almost imagine Alfred Wimple eat-
ing his sole; she knew when it was finished; she listened
while Jane entered and pushed his plate tlrougl the
buttery-llatch; she heard the chicken arrive, and imagined
Alfred Wimple solemnly carving it. IIer heart beat
faster as he went on towards the end of his feast; she was





<pb n="289"/>AUNT ANNE                   289
impatient for the crisis to begin. At last he rose from
tlie table and opened the door, and looked at her curi-
ously. She rose and stood, facing him, on the rug.
"Did you bring a paper from town, Anne ?" he asked,
without a word of gratitude for his dainty dinner.
" Yes, I brought some papers; but you will not require
them." She hesitated a moment, and then went on firmly,
" I wisl you to know, Alfred, that you are about to leave
this house never to enter it again."
" What do you mean ?" he asked, and fastened his eyes
on her with only a little more expression in them than
usual.
"I mean that I know everything."
"IHave you seen my uncle?" he asked, betraying no
surprise and hot moving from the doorway by which lie
stood.
"lie is in Scotland for a fortnight-but I know every-
thing. I know that you have insulted and defamed me."
Slie spoke in a low voice and so calmly that he looked at
her as if he thought she did not understand the meaning
of her own words. " Till I met you," sih went on, " I
bore an unsullied name and reputation."
" What have I done to your name and reputation ?" lie
asked, and closed his lips as though he were almost stupe-
fied with silence. But he went a step towards her, with a
shrinking, defensive movement. She retreated towards the
table on which the candle stood, a flickering witness of the
scene between themn-a scene full of shame and suffering
and unconfessed fear for her, and of cruelty and loathing
and bewilderment for him; but for both strangely desti-
tute of fire and passion.
"You have ruined both," she said. " You have dared to
make a pretence of marriage with me, though you were
19





<pb n="290"/>290                 AUNT ANNE 
married already to an inferior person whom you had
known at your lodgings."
"Who told you this ?"
" I have seen and heard her. I know everything. You
will retire from my presence this evening and never enter
it again."
"It is not true," he said, shortly, and made another
step forwards, and again she retreated.
" It is true. To-morrow I shall go to Liphook and ex-
pose your infamous behavior."
" If you dare," he said, almost fiercely, and then, sud-
denly, he changed his note. "I was obliged to do it,
Anne," he added, as if he had suddenly seen that the
game was up, and lying would serve him nothing. " But
I was fond of you; I told you there were many difficulties
the night I asked you to marry me."
" No, Alfred "-and for the first time her lips quivered
-" you were not fond of me. Even then you were calcu-
lating that you would get the money Sir William Ran-
nage had left me in his will."
"What should I know about his will ?"
"You were aware of its contents. You went to him in
regard to the instructions. I have heard everything from
his own lips." IIe was silent for a moment, and still there
was no expression in his dull eyes.
"Rammage could not tell you that I was married," lie
said, presently. "Where did you get that ridiculous story
from ?"
"It is not a ridiculous story. You have married a com-
mon dressmaker, and you presumed after that to insult
and impose on me."
" What are you going to do-what do you want me to
do?" he asled, almost curiously.
Ii





<pb n="291"/>AUNT ANNE                 291
"I shall not treat you with the severity you deserve,
but you will leave this house to-night and never enter it
again."
"I should go to Liphook. You would not like that,
Anne."
"Alfred," she said, indignantly, "I could not accept
shame and degradation, even from a man I love. Besides,
I have no longer any love for you. You will not dare to
offer me that. Every moment that you stay in my pres-
ence is an insult. I must insist on your leaving this house
at once."
"Where am I togo ?" he asked, still curiously.
" That is for your consideration. You and I are apart."
"I have no money," he said, too much astonished,
though he made no sign of it, to fight her fairly.
"You have sufficient money for your present necessi-
ties, Alfred. You must not think that you can deceive
me any longer. I know everything about you." Sud-
denly an idea occurred to him, and he asked, in a manner
that was almost a threat, though it had no effect upon
her,
"Have you been to Liphook ?"
"I shall not tell you where I have been, Alfred; I
have discovered your baseness, and that is sufficient. I
know that our marriage was a mockery, that you dared to
offer me what you had already given to another woman.
You will go back to her, and at once. You came to me
solely for my money, and of that you will not have one
penny piece." Still he stood looking at her, speechlessly,
while with each word she said his loathing for her in-
creased and his anger grew more difficult to control.
His lips parted and showed his teeth, white and clenched
together.





<pb n="292"/>292                 AUNT ANNE 
"I will have the money yet; and you shall suffer," lie
said.
"You will not," she answered, witl a determined wink.
"I have taken care of that."
" You have left it to me."
For a moment she was silent; then a light broke upon
her, and she spoke quickly.
" Alfred," she said, "I know now wliy you put your
name in my will without mentioning the relationship in
which I supposed you stood to me, and wlly you did not
put my name in yours, but only said that you left every-
thing to your wife. You were deliberately insulting me,
and deceiving me most cruelly even then, on the day I
thought most sacred."
" I thought you were fond of me," he said, as if he had
not heard her last speech. For a moment site could not
answer him. Only a few hours before, and the deceptions
of whicl she had known him then to be guilty had but
made hini dearer to lier. she had loved limn witl all her
own strength, and supposed him to possess it. Sie had
idealized him with hler own goodness, till she had mistaken
it for his. she lad never once realized that any comfort
she gathered in through him was but her own feeling re-
turning to sootle her a little with its beauty. Now all the
glamour had vanished, slhe loatlied and shrank from him,
just as he had done from her. It was like a death agony.
" I was fond of you," she said. " I loved you more than
all the world, and I would have given you my life, I would
have worked for your daily bread. I wanted nothing in 
the world but you, Alfred; but I am undeceived. You
must go; you must leave me, and at once. I have desired
Jane to pack your things-"
"I shall stay," he said, in a tone tllat made Ier look up
I





<pb n="293"/>AUNT ANNE                  293
quickly. "I do not mean to go until I have the money
William Ranmmage has left you."
"You will not have one penny piece of it," she an-
swered.
" I will," he said, with a quiet, determined look she knew
well in his dull eyes. "lie has left it to you, and you have
left it to me. I mean to have it."
"It is no use trying to intimidate me, Alfred," she
said; "it is too late. To-morrow I shall make another
disposition of my property."
" No, you will not," he said; "for I shall not let you out
of my sight till you are dead, and you will be dead soon."
"You wit1 gain nothing by that, Alfred. William
Rammage also will make another disposition of his prop-
erty to-morrow, for I told him of our marriage."
" No, he will not, Anne "-he looked at her with awful
triumph-" for he is dead already."
" Dead already ? You are trying to hoodwink me, Al-
fred; and if it is true it will not alter my intention or pre-
vent me from carrying it out," she answered, determined
not to let him know that her promised wealth had van-
ished. There was a sound of footsteps, and then the back
door closed. Aunt Anne quaked when she heard it, for
she knew that Jane had gone home without coming to
say the usual good-night. He heard it, too, and his tone
altered in a moment.
" You will have no chance of altering your intention,
.Anne," he said, and went another step towards ler.
" Why ?" she asked, witl a fearless wink.
"Because you shall not live to do it"-and he went a
little nearer; still she did not quail for a moment.
" And you think when I am dead you will go and spend
my money with the woman at Liphook ?"





<pb n="294"/>294                 AUNT ANNE 
"Yes," he said; "I like her, and I loathe you !" He
drew the word out as if he gloated over the sound of it,
and the awful look came into his eyes again.
"IIeaven has frustrated your design," she said. "Al-
fred, if you kill me you will gain nothing by it, and the law
will punish you. William Rammage has burned his will.
lie burned it to-day before my eyes, when he heard that
I had disgraced my family and my name by a marriage
with you."
"Burned it!"  he put out his hands, almost as if he
were going to strangle her. " Then I shall go; I shall go
--when it suits me. I only wanted your money. A young
man does not marry an old woman for anything but money,
Anne. You are loathsome-loathsome and unwholesome,"
lie repeated, watching the effect of every word upon her-
"and I have loathed being with you. I shall go to the
other woman. She is my wife; I like her-she is young,
not old and loathsome like you! I only married you for
the sake of your money." Aunt Anne never moved an
inch; she only watched him steadily, as slowly he brought
out his sentences, pausing between each one. " You have
kept me from her all these months," he went on, concen-
trating himself on every word he said; "and now you
have taken from me the money I deserved for being with
you-for being with a wrinkled, withered old woman."
She did not move or speak. For a moment he showed
his teeth again, then slowly lifted his hands.
"Anne," he said, "I am going to strangle you"-and.
he bent over her. He had no intention of doing it, but
it pleased him to torture and threaten her.
" If you dare to touch me-" she said, and a shriek burst
from ler. There was the sound of a door opening and of
footsteps entering.





<pb n="295"/>AUNT ANNE                  295
"Jane !" shouted Aunt Anne, "Jane!" Jane opened
the door and looked in.
"If you please, ma'am, I heard Mr. Knox, the police-
man, go by, and you said you wanted him."   Alfred
Wimple stared at her in astonishment, and his face
lblanched. Aunt Anne recovered lhei;self-possession in a
moment, though she trembled from head to foot.
" If you will ask him to stay in the kitclen, I will speak
to him," she said. Then she turned to Alfred Wimple
again.
" You will only get yourself laughed at," he said. She
was silent a moment; she saw what was in his thoughts
and took advantage of it.
"You do not deserve my clemency," she said, "but I
will extend it to you, provided you will go from the house
this minute. If you do not I shall take measures to pun-
ish you."'
He was trembling, and could not speak.
She opened the door. "Jane," she called, "get Mr.
Wimple's portmanteau; have you put everything into it?"
"Everything but the slippers. It's raining, ma'am,"
Jane added, not in the least understanding what was going
on. But Aunt Anne had shut the door, and turned to
Alfred Wimple again.
"Now you will go I" she said.
"I cannot go in the rain," he answered, and made a
sound in his throat; "you know how bad my cough is.
You cannot turn me out in this weather. I was angry
just now. I did not mean it."
"You will go immediately," she said; "you shall not
remain another hour under my roof."
"It will kill me to go in this rain," he said, doggedly.
"You would have killed me when you thought you





<pb n="296"/>296                 AUNT ANNE                       '
would get William Rammage's money by it; you are
not fit to remain another hour in the same house with the
woman you have wronged, and you shall not. Your coat
is in the hall, ready for you "-and she went towards the
door. "You will go this very moment, and you will
never venture to come near me again."
"I have been coughing all day," he almost pleaded, ut-
terly confounded by the turn things had taken.
"I brought you some lozenges from London, before I
knew all your baseness "-and she fumbled in her pocket.
"Here they are, and you can take them witl you."  She
put them down before him on the table, and went slowly
out to the kitchen. "Officer," she said, "I will not de-
tain you about the wood this evening. I want you to
walk with Mr.   imlple as far as Steggall's, and see him
into a wagonette; and there," she added, in a low voice,
"is a half-crown to recompense you for your trouble."
"It's very wet, ma'am; is the gentleman obliged to go
to-niglht ?"
"Yes"-and, winking sternly, she opened the street door
wide. "Yes, he is obliged to go to-night." With a puz-
zled air Jane picked up the portmanteau. Alfred Wim-
ple took it from her with sulky reluctance. For a moment
they all stood looking out at the blackness of the fir-trees
and listened to the falling rain. Aunt Anne turned to the
little hat-stand in the hall. "Here is an umbrella, Al-  i
fred," she said, "and you have your lozenges. Good-
night, officer"-and she did not say another word. The 
two men went out together. She shut the door, double-
locked it, and drew the bolts at the top and bottom--it 
was the last sound that Alfred Wimple heard as he left
the cottage.
For a moment she stood still, listening to his footsteps;





<pb n="297"/>ACNT ANNE                  297
she waited to hear the click of the gate as it shut behind
them. Then, with a strange, dazed manner, as if she were
not quite sure that she was awake, she went back to the
drawing-room.
" If you please, ma'am," asked the servant, "isn't Mr.
Wimple coming back to-night ?-for you won't like being
left alone, and I don't know what to do about mother."
"You can go to her," Aunt Anne answered. A des-
perate longing to be alone was upon her; she wanted to
think quietly, and it seemed impossible to do so while
any one remained beneath the same roof witl hler. She
was impatient for a spell of loneliness before she died.
She felt that she was going to die, that she had heard her
death-sentence in the shed beyond the valley. There was
no gainsaying it-shame and agony were going to kill her.
But first she uanted to be alone, to realize all that had
happened, and how it had come about. She remembered
suddenly, but only for a moment, that Alfred had stated
that Sir William Rammage was dead. It was untrue, of
course-Alfred could not have known. Besides, William
Iammage's life or death concerned her no longer; in his
money she took no further interest. She only wanted to be
alone and to think. "You can go to your mother, Jane,"
she repeated; " I wish to be left alone; I have a predilec-
tion for solitude." 
"Yes, ma'am," the girl answered, hesitatingly-" and
you said I was to remind you about the wages; I wouldn't,
only mother's bad."
"I will pay them."  She opened her purse and counted
out the few silver coins left in it. "I must remain a
sixpence in your debt; this is all the change I have for
the moment."   She put her empty purse down on the
table, and knew that she had not a penny left in the





<pb n="298"/>298                 AUNT ANNE
world. For a moment she was silent; she looked pnzzl]d, i
as if she were doing a mental sum. Then she looked up. '
"Jane," she said, "Jyou can take the remains of tbo '
chicken and the sole to your mother, and anything else
that was left from dinner. I shall not require it."  She
dreaded seeing anythingi that Alfred Wimple had
touched. she felt that, even down to the smallest detail, 
she must rid herself of all that had had to do with her
life of shame and disgrace, and there was not much time '
left her in wllich to. do it. Slic must begin at once:
when she had made her life clean and spotless again she 
would look up and meet death unabashed. 
"I am ready, ma'am," Jane said, presently, and looked 
in, with lher basket on her arm. Aunt Anne got up and
followed her to the back door, in order to see that it was
made fast. She shook witl fear when she beleld the -i
night. Under that sky and through the darkness Alfred
Wimple was making his way to Liphook. The very air
seemed to liave pollution in it. She retreated thankfully
to the covering of the cottage; but the stillness appalled
her, once slhe was wholly alone in it. Slce stood in tlle
hiall for a moment and listened: there was not a sound.
She waited for a moment at the foot of the stairs and re-
membered Alfred's room above, from which every trace
of him had been removed, but she had not courage to
mount the stairs. She went back into the little drawing-
room and shut the door, and taking up her empty purse
from beside the candlestick put it into her pocket. As
in the morning, her ]land touched something that should
not be there; but she knew what it was this time, and 
pulled it out quickly. It was the blue tie that she had  ,
kissed in the train. With almost a cry of horror, as if it
were a deadly snake, she threw it on the fire and held it





<pb n="299"/>AUNT ANNE                   299
down with the poker, as William Rammage had held down
lis burning will. As she did so her eyes caughlt the wed-
ding-ring on her left hand; in a nmoment she had pulled
it iff lier trelmbling finger and put it in the fire, too. The
Hflame blazed and smouldered and died away, and her ex-
citement with it. But she had uot strength to rise from
the floor on, whicl she had been kneeling; she pulled the
cushion down from the back of the easy-chair, and sank, a
miserable heap, upon the rug.

<pb n="300"/>CHAPTER XXI
DURING the days that followed she was shut up in the
cottage alone; and no one entered save Jane Mitchell, 
vwo came in the morning to light the fire while the rem-
nant of coal lasted, and then was sent away.
"I shall not require you any more," she said to Lucas,
when he came to ask if she wanted the pony. She was
covered with shame, and could never drive along the 
roads again.
"No, I do not need any provisions," she said to Jane
Mitchell, who offered to do some shopping for her; "I
have sufficient in the house, and I will not trouble you to
come again, Jane, until this day week "-and, having se-
curely fastened the outer doors, she went to the drawing-
room.
"I shall be dead by then," she thought, "and Jane will
find me."  she was terribly ill, but she did not know it.
The cold and the damp of that long day in London and
afterwards had laid hold on her. She coughed, and knew
that swift pains went through her, and a load was on her
chest, but she had no time to notice these things. She
had had no food for days. Save a little milk in a cup, and
some bread, there was nothing left when Jjane Mitchell
took her departure. She was being slowly starved; she
knew it, and did not care. the awful shame, the misery, 4
the agony, that had overtaken her, stifled all other feel- 
ings, and were killing her; she knew that, too, and waited





<pb n="301"/>AUNT ANNE                   301
for death.  Everything had gone out of her life; there
was nothing to come into it more. She had been proud
of her memories, her unsullied past, her own spotless-
ness--"Now it is all gone," she said to herself. Every
memory was a reproach or was hideous.    She sat on
one of the chairs before the drawing-room fire-place, and
thought and thought and thought, till she could bear it
no longer.  It seemed as if pain were stamping the life
out of her, as if she must be dying; she could feel that
she was dying; but life remained by a little, and grew
keen, and tortured her again.  The key was turned in
the lock of Alfred Wimple's room, but his touch was on
everything in the house; and a shrinking from it was
her strongest feeling concerning him. Even the sight
of a cup from which he had drunk made her shudder
more than the bitter cold. "The place is contaminated,"
she said to herself; "it is poisoned."  Sometimes for a
few minutes a little tenderness would try to push its
way into her heart again, but she shrank from that most
of all, and with horror and loathing of herself. She was
bowed down with disgrace.    She felt as if by even
living she was committing an offence against the whole
world. There was no one she was fit to see; she had
no right of any sort left, no business to be in the light;
and there was no place in which she could hide. The
nights were worst of all, they were so long and still; and
when she had used the two candles left in the dining-
room she had no means of shortening them even by an
hour. Then, quaking, she lay on the hard sofa in the
drawing-room, while the darkness gathered round, and tlke
cold fastened its shatpest fangs into her. In those long
hours she suffered not only her own reproaches, but the
reproaches of the dead-of the dear ones she ]lad loved in





<pb n="302"/>302                 AUNT ANNE 
by-gone years. From every corner they seemed to come-
through the closed door and in at the curtained windows,
troops of them-till she could bear it no longer, and dared
not see the darkness that seemed to be growing white with
their faces. . But when she closed her eyes it was no bet-
ter: they came a little closer and touched her with their
hands as if they would push her a little farther into space;
she was not fit to be among them. The friends of her
girlhood, with whom she had played and shared her little
secrets, came from the strange world into which they had
carried the memory of their own blameless lives. They
looked at her reproachfully, and went away; she would
never be one of them now, even in eternity. And there
was one more; she could see him coming softly through 
the shadows. He stood beside her, and she cowered and
hid her face. Then she knew that he was sorry and un-
derstood tlat, in some grotesque manner, it lad been done -:
half for love of him. It comforted her a little to think 
this, while she turned her face down to the cushion, and 
sobbed, "Forgive me, I am so ashamed-so ashamed." 
At last, perhaps, she would ache witl fever and cold, and
the sharp pains went through her again. She welcomed
these almost lovingly, thinking that perhaps they meant
the coming of the end; and gradually, as the morning
broke, she would doze off into a weary sleep.
Sometimes a ghastly fear would seize her that Alfred
Wimple was coming back. She could hear his footsteps
going round the house; she fancied he was creeping be- 
neath the veranda, that he was trying the window. Ile
wanted to come in and strangle her. she could feel his
long hands closing round her throat, and put up her own
to draw them, finger by finger, away. It was not the kill-
ing she would mind, but the pollution of his touch.

<pb n="303"/>AUNT ANNE                  303
Through the day she wandered from room to room-
now looking at the table at which he had sat the last
night of all; or seeing him, with his back to the buttery-
hatch, eating the sole and the chicken she had brought
from London; or standing in the doorway, when he came
afterwards and asked her for the evening paper, She
Jwent to the window and looked at the garden, and the
pathwvay down to the dip; but this was more than she
could bear, and she would turn away and sit down by the
empty fireplace again. She grew hungry once; a terrible
craving for food came over her. She gathered some sticks
together, and made a fire, all the time seeing strange vi-
sions and grinning fiends that mocked her. She took them
to be the punishment of her sin-for sin she counted all
that she had done-but in reality they were but signs of
the illness and starvation that were contending for the
mastery of her. She put a little water on to boil over the
blazing sticks, and watched it greedily. She made some
tea, with trembling eagerness, and found a new excitement
in the strength it gave her; but when the fire had died
away, and an hour had passed, she was prostrate again.
Gradually she became so ill that she could scarcely drag her-
self from the drawing-room to the kitchen; the sense of
being unfit to stay in the world grew upon her-a dread
of seeing people, a haunting fear of some one coiing to
the door. But no one came through all those terrible days
except, once or twice, Jane Mitchell, only to be told that
" her services were not required."
She thought of Walter and Florence sometimes, and
was afraid of their coming back. She could never look
them in the face again, or dare to speak to theln, or see
the children. Just as before she had exaggerated her
own importance in the world and her own virtue, now





<pb n="304"/>304                 AUNT ANNE 
she exaggerated her own disgrace. Seic knew what the 
women she had once despised felt like--"I was never 
lenient," she said to herself. "I was very harsh, as if  i
they had gone out of their way to do wrong. I ought to 
have shown them more clemency "-and as she said this, 
there came before her the face of Mrs. North. She sat and  ;
looked at it. "She was young, and there was excuse for 
her; and I am old, yet could not forgive her. I will make 
atonement now. I will write and tell her." HIer fingers
were so weak she could hardly hold the pen, but she man- 
aged to put down a little entreaty for forgiveness. "I 
ought to have been more gentle to you," she wrote. "I 
know that now, for I have been as frail-" she stopped
and gave a sad little wink at tlhe word-" as you. I know
what your sufferings have been by my own, and can pity
your humiliation."  The letter remained on the table-
she allnost forgot it; fever and blackness filled her life--
she could scarcely walk across the room.
The morning brought tlhe postman, with a letter from
Walter and Florence. "Would you put a postage-stamp p
on this for me " she said, giving him the one for Mrs. 
North. "I will repay you the next tine you come; I
have no change for the moment."
Slhe put the letter with the Monte Carlo post-mark on
tlie mantelpiece, and stood looking at the familiar hand-
writing, and imagining them together beneath the ,blue
sky, Walter in high spirits, and Florence witl her pretty
hair plaited round her head. "Dear children !" she said.'
"IHe is growing more and more like his father."  She
closed her eyes for a moment; her limbs swayed and gave
way beneath her; and she fell fromn sheer weakness, and
could make no effort to rise. Presently she pulled the
cushion down, and lay on the rug again as she had on the





<pb n="305"/>AUNT ANNE                  305
niglit of Alfred Wimple's departure. She did not know
how the day passed-probably most of it went in forget-
fulness. The next afternoon came, and she had not no-
ticed the hours.
The click of the gate, and footsteps coming towards the
house-Aunt Anne struggled up, panting, and listened-a
quick knock at the door. she hesitated, raised herself to
her feet by the arm-chair, and went out, but could not
galther courage to undo the lock.
" Who is it?" she asked.
"Let me in," cried a voice that was familiar enough,
though she could not identify it. She bowed her head-
she was about to be looked at in all her humiliation-and,
with trembling hands, opened the door.
Mrs. North walked in, with a happy laugh.  She was
,perfectly dressed, as usual, and carried a white basket.
"My dear old lady," she said, "what is the matter?
Your letter frightened me out of my senses. I came off
the moment it arrived. You poor old darling, what is the
matter? Why, you can't stand-I must carry you." She
supported the old lady back into the drawing-room-
cheerless and cold enough it looked; that was the first
impression Mrs. North had of it-and sat down beside her
on the sofa.
"My love," the old lady said, "I wrote to ask your
forgiveness; it was due to you that I should, for I am
worse than you. If I was harsh to you once, you may be
harsh to me now."
Mrs. North pressed her hand.
" But you are ill, dear Mrs. Wimple," she said.
Aunt Anne looked up, with a start of horror.
"I must ask you never to call me by that name again;
it is not mine. It is the symbol of my disgrace. It is

my greatest punishment to remember that I ever for a
single moment bore it."  And then she broke down, and,
dropping her head on Mrs. North's shoulder, sobbed as if
her heart would break.
"You dear-you poor old dear," Mrs. North said, strok- 
ing the scanty gray hair; "I can't bear to see you cry-
you mustn't do it; you are ill. Who is here with you V"
"There is no one here. I am not fit to have any one, 
with me. I am all alone." 
"All alone !" 
"Yes "-and she shook her head. 
"Then I shall stay and take care of you, and nurse you,  -
and make you quite well again. You know I always     4
cared for you, dear old lady "-and Mrs. North kissed her 
tenderly.
"And I treated you with so much severity," Aunt Anne
said, ruefully.
"It was very good for nc. And now," Mrs. North said,  |
in her sweet, coaxing voice, "put your feet up on the  i
sofa; you are trembling and shaking with cold. Why, 
you have no fire; let us go into another room where there  j
is one." 
"There is no fire in the house," Aunt Anne answered. 
"The weather is very mild; moreover, the coal-cellar needs
replenishing.  I have not been sufficiently well to do it." 
"No fire !-and you evidently suffering from bronahitis I
Oil, you do indeed need to be looked after. Have you no
servant here?"  Mrs. North was rapidly taking in the :
whole situation.
"No, my dear. I wished to be alone."
"But this is terrible.  We must set everything to
rights. You appear to be killing yourself. I don't believe
you have anything to eat and drink in the house."





<pb n="307"/>AUNT ANNE                  307
"No. I have been too ill to require nourishment; I
regret that I cannot ask you to stay."
Mrs. North looked at her, almost in despair. Then she
took off her hat and gloves, and stood for a moment, a
lovely picture in the midst of the dreary room, before she
knelt down by Aunt Anne.
"Let me stay with you," she pleaded, taking the two
thin hands in hers; "you were always so good to me. I
know that something terrible has happened to you; you
shall tell me what it is by and by, when you are better.
Now I want to take care of you; and you will let me,
won't you ?"
"You shall do anything you like, my dear," Aunt Anne
gasped, too weak to offer resistance.
/Then Mrs. North went out to the fly, which was still
waiting at the gate, and found Jane Mitchell, who, at-
tracted by the unusual sight, was talking to the driver.
"I want some coals sent at once, and a servant."
"I was the servant, if you please, ma'am; only Mrs.
Wimple said she didn't want me," remarked Jane.
" Tlhen go in immediately and make a fire," answered
Mrs. North, imperiously; "and if there are no coals get
some instantly, from your mother's cottage or anywhere
else. Thlere must be shops in the village. Order tea and
sugar, and everything else you can think of. I will send
to London for my maid and cook, to come and help you.
Make haste and light a fire in the drawing-room. Where
is my shawl ? Here, driver, take this telegram; and order
these things from the village, and say they are wanted
instantly "-she had written the list on the leaf of a note-
book; " and this is for your trouble," she added.
" Now, you dear old lady," she said, going back to her,
"let me put this shawl over your feet first, for we must





<pb n="308"/>308                 AUNT ANNE                     I
make you warm. Consider that I have adopted you." In a :
moment she ran up-stairs, and searched for a soft pillow to
put under Aunt Anne's head, and then produced some
grapes and jelly from the basket she had brought with
her. Aunt Anne sucked in a little of the jelly almost
eagerly, and as she did so Mrs. North realized that she
had only just come in time. " We must send for a doe-
tor," she thought; " but I am afraid that everything is
too late."
In twenty-four hours the cottage looked like another
place. Mrs. North's cook had taken possession of the
kitchen; a comfortable-looking, middle-aged maid went 
up and down the stairs; the windows were open, though
there were fires burning in all the grates. There were
good things in the larder, and an atmosphere of home
was everywhere. Aunt Anne was bewildered, but Mrs.
North looked quite happy.
"I have taken possession of you," she explained, the 
second morning after she came. "You ought to have 
sent for me sooner. In fact, you ought never to have
left me. You only got into mischief, and so did I."
"Yes, my dear," said Aunt Anne, feebly, "we both
did."
Mrs. North's lips quivered for a moment.
" It shows that we ought to have stayed together," she
said, half crying. "Perhaps I should have been better if 
you had not gone. Oil, I shall never forget all you told
me this morning." For Aunt Anne, in sheer desperation, 
as well as in penitent love and gratitude, had poured out
the whole history of her life since she left Cornwall Gar-
dens, and Mrs. North's keen perception and quick sym- 
pathy had filled in any outlines that had been left a little
vague.
i

"We know each other so well now, I don't think I
ought to call you Mrs. Baines any longer. I want to call
you something else."
"Let it be anything you like, my dear."
"What does the Madon-Mrs. Hibbert, call you ? But
I know ; she calls you 'Aunt Anne.' Let me do the
same ?"
"Yes, dear, you shall call me Aunt Anne."
"Oh, I am so glad to be witl you," Mrs. North went
on. " I have longed sometimes to put down my head on
your lap and cry. I have been just as miserable as you
have-more, a thousand times more; for my shame"--
she liked indulging Aunt Anne in her estimate of her own
conduct-" has been all my own wicked doing, but yours
was only a sad mistake. I don't think we ought to be
separatd any more, Aunt Anne; we ought to live to-
gether, and take care of each other."
"My dear," said the old lady, still lying on the sofa,
" there will be no living for me; I am going to die."
" Oh no," Mrs. North answered, with a little gasp, "you
are going to live and be taken care of, and loved properly.
I wish the doctor would come again. then I should speak
on medical authority. Go to sleep a little while; I will sit
by you."
An hour passed. Aunt Anne opened her eyes.
"Could you put me by the fire, my dear; I am very
cold."
- " Yes, of course I can; but wait a moment. Clarke will
come and help me. Clarke," she called, " I want you to
come and help me to move Mrs. Baines."
"Now you look more comfortable," she said, when it
was done. "Tlhere is a footstool for your feet, and the
peacock beside you to keep you company."





<pb n="310"/>310                  AUNT ANNE 
Aunt Anne sat still for a moment, looking at the fire.
"My dear," she said, presently, " I lave been thinking  i
of what you said; we have botl suffered very much; we r
ought to be together. Only now you have the liope of a
new life before you. But we have both suffered," slle
repeated.
Mrs. North knelt down beside her like a girl. "Suf -
fered," she said. " Oh, dear old lady, if you only knew
what I have suffered-the loneliness of my girlhood, the
misery of my marriage, the perpetual hunger for hap-
piness, the struggle to get it. And olh! tlhe longing to bo
loved, and the madness wlen love came, and then-then 
-but you know," she whispered, passionately-" I need
not go over it; the sllame, and the publicity, and the re-
lief I dared not to acknowledge even to myself, when I
was set free. And then the awful dread that even lie, the
man for whom I did it all, would perlaps despise me as 
the rest of the world did. I am not wicked naturally, I 
am not, indeed-I don't think any wonlan on this green 
earth lias loved beautiful things and longed to do riglt- 
cous things, more than I have, or felt the misery of failure
more bitterly."
"It will come right now, my love," Annt Anne said,
gently. "You are young; it will all come right. You
said you had a telegram, and that he was coming back ?"
"Yes, he is coming back," Mrs. North answered, in a 
low voice; " but I do not want him to set it right because
I did the wrong for him, or just to make reparation from
a sense of honor. I do not want to spoil his life; for !
some people will cut lim if he marries me; it is only-
only-if he loves me still, and more than all the world, as
I do him-tlhat is the only chance of it all coming right. 
It is time I had a letter-  But here is your beef-tea. Let





<pb n="311"/>AUNT ANNE                   311
us try and forget all our troubles, and get a little peace
together."  She looked up with an April-day smile, took
the beef-tea from Clarke, and, holding it before Aunt
Anne, watched with satisfaction every mouthful site took.
"I fear I give you a great deal of trouble," the old
lady said, gratefully.
" It isn't trouble "-and the tears came to her eyes ; "it
is blessedness. I never had any one before to serve and
wait on whom I loved; even my hands are sensible of the
happiness of everytling they do for you. It is new life.
But now we have talked too much, and you must go to
sleep."
" Yes, my love "-and Aunt Anne put her lead back on
the pillow; " I will do as you desire, but you are very
autocratic."
"Of course." ]Mrs. North lauglled at hearing the
familiar word, and then went to the dining-room for a
little spell of quictncss.
"Clarke," she said to the maid wvlo had been waiting
there, "go in and watcl by Mrs. Baines; she must not be
left alone."
Mrs. North sat down on the chair that Aunt Anne had
pulled out for Alfred Wimple after her return from Lon-
don.
"O01, I wonder if it will come right'C" she said to her-
self. "If it does-if it does-if it does ! But I ought to
have had a letter by this time; it is long cnougl since
the telegram from Bombay. Something tells me that it
will come right; I think that is the meaning of the hap-
piness that has forced itself upon me lately. It is no use
trying to be miserable any longer. Iappiness seems to be
coming nearer and nearer. I have a sense of forgiveness
in my heart; surely I know what it means ? Perhaps, as





<pb n="312"/>312                  AUNT ANNE
Aunt Anne says, all I have suffered has been an atonement
for the wrong. One little letter, and I shall be content.
The dear old lady shall never go away from me; she shall
just be made as happy as possible." She got up and went
to the window, and leaned out towards the garden. " Those
trees at the end," she said to herself, "surely must hide
the way down to the dip, where she listened. It is very
lovely to-day"-and she looked up at the sky; "but I
wish the doctor would come, I should feel more satisfied."
There was a footstep.  "Yes, Clarke; is anything the
matter? Why have you come? You look quite pale."
"Mrs. Baines is going to die, ina'am; I am certain of it."
"Going to die?" Mrs. North's face turned white, and
she went towards the door.
"I don't mean this minute, ma'am; but just now she
opened her eyes and looked round as if she didn't see, and
then she picked at her dress as dying people do at the
sheet-it's a sure sign. Besides, she is black round the
mouth. I don't believe she will live three days."
Mrs. North clasped her hands, with fear.
"I wish she would stay in bed; the doctor said she
ought to do so yesterday; but she seemed better, and
begged so hard to come down this morning that I gave
way."
"It's another sign," said the maid; " they always want
to get up towards the last."
" The doctor promised he would be here by twelve, and
now it is nearly two."
IIe calne an hour later. "She must be taken up-stairs
at once," he said; so they carried her up, Clarke and the
doctor between them, while Mrs. North followed anxious-
ly ; and all of them knew that Aunt Anne would never 
walk down the stairs again.





<pb n="313"/>AUNT ANNE                   313
Then a telegram was sent to Florence and Walter, at
Monte Carlo.
But she was a little better in the evening, and Mrs.
North brightened up as she saw it. Perhaps Clarke was
a foolish croaker, and signs were foolish things to trouble
one's self about.  The old lady might live, after all, and
there would be some happiness yet.
" No, Aunt Anne, you are not going to get up yet," she
said next morning, in answer to an inquiring look; " you
must wait until the doctor has been; remember it is my
turn to be autocratic."
" Yes, my love "-and she dozed off. Half her time was
spent in sleep. Since Mrs. North's arrival there had stolen
over her a gradual contentment, as if a crisis had occurred,
and the blackness of the past grown dim. Perhaps it was
giving place to all that was in her heart, or the sound of
Mrs. North's fresh young voice, or the loving touch of
her hand. Be it what it might, Alfred Wimple and the
misery that he had caused seemed to have gone farther
and farther away, while peacefulness was stealing over ler.
"It is like being with my dear Florence and Walter," she
said to Mrs. North once-"only perhaps you understand
even better than they could, for you have gone through
the pain.
"Yes, dear Aunt Anne, I have gone through the pain"
-and Mrs. North sat waiting for the doctor again, not that
she was very uneasy to-day, for the old lady was a little
better, and hope grows up quickly when youth passes by.





<pb n="314"/>CnAIPTE  XXII
TnE sound of the door-bell, and of some one being
shown intf the drawing-room.
"Tlle doctor has come, Aunt Anne," Mrs. North said.
"I will invigorate myself witl a talk before I bring him
to you, and tell him that you are much better."  But in-
stead of the doctor she found a little, dried-up-looking old
gentleman standing in the middle of the room, holding
his hat and umbrella in one hland. she looked at him in-
quiringly.
" I understood that Mrs. Bailes was here," he said. Mrs.
North looked up, with expectation. "I have come from
London expressly to see her on important business. I was
solicitor to the late Sir Willim ammage," he added.
Mrs. North's spirits revived. This looked like a new and 
exciting pliase of the story.
"Are you Mr. Bough ton ?"
"I am Mr. Boughton "-and he made her a formal lit.
tie bow. "I see you understand-"
"Oh, yes," she said, eagerly; "and the ex-Lord Mayor
was the old lady's cousin. I regret to say that slhe is very
ill in bed, and cannot possibly see you, but I should be
happy to deliver any message."  Mr. Boughton looked at
her, with benevolent criticism, and thought lher a most
beautiful young woman.   She meanwhile grasped the
whole situation to her own satisfaction.  That horrid
Lord Mayor, as she mentally called Sir William, had





<pb n="315"/>AUNT ANNE                  315
probably told his solicitor all about Alfred Wimple; and
the little dried-up gentleman before her, who was (as she
had instantly remembered) the uncle, had conic to see how
the land lay. Mrs. North felt as convinced as Sir William
had done that the whole affair was a conspiracy between
the uncle and nephew, and slhe promptly determined to
make Mr. Boughton as uncomfortable as possible.
"I quite understand the business on which you have
come to see Mrs. Baines," she said, with decision, but with
a twinkle of mischief she could not help in her eyes. " You
have heard, of course, that the conduct of your delightful
nephew, Mr. Alfred Wimple, is entirely found out."
" God bless my soul !" said Mr. Boughton, astonished
out of his senses. " What has he to do with Mrs. Baines ?"
"You perhaps approved of his romantic marriage?"
Mrs. North inquired, politely. She was enjoying herself
enormously.
"His romantic marriage!" exclaimed the lawyer. " I
know nothing about it. My dear madam, what do you
mean ? Is that scoundrel married ?"
"Most certainly he is married," Mrs. North went on;
" and, as far as I can gather particulars from Mrs. Baincs,
your cllarming niece is a dress-maker at Liphook."
"At Liphook!" exclaimed Mr. Bougliton, more and
more astonished; " why-why-"
"lWhere she lives witl lher grand mother," continued
Mrs. Nortl, in the most amiable voice. "IIer mother,
I understand, lets lodgings in the Gray's Inn Road, and
it was Mr. Wimple's kind intention to pay the amount
he owes her out of Mrs. Baines's fortune."
" Good gracious !-that was the woman who came to me
the other day. I never heard of such a thing in my life!
How did he get hold of Mrs. Baines ?" There was some-





<pb n="316"/>316                 AUNT ANSNE
thing so genuine in his bewilderment that Mrs. North
began to believe in his honesty, but she was determined 
not to be taken in too easily.                       :
"The details are most exciting, and will be exceedingly
edifying in a court of justice. Now may I inquire why,
you so particularly wisl to see the old lady ?"
"I came to see her about the late Sir William Ram-
mage," Mr. Bouglton said, finding it difficult to collect
hig scattered wits after Mrs. North's information.
"Is he really dead, then ?" she asked, politely.
"Most certainly; he died on the fifth, and Mrs. Baines-" 
"She is much too ill to see anybody; and as I under-
stand he burned his will, and has not left her any money,
it is hardly worth while to worry her witl particulars of
his unlamented death."
" Burned his will  Yes, for some extraordinary reason
he did-so Charles, the man-servant, tells me-lhe did it in
her presence. He had no time to make another, for tho
agitation caused by her visit killed him."
"Or perhaps it was the mercy of Providence," remarked
Mrs. North.
Mr. Boughton did not heed the remark, but asked,
"May I inquire if you are in Mrs. Baines's confidence ?"
"Entirely," she answered, decisively.
"Then I may tell you that no former will has been
found, and she is next-of-kin. There are no other rela-
tions at all, I believe, and she will therefore inherit about
three times as much as if the burned will had remained in-
existence."
"Really !"-and Mrs. North clapped her hands for joy. 
And then the tears came into her eyes. "Oh, but it is 
too late, for she is dying; nothing can save her; she is
dying. I have telegraphed to her neplew and niece to





<pb n="317"/>AUNT ANNE                  317
come back from Monte Carlo. She has had a terrible
shock, from which she will never recover; and besides
that she has virtually starved herself and taken a hundred
colds. She has not the strength of a fly left. I know
she is dying," Mrs. North added, witl a sob she could
not help.
"Don't you think that the good news I bring might
save her life ?"
"No; and I am.not sure that it would be good to save
it, she has suffered so cruelly. What a wicked old man
Sir William Rammage was!" she burst out, and looked
up sympathetically at Mr. Bougllton.
" He was my client," the lawyer urged.
" He allowed the poor old lady to starve for want of
money, and now that he is dead and she is dying it comes
to her."
"Yes, it is very unfortunate-very unfortunate."
"Everything seems to be a point of view," Mrs. North
went on, in the eager manner whicl so often characterized
her. " Poverty is the point of view from lwhicl we look
at riches we cannot get; from vice we look at virtue which
we cannot attain; from liell we look at the heaven we
cannot reach. Perhaps Sir William Rammage would ap-
preciate the latter part of the remark now "-she said the
last words between laughter and tears.
" My dear madam," Mr. Boughton exclaimed, in rather
a shocked voice, "pray don't let us begin a discussion.
To go back to Mrs. Baines, I think if I could see her-"
" It is quite impossible; you would remind her of your
horrible nephew, and that would kill her."
" What on earth has she got to do with my nephew ?"
-and this time his manner convinced Mrs. North that he
was not an impostor.





<pb n="318"/>318                 AUNT ANNE 
"Mr. Boughton," she said, gravely, "the old lady is
very, very ill. the doctor says she cannot live, and I fear 
that the sight of you would kill her straight off; but, if
you like, I will go and sound her, and find out if she is
strong enough to bear a visit from you "-and, the lawyer
having agreed to this, Mrs. North went up-stairs.
"Dearest old lady"-her girlish voice had always a ten-
der note in it wlen she spoke to Aunt Anne. " I have
some good news for you-very good news. Do you think
you could bear to hear it " 
"Yes, my love," Aunt Anne answered, wheezily, "but
you must forgive me if I am sceptical as to its goodness."
Mrs. North knelt down by the bedside, and stroked the
thin hands. " Mr. Boughton is down-stairs; he has come
to tell you that Sir William Ranmmage is dead."
" Then it is true," Mrs. Baines said, sadly. " Poor Will-
iam! My dear, we once lay in the same cradle together,
while our mothers watched beside it. What does Mr.
Boughton say about Alfred ?"
" le doesn't appear to know anything about his wick-
edness."
"I felt sure he did not; I never believed in the deprav-
ity of human nature."
"Then how would you account for Mr. Wimple ?" she
asked, with much interest. Tlie old lady considered for
a moment.
" Perhaps he was my punishment for all I did in the
past. I have thought that lately, and tried to bear it-
only it is more than I can bear. It has humiliated me
too much. Tell me wly Mr. Boughton has come; is it
anything about Alfred ?"
" Nothing," was the emphatic answer; " and if you see
him I advise you not to mention Mr. Wimple's name."  4
i





<pb n="319"/>ACNT ANNE                   319
"My dear," Aunt Anne said, impressively, "except to
yourself, his name will never pass my lips again. I feel
that it is desecration to my dear Walter and Florence to
mention it in their house. I shall never forgive myself
for having brought him into it. But perlaps all I have.
suffered is some expiation; you and I have botl felt tlat
about our frailty "-and she shook her head. " What is
the good news ?"
"Mr. Bougllton brought it, and it is about Sir William's
money."   Mrs. Baines was silent for a moment; then she
looked up, with a little wink, and a smile came to her lips.
" I should like to see him," she said. " But will you help
me to get up first? I think if I could sit by the open win-
dow I should be better."
"Perhaps you would, you dear; it's warm enough for
summer. Let me help you into your dressing-gown. Stay,
you shall wear mine. It is very smart, with lavender
bows; quite proper half-mourning for a cousin. There-
now-gently "-and she helped the old lady into the easy-
chair by the window. It was a long business, but at last
sle was safely there, with the sunshine falling on ler, and
the soft lace and lavender ribbons of Mrs. North's dress-
ing-gown about her poor old neck.
"And are you sure it's good news, my love ?" she asked
Mrs. North.
" I am quite sure," Mrs. North answered, as slhe tucked
an cider-down quilt round Aunt Anne. "IIe has come
from London on purpose to bring it to you."
" Has he partaken of any refreshment since he arrived ?"
"No; but I will have some ready for hlim   en lie
comes down frolm his talk witl you. Now you shall have
your tete-dt-te "-and Mrs. North went back to the lawyer.
" You must break it to hler very, very gently, and you





<pb n="320"/>320                 AUNT ANNE
mustn't be more than five or ten minutes with her," she
said, as she took him up to the bedroom door.
Aunt Anne was so much fatigued with the exertion of
getting up that she found it a hard matter to receive Mr.
Boughton with all the courtesy she desired to show him.:
She took the news of her fortune very quietly; it did not;'
even excite her.
"It is too late," she said. " Nothing can solace me fori
what I have lost; but it will enable me to make provision'
for my dear Walter and Florence."  Her eyes closed; heri
head sank on her breast; she put out her hand towards the>
window, as if to clutch at something that was not there.
Mr. Boughton saw it, and understood.
" I cannot repay you for your kindness and considera-
tion," she went on, presently. "Even when I have dis-
charged my pecuniary obligation I shall still remain your.
debtor. But there are some things I should like to do.
I wish Mrs. North to have a sum of money; I will tell her
my wishes in regard to it."
"Perhaps I had better return in a day or two. Yo
must forgive me for saying, my dear madam, that, with
the vast sum that is now at your disposal, you ought to
make a will immediately. I could take instructions now
if you like."
"Instructions?" she repeated, witl a puzzled air;"
will give them all to Mrs. North, and you can take them
from her. You will not think me inhospitable if I ask
you to leave me now, Mr. Bougliton? I am very tired.
Tell me, did they send for you when William Rammage:
died ?"
"They telegraphed for me immediately, and when
got to the office I found your letter waiting for me-th
one you wrote before you left London, giving me your





<pb n="321"/>AUNT ANNE                  321
address here." She did not hear him; her eyes had closed
again, and her chin rested down on the lavender ribbons;
the sunshine came in and lighted up her face, and that
which Mr. Boughton saw written on it was unmistakable.
"You are quite right, my dear madam," he said to Mrs.
North, as he sat partaking of the refreshment Aunt Anne
had devised for him; "it has come too late."
He looked at his watch when he had finished. "I have
only a quarter of an hour to stay," he said. " Before I
go, would you give me some explanation of the extraordi-
nary statements you made on my arrival ?"
"You shall have it," Mrs. North answered, eagerly;
"but wait one moment, till I have taken this egg and
wine to Mrs. Baines and seen that the maid is with her."
" That's a remarkably handsome girl," the lawyer
thought, when she had disappeared; "I wonder where
I have heard her name before, and who she is ?" Bllt this
speculation was entirely forgotten when he heard the story
of his nephew's doings of the last few months. "God
bless my soul!" he exclaimed; "why, he might be sent
to prison with hard labor-and serve him right, the
scoundrel!"
"I am delighted to hear you say it," Mrs. Nortl an-
swered, impulsively. " Please shake hands with me. I am
ashamed to say I thought it all a conspiracy, even after
you came, and that is why I was so disagreeable."
" Conspiracy, my dear madam ?-why, the last thing I
did to Wimple was to kick him out of my office; and I
have been worried by his duns ever since. As for the
will she made in his favor, get it destroyed at once or lie
may give us no end of trouble yet.  She has virtually
given me instructions for a new one. I told her I would
come in a day or two, but I think it would be safer to
21





<pb n="322"/>322                 AUNT ANNE 
come to-morrow. It will have to be rather late in
day, I am afraid, but I can sleep at the inn. In the mea
time get the other will destroyed. Why, bless me! if at
died to-night it might make an awful scandal; I would
not have it happen for all I am worth."
Mr. Bonglton departed; and the doctor came, and ga
so bad a report that Mrs. North sent off yet another tell!

ing them not to waste a moment on their arrival, but to
come straight to Witley.   And then the second po
brought her the morning's letters which had been sent
on. Among them was one with the Naples post-mark,!
which she tore open with feverish haste and could scarce-
ly read for tears of joy.
"I could not write before," it said. "I am detained
here by a friend's illness; but now that I am thus far J
send you just a line to say I shall be with you soon, and 
shall never leave you again. I hate to think it all. TI

"It is too much happiness to bear," she said, with a so
"It is all I wanted, that he should love me-I must writ
this minute, or he will wonder"-and she got out her blo

and, kneeling down by the table, wrote,
"I am here with Mrs. Baincs, and she is dying. I have just--ju

She sealed it up; and, seizing her lat, went once round
the garden, for the cottage seemed too small a house

her. She looked up to the sky, and thought how blessed
it was to be beneath it, and away at the larches and fir-
trees, and wondered if he and she would ever walk be-
tween them. Something told her that they would if-if
all came right, if she found that he loved her so much
that he could not live without her.  They would lead
such ideal lives; they would do their very best for every
one, and make so many people happy, and cover up the
past with all the good that love would surely put it into
their hearts to do. "It would be too much to bear," she
said to herself; " it is too much to think of yet-  I will
go back to my dear old lady, and comfort her."
Aunt Anne was much better for her interview with
Mr. Boughton. The excitement had done her good, and
some of her little consequential ways had returned with
the knowledge of her wealth.
"I am glad to see you, my love," she said to Mrs.
North; " I have many things to discuss with you if you
will permit me to encroach on your good-nature. Would
you mind sitting down on the footstool again beside me,
as you did yesterday?" The maid had lifted her on to
the old-fashioned sofa at the foot of the bed. She was
propped up witl pillows, and looked so well and comfort-
able it seemed almost possible that she might live.
"I will," Mrs. North answered, still overcome with her
own thoughts--"'  will sit at your feet, and receive your
royal commands. But first permit me to say that you are
looking irresistible-my lavender ribbons give you a most
ravishing appearance."
" You are in excellent spirits," Aunt Anne said, with a
pleased smile; " and so am I," she added. " It has done me
a world of good to hear that William Ranlmage's iniqui-
tous intentions have been frustrated."

"I trust he is aware of it," Mrs. North answered, " and that 
his soul is delightfully vexed by the enterprising Satan."
"My love," said the old lady, with a shocked wink, "you
hardly understand the purport of your own words."
"Yes, I do," Mrs. North said, emphatically, "but notr
I want to speak about something much more important.

very long words when I offend you."
"I will endeavor to do so, my love; but I hope that somdi
one else will do it better"-she stopped and closed her eyeas
"I believe you are a witch, and you know about my 
letter. It has just come, and has made me so happy," Mrs.
North said, between laughing and crying.
"What does he say ?" the old lady asked, without open.,
ing her eyes.
"lie says he is coming," Mrs. North answered, ahnost
in a whisper. "It's almost more than I can bear. I
think it will all come right. The other was never a mar-
riage-it was cruel to call it one; it was a girl's body and&
soul made ready for ruin by those who persuaded her"
and she put her face down.
"My dear, I understand now; I think I was very unf
sympathetic. But purity counts before all things "-andi
Aunt Anne's lips quivered. "Tell me, my love, have you
heard-I know it is painful to you to hear his name, but
have you heard anything of Mr. North lately?"  Mrs
North looked up with a mischievous twinkle in her eyet
which a moment before had been full of tears, and an,.
swered, demurely, 
"I am told that he is casting his eyes on an amiable lad
of forty-five. She is the sister of an eminent Q. C., hl





<pb n="325"/>AUNT ANNE                  325
read Buckle's 'History of Civilization,' and her favorite
fad is the abolition of capital punishment. But I don't
want to talk of my affairs, Aunt Anne, I want to talk of
yours-they are more momentous." Mrs. North prided
herself on picking up Aunt Anne's words, and using them
with great discretion.
" Yes, my love, I am most grateful to you."
"I am certain-as I tell you-that you are going to
live and get well." Mrs. North meant her words at the
moment, for, with the sweet insolence of youth, she was
incredulous of death until it was absolutely before her
eyes. "But at the same time," she went on, " now that
you are enormously rich, you ought to take precautions in
case of an accident. If the cottage were burned down to-
night, and we were burned with it, who would inherit your
money ?"
" I told Mr. Boughton that I would give my instructions
to you, and he is coming the day after to-morrow."
" But have you destroyed the will you made in favor
of Alfred Wimple "
"I have not got it; he took it away witl him." Mrs.
North looked quite alarmed.
"We must make another, this minute," she said; "if
the conflagration took place this evening he would get
every penny. Let me make it this minute. I can do it
on a sheet of note-paper. Don't agitate your dear old
self, I shall be back directly "-and in a moment she had
fled down-stairs and returned with her blotting-book, and
once more she knelt down by a table to write. " You
want to leave everything to the Hibberts, don't you ?"
" Yes; but if you would permit me, my love, I should
like to leave you something."
" Then I couldn't make the will, for it would not be





<pb n="326"/>326                  AUNT ANNE
legal; besides, I am rich enough, you kind old lady. Shall 
I begin ?"
"Stop one moment, my dear; will you give me a little
sal volatile first, and let me rest for five minutes?" She 
closed her eyes, but it was not to sleep; she appeared to 
be tlinking of something that disturbed her. When she
looked up again she was almost panting with excitement
as well as weakness, and there was the fierce, yet fright- 
cned, look in her eyes that had been in them when she i2
opened the front door to turn Alfred Wimple out of the i.
house.
"I want you to do something for me," she said, almost 
in a whisper-" I want you to have a sum of money, and ':
to get it to him"-shle could not make herself utter his
name-" on condition that he goes out of the country with
it. Let him go to Australia with the w'oman-"
"Yes," Mrs. North said, seeing she hesitated.
" she is not in his position, and could never be received:
in society."
"No, dear," Mrs. North said, reflecting that Mr. Wim-4,
pie's position was not particularly exalted.
"I want him to go out of the country," Aunt Anneo
went on-" as far away as possible; I cannot breathe the 
same air with hlim, or bear to think that he is beneath the

moment, and shuddered, and put her tlin hands, one over 
the other, under her chin. " When I am dead and buried," 
she went on, "I believe I should know if his body was.

feel the desecration. It has killed me; it has made me

eager to die. But I want to know that he will go away
-that none of those I care for will ever see his face
again; it will be a sacrilege if he even passes them in the
street. I want him to have a sum of money, and to go
away."
" I will take care that he has it," Mrs. North said, gen-
tly, "I will speak to the Hibberts. But, Aunt Anne,"
she asked, "don't you think you might forgive himn? Iie
shall go away, but you would not like to die without for-
giving him ?" Mrs. North did not for a moment expect
her to do it, or even wish it, but she felt it almost a duty
to say wlat she did from a little notion, as old-fashioned
as one of Aunt Anne's perhaps, about dying in charity
witll all men.
"No, you must not ask me to do that"-and her voice
was determined. " I cannot; it was too terrible."
"And I am very glad," Mrs. North said, having eased
her conscience with the previous remark-" a slightly re-
vengeful spirit comforts one so much."
"Don't let us ever speak of him again, even you and
I. I want to shut him out of the little bit of life I have
left."
"We never will," Mrs. North said. "Let this be the
Amen of him. Now I will make the will. Iere is a
sheet of note-paper and a singularly bad quill pen."
" This is the last Will and Testament of me, Anne Baines (sometime
called Wimple). I revoke all other wills and codicils, and give and
bequeath everything that is mine or may be mine to my dear nephew
and niece, Walter and Florence Hibbert."
The maid came and stood on one side and Mrs. North
on the other, while Aunt Anne gave a little wink to her-
self, and pushed aside the end of the lavender ribbon lest





<pb n="328"/>328                 AUNT ANNE
it should smudge the paper, and signed Anne Baines,
looking at every letter as she made it with intense in-
terest.
" I am glad to write that name once more," she said,
and fell back, with a sigh.

<pb n="329"/>CHAPTER XXIII
IT was a long night that followed. A telegram had ar-
rived from the Hibberts. They were on their way, and
coming as fast as possible, they said; but through the dark
hours, as Mrs. North sat beside Aunt Anne, she feared
that death would come still faster.
Her bronchitis was worse at times; she could hardly
breathe; it was only the almost summer-like warmth that
saved ler. She talked of strange people when she could
find voice to do so-people of whom Mrs. North had
never heard before; but it seemed somehow as if they had
silently entered-as if they filled the house, and were wait-
ing. At midnight and in the still small hours of the morn-
ing she could fancy that they were going softly up and
down the stairs; that they peered into the room in whicl
Aunt Anne lay-the one to the front that looked down on
the long white road stretching from the city to the sea.
" Oh, if the Hibberts would come," Mrs. North said, a
dozen times. " I want her to die with her own people. I
love ler, but I am a stranger."
So the night passed.
"My dear," Aunt Anne asked, opening her eyes, " is it
morning yet ?"
"Yes," Mrs. North answered, tenderly, "and a lovely
morning. The sun is shining, and a tlrusll is singing on the
tree outside. We will open the window presently, and let
the summer in." An hour passed, and the postman came,





<pb n="330"/>330                  AUNT ANNE
but he brought no news of those who were expected. 
Later on the doctor looked in, and said her pulse wasi
weaker.
"She must live a little longer," Mrs. North said, in deo-
spair; " she must, indeed."
"I will come again this afternoon," he said; "perhaps
she may have a little rally." While Aunt Anne dozed and i
the maid watched, Mrs. North, unable to sit quietly any
longer, wandered up and down the house, and round the 
little drawing-room, bending her face over the pot-pourri 
on the corner cupboard, opening the piano and looking at
the yellow keys she did not venture to touch. And then,,
restlessly, she went into the garden, and gathered some oak I
and beech bougls, with the fresh young leaves upon them, ?
and put them in pots, as Aunt Anne had once done for'
the home-coming of Florence.
"I cannot feel as if she is going to die," she thought,
"but rather as if she were going to meet the people sh
knew long ago; it will be a festival for them."  Sl
looked down the road, and strained her cars, but there wa
no sound of a carriage, no sign of Walter and Floren
Then, for a moment, she remembered her letter, but s
was afraid to let herself linger over it while Aunt An
up-stairs lay dying. " It is all such a tangle," she said 
herself-" life and death, and joy and sorrow, and which
best it is difficult to say."  Aunt Anne's little breaka
was ready, and she carried it up herself, and lovingl
watched the old lady trying to swallow a spoonful.
"You look a little better again, Aunt Anne."
"Yes, love; and I shall be much better when I have
those dear children. I am not quite happy about that 
I wanted you to have some remembrance of me."
"Give me something," Mrs. North said-"someth





<pb n="331"/>AUNT ANNE                  331
you have worn; I shall like that better than a legacy, be-
cause I shall have it from your own two living hands."
"I have parted with all my possessions, but Florence
and Walter shall be commissioned to get you some-
tiling."
"The thing I should have liked," Mrs. North answered,
" was a little brooch you used to wear. It had hair in the
middle, and a crinkly gold setting around it."
"My dear," said Aunt Anne, dreamily, "it is in a little
box in my left-hand drawer; but it needs renovating-the
pin is broken, and the glass and the hair have come out.
It belonged to my mother."
" Give it to me," Mrs. North said, eagerly. " I will have
it done up, and wear it till you are better, and then you
shall have it back; let me get it at once"-and in her eager
manner she went to the drawer. "IHere it is," she said.
"It will make a little gold buckle. I have a canary-col-
ored ribbon in the next room; I will put it through, and
wear it round my neck. Aunt Anne, you have made me
a present."
"I am delighted that it meets with your approval, my
dear"-and there was a long silence. the morning dragged
on-a happy spring morning, on which, as Mrs. North said
to herself, you could almost hear the summer walking to
you over the little flowers. Presently Aunt Anne called
her.
" I was thinking," she said, "of a canary-colored dress
I had when I was a girl. I wore it at my first ball-it was
a military ball, my dear, and the officers were all in uni-
form. As soon as I entered the room, Captain Maxwell
asked me to dance; but I felt quite afraid, and said, ' You
must take off your sword, if you please, and put it on one
side.' Think of my audacity in asking him to do such a





<pb n="332"/>332                 AUNT ANNE
thing; but he did it. Your ribbon made me remember:
it"-and again she dropped off to sleep.
Mrs. North went to the window, and looked out once.
more. " I feel like sister Anne on the watch-tower," she 
said to hersclf. "If they would only come."  Suddenly a
dread overcame her. Florence and Walter knew nothing of 
Alfred Wimple's conduct. They might arrive, and, before
she had time to tell them, by some chance word cause
Aunt Anne infinite pain.  The shame and humiliation
seemed to have gone out of the old lady's life during the 
last day or two. It would be a cruel thing to remind her
of it.  She had made herself ready to meet death. It,
was coming to her gently and surely, with thoughts' of 
those she loved, and a remembrance of the days that had 
been before the maddening shame of the past year. Mrs.:
North went down-stairs. Jane Mitchell was in the kitchen. 
" Is there any way of sending a note to the station ?" she
asked.
"Why, yes, ma'amn; Lucas would take it with the pony-
cart."
" Go to him, ask him to get ready at once, and come fo
the letter."  As shortly as possible she wrote an accou
of all that had taken place at the cottage, and explaine
her own presence there.         ,
" Take this at once to the station-master, and ask hiI
to give it to Mr. and Mrs. Hibbert the moment they
rive, and to see that they come here by the fastest fly tha
is there."  And once more she went up to the front bed
room. Aunt Anne was sleeping peacefully; a little smi
was on her lips. Mrs. North went to the window, a
looked up and down the long straight road, and over
the fir-trees.  Presently Lucas came by with the pon
cart; he touched his hat, pulled the note out of his p





<pb n="333"/>AUNT ANNE                  333
to show that he had it safely, and drove on in the sun-
shine. The birds were twittering everywhere. A clump
of broom was nearly topped with yellow; some spots of
gold were on the gorse. Half an hour-Aunt Anne still
slept. Mrs. North put her arms on the window-sill, and
rested her head down on them with her face turned to the
road that led to the station. " If only the Hibberts would
come !" she said. "Oh, if they would come !"
Tle long morning went into afternoon. A change came
over Aunt Anne. It was plain enough this time. She
spoke once, very gently and so indistinctly that Mrs. North
could hardly make out the words, though she bent over her,
trying to understand.
" Aunt Anne, dear, do you know me?" A smile came
over the old lady's face. She was thinking of something
that pleased her.
" Yes, dear Walter," she said, "you must get some choc-
olates for those dear children, and I will reimburse you."
Then the little woman, who had watched so bravely, broke
down, and, kneeling by the bedside, sobbed softly to her-
self.
" Oh, they must come; oh, they must come," she whis-
pered.  "Perhaps I had better rouse her a little," she
thought after a little while, and slipped her arm under the
old lady's sloulder.
"Aunt Anne-Aunt Anne, dear," she said, " Walter and
Florence are coming; they are hurrying to you, do you
hear me ?"
" Yes, my love," the old lady said, recovering a little,
and recognizing her. "You said it was morning time,
and a thrush was singing on the tree outside. I think I
hear it."
"You do; listen, dear, listen !" and Mrs. North turned her





<pb n="334"/>334                  AUNT ANNE
face towards the window, as though she were listening,
and looked at Aunt Anne's face, as if to put life into'
her. And as she did so there came upon her ears a joy-
fil sound, the one she most longed to hear in the world--
the sound of carriage wlleels.
" They have colie," she said; " thank God! they have
collie."
Aunt Anne seemed to understand; an expression. o
rcstfulness came over her face; she closed her eyes, as if'
satisfied. Mrs. North was in despair; it seemed as if they 
would be a moment too late.
"Dearest old lady, they have conic! tllcy are in the g
den! Wake up!-vake up, to see them.      Stay, let m
prop you up a little bit more."  she could scarcely say
tlhe words, her heart was so full. "Tlhere, now you eas'
see the fir-trees and the sunshine. Kiss me once, de
Aunt Annc, I am going to fetch your children"-ani
she gently drew her arms away. The IIibberts were I
the house-they were on the stairs already. Mrs. Nor
met them. "You are just in time," she whispered 
Florence-" she has waited."
Mrs. Iibbcrt could not speak, but she stopped one 
ment to put her arms round Mrs. North's neck, and t
went on.
"Come with us," Walter said.
" No," Mrs. North answered, chokingly, while the t
ran down her face. "Slie is waiting for you. Go in 
her. I liave no business thlere."
Without a word they went to Aunt Anne. Like a
there came over Florence the remembrance of the
when she had first entered the room, and had thought tl
it looked like a room to die in. the old lady did not m
a sign. For a moment tley stood by hler silently. 
ence stooped, and kissed the coverlet. 
!.,





<pb n="335"/>AUNT ANNE                  335
"Dear Aunt Anne," they said, tenderly, "we have
come."  Then a look of joy spread over the old lady's
face. She made one last struggle to speak.
" My dear Walter and Florence," she said, and stopped
for a moment. "I have not been able ... to make any
preparation for your arrival . . . but Mrs. North"-she
stopped again, and her eyes closed. They went a little
nearer to each other, and stood watching.
The scent of the fresh spring air filled the room. The
sunshine was passing over the house. There was the clear
note of a bird, but not another sound. the bird ceased,
and all was still-so still that Florence looked up, with a
questioning look of fear upon her face. Walter bent over
the bed for a moment, thlen gently put his arm round his
wife's shoulder. Aunt Anne had journeyed on.
THE END

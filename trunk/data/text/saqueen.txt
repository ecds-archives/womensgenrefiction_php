MY QUEEN;

OR,

OREANA BRENTFORD.

PART FIRST.

CHAPTER I

THE BRENTFORDS.

THE BRENTFORDS, of Brentford Farm, Middlesex, England, were an ancient and honorable yeoman family, who, in the secure enjoyment of moderate wealth, led a peaceful, pleasurable existence upon their own goodly estate.
<p>The only shadow that obscured the happiness of the Brentfords was the thought that soon the old name would be extinct; for Mr. and Mrs. William Bremtford had but one child--a daughter. However, to make amends for this disappointment, this daughter was richly endowed with beauty and mental gifts; and as she grew to womanhood, the fond parents forgot they were sonless in the joy of having such a
daughter.</p>
<p>"My queen," the proud father called her; and the
<pb n="8     THE BRENTFORDS."/>
 
title seemed well suited to the stately figure, far above the usual stature of woman, yet so harmoniously proportioned that one knew not which to admire most,--its grace, or its majesty. A queen, indeed, Oreana Brentford appeared, as she moved among her girl companions, with the dignified reserve of a sovereign; and no crown did she need; save the massive braids of her chestnut-brown hair. But when soul enthusiasm flamed out of her hazel gray eyes, and the pale, statuesque face grew luminous in the glowing radiations, when the regal form swayed in the ecstasy of exaltation, the queen became a priestess.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the blending of these peculiar types that gave to Oreana an undefinable expression, as of some hidden power, or some strange destiny, that would isolate her from woman kind.</p>
<p>This idea of expectancy, this vague surmising of what she would do,--what would happen to her, impressed and attracted a stranger more than did her beauty.</p>
<p>Had she suddenly developed into a Deborah or--a Judith, few would have felt surprised; except, perhaps, her parents, who deemed it impossible that a Brentford could ever diverge from the well-known path within whose narrow limits they and their ancestors had walked contentedly.</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen Oreana accepted as her affianced husband Julian Bellew, the heir of the manor, and her second cousin. The Bellews and Brentfords hailed with delight this engagement. It promised the realization of all their hopes and wishes, for the union of Oreana and Julian had always been the pet scheme of the two families.</p>
<p>For once the course of true love ran smoothly--
<pb n="THE LOVERS.     9"/>

every one seemed delighted. Those who had prophesied an ominous destiny for Oreana were silenced; some still shook their heads and pitied Julian, but they numbered few, and the general voice declared the lovers the happiest of the happy.</p>
<p>Pre-eminently happy they seemed to be, blest with love, beauty, home joys, and the world's favors.</p>

CHAPTER II.

THE LOVERS.


ONE bright spring afternoon in the year 1856, within a rustic pavilion at Brentford, sat the lovers. Julian read aloud the "Fire Worshipers." Oreana was supposed to be listening, but it was evident from her abstracted gaze, that her spirit had wandered too far away to hear even a lover's tones. At last, Julian, discovering that Oreana did not hear him, closed the book, and drew near to his lady-love, saying:</p>
<p>"Oreana, what are you thinking about? For the last half-hour you have sat silent, immovable, with all the sunshine gone from your face. I do not think you have heard a word that I have read. Do, love, look again like yourself, or I shall fancy you are a Parca, about to snip my life-thread."</p>
<p>"A Parca! What a queer fancy; and yet, perhaps it is a truthful one. I am a Fate."</p>
<p>"You are mine, darling,--my Clotho. Weave my web of golden threads.  But there,--these fingers could weave nought else but gold. Won't you smile? this is our last <hi rend=”italic">tete &agrave; tete</hi> for a long week."</p>
<pb n="10     THE LOVERS."/>

<p>"A week?" echoed Oreana, half dreamily, half interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Why yes, dear, to-morrow you know I go to Liverpool; and you, the next day, to Cousin Laura's; so we shall not meet again until next week."</p>
<p>"Perhaps never again."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Come, cheer up; why, two months from to-day will be our wedding day."</p>
<p>"No, Julian, it cannot be."</p>
<p>The young man started.</p>
<p>"Cannot be? What does it all mean?" Have I angered you?"</p>
<p>"Angered me! No, Julian; but there is something I must tell you. You never would listen to me, but now you must. The Word of God has come unto me. It calls upon me to arise--to leave Babylon."</p>
<p>"Good God! Are you going to be a nun?"</p>
<p>"A nun? God forbid. No, a greater light has been vouchsafed to me--a light that makes me one of God's saints."</p>
<p>"There, dear; don't go back to that tabooed subject. We all know you are a saint; but what has that to do with our marriage?"</p>
<p>"It has everything to do with it. I cannot marry you unless you receive the truth, and are baptized; and even then I will not marry until we are in the holy Zion."</p>
<p>"Oreana, you are driving me mad. Say it is all a jest. You cannot possibly mean that you are a Mormon."</p>
<p>"I do not jest; I am a Mormon."</p>
<p>Julian started as if stung, his eyes dilated with horror.</p>
<pb n="THE LOVERS.     11"/>

<p>"Oreana, I cannot believe it. You, so pure, so good, so noble, to accept an abominable creed like Mormonism."</p>
<p>"Abominable! Julian, you know not of what you speak. The early Christians were also called abominable. Christ was crucified as a conspirator. Luther was charged with every crime. Surely, then, we can endure calumny. What do you know about the saints, or Mormons as you call them, that you malign them in this way?"</p>
<p>"You speak truly, Oreana; but the early Christians were pure. Do not these Mormons commend and practice polygamy?"</p>
<p>"And were not Abraham, Jacob, and the Patriarchs, were not David and Solomon polygamists? Yet do we not reverence them? Are they not upheld by all the churches as models of virtue and wisdom? What have you to reply?"</p>
<p>"Only that these wise and good men belonged to a different age, a different civilization to ours; and I should no more think of doing anything against my conscience, or antagonistic to our civilization, simply because they did it, than I would dwell in a tent because Abraham did so, or, instead of a gun, use a sling because such was David's weapon."</p>
<p>"I own I have never studied the Bible sufficiently to refute your arguments in a learned manner; but certainly, common sense seems to confute them."</p>
<p>"Yes, the wisdom of the serpent is found in the mouths of the wicked; and in the Latter Day their hearts shall be hardened. But Julian, do not you be like unto them. Come with me to the desert that has
<pb n="12     THE LOVERS."/>

blossomed like a rose, to the city of God on the mountains. Leave Babylon!--leave the wicked!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my love; there is no wickedness here. Are not our parents as good as they can be, are not our friends upright, intelligent, God-loving Christians?
I own I am not very churchy, but I try to do right, to lead a peaceful life. Again: why should you imagine God is in one particular spot? Does not the Bible say that He is everywhere--and wherever good will and happiness reign, there he loves to dwell? God smiles upon us here, in this lovely vale,--as benignly as He would on that far-off mountain; and certainly we can serve Him as well, if not better, here among civilized people, than we could among savages."</p>
<p>"No, Julian: in Zion only can we serve God, in Zion only can we be saved at that awful day--of doom fast, fast approaching; in Zion only can our marriage be recorded in Heaven. To Zion I go; no earthly obstacle is strong enough to prevent me."</p>
<p>"My love, my love," cried Julian, pressing her to his heart." I conjure you, I implore you, by all that is holy, by the sacred words <hi rend=”italic">home</hi> and <hi rend=”italic">love</hi>, banish these ideas. Our heavenly Father cannot wish you to break these sacred ties, to kill your fond parents, for they will die if you leave them thus. No! God cannot wish it. It is blasphemy to say He does. Oreana, have pity upon me, upon yourself. Do not leave all that is bright and beautiful. Break away from this evil influence--throw off these delusion--promise me you will think no more of these wild projects, promise, beseech you--"</p>
<p>Oreana disengaged herself from Julian's embrace, walked slowly to the door of the pavilion, and there
<pb n="THE LOVERS.     13"/>

stood silent and motionless gazing out upon the glowing West, as if seeking inspiration.</p>
<p>At length she turned to speak.</p>
<p>Julian started with surprise. Was this Oreana, or was it not rather a pythoness of ancient Delphos about to pronounce his doom?  Never did priestess look more inspired than did Oreana. Her figure seemed to grow tall and expand; a wondrous light shone in her face, and her features became luminously transparent. She stood, framed in sunbeams, one radiant hand stretched out towards the West, a personification of religious enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Julian," she cried, her voice vibrant with passionate exaltation: "Julian, I hear the voice of God saying unto me, 'My daughter, arise out of Babylon; come to my city, to the New Jerusalem. I bid thee leave father, mother, home, all, for me.' Yes, I hear the voice, and I see angel forms beckoning to me. In their hands are palmy crowns, martyrs' crowns. Again I hear the voice saying, 'Arise quickly, my daughter; all they that love Me, arise out of Babylon ere she be destroyed.' Yes, I see the angel of the Lord descending, in his hands war, famine, and pestilence. I see the proud ones of the earth swept away into perdition. I see the Holy One of Israel coming in dazzling splendor to reign in Zion. Let us go, Julian, to meet him, to reign with Him. Let our example inspire those we love to become saints of Zion. But if you will not come, woe be unto you. Woe unto all who will not listen--woe, woe to--"</p>
<p>Oreana stopped suddenly. A dark cloud obscured the sun, its glory vanished, and with it her inspiration. A gloom, prophetic of the future, enfolded the lovers,
<pb n="14      THE LOVERS."/>               

who silently left the pavilion, never again to enter it together.</p>
<p>As they approached the house, the sound of merry voices and laughter greeted them. Julian paused.</p>
<p>"Oreana, I cannot go in now. It is no use to cloud the happiness of our parents. They would see that something was wrong, and--and I--we need not tell them, yet, for I know you will soon think differently. Don't you think so, dear? A change will make us feel better, and it would be cruel to worry them. We will talk this over when we meet again. Shall it be so, my darling?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," sadly replied Oreana. "We shall
 agree, no doubt, when we meet again. Good bye, Julian, God bless you."</p>
<p>Tears filled Oreana's eyes, and Julian was forced to rush away, to hide his emotion.</p>
<p>Often did he look back and wave adieus to Oreana, who stood watching him as he slowly disappeared. Not until a turn in the road hid him from her sight did she move, and then it was to run to the pavilion steps, from whence she could see him enter the manor.</p>
<p>One last farewell; then Oreana turned towards the house. She walked slowly, looking fondly at every familiar object.</p>
<p>She, also, seemed to dread meeting her parents; for she avoided the parlor, and sought her own room, where, with locked doors, she knelt in prayer.</p>
<pb n=" THE DEVOTEE.     15"/>

CHAPTER II.

THE DEVOTEE.


OREANA was unfortunate, in that she was placed out of her proper sphere and age.</p>
<p>Born a century later, when a rational education could have developed her reason and trained her energies, she would have been a heroic leader in the march of Progress, instead of a discontented, eccentric young lady. Or had she belonged to the charmed circle of nobility, she might have indulged her marked individualisms, without entailing upon her sad consequences. But she was only a well-to-do nobody, with just sufficient luxury, education, and position, to make her one of the happy ones without a history.</p>
<p>Oreana longed for action. Feminine avocations were distasteful to her, and the gaiety of visits, parties and balls, disgusted her. She was profoundly religious; yet she declined to take active interest in church duties, because the creeds did not satisfy her soul.</p>
<p>At one time she thought of becoming a foreign missionary; but, upon further deliberation, she concluded that any religion that was fashionable, popular, or even tolerated, could not be the true one.</p>
<p>Oreana sighed for persecution. Her nature was strongly combative. Veneration and spirituality were controlled by combativeness. Her soul demanded persecution, so that she might sacrifice her loves--herself, to win a martyr's laurels.</p>
<p>And here, a psychological problem suggests itself. Do not the characteristics of would-be martyrs, their                                                    <pb n="16      THE   DEVOTEE."/>
               

defiance of the world, and self-crucifixion, spring from the same source as the war-loving, cruel impulses of the warrior and tyrant?</p>
<p>In the fanatic, combativeness is spiritualized; in the tyrant, it is brutalized. In the former, God is the  end, self the victim: in the latter, self is the end, the neighbor the victim.</p>
<p>With a nature so contradictory and unsatisfied, Oreana could not be happy. Misunderstood by all around her, she had no friends in whom she could confide. She belonged to a class of happy, unthinking people, who accepted their church without a question, and who considered the problems of the day as entirely out of their sphere, if, indeed, they gave them a thought.</p>
<p>So Oreana sighed, desired, and meditated in solitude. Her aspirations, finding no vent, filled heart and brain with chimeras. For her betrothed, she entertained an affection which she imagined to be love; and her approaching marriage somewhat diverted her mind.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then, her spirit would revolt, more especially when, upon some church festival, she attended the cathedral service.</p>
<p>The magnificence of the antique pile, the glorious music, the elegant, nobly-born officiates, the fashionable, languid congregation, aroused her contempt.</p>
<p>Bah! she was sick of it all! What merit was there in such ease and luxury?</p>
<p>How she sighed for the catacombs of the early Christians!</p>
<p>During one of these discontented fits, she visited some cousins at Liverpool; there she became acquainted with the sect of Latter Day Saints.</p>
<pb n="THE DEVOTEE.     17"/>

<p>She was attracted to it immediately.</p>
<p>The rude, unadorned meeting-house,--the preacher, plain in appearance and language, yet so earnest and inspirational, like unto the Galilean fishermen, the fanatical devotion of the lowly assembly, all delighted her. It almost equalled the catacombs.</p>
<p>Then the command to leave the world and its follies; to assemble, as the Jews of old, in a city of God, satisfied her impatient energies. Here was a field for action. Her fancy was dazzled by its prophets and apostles, its visions and revelations, by its gospel miraculously found, and as miraculously read by means of the Urim and Thummim. Her imagination rejoiced in this restoration of the past.</p>
<p>But when the preacher depicted the murder of the prophet Joseph, the banishment of the saints from Nauvoo, their trials and persecutions, Oreana wept for joy. She had found that which she had so long desired. Before leaving Liverpool she received baptism.</p>
<p>Oreana failed in her attempt to convert her family. No one would listen to her exhortations; the books she placed on her father's desk, in her mother's work-basket, were speedily burned. Julian laughed, her friends pitied her hallucination, her mother wept, and her father threatened to disown her. Oreana's nature prompted heroic defiance, but wary Silvertung advised dissimulation. Secret influence, he said, was the most efficacious; by its means she might yet win souls. So Oreana made a mighty effort, went to church as usual, and spoke no word of Zion. Her friends rejoiced, and soon forgot the temporary eccentricity. Repression increased Oreana's enthusiasm. She resolved to forsake her parents, her lover, her home, all for Christ's sake.</p>
<pb n="18     MRS. LASCELLE."/>

CHAPTER IV.

MRS. LAS8ELLE.

A KNOCK at the door interrupted Oreana's devotions.</p>
<p>Annoyed at the intrusion, Oreana pretended not to hear; but the knocking continued, and a plaintive voice cried:</p>
<p>"Dear Oreana, it is I,--Mary,--let me in. I must see you."</p>
<p>Oreana flew to open the door.</p>
<p>"My dear Mary, excuse me; I thought it was some one of the house. But what is the matter? You look pale and agitated."</p>
<p>For answer, the young lady burst into a passion of tears.</p>
<p>The visitor was a lovely woman,--the exact opposite of Orepna: a fragile, shrinking creature, with the face of a Clytie, shaded by curls so soft, so delicately bright, that they seemed spun out of moonbeams. A woman to be cherished and petted, was Mary Lascelle.</p>
<p>"Now, my love," said Oreana, who had partly succeeded in calming the grief of her visitor, "tell me what it is that so distresses you."</p>
<p>"Oreana, my heart will break. I cannot, cannot do it. Why does God demand such sacrifices? I cannot. My heart will break."</p>
<p>"My dear Mary, there's no such word as cannot; and what is the breaking of a poor, sinful heart, compared to the woe pronounced against those who disobey? But what is this new trouble?"</p>
<pb n="MRS. LASCELLE.     19"/>

<p>"It is the revelation."</p>
<p>"Have you had a revelation?"</p>
<p>"Brother Trap has received one concerning me."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mary I how I envy you. Yet how I rejoice that in our day such things are. And you weep, instead exulting?"</p>
<p>"It was so awful." And again she burst into tears.</p>
<p>"There, don't cry, dear; tell me all about this revelation."</p>
<p>"It makes me shudder to think of it. Brother Trap went into a trance while we--I mean Brother Silvertung and I--were kneeling in prayer. He spoke in a strange, awful voice, bidding me take Elsie and but oh! I cannot speak of it. Read it. Brother Silvertung took it down in writing."</p>
<p>Oreana took the scrap of paper, kissed it reverently and read The Revelation:</p>
<p>"In answer to the prayers of the saints, for the guidance of Sister Mary Lascelle.</p>
<p>"Behold, thus saith the Lord!</p>
<p>"Hearken ye, O my servant:</p>
<p>"Know ye, that I am the Lord thy God: He that brought the children of Israel out from the land of Egypt: He whom thy fathers adored, even the same. I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, who visitest judgment upon the wicked, yea to the third and fourth generation. Listen ye, 0 my servant; for inasmuch as thou hast left all things to keep my commandments, even so will I speak unto thee.</p>
<p>"Verily I say unto thee, Go unto my chosen servant, Mary Lascelle, and say unto her:</p>
<p>"Thus saith the Lord! Thy tears and prayers have found favor in my sight, even as the sacrifice of
<pb n="20     MRS. LASCELLE."/>

Abel. Know ye the will of the Lord. Even so as the man thou now callest husband has despised my ways, and mocked at my commandments, he shall be cut down and cast into the fire.</p>
<p>"Verily say unto thee, he is no longer thy husband but if thou wouldst enter into the land that I have reserved for those who love me and keep my commandments, then verily, I say unto thee: Arise, take thy child, go forth from those that love iniquity, follow my servant, Moses Silvertung, into the wilderness unto Zion. For I say unto thee that any one who prefers father, mother, husband, or child, to Me, is not worthy of my kingdom: him will I destroy, as I destroyed thousands of Israelites in the desert.</p>
<p>"Other things there are, that I desire of thee, if thou wouldst enter into my kingdom: these will I reveal to thee in the fullness of time. Even so, saith the
Lord."</p>
<p>The impressive tone in which Oreana read the revelation thrilled Mrs. Lascelle. The words seemed more awful than they did when she first heard them.
There was silence for a few moments, when Oreana cried:</p>
<p>"Blessed be God, who remembereth His people, and who permitteth us to live in the days of the Renewal of the Covenant! Think of our privilege, Mary, and exult For ages the world has been desolate, God's voice was silent; but now He speaketh again.  Mary, I envy you. A special revelation. Thrice blessed woman!</p>
<p>"And you hesitate after such a declaration of the Divine Will?"</p>
<p>"But it is so horrible."</p>
<pb n="MRS. LASCELLE     21"/>

<p>"Not more so than the sacrifice that Abraham was commanded to make."</p>
<p>"Yes, but be did not make it."</p>
<p>"Neither will you, in the end. Your departure will awaken your husband: he will follow you to Zion, and great will be your happiness."</p>
<p>"Do you really think so?" said Mary, with a bright smile.</p>
<p>"I feel certain of it."</p>
<p>"Still, it will kill me to leave secretly like a dishonest woman. Ah! Oreana, you are not a wife: you don't know my feelings."</p>
<p>"Am I not a daughter--an affianced wife? To-day I have broken with Julian. To-morrow I leave my parents. They will disown me; yea, or perhaps curse me. But it is glorious to suffer for the faith."</p>
<p>"Oreana, you have the heroism of the martyrs. You exult,--I tremble."</p>
<p>"But you shall no longer tremble,--you, whom the Lord so favors. Be not faint-hearted. Think of the woes, the misery here, eternal torments hereafter, that will be the lot of the disobedient. Already little Elsie has been stricken down by the anger of the Lord; only your promise of obedience saved her."</p>
<p>Spare me, Oreana, I will obey; I,--oh, that I could die."</p>
<p>"You are weak, my dear. Left to yourself your good intentions will, fail before the strength of the wicked. You must come with me--nay, not a word. I will ride over with you now. Your husband will readily consent, for he has often spoken of late about your going away for a visit.</p>
<p>"Then we can arrange our plans. We must be of
<pb n="22      THE IVY VINE."/>

the number of those brave pilgrims who are going across the plains on foot. You have heard of the glorious blessings promised to these by our second Moses. Thank God, I am of age and independent. That legacy my great-aunt left me will suffice for us both. By the way, do you know the Delvilles of Liverpool are going? So we shall not be without friends. Oh, how happy we shall be when re-united in Zion!"</p>
<p>While thus talking Oreana had prepared herself for the ride. In her hands Mrs. Lascelle was powerless. Her weak nature bowed before Oreana's resolute will, and by the time they reached town Mary had promised entire obedience.</p>

CHAPTER V.

THE    IVY    VINE.

MRS. LASCELLE had always been a pet; and only the exceeding gentleness of her character prevented her from being that disagreeable being, a spoiled beauty.</p>
<p>Her parents kept watch over her, fearful lest a breeze should rudely sweep her curls, or that a wavelet from the troubled ocean of life might break over her path.</p>
<p>Mary early evinced a peculiar impressibility concerning religious matters, consequently they would not allow her to receive the instructions generally given to children.</p>
<p>"Wait until she is old enough not to worry herself
<pb n="THE IVY VINE     23"/>

about sin and death," was their answer to those who considered this negligence reprehensible. All serious studies were also considered as worries, and discarded accordingly; a boarding-school was out of the question, even a day-school was deemed too severe for little fairy. So Mary grew up under her mother's eye, in ignorant innocence of life's problems and responsibilities, without a care.</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen she became the wife of Edward Lascelle, who tried to be as careful of his little wife as her parents had been. But he had his way to make in the world, and business obliged him to leave her to her own guidance in many things.</p>
<p>As long as her parents lived, it was of no consequence; but in the fifth year of her marriage death took away these guardians. Mary was overwhelmed with grief, and, as a natural consequence, sought consolation in the church.</p>
<p>The Bible became her <hi rend=”italic">vade mecum</hi> and Oreana her bosom friend. Unfortunately for her, Edward Lascelle was a free-thinker: at heart one of those who consider piety and church duties fit for women only.</p>
<p>One day she accompanied Oreana to the meeting-house of the Latter Day Saints.</p>
<p>The preacher, who was well named Silvertung, spoke chiefly upon the second coming of Christ, an event which he declared to be nearer than any one dreamed of. Numerous Bible texts proved this assertion, and he adduced the disasters daily happening as the signs that told the coming of the Son of Man. It behooved them all to prepare to receive Him by accepting the covenant of the Latter Day, leaving the ungodly and gathering together in God's city.</p>
<pb n="24     THE IVY VINE."/>

<p>The sermon made a vivid impression upon Mrs. Lascelle. She told her husband of the doubts and fears awakened in her soul by the new gospel; but he merely laughed. If she were pleased, so was he. She tried to persuade him to accompany her, but in vain: So she went alone. Her weak, undeveloped character could not resist the fervid positiveness of the converts, and the thought of Christ's coming overpoweredher. She received baptism.</p>
<p>Still she yearned for her husband's sympathy; she implored him to listen. But he was deaf to her importunities; he ridiculed the ideas that filled her with awe; he termed them women's nonsense.</p>
<p>This indifference wounded her, gradually the husband's influence grew weaker, and another's grew stronger. This other was the preacher Silvertung: a man pleasing to look at, of insinuating manners, and a great favorite with the female converts. He could pray and sing so beautifully, and his piety was so touching.</p>
<p>Elder Silvertung admired lovely women, especially if they belonged to the type glorified by the poets, worshiped by sentimentalists, and extolled by the goody ones of the day,--the ivy vine women,--those who love to twine around the gnarled oaks, the decayed stumps, or some worm-eaten, crooked posts.Ah! well! the ivy vine makes ugliness picturesque: so let it thrive in the human family.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascelle, either by nature or education, or perhaps both, belonged to this type of women; and Elder Silvertung admired her so much, that he felt a special call to assure the salvation of this sweet creature. He soon discovered how matters stood with the young
<pb n="THE IVY VINE     25"/>

couple; how of late the tree had thrown off the vine; how the vine had drooped without support. It gave him a fine opportunity, of which he hastened to avail himself.</p>
<p>The ivy found a support around which it could tiwne,--spiritually of course,--but in this world it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between spiritual and material, so much do they intermingle.</p>
<p>In Elder Silvertung Mrs. Lascelle found a sympathizer, a counselor, a guide and conductor, on the road to Zion. Under the elder's teaching she was soon convinced that her husband would be doomed to woe if he still continued unregenerate. Only the Saints could enter heaven, only those who accepted the Covenant would reign with Christ. She must save her husband. Her love and faith gave her strength; laughter, ridicule, even anger could not silence her.</p>
<p>Astonished at the change in his wife, Mr. Lascelle made some inquiries about these "Saints." The information he obtained disgusted him. He trembled for his gentle and credulous wife. He remonstrated with her. It was too late.</p>
<p>For the first time this husband and wife quarreled.</p>
<p>The deluded woman went to Elder Silvertung for consolation in this new trouble. In the midst of the conversation, the elder closed his eyes, and in a strange, far-off voice began:</p>
<p>"Thus saith the Lord! The man who turns a deaf ear to the law of the Lord, him shall the Lord destroy: yea, the Lord will destroy him, and all who consort with him. Remain not with the wicked, lest ye be confounded with them. If thy eye offend thee pluck it out; even so tear out of thy heart love for
<pb n="26      THE IVY VINE."/>

the wicked. Leave them,--flee from them; for destruction cometh as the whirlwind."</p>
<p>The elder paused, but still remained in his trance-like state. Mrs. Lascelle was frightened.</p>
<p>"Leave my husband," she gasped, "never! This is terrible."</p>
<p>Again, that far-off voice spoke:</p>
<p>"More terrible will it be to hear the voice of God say, Because thou has preferred the wicked to me, thou shalt be accursed for ever and ever."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascene sobbed aloud. Her grief aroused the elder from his pretended trance.</p>
<p>"My dear sister, what has so affected you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, brother I those awful words. How could you speak so to me?"</p>
<p>"What I did I speak? I was not conscious of it. Sometimes, indeed, the Spirit speaks through me, unworthy as I am. If I have grieved or offended you, dear sister, forgive me."</p>
<p>"Then, indeed, am I lost," ejaculated the poor woman. "Misery on every side! but I cannot forsake my husband."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascelle left hurriedly, without another word. She was frightened. For some time she avoided the saints, and love for her husband seemed to have gained the ascendancy. If Edward Lascelle had sympathized ever so little with her religious sentiments she would have been saved. But fate seemed working against her. The husband who worshiped her as a beautiful idol, who treasured up every word that fell from her lips, who lavished upon her the fruits of his labor, the wealth of his love, was an unrelenting tyrant in the matter that most interested her.  Then Oreana, a
<pb n="THE IVY VINE.     27"/>

friend who would not be avoided, never ceased her exhortations. Just at this time, little Elsie suddenly fell sick. Oreana declared the illness to be a judgment from heaven. The weak woman believed it. She ran to Elder Silvertung and begged him to minister to the child, promising complete submission to the will of God if her darling was cured.</p>
<p>Elsie's sickness was only a child's ailment, from which she must recover in a few days; but Mrs. Lascelle's distorted imagination magnified it into a death-warning. As a matter of course, the child got well, and the mother became more fervent than ever; for gratitude and repentance quickened her devotion.</p>
<p>One day, Elder Silvertung announced his departure for Zion. He should leave with the next band of saints.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascelle wept with real sorrow. What should she do without his spiritual guidance? "Tell me," she cried, "what I must do to be saved: tell me, and I will do it."</p>
<p>"Let us return thanks to God, who inspires the feeble heart with such sentiments. My dear sister, your\situation is indeed one of doubt, beset with painful alternatives; but all the saints shall pray for you, that the Lord may vouchsafe you a special revelation."</p>
<p>The revelation came. Mrs. Lascelle was lost.</p>

CHAPTER VL

LOST !

WHILE Mary Lascelle was struggling hopelessly between the dictates of her womanly conscience and the evil influences of fanaticism, her husband hurried homewards, his step buoyant, his eye sparkling, for he had that day won a position he had desired for many a long year, and as he drew near the pretty rustic villa which he called home, the exuberance of joy burst out in song.</p>
<p>"How glad Mary will be," he murmured. Then suddenly his brow contracted; some dark thought had chased away the sunshine. He is not a pleasant man to look at when he frowns, when storms gather in the dark eyes, when passion dilates the nostril and makes the brown face glow with swarthy redness. But the very intensity of his nature rendered him a devoted husband and father; perhaps somewhat egotistic and dictatorial, yet loving and tender withal. Edward Lascelle idolized his wife and child. In them centered all his hopes, his affections, his aspirations. They were his world, his heaven. And the Mormon shadow had crept into his home, chilling love's warmth, shadowing the sweet face of his darling Mary. How he hated this religious craze about the New Jerusalem! The mere thought of it enraged him. But success has made him far too happy to-day to be depressed by a shadow.</p>
<p>"Pshaw," he said to himself. "Mary will soon forget these silly ideas. She must have a change of
<pb n="LOST!     29"/>

scene. I can well afford it now. How happy Mary will be."</p>
<p>As he entered the gate, a winsome, brown-eyed sprite of four summers danced out to meet him.</p>
<p>"Papa, I tho glad you're come. Mamma gone and I'm lonethome."</p>
<p>"Mamma gone," gasped the man.</p>
<p>"Yeth, gone to the nathy preather man. Papa, why don't you kill that preather man? He makth mamma cry. I don't like him, tho' he givth me candy. I throwth ith candy away, papa. Ain't I a good girl?"</p>
<p>"Yes; love, don't have anything to do with him."</p>
<p>Mr. Lascelle spoke mechanically. The absence of his wife pierced him to his soul, and the words of his little Elsie rang through his brain with a fearful echo. "Kill the man! Why not?" Then he shuddered at the awful thought; and cast it from him.</p>
<p>"Come, papa, take me up, and go in."</p>
<p>He obeyed.</p>
<p>A trim servant-maid met him at the door, with a message that mistress would not be home for some time, and that dinner was all ready.</p>
<p>"Yeth, and I will make yoo tea," said little Elsie, who, enthroned on her father's shoulder, lovingly tried to kiss away his disappointment. Her childish caresses were soothing; but they could not bring back the gladness to the father's face. He returned the caresses of his little Elsie; he smiled at her baby prattle; but his heart sighed wearily.</p>
<p>It was a worn, spiritless man that sat down at table. The appetizing viands had lost their flavor,--the pleasant home, its sunshine. From that day of
<pb n="30      LOST!"/>

joyful success, the triumph had fled; for his inspiration, his love, his wife was not there to share his happiness. His good fortune was the result of long continued labor,--of nights as well as days spent in anxious efforts. Traces of care and fatigue were plainly visible in the dark face, no longer illumined with joy.</p>
<p>He rose from the table and threw himself upon a sofa,--too weary even to smile at Elsie. The child, lulled by the stillness, dropped asleep in her father's arms. Weary and disappointed, the man closed his eyes. He dreamed of darkness--of horror. He saw himself a wanderer on a desert. Mountains, cloud-
wrapt and gloomy, imprisoned him. Shadowy forms surrounded him. The shadows became more distinct. The faces of wife and child appeared; but how changed by anguish and despair! A lurid cloud hung over his Elsie. She stretched forth her hands to him imploringly. He rushed into the gloom. The forms vanished. Again he was alone, his hands dyed in blood.</p>
<p>"Thank God, 'tis but a dream!" he cried, as he awoke 'to find a bright form bending over him. It was his wife. Her sweet face wore a strange expression of mingled sorrow and love. Fear looked out of the blue eyes, while on their gold-tipped fringe, teardrops glistened.</p>
<p>The awakened man gazed upon her in wondering love, little dreaming of the cause of her quivering lips and hunted look.</p>
<p>To him she appeared so beautiful. He noted even the shimmering of her blue dress, and the fragrance of the blush rose that nestled in the dainty lace at her throat.</p>
<pb n="LOST!     31"/>
 
<p>"How lovely you are, darling! But why so sad? I have news that will make you glad. Dance with glee, little wife. I am a partner now. Isn't that gay? Why, you are sighing instead of laughing. Are you not pleased?".</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, dear, but--"</p>
<p>"But what? Why, I declare you are quite pale, and all trembling. You want change of air and scene. You are growing nervous."</p>
<p>"That is what I tell her, Edward," said Oreana, entering the room. "In fact, I have come this evening on purpose to talk with you on the subject. Tomorrow afternoon, I am going to London to cousin Laura's for a week; and I think it would do Mary ever so much good to go with me. You know I ought to have some matron to chaperon me; now mamma says it is impossible for her to leave, and cousin Laura never goes out, so you will be good and let Mary come, won't you? You see I am very selfish."</p>
<p>"Just the very thing, isn't it, little wife?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascelle felt too guilty to speak. She sank sobbing in her husband's arms.  "Don't send me away Edward,--don't."</p>
<p>Oreana trembled; Mary was so weak.</p>
<p>"Send you away, darling! Why, what nonsense you are talking! Go with Oreana to-morrow."</p>
<p>"It is rather short notice. Of course we must take Elsie; but they do not require any preparation," added Oreana.</p>
<p>"Oh I Edward, I don't want to leave you," cried Mrs. Lascelle, still clinging to her husband. Ah ! why could he not read her heart?</p>
<p>"Don't cry, love. Why, I did not think you were

so low-spirited and nervous. Now go to-morrow, like a brave little woman, and I will run down to you next week; then we will go to the sea-side for a little holiday. We can afford it now, Mary, and we shall enjoy it so much. During the next few days I shall be up to the ears in business; and there! I had almost forgotten, I have to leave for Liverpool this very night. Just get me a few things ready. I have not a moment to lose. I am so glad you are going with Oreana, for you would feel so lonely."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascelle groaned. Everything seemed to urge her to the fatal step. Never had she loved her husband more; and had she been free from Oreana's influence, she would have told him all. But Oreana's will subjugated her; in this presence her lips refused to speak the words of salvation.</p>
<p>The moments flew by. All was ready. Mr. Lascelle had kissed little Elsie. The door was open for his exit.</p>
<p>"Now, Mary, love, smile once before I go."</p>
<p>"Edward, will you forgive me?" cried the wife in piteous agony.</p>
<p>"Forgive you, darling? What ever for? There, now, one kiss. Good bye, till next week. Cheer up, little wife. Oreana, do try to make her once more her old self, and persuade her to forget those horrid Mormons, as you have done." (Oreana winced.) "Take good care of yourselves and our little Elsie. Good bye."</p>
<p>He left the house whistling a merry tune, and was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>Mary watched him with strained eyes, then she fell on her knees by the side of her sleeping child, moaning, "Lost, lost! and I--"</p>

CHAPTER VII.

THE DELVILLES.

ROBERT DELVILLE, silk mercer and linen draper, of High street, Liverpool, was a ruddy, coarse-featured, loud man, with the physique of a pugilist. Rumor hinted at a wild youth, addicted to low games and cruel companions; but that was all in the far past. Many a year ago Robert Delville had settled down into a good, blunt citizen, rather sharp at a bargain, yet honest in the main. He was loved by his family, and liked by his friends, regular at church, and fond of the Bible. It is true that he displayed a predilection for witnessing executions (but that was nothing singular in those days), and frequently he would emphatically declare his dissatisfaction at the existing state of things, social, moral, and religious.</p>
<p>He had eagerly embraced the new gospel, and soon after astonished his little world with the announcement that he was going to Zion. For some time a clearance sale has been going on. It is all over now. The place is empty and deserted; the shutters going up. Upstairs, in the family apartments, the greatest confusion reigns. Some are boxing furniture, others packing trunks. The day's work is almost over. The mistress, a portly, good-natured-looking woman, sits down upon a trunk to rest awhile. She has a very troubled look, and every now and then she wipes her eyes, from which the tears will flow in spite of her efforts to repress them. A pretty little girl lays her cheek caressingly against her mother's, and cries

2*
<pb n="34     THE DELVILLES."/>

because her mother weeps. In one corner of the room, a serious-faced boy is packing away some books, carefully, tenderly, as if he loved them.</p>
<p>Another son, the eldest, a bright sturdy youth of fifteen, is working with a will.</p>
<p>"Is this to go, mother?" he asks, pointing to a beautiful picture of Aurora.</p>
<p>"No, dear, they say we cannot take anything more than is absolutely necessary. The furniture will be sold to-morrow. Oh dear! I shall have to go away. I never can endure to see that go. I did not think it would be so hard;" and the strong, rosy-faced woman, to whom sorrow had hitherto been a stranger, wept afresh, as she looked around upon the elegance and comfort so soon to be taken from her.</p>
<p>"Never mind, mother," replied the youth. "It will be all right: and won't we have jolly fun crossing the plains? I'll shoot deer and buffalo, and--"</p>
<p>"That is all you think about, Rob. As for me, I don't like this move one bit," said the boy of the books. "I hope I shall be able to go to school there."</p>
<p>"Go to school! Why, of course you can; didn't Brother Trapp tell father, 'that Zion is the nicest city in all the world, the very best place for children, boys or girls.' So you are all right, Stanly. Here's father, just ask him."</p>
<p>Mr. Delville enters.</p>
<p>"Well, wife, it is all done. Everything sold: here's the money. We shall be able to do great things in Zion. Why, surely Lucy, you ain't crying?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Robert, it is so sad to leave the old place where I was brought up,--and we were married, and all our children were born: to see all the things we








<pb n="THE DELVILLES      35"/>

prize, sold as if we were ruined. Just think, how happy we have been here. Why can't we be as good Saints here, as in that way-off-country?"</p>
<p>"Now, Lucy, would you stay here and be burned up with the wicked, instead of reigning with Christ in a city paved with gold, and whose walls are of precious stones. Besides dear, a great destiny awaits me there. I have had wonderful dreams of late; and then Brother Trapp, who often converses with God, has told me of great things in store for you and me, and the children, if we remain faithful."</p>
<p>"But, Rob, we don't want anything more than we have; and they do whisper of terrible things done by the leaders of this people."</p>
<p>"Lies, all lies, Lucy. The wicked must slander the saints. The devil hates to be cheated out of his prey: and he shows fight by slandering those who work against him. Speaking of the devil, reminds me, that I have in my pocket the funniest thing about his black majesty and the prophet that ever I read. It made me laugh till the tears ran down my cheeks. It is the best thing out. Just right to drive away the blues. Shall I read it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear, if it will drive away the blues."</p>
<p>"Oh! it will do that. You will laugh till you ache,--listen."</p>

<p>"Now, what do you think of that? Why, bless me, you don't smile."</p>
<p>"I should think not; it is outrageous. I don't re-

spect the prophet half as much as I did. 0, Robert! I am afraid this is a bad move."</p>
<p>"Lucy, I thought you were a good saint, anxious to receive the endowments, which we can't do till we get to Zion. Even our marriage is not perfect. If we were to die now, we should be as strangers in heaven; and, as they don't marry there, we should have to live apart for all eternity. As soon as we reach Zion we will be sealed to each other, won't we, Lucy?"</p>
<p>At the mention of marriage Mrs. Delville's tears flowed faster. She found a pretext to send the children out of the room, then, turning to her husband, she said:</p>
<p>"Robert, it is this new doctrine of marriage that is troubling me. If you should take another wife it would kill me. I never could endure the torture of yielding my place in our home. And my children--Oh, God! when I think of it!"</p>
<p>"Why do you think of it? But there,--that is just like a woman, always fussing about something,--as if I would take another wife, while you are alive. No, indeed! one is enough for me. Why, you might just as well imagine me a cut-throat."</p>
<p>"Oh, Robert I how can you talk so?"</p>
<p>"Why, mother, how can you talk so? Haven't we been as happy as lovers, ever since we joined?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>
<p>"And so we stall always be, old lady--"</p>
<p>"And will you promise me, Robert, that you never will enter polygamy?"</p>
<p>"I promise you, Lucy. There's my hand on't."</p>
<p>"Thank God! Robert. I shall be happy now."</p>

CHAPTER VIII.

JULIAN.

WHEN Julian parted from Oreana, it seemed to him that chaos reigned throughout the world; he almost dreaded to step, lest the unstable earth should sink beneath him. Oreana's fanatic declarations subverted all order, destroyed all harmony. Before she uttered them, the future shone bright and clear, and he gazed with delight upon the coming years, all freighted with love and happiness. But, now, shadows obscured the glorious vision. These shadows were as yet formless, but when they should take actual shape, what unknown horror would they reveal?</p>
<p>Julian, whose life had been without a care, found himself suddenly confronted by an ugly, scowling fate; an obstacle had arisen--an eccentric, vague obstacle--yet none the less a stern reality, which stopped his joyous career; the violent jar unnerved him. In the midst of his love triumph he was crushed by a terrible rival--a rival whom he could not slay. Oreana's wild words still rang in his ears. She required him to renounce his church, his home, to become a dishonored, contemned man--a Mormon--and Oreana, the noble, the beautiful, was already this creature of scorn. The thought was maddening.</p>
<p>What was sickness?--death! to this. Sickness and death were sacred sorrows, direct from the hand of God; sorrows that strengthened the bond of human sympathy, and brought mortals nearer to Heaven; but this that rankled within his heart was no such
<pb n="JULIAN.     39"/>

holy grief. No, it was a monstrous wrong, a willful disturbance of civilized laws, a sundering of sympathies, a wandering away from approved of, comfortable beliefs, to follow visionary will-o'-the-wisps; it was a disruption of peace; it meant persecution, dishonor, banishment, poverty, despair.</p>
<p>Such were the thoughts that surged through Julian's mind for some time after the conversation in the pavilion. Whichever way he viewed Oreana's infatuation, and its possible results, he could only see misery. What should he do to save her?</p>
<p>Neither ridicule nor stern opposition would avail. These weapons had been used when Oreana first spoke of the new doctrines, and the consequence was the desperate resolve to leave all for Zion. If he or her father had listened then, sympathetically, their wider knowledge of the world, their more sceptical minds, might have exposed the errors and thus prevented the delusion from gaining ground. Perhaps it was not too late now. The thought gave him hope.</p>
<p>Yes, he would investigate this new belief, study its proofs; he would discuss tenets understandingly, and his words might yet save Oreana, and avert the impending sorrow from those he loved.</p>
<p>Julian was pre-eminently unselfish, and the desolation that Oreana's mad project would bring to her parents and his grieved him more than his own disappointment.</p>
<p>As soon as he decided upon a course of action, his heart grew lighter; however, he was too young a novice in care to possess the art of hiding its traces. His cheek remained pale; the fine gray eyes lost their merry gleam; a cloud rested upon his brow, from
<pb n="40     JULIAN."/>

which he kept restlessly pushing back his hair, as if the touch fevered him.</p>
<p>He could feel the change, and dreaded meeting his mother; for what was the use to worry her?—there would be time enough if he should fail to alter Oreana's resolution. But he was determined not to fail. To avoid the meeting, he resolved to start upon his journey that night, instead of the next morning. His preparations were all made, and he had nothing to do except to catch the train. He wrote a note to his mother to the effect that he preferred traveling during the night, and that to atone for his hasty departure, he would return a day or two sooner.</p>
<p>"Down, Jacmar! down, Jumble!" cried young Bellew, as two favorite dogs jumped upon him, begging, with eloquent eyes and whines, to go with their master.</p>
<p>"It is no use begging. I can't take you this time. Never mind, I shall soon return,--very soon."</p>
<p>But the affectionate animals seemed to disbelieve him; they followed the carriage, whining piteously, until Julian forced them back.</p>
<p>The heir of the manor passed out from his home; the gates closed behind him; yet no warning voice cried beware; no evil omen crossed his path to bid him return; no dread foreboding revealed to him aught of his fate. Even his previous gloom began to disappear in the excitement of departure, and in his firm conviction that he could easily disabuse Oreana of her delusion.</p>
<p>At the station, Julian met Mr. Lascelle. This gentleman was in a joyous state, for his wife's prayer to be forgiven, he had interpreted as a promise that she
<pb n="JULIAN.     41"/>

had renounced Mormonism forevermore; and her reluctance to leave him, seemed a revival of the old love. Thus reassured, Mr. Lascelle gave himself up to the enjoyment of his success. Julian felt the cheerful influence, and for a while Zion and the Saints were forgotten.</p>
<p>"By the way, Julian, my little wife is going to London to take care of Oreana."</p>
<p>The news startled Julian. It brought back to him back to the unpleasantness of the afternoon.</p>
<p>"Going to London!"</p>
<p>Yes; and the idea is exceedingly ludicrous. Imagine, if you can, my little fairy playing chaperon, duenna, dragon, to your stately lady-love. What a satire on the proprieties! It is worthy of <hi rend=”italic">Punch</hi>, is it not?"</p>
<p>Julian tried to laugh an assent, but his heart misgave him. What could this sudden arrangement mean?</p>
<p>Oreana had intended to go alone; she had said so repeatedly. But, if she did not intend to marry him, would she go to London at all?  She went there for her trousseau. So she could not have given him up. He had been troubling himself over the wild dreams of an enthusiastic girl; perhaps the natural coquetry of her sex found their courtship too monotonous, too smooth, and she sought to  give it more piquancy by teazing him. This conduct seemed unlike Oreana; but she was a woman, and women are enigmas.</p>
<p>Thus Julian tried to reason himself into hopefulness, while Mr. Lascelle talked of Elsie, of his wife, and Oreana.</p>
<p>"Yes," he continued, "it will do my little wife a
<pb n="42      JULIAN."/>

great deal of good. She has been fretting herself nervous of late about that Mormonism" (the hateful word made Julian shudder). "I do hope Oreana and London will cause her to forget all about it. I think Mary is ashamed of her foolishness. Oreana soon gave it up, didn't she?"</p>
<p>Julian winced, but remained silent. He could not bring himself to discuss Oreana's opinions with any one; yet he felt that Mr. Lascelle was deceived about this London trip, and he blamed himself for leaving home. If any thing went wrong--but there! What could go wrong? Oreana was far too noble to stoop to deception. Julian little knew the power of fanaticism.</p>
<p>Mr. Lascelle repeated his question. Forced to answer, Julian said, with some effort, "I think she inclines to it yet a little,--but she will come all right."</p>
<p>"Well, women are credulous creatures. They are made so by the innocence that we men admire so much. But tell me, have you studied these new doctrines?"</p>
<p>"Not I. But it is all a humbug--some Yankee speculation. Mary wanted to preach it to me, but I wouldn't listen. It is the only thing we ever quarreled about. But you know I couldn't stand the canting nonsense."</p>
<p>"I think you are in error there, Lascelle. Would it not be wiser to enter into your wife's thoughts and fancies, in order to guide her understandingly? Women are led by their sympathies. Lovers act upon this law, but after marriage it seems to be ignored."</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps, there is something in that; but I have no patience with such whims."</p>
<p>"You could acquire patience."</p>
<pb n="A SURPRISE.     43"/>

<p>"What a model husband you will be, Julian!" remarked Lascelle, laughing.</p>
<p>"A truce to jesting, Edward. To be candid with you, I feel anxious to learn all about this creed that attracts such women as your wife and Oreana. Now, suppose while we are away we go to their meetings, eh!--what say you? We need not mention it, you know; but when the subject is referred to again in our homes, we shall know how to answer."</p>
<p>"All right! It will be great fun. I shall have very little time, but I will go with you once or so. I tell you though, beforehand, that it is all nonsense."</p>

CHAPTER IX.

A SURPRISE.

AFTER their arrival at Liverpool, Julian lost no time in making his inquiries concerning the Saints, and their place of meeting. It was a much easier task than he expected,for the "New Jerusalem" and the "Saints" were the prevailing topics. Everyone pretended to know all about them. The number of converts to the new doctrines greatly surprised Julian and Lascelle. They found the meeting-house crowded, not with the mocking curious, but with eager believers. Neither were these as poor and contemptible as our investigators had expected. The well-to-do middle class was well represented, and the congregation appeared quite respectable.</p>
<p>In truth, Mormonism was making rapid progress.
<pb n="44     A SURPRISE."/>

It suited the period which gave it birth. It coincided with its predominating ideas,--the Rehabilitation of Matter, the Improvement of the Marriage Law, and Migration.</p>
<p>Ideas float in the atmosphere, and are unconsciously inhaled with it.</p>
<p>But, as the air breathed by the majority of mankind is empoisoned by foul effluvia, so the ideas absorbed by them are vitiated by ignorance, passion, and superstition.</p>
<p>Hence, good theories generate baneful practices, and the idealisms of our progressive century made easy the introduction of Mormonism with its material god and earthly heaven, its false revelation of marriage, and its command to migrate.</p>
<p>Besides its array of so-called miracles, prophesies, and its aureole of persecution, there was an absolute positiveness about the dogmas and denunciations of the new creed that subjugated--the timid and wavering, while its promises attracted the ambitious and discontented.</p>
<p>Men like Mr. Delville, who wished to enrich themselves in the service of the Lord, had an eye to apostleships, to goodly herds and lands in the kingdom, insured against the fires of the Last Day. A religion that combined earthly treasures with eternal bliss; a religion whose honors were not all taken by an exclusive nobility--that was the religion for them.</p>
<p>To the pariahs of society, excluded from all pleasure,--those whom the Church overlooks, society oppresses, and the happy forget,--Mormonism promised beautiful homes in a land overflowing with milk and honey, thrones of honor among the chosen ones of
<pb n="A SURPRISE.     45"/>

God; from <hi rend=”italic">which elevated position</hi> they should see their oppressors swept from the face of the earth. Already they, the poor and the lowly, rejoiced in the title of "Saint," while the rich and powerful were Gentiles, accursed. Ah! what a sweet revenge!
<p>But polygamy! How could civilized men and women accept such degradation?</p>
<p>Polygamy was kept in the background as much as possible. The teachers knew well how to give milk to babes, how to prepare their infant stomachs for stronger food.</p>
<p>Social problems occupied the thoughts of men, the relation of the sexes dissatisfied many; new systems were discussed,--why not, then, polygamy? The Mormon preachers declared that all the miseries afflicting domestic life resulted from monogamy.</p>
<p>They painted the social evil in its most horrible colors; and all women and Christians were entreated to espouse a system that would banish it from the earth.</p>
<p>Polygamy was this system. Polygamy was to bring happiness to man, exaltation to woman, improvement to the race.</p>
<p>The Old Testament approved of it. *The New Testament did not condemn it. The revelations of the Latter Day commended it. To untrained minds, blinded by fanaticism, this was sufficient. But the teachers appealed specially to the charity, the purity of women. By this means were women like Oreana and Mary Lascelle captivated. They had never seen

<pb n="46     A SURPRISE."/>

its working. Their imagination could not realize a system so foreign to their actual experience.</p>
<p>To them, polygamy was only a theory, and, like all theories appeared beautiful in the distance. Never for a moment did they associate themselves with the idea of plurality.</p>
<p>Husbands promised their wives, as did Robert Delville, to remain monogamists.</p>
<p>But the majority of converts never gave it a thought. The millennium and Zion absorbed them. In the sermon to which Julian and Lascelle listened, there was no mention made of it. The speaker chose for text, "Quench not the spirit. Pray without ceasing. Rejoice evermore." I. <hi rend=”italic">Thess.</hi> v. 19, 17, 16.</p>
<p>He spoke out of the fullness of his soul, and his simple, earnest speech touched even Lascelle, who disliked all preaching.</p>
<p>"That is good, I declare," said Julian; "quite refreshing after the high-flown verbiage and hollow sentiments now fashionable in the churches. What say you, Lascelle?"</p>
<p>"That man believes what he preaches, anyway."</p>
<p>"He does certainly; and if that is Mormonism, it is not so bad."</p>
<p>"Pshaw, Julian! That is not Mormonism; that is religion, ethics poetized by the supernatural. All sects are based upon religion, but none of them remain content with the simple structure; they must, forsooth, build a fine temple unlike any other that has ever been. So they call to their aid ambition, prejudice, ignorance, with a host of other evils inherent in human nature, and they rear a meretricious, ugly, shaky affair that they term a church, which effectually hides religion."</p>
<pb n="A SURPRISE.     47"/>

<p>"Lascelle, you are too skeptical."</p>
<p>"Not at all; it is only the truth. There is just that difference between religions and creeds. I do respect the former, but the latter I despise. They do very well to amuse women and children, but some are not even fit for that. Take this one, for instance, with its New Jerusalem and polygamy. Now that man whom we have just heard still clings to religion; he has never yet looked at the creed. I’ll wager he has never been to the Mormon city, and knows very little of this prophet Joe Smith, or Brigham Young. Let us go and find out."</p>
<p>Julian readily assented. The preacher received them pleasantly, but with a quiet dignity that seemed natural to him.</p>
<p>He answered their numerous questions without any hesitancy, assuring them he was only too happy to be able to give his testimony for the great and mighty things God had done for His people in the Latter Days, when the Saints should be gathered to the New Jerusalem, and the inheritance of Israel be restored.</p>
<p>"But why must the Saints go so far? Why cannot they worship God here as well as in Zion?"</p>
<p>"If you have read the Bible, my friend, you must have been impressed with the insistency with which God commands his children to separate from the ungodly. Remember what the Psalmist says—-"</p>
<p>"My dear sir," exclaimed Lascelle, "you can dispense with texts. As every thing can be proven from the Bible, I do not consider it as any proof. Let us come to something tangible. What is your candid opinion about polygamy?"</p>
<pb n=" 48     A SURPRISE."/>

<p>The preacher’s face grew troubled; he hesitated for a moment, then replied:</p>
<p>"See, my friends, the evil in this, your monogamic society. Now, God declares that the New Law of Celestial Marriage will stem this wickedness—that it will purify the world—"</p>
<p>"By giving license to men’s passions," said Julian.</p>
<p>"Nay, it is not license, my friend; you do not understand the principles."</p>
<p>"That is true, but I understand my sex," replied Julian, smiling sadly.</p>
<p>The preacher sighed, and tried to turn the conversation. "Think," he said, "of the wonders wrought by the New Gospel. The Spirit of God dwells once more with men, causing them to work miracles—to prophesy; the ignorant become wise, the timid brave, the weak strong. This very week hundreds will leave their country, their home, their friends; they will brave the terrors of the sea, they will cross the wild deserts on foot—yes, on foot they will travel to Zion. The pilgrims of old are outdone by weak women and children."</p>
<p>"Have you ever been to this Mormon city?" asked Lascelle of the preacher.</p>
<p>"Not yet, but I hope--"</p>
<p>"Oh! Of course. So you have not been there. Do you know this Brigham Young?"</p>
<p>"Very little. I heard him once. Ah! he is a great patriarch."</p>
<p>"No doubt," answered Lascelle, with a shade of irony in his tone. "Now, have you seen the actual workings of polygamy?"</p>
<p>"I am obliged to answer, no."</p>
<pb n=" A SURPRISE.     49/>

<p>"Just as I thought," continued Lascelle. "You know nothing of polygamy, of Zion, nor of Zion’s ruler, and when you do become acquainted with them,--you will, mark my words,--you will abjure Mormonism. Do not be offended; you interest me very much, and I mean no harm, but you will renounce this creed."</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at this, and Julian said, jestingly, "Why, Edward, you are usurping the priviledges of the Saints; have you this gift?" he added, turning to the preacher.</p>
<p>"The gift of prophecy is a glorious gift, and God bestoweth it upon whomsoever He pleases—often upon the most unworthy, the most lowly—to show forth the greatness of His power. Thus, sometimes, the Holy Spirit, has empowered me to see dimly into the future—and thus it is that, now, I see you in Zion; and beware! there is deception, there is danger, before you. I see but dimly, very little is the veil lifted—perhaps I should say I feel, rather than that I see." The preacher stopped as if bewildered.</p>
<p>"This is becoming interesting," said Lascelle, laughing. "Can’t you tell me something? I prophesied for you."</p>
<p>"My friend," replied the preacher, "you laugh now, but presently, you will weep. Philosophy may do for prosperity; but in adversity, we want faith, faith and trust in God our Father. If we do not cling fast to the rock of faith we are but toys of our passions. Remember this, my friend, when the dark cloud bursts over your head. Something tells me we
<pb n=" 50     A SURPRISE. />

shall meet in the distant future, and that I shall be of use to you and yours. What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Lascelle--Edward Lascelle"--</p>
<p>"And mine is Menly. God guard you, my friends--"</p>
<p>Julian and Lascelle hurried away in silence. Julian felt troubled, but Lascelle chafed with anger and impatience.</p>
<p>"There, did I not tell you," cried he, at last, "that it was all humbug? However, I did think that fellow Menly was sincere."</p>
<p>"So he is. It appears absurd to us, but he believes it."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! You can't deceive me in that way! I will have nothing more to do with it."</p>
<p>"Let us go to see these emigrant pilgrims."</p>
<p>"You may go if you please, Julian, but I shall not. Any way it will be impossible, for I must be home tomorrow evening, then in two days I go to London. My little wife expects me. So good bye to these Mormons."</p>
<p>Julian did not go again to the meeting-house, but he remembered the departure of the Mormon vessel. On the morning it was to sail he rose with the intention of spending the morning on board the "Eagle," but an unexpected meeting with a friend detained him and it was nearly noon when he reached the vessel.</p>
<p>As he curiously scanned the crowd of emigrant pilgrims, his attention was arrested by the figure of a woman whose stately grace made him think of Oreana.</p>
<p>"What a magnificent creature for such a fate," thought he. He lost all interest in the other pilgrims; he could only see that one. Her dress was neat, yet
<pb n="A SURPRISE.     51"/>

very coarse, and without the slightest attempt at ornament; a short serge dress, a dark shawl, and a huge sun-bonnet which completely concealed her head and features. She stood apart from the rest, erect, motionless, heedless of the confusion around her, all absorbed in her thoughts. Julian felt fascinated; never had the sight of a stranger impressed him so deeply. He must see her face. He threaded his way through the crowd, to the spot where she stood looking away off in to the west. A strange fear crept over him. He dared not speak. If he could but see her face--if she would only look at him. His wish was granted. The sea-breeze came sweeping by,--the bonnet fell back,--then the woman turned towards Julian. It was Oreana.</p>

<p>An item clipped from an English paper.</p>

<p>"TRUE LOVE.</p>
<p>"An incident which recalls the romance of the olden time, occurred last Wednesday, on board the ship ‘Eagle,’ as she was preparing to leave the port of Liverpool, for New York.</p>
<p>"There were on board several hundred Mormon emigrants, among whom was a young lady belonging to a family of good standing,--the Brentfords, of Brentford Farm.</p>
<p>"The young lady was on the eve of marriage with Mr. Julian Bellew, of the manor of S--; but she became so infatuated with the Mormon delusion, that she forsook parents, home and lover, for Zion, as the Mormons call their city, situated somewhere in the wilds of America.</p>
<p>"The young lady's family had not the faintest idea
<pb n="52     A SURPRISE."/>

of her mad determination; however, it happened that her lover, who had gone to Liverpool on business, strolled down to the quay, and, prompted by curiosity, visited the 'Eagle.' There he found Miss Brentford. A touching scene ensued. The lover entreated his affianced wife to return to her family. The lady (who is of age), remained deaf to his prayers; though very much moved, she clung to her resolve to go to Zion.</p>
<p>"Finding that his entreaties were without avail, Mr. Bellew declared he would save his betrothed, he would bring her back to her family, or die in the attempt.</p>
<p>"The vessel was to sail in an hour, but to love there is nothing impossible. Mr. Bellew made all his arrangements for a trip to the deserts of the western hemisphere, and was by the side of his promised bride when the vessel sailed.</p>
<p>"It is to be hoped that the heroic love of Mr. Bellew will be effectual in curing Miss Brentford of her folly, which has destroyed the happiness of two honorable families.</p>
<p>"Mr. Delville, the well-known linen draper of High street, his wife and children, were also among these emigrants, and it is rumored that Mrs. Lascelle, of S--, has forsaken her husband, and, with her child, a girl of four or five years of age, has embarked for the land of the Mormons."</p>

<p>The paper contained one other short announcement:</p>

<p>"Died, Thursday, May 2, Mr. Brentford, of Brentford Farm, of sudden paralysis."</p>

<p>What pathos, what despair do not these items express!</p>
<p>At Bellew Manor and Brentford Farm joy and
<pb n="TO THE FAR WEST.     53"/>

laughter are changed to mourning and the wailing of broken hearts.</p>
<p>But there is a home yet more desolate, a dishonored, deserted hearth, where Edward Lascelle, forsaken, alone struggles with the madness of despair.</p>

CHAPTER X.

TO THE FAR WEST.

<p>"Come to the land of the mountain and prairie,</p>
<p>Gather in strength to our home in the west;</p>
<p>Free are her sons as the breeze round the eerie,</p>
<p>Birth-place of prophets, and home of the blest.</p>
<p>Come let us haste away,</p>
<p>Here we'll no longer stay,</p>
<p>Zion, thy beauties we're yearning to see."</p>
<p><hi rend=”italic">Latter Day Saints' Hymn.</hi></p>

Thus sang the pilgrims as they made the last preparations for their unparallelled march across the prairie and desert. At last they stood upon the confines of the pathless West. Behind them, civilization and home; before them, primeval solitudes, and Zion;--but instead of sighing, they sang, enthusiastically:</p>
<p>"Come, let us haste away."</p>

<p>The trip from the Atlantic coast to Iowa City had filled them with delight. This new world was indeed a land of promise, a land of matchless skies and bewildering greatness; and if the heritage of the Gentile was so beautiful, what must Zion be, the home given by God unto His Saints? Even Julian caught the enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The sea voyage had wrought a great change in his
<pb n="54      TO THE FAR WEST."/>

mind. The earnest faith of these people, who had forsaken all for Zion, touched him. Gradually his disgust gave way to pity, then to admiration.</p>
<p>He listened more attentively to Oreana, when she offered to expound to him the new gospel. From her lips, its tenets appeared beautiful; for she clothed them with the poetry and exalted purity of her soul. Julian was impressed.   Heretofore, attendance at church upon Sundays, and upholding the ministry constituted his ideas of religion. Now he was forced to consider it daily, hourly. There was nothing repulsive in their principles; on the contrary their eager desire to restore the simplicity of the days when "God spoke with His people," seemed most laudable. Julian had been taught to revere the past, to believe in the golden age, in the moral and spiritual retrogression of mankind; therefore, he could not conscientiously condemn doctrines that resuscitated these good old days. Common sense confuted them, but common sense arguments seemed very weak when brought to bear against the multitude of Biblical texts the Saints produced to prove their doctrines.  Julian was not sufficiently conversant with the Scriptures to fight them with their own weapons'; it was the natural versus the supernatural, and Julian grew awed. If they were right,--perhaps they were,--the thoughtless young man grew thoughtful. Oreana saw this change, and continued with greater force her exhortations and prayers.</p>
<p>Some things there were that appeared to Julian very antagonistic to right-mindedness,--such as Mrs. Lascelle leaving her husband, and some suspicious proceedings on the part of Elder Silvertung, that
<pb n="TO THE FAR WEST.     55"/>
 

savored more of hypocrisy and libertinage than of patriarchal simplicity; but Oreana declared it would all be made clear and right, as soon as he received the fullness of the gospel.</p>
<p>Oreana had ever been his guiding star. Her heroism, although misguided, was nevertheless heroism, and Julian loved her all the more for her dauntless spirit. With him to love was to believe.</p>
<p>Still, the conduct of Mrs. Lascelle weighed upon his mind. He blamed himself for not having thought of her while there was time to communicate with her husband. The shock of finding Oreana upon the emigrant ship had effaced from his mind everything else; and the fact that Mrs. Lascelle had accompanied Oreana never occurred to him until he saw her the day after they sailed.</p>
<p>Julian felt guilty towards his friend. He would write to Lascelle as soon as they reached New York—but Oreana, by persuasion and argument, prevented him.</p>
<p>"I am responsible for Mary, and I will write to her husband. Don't you interfere, or you will widen the breach. Edward knows more than you can tell him, and Mary and I intend to write."</p>
<p>Thus urged, Julian contented himself with writing to his mother, explaining fully his sudden resolve, and comforting her with the assurance that as soon as Oreana became his wife, which would be immediately after their arrival in Zion, he would exert a husband’s power and bring back the wanderer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lascelle and Elsie were not with the emigrants.  The Lord had revealed to His chosen servant, Mary, those <hi rend=”italic">other things</hi> He desired of her for her ex-
<pb n="56     TO THE FAR WEST."/>

altation; consequently she had hastened to Zion along with Elder Silvertung and a chosen few.</p>
<p>The elder, upon his arrival in America, found that his presence was required, immediately, in Zion. He was therefore obliged to forego the blessings and glories promised to the pilgrims. He tearfully begged them to remember him in their prayers, and greatly lamented this business which prevented him gaining the laurels reserved for these heroic saints.</p>
<p>The emigrants were much surprised when they discovered that Mrs. Lascelle had followed Silvertung. Julian's suspicions were aroused, but Oreana calmed him.</p>
<p>"She went by the command of God. His ways are not our ways, Julian; we blind, sinful creatures, have only to obey."</p>
<p>Julian was silenced. Perhaps it would be all right. It was not a time for reflection; the excitement of traveling, the continual novelty, the care of his party (for the Delvilles looked up to him), kept him too busy to think.</p>
<p>The residents of the frontier town, although accustomed to reckless adventure, regarded the pilgrims as mad.</p>
<p>At that late season--for it was the month of August--a foot journey across the plains would be a most perilous undertaking, even for well-equipped, able-bodied men. What would it be, then, for this band, more than half of whom were women and children, besides many aged persons and infants? The quickest march would require fifteen weeks; hence, Zion would not be reached until after the snows.</p>
<p>Winter among these dreary solitudes! The mere
<pb n="TO THE FAR WEST.     57"/>

idea of it appalled the boldest. They begged the Saints to defer the journey until Spring; but the deluded people regarded these Gentile importunities as snares of the devil. Some few, however, among whom was Julian, wiser than the rest, discussed the opinions of those who knew the plains, and a small opposition party was formed. The leaders became incensed. Most of the emigrants were poor, and the cost of keeping them in Iowa until Spring would greatly deplete the Church treasury. It was not to be thought of.</p>
<p>A general gathering was called.</p>
<p>Among the band only two had ever crossed the plains,--one, a Zionite, who had come East on business, and preferred going with the emigrants to venturing alone on the plains; the other was a bishop, the chief of the band.</p>
<p>The Zionite, supported by the opposition party, implored the emigrants to remain until Spring. He represented to them the lateness of the season, the certainty of winter overtaking them--a winter whose rigors far exceeded their imagination. He asked them to remember the paucity of their supplies, the weakness of many of their band. His address was interrupted by the bishop, who declared that Brother Simms was influenced by a bad spirit.</p>
<p>"I know the route as well as he, and I tell you it is all false. Will you, through fear, sacrifice the honor, the glory, the exaltation promised to you by the Lord? And even were it true, cannot the Lord take care of His own? I guess He can and He will. The Spirit tells me that not a hair of your heads shall be injured. Not a flake of snow shall hinder you. I appeal to Brother R--to confirm my words."</p>
<pb n="58     TO THE FAR WEST."/>

Brother R--, an apostle of the Church, but not belonging to the band, arose. It was the first time the new Saints had enjoyed the happiness of listening to an apostle of the Last Covenant.</p>
<p>"Heed not," he said, "the wicked, who are careful as to the things of this earth. Heed not the counsels of the evil one, but hearken to the voice of the Lord. He commands you to go as an example to the nations. Will you turn back afraid? God commands the storm. The winds and the sea obey Him. He is your guide; can ye then fear? He who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb will not allow His Saints to perish. He who nourished the children of Israel in the desert, and fed five thousand upon five loaves, will also feed you, oh, ye of little faith! This want of supplies is decreed that the Lord may work a miracle in your favor. And if ye do the will of the Lord and do not offend Him, ye shall all reach Zion safe and sound. It is the Lord Himself who promises. Woe be unto those who doubt! All who are ready to obey--the Lord's faithful Saints--let them hold up their hands."</p>
<p>Instantly the crowd raised their hands, excepting only Julian and Brother Simms. The opposition party was reduced to two.</p>
<p>Ashamed of their temporary hesitation, and fearful lest the Lord should punish them for their lack of faith, the pilgrims hastened their departure, and were soon ready to begin the journey. In vain Julian endeavored to dissuade Oreana and the Delvilles from the mad undertaking. They, even more than the rest, mocked at truth and believed falsehood. Alas! For the credulity of mankind. It was not the first time that faith derided knowledge.</p>
<pb n="ON THE ROAD.     59"/>

CHAPTER XI.

ON THE ROAD.

THE emigrants were divided into parties of five. Each party took charge of a hand-cart loaded with their food and camping equipments. The children too young to walk were also placed in these carts.</p>
<p>A few wagons containing reserve supplies and the baggage of the pilgrims accompanied the caravan.</p>
<p>Brother Simms acted as guide. Captains were chosen, and with the rising of the sun, one August morning, the caravan started.</p>
<p>Oreana and Mr. Delville intoned the hymn:</p>

<p>"0 Babylon, 0 Babylon, we bid thee farewell,</p>
<p>We're to the mountains of Ephraim to dwell."</p>

<p>The whole band took up the song; and thus, in light-heartedness and exultation, began the terrible march.</p>
<p>The last settlement disappeared from their sight; but they laughed, and louder, louder sang,</p>

<p>"0 Babylon, 0 Babylon, we bid thee farewell."</p>

<p>Praying, singing, dreaming of Zion, they walked on, on; resting only at night. Thus the days flew by. The days grew into weeks, the weeks into months. The hot summer gave place to mellow autumn. Autumn paled, and winter advanced with rapid strides.</p>
<p>As the days grew shorter, so did their supplies.
<pb n="60     ON THE ROAD."/>

From full rations to three-quarters, then to half rations of poor, unnutritious food.</p>
<p>Ceaselessly they toiled onward; far into the night they extended their march, continuing it again with the morning's dawn. "On to Zion" was the watch-word; and the wearied limbs found new strength, the sinking hearts new courage, as through the air rang the watchword:</p>
<p>"On, on, to Zion."</p>
<p>Onward, ever onward, over the pathless waste; but slower grew the pace, fainter the song, heavier the carts, and farther, farther, seemed the promised land.</p>
<p>How fervently they prayed. Was God deaf? Or was He angry? How could He be angry when they never rebelled, never repined, never doubted? They only prayed more humbly, more earnestly.</p>
<p>History has extolled, and poetry immortalized, those brave pioneers, who, in comfortable wagons, drawn by sturdy oxen, or mounted on fleet-footed horses, opened a path to the far-distant West. Modern travelers, as they whirl along in luxurious palace cars, think upon these brave pioneers with wondering admiration. But who gives a thought to those heroic pilgrims, those weak women, those tender children, those aged ones tottering to the tomb, who, from religious inspiration, made that journey on foot? Pilgrims of the middle ages, you are outdone, your heroism eclipsed by these simple emigrants of our infidel age.</p>
<p>On foot, one thousand miles, pushing before them heavily-laden carts!</p>
<p>On foot, one thousand miles, over prairie solitudes, gloomy mountain passes, rock-strewn paths, deep-flowing streams, and the desert.</p>
<pb n="A STORM ON THE DESSERT.     61"/>

<p>On foot, one thousand miles, scorched by the mid-day sun, choked with alkaline dust, buffeted by the hurricane, chilled by icy winds, bitten by the frosts, blinded by the snow storm!</p>
<p>On foot, one thousand miles, parched with thirst, fainting with hunger, hands and feet blistered and bleeding, weary, exhausted, dying!</p>
<p>To Zion on foot, one thousand miles, deceived yet believing, heroic amidst despair, murmuring only "Thy will be done," praying, hoping, trusting ever. Thus the pilgrims journeyed to Zion on foot, one thousand miles.</p>
<p>Oh I what a glorious epic upon the greatness, the divinity of the soul!</p>

CHAPTER XII.

A STORM ON THE DESERT.

DESOLATION of desolation! A desert within a desert! A treeless, flowerless, grassless, voiceless waste. A world turned to ashes. A sepulchral solitude, over which brood, in dumb despair, the shadows of an awful past; shadows from which joyous, beauteous life recoils. The earth is shorn of its glorious motherhood; naught but abortive, hueless shrubs are born of the arid soil, infecting the atmosphere with their sickening breath, making the desolation more desolate.</p>
<p>To the North, to the South, stretches the limitless plain, till the gray earth meets the gray winter sky, and they fade away in a shadowy embrace.</p>
<pb n="62     A STORM ON THE DESSERT."/>

<p>To the East, rise jagged fantastic rocks--like an army of pitiless genii shutting out the world,--the world of love and beauty. To the West tower the stern hoary-headed sentinels of the land of Zion.</p>
<p>But the mountains are gray and barren, as if the desert upheaved itself in giant masses, to hurl defiance at heaven. Desolation enfolds the cloud-piercing height, the far-stretching plain, and over all reigns an awful silence, unbroken by song of bird, by whirr of wing, or rustle of grass. Even the streams lose their joyousness; they shrink, they creep along in silent fear till they sink into an alkaline grave.</p>
<p>The bold explorer shudders as he enters the lifeless realm; the Indian turns from it with superstitious dread.</p>
<p>Midway in that dreary desert, mere specks dotting the gray limitless space, we find the pilgrims; but it is difficult to recognize our old friends among these tattered, dust-stained, gaunt, haggard, hollow-eyed beings.</p>
<p>The caravan halts: to dig a grave--a double grave.</p>
<p>An aged woman and Bob Delville have succumbed. Poor Bob, the merry, light-hearted youth; how hard it was to die! How cruel it seemed so leave him there alone in that dismal solitude! He had been the life of the band, always looking on the bright side of everything, and enlivening, by some quaint, funny remark, the gloomiest moments.</p>
<p>He had devoted himself to his mother and sister. This devotion caused his death. They had begged him to think more of himself; but he answered their entreaties with a joke. And now he was dead. The heart-broken mother knelt by the grave of her first-born, while women wept and men groaned.</p>
<pb n="A STORM ON THE DESSERT.     63"/>

<p>It was more than death to them--it was the breaking of God's promise.</p>
<p>The only Power that could save seemed to have deserted them.</p>
<p>For a moment Faith tottered, Despair triumphed. But Oreana doubted not, feared not.</p>
<p>From rank to rank she moved, exhorting, cheering. Her enthusiastic words rekindled their waning courage. Her hope and trust nerved the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>"'Tis but a trial of our faith," she cried. "Would ye wear a martyr's crown without meriting it? Be not faint-hearted. The Lord will not always turn away His face. Hope in him. Zion is near."</p>
<p>Oreana's heroic spirit was contagious: the wailings and groanings ceased. One last hymn over the lonely graves, and then once more on the march--"Onward to Zion."</p>
<p>While the air was yet tremulous with sad melody, there came a sound like the rushing of a mighty ocean:--now a roar, now a plaintive wail. The discordant prelude awakens the spirits of the desert. The alkali takes form. It wreathes, it winds itself into mystic spirals, and, keeping time to the weird music, the spectral dancers glide over the plain, mocking the lonely wanderers.</p>
<p>But even the heralds of the storm cannot daunt the pilgrims now, as Oreana's voice is heard above the wind:</p>
<p>"Brothers and sisters, look upwards. Beyond those mountains is the city of God."</p>
<p>The pilgrims press onward; but ah! how distant those mountains seem. Will the distance never decrease? An endless desert behind them, an endless
<pb n="64      A STORM ON THE DESERT."/>

desert before them, and every hour brings nearer the winter's storms.</p>
<p>The bishop is silent. Perhaps he repents of his bold assertions. Mr. Delville seems dazed. Julian marches onward doggedly, determinedly. He has grappled with a fearful destiny; and that destiny he is resolved to conquer. It is not fanaticism that nerves him,--it is love and pity. Love for Oreana, pity for the pilgrims.</p>
<p>Rapidly, steadily, he pushes his cart, in which lies a pale, thin child, her features drawn by suffering. It is Lizzie, the pet of the Delville household, too weary to complain. Death will soon take her to join her brother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Delville walked beside her husband, a mere human automaton, her heart crushed with grief.</p>
<p>To Oreana, suffering seemed a delight. Her spirit grew stronger, and her body showed no signs of fatigue. Sometimes she appeared exultant. She exhorted, cheered, directed, undaunted even by death.</p>
<p>Two days have passed since the first burial in the desert; days cloudy and menacing; days of furious winds that hurled them one against another, and buffetted them about as though they were toys for the hurricane.</p>
<p>Many sank by the way, gladly welcoming death. Graves mark the pilgrims' path. The dead are no longer lonely.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wind ceases, the clouds sink lower and lower. The air becomes thick with fast-falling masses. The snow storm is upon them.</p>
<p>The pilgrims stop, bewildered. Another prophetic promise falsified. But there is not a moment to be
<pb n="A STORM ON THE DESERT.     65"/>

lost. Thought must be deferred; this is the hour for action. Brother Simms, their guide, orders a rest for refreshments. God knows when they will be able to stop again.</p>
<p>Among the provisions was some good brandy. A little of the liquor was given to each one with the rations of oatmeal and dried meat. This done, the captain ordered the children to be placed in the carts. Then the carts, with their respective parties, were divided into bands of twenty, each twenty under the command of an energetic leader.</p>
<p>Oreana, who seemed endowed with man's strength, woman's fortitude, and the heroism of a martyr, took command of the weakest division.</p>
<p>These precautions were necessary to prevent stopping or scattering. Either would be certain death.</p>
<p>Very little time had been spent in these preparations, yet in that time a thick snow carpet hid the gray alkali, and the mountains were lost to view.
The leaders intoned a hymn, and the pilgrims moved on. Warmed by the exercise in the snow, invigorated by the stimulant, they marched for hours, stopping only at stated intervals to rest and shake the snow from their garments, and from the light covering of the carts. All the time they continued the song, so that they might more easily keep together.</p>
<p>But in spite of these precautions many dropped off unnoticed, and sank without a groan into that slumber from which there is no waking.</p>
<p>Nor were they missed until the next day. Towards morning the storm ceased, the clouds broke, and the
<pb n="66      DESPAIR CHANGED TO GLADNESS."/>

moon and stars shone out. With them came the cruel frost.</p>
<p>Weary as they were, they dared not rest, for to stop on the freezing snow, exposed to the intense cold without fire, without sufficient clothing, was certain death. Their only salvation was in continued motion. Onward they dragged their weary limbs while the pitiless frost stung their hands, blistered with pushing the carts, stung their feet, bruised and bleeding with travel.</p>
<p>The morning brought the sun. In its warmth the pilgrims rested.</p>
<p>The successful battle with the storm gave them a sort of dumb courage.</p>
<p>For days they had expected it--dreaded it. Now it was over, few had perished, and the survivors rejoiced that there was no fresh horror to meet.</p>

CHAPTER XIII.

DESPAIR CHANGED TO GLADNESS.

DAYS passed; each day brought fresh suffering; each day death visited the emigrant band. The pilgrims have become familiarized with the dread presence. The grave appalls them no more.</p>
<p>They have reached the mountains, but the steep, rocky paths are more toilsome than the alkali plain, as barren and desolate, and Zion is still so far.</p>
<p>One afternoon, about a week after the sow storm, the emigrants found themselves upon a small plateau,
<pb n="DESPAIR CHANGED TO GLADNESS.     67"/>

which to the north-west opened into a steep canyon, through which the road passed.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the canyon was a sheltered spot with abundance of brush wood, and here the pilgrims resolved to pass the night. Before they could reach it, two men, who had been long suffering from a malady induced by cold and privation, sank by the way, unable to go any further. As the camping-place was near, their friends arranged a camp and then left them, feeling perfectly secure as to their safety. The wife of one of the men remained to nurse them.</p>
<p>Supper had been eaten some time; most of the pilgrims were asleep; the camp fires almost dead, when menacing howls filled the air. The sounds came nearer and nearer, growing louder and more ominous. The terrified pilgrims, rudely awakened from their sleep, clung to each other, trembling with dread.</p>
<p>A voice cried "The wolves, the wolves!" The hideous howlings answered, "We are the wolves!"</p>
<p>The pilgrims were panic-stricken. Their minds classed wolves with lions and tigers, and brave hearts, that had nobly endured hunger, fatigue, and storm, quailed before this new horror.</p>
<p>In vain Brother Simms assured them that wolves were too cowardly to attack a multitude, that only stragglers need fear. His words fell unheeded; men and women rushed madly about, trying to rekindle the fires, to find their weapons and to make a barricade of the carts. Nearer, nearer, came the savage pack, their fiery eyes and gleaming fangs lighting up the darkness. The excited emigrants imagined themselves surrounded by thousands of ferocious beasts, and the men fired recklessly; the women struck aim-
<pb n="68     DESPAIR CHANGED TO GLADNESS."/>

less blows with anything they could find to wield. The onslaught was fierce, but ill-directed. The wolves at first recoiled, but they soon returned to the fight as if they knew their advantage. Perhaps instinct told them of the exhausted condition of their opponents; perhaps hunger emboldened them, for they evinced no wolfish cowardice.</p>
<p>Many of the women had fainted. The wolves sprang towards the prostrate forms, and could with difficulty be beaten back.</p>
<p>One seized Mrs. Delville, his fangs sinking deep into her shoulder; but a blow from Julian’s gun laid the wolves prostrate.</p>
<p>Suddenly the wolves retreated.</p>
<p>The pilgrims began to breathe freely, when a cry of, "the sick! the sick!" alarmed the camp.</p>
<p>In the fright and confusion, the sick men and their nurse had been forgotten. Instantly Julian, Brother Simms, and a few of the stoutest, started to the rescue, armed with brands, guns and knives. They fought their way through a cordon of wolves frightening, burning, killing, the savage animals.
<p>In a few minutes they came in sight of the little camp. The strong men turned in horror from the scene revealed to them by the moonbeams. They were too late: the wolves had preceded them.</p>
<p>All through the dreary hours of darkness the pilgrims watched. The wolves did not return; but the mountains re-echoed with their howlings,--a paean of ghosts to which the wind moaned a dirge-like accompaniment.</p>
<p>The dawn came at last; the pilgrims continued their march in silence. Their hearts benumbed,--hope
<pb n="DESPAIR TURNED TO GLADNESS.     69"/>

and courage dead,--still they moved onwards, impelled by the instinctive love of life common to all that breathe and move.</p>
<p>In vain Oreana tried to rekindle enthusiasm. In vain she sang songs of Zion. Lips were mute, eyes vacant, souls paralyzed. Despair had conquered Hope.</p>
<p>Finding her efforts useless, Oreana asked Julian to accompany her to the rear in order to help on those who should drop behind.</p>
<p>The march had become one of agony. Many were lamed from frost-bite. Some had lost the use of their feet, and had to be helped along by their stronger companions. Every one suffered from swollen and blistered feet and hands, so that every step was torture. Provisions were almost gone, and they were yet many a dreary mile from Zion. To augment the gloom, the sun was obscured by heavy clouds, harbingers of another snow storm.</p>
<p>The pilgrims struggled on, walking by day, watching through the night; for the wolves followed them.</p>
<p>The snow storm came. Still a little while the pilgrims fought the storm; but resistance died at last.</p>
<p>"God has forsaken us: let us die down and die," cried exhausted nature.</p>
<p>"No; He has not forsaken us. He only tries us," exclaimed Oreana. "Let us pray to Him. He is our father. He will hear us;" and the mountains echoed, "Hear us."</p>
<p>The pilgrims stopped; they fell on their knees; and a prayer went up to the Eternal,--a prayer of death agony. From the midst of those desert mountains borne on the wings of the storm, arose that
<pb n="70     THE DESPAIR CHANGED TO GLADNESS."/>

prayer,--the cry of hundreds of hearts, bleeding victims of faith: a cry mightier than that of Rachel, mourning for her children. A cry that ascended to the throne of the Father.</p>
<p>"Hush! Hush! What is that sound?"</p>
<p>"0 God! hast Thou remembered us?"</p>
<p>"Hush ! It comes again, and nearer, nearer."</p>
<p>Heads are raised to catch the sound, and hands outstretched as if to retain it. Eyes wild with despairing fear gaze upon eyes burning with feverish hope, faces blanch with the sickening dread of disappointment, and hearts stand still with maddening suspense.</p>
<p>They listen in awful silence--a silence that makes audible the falling of the snow-flakes--for a word might break the spell, and hope might vanish for ever.</p>
<p>Hush!—hark--the rumbling of carts--the tramp of oxen--the hum of voices. The voices are singing--"Yes,"--"no,"--"it is,"--"it is a song of Zion."</p>
<p>Then through the canyon rings the glad cry:</p>
<p>"God has heard us--help is near--we are saved!"</p>
<p>Then tears of gladness gush forth from hearts frozen by despair.</p>
<p>Spirits who had bravely endured the agonies of that terrible march, sink; overwhelmed with sudden joy.</p>
<p>Mothers press their children to their bosom, friend clasps friend, misery is forgotten.</p>
<p>The mountains re-echo with prayers of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>"Praise be unto our Father who sends succor to His children."*</p>

<p>* The Zionites, alarmed at the delay of the emigrants, sent out a party in search of them.</p>
<pb n="THE CHIEF.     71"/>

<p>The succor came in time to save a part of the hand-cart band; but two hundred and seventeen graves mark their pathway across the desert. Two hundred and seventeen victims of religious fanaticism and the avarice of the modern Mohammed.</p>

CHAPTER XIV.

THE CHIEF.

IS transmigration a reality? or do the Spirit Principles of particular virtues and passions become incarnate from time to time in the course of ages, to teach or to destroy, or to deceive mankind?</p>
<p>These thoughts suggest themselves as we approach the sanctum of the Modern Man of the Mountain,--the genius of Mormonism; the center around which revolve Polygamy, Blood Atonement, Theocracy; the Despot Priest; the Chief of the Destroying Angels; the Moses of the Nineteenth Century; the Prophet, Seer, Revelator of the Latter Day Saints. A low room, lighted by two square windows, the walls unadorned, the furniture of dark wood, upholstered in somber, austere horse-hair.</p>
<p>In one of the arm-chairs sits a man of about fifty years. His head is large and well developed--the back brain particularly so--the forehead has great breadth, the eyebrows are heavy and near together. Eyes of grayish blue, piercing, uncomfortable eyes, gleaming with the metallic lustre of steel-eyes that can read the
<pb n="72     THE CHIEF."/>

hearts of men, while the drooping lids effectually conceal their own secrets.</p>
<p>The nose is of the aquiline order, slightly curved inwards; the lips of medium fullness, but so tightly compressed that they appear thin; the mouth large, the corners drawn in, the muscles of expression locked so that no twitch may betray the interior man. Hair and beard are abundant, of a light shade just turning gray. Tall and very thick-set-a personification of massive strength.</p>
<p>The man is a marvelous expression of power. Command is in his glance, in the wave of his hand—it asserts itself in his demeanor, it is heard in his step. He wants no silver vail to envelop him in mystery, no rich robes to dazzle the beholders, no armed guards to give him prestige.</p>
<p>Encircled with the aura of an indomitable, unscrupulous will, he boldly stands forth, utters his fiat, and thousands of deluded votaries obey.</p>
<p>Such, twenty years ago, was this autocrat of a barbaric creed, who, enthroned on the mountains of the "Land of Liberty and Progress," endeavored in the name of God to force mankind back to ancient barbarism.</p>
<p>No religious enthusiast was he, overpowering souls by the sublimity of his ideas, carrying them wheresoever he would on the wings of inspiration; but an astute, self-made despot, conquering by force of will and crafty foresight, making all things, even the name of God, subservient to his own selfish ends.</p>
<p>But although not an enthusiast like the prophet, Joseph, he had that which the prophet lacked--a firm, unalterable faith in himself. He was Mormonism; 
<pb n="THE CHIEF.     73"/>

therefore Mormonism was true, and the revelations that supported it were of God, true. Mankind must accept Him or be lost. In this faith he never faltered. In defeat, as well as in triumph, he regarded himself as a Napoleonic Moses,--the genius of the age,--the mouth-piece of the Lord. This conviction made him what he was-great. For whatever his crimes, his selfish meanness, the man has carved his name in capital letters on the pillars of Time. Only a few years ago, the people he now governed were fleeing in confusion and terror from an avenging mob. Homeless, moneyless, without a future, they cried to the Lord, out of their desolation, to send them a Moses. Instantly this man sprang into a cart and cried: "Attention! 0 ye camps of Israel."</p>
<p>This happy phrase made him master of the people. His judgment made him master of the situation.</p>
<p>He conducted them safely over unknown deserts to the Great Salt Lake. Under his direction the desert became fruitful, settlements sprang up, projects shadowed forth by the castle-building Joseph became tangible realizations. In a few years this ostracized creed attained an organizing power almost equal to that of Catholicism. His people saw this and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Verily the Lord has given unto us a second Moses."</p>
<p>Then ambition whispered to selfishness; together they dreamed dreams, wherein this desert chief saw himself ruler of a mighty people, a conqueror, a king. But how to attain this end? The ordinary means of immigration and increase were too slow. Besides, the immigrants were mostly women. Craft hinted polygamy. Sensuality applauded, and a polygamous decree went forth-forged in God's name.</p>
4
<pb n="74     THE CHIEF."/>

<p>What did it matter if women's hearts bled, what did it matter if humanity became degraded? He, the chief, would rule a  mighty people, ready to conquer the world.</p>
<p>Success smiled on his ambition. Already the feeble colony had become a strong, self-supporting people.</p>
<p>The hand-cart failure was the first check. The sight of the human skeletons, of the handless, footless beings that met  him on the streets, worried him. Not that he reproached himself with their misery; but the lie direct they gave to         revelation and prophesy, threatened him in two very delicate points---his ambition and his avarice. It might deter         immigration!</p>
<p>A cloud rested on the great man's brow. But there was another cause for his displeasure. Elder Silvertung's             wife-conquest angered him from the first, and that morning's mail brought him papers which showed up, in strong colors, themeans the elder had taken to win her. Now this would not do at all. Not only would such conduct bring odium on the cause,  bat it was encroaching upon his privileges. Silvertung had robbed him of a lovely wife; for, of course, he could have takenpossession of Mary Lasoelle, if Silvertung had not forestalled him. Mary would have looked so lovely in his harem; she     would have just filled the vacant spot in his affections.</p>
<p>It is true these affections were claimed by a dozen wives; but what were a dozen in his elastic heart? Besides, like    other great princes, policy, not fancy, had hitherto ruled his choice; but now his position allowed him more liberty. He   intended to give himself the pleasure of wooing beauty and elegance; but
<pb n="A TRYING AUDIENCE.    75"/>

his would be a sorry chance if his emissaries made use of their better opportunities to rob him thus.</p>
<p>As these thoughts passed through his mind, the frown upon his brow grew darker---he stamped---he prayed in wrath.</p>

CHAPTER XV.

A TRYING AUDIENCE.

AT this unpropitious moment the leader of the hand-cart expedition and Elder Silvertung were ushered into the royal        presence.</p>
<p>Observing the scowling aspect of the chief, they started back; for the bravest of the priesthood feared the despot's    anger.</p>
<p>A few moments of silence; then he turned to the hand-cart leader:</p>
<p>"A nice mess you have got us into. I suppose you think I can stand the blame of every thing. As soon as the sufferings  of those people become known immigration will cease; then what will become of us?"</p>
<p>"The people do not think any one is to blame but themselves;" meekly answered the brother; "and as for the facts gettingwind, we can easily prevent that."</p>
<p>"Last night, at meeting, the general feeling was, that God was offended by their delay and hesitation, and showed his   anger in thus afflicting them," interposed Silvertung.</p>
<p>"Humph! So far so good. Let them think God is angry. He ought to be. We must do something to cause this experiment to beforgotten."</p>
<pb n="76     A TRYING AUDIENCE."/>

<p>"Well, the adage says, 'Out of sight, out of mind.' The territory is large enough to hide them; and if they don't have  anybody around to remind them of their adventures they will soon forget them. There are plenty of districts in deserts     where mail facilities are yet unknown."</p>
<p>"Very good advice, and easily followed. It is a pity you are not always so inspired," sneered the chief.</p>
<p>"Among them are some well-to-do people and some pretty nice women that we ought to keep among us."</p>
<p>"Brother Silvertung, take care that women don't ruin you yet. Read that, and that, then digest it if you can."</p>
<p>Brother Silvertung took the papers, read the remarks upon his conduct, and smiled.</p>
<p>"You seem to think it fun," said the chief, fixing the brother with his sharp, cold glance. "But I tell you it won't do.I won't have it. You bring scandal upon the Church, and I have to suffer; but this thing must stop. I won't father any of  your foolhardiness, by God, I won't."</p>
<p>The table received a blow which echoed through the room. The brethren started.</p>
<p>"I did not think," stammered Silvertung.</p>
<p>"Think? You have no business to think. I don't want thinkers or fools around me."</p>
<p>"But Mary and her daughter; we can count them equal to a dozen Saints for the coming generation."</p>
<p>"The honor of which increase you selfishly keep to yourself. A nice pass we're come to when missionaries assume the     prerogatives of the presidency. Next thing, the newly-fledged saints, and the women, will
<pb n="A  TRYING AUDIENCE.     77"/>

indulge in visions and revelations. But I shall stop this thing. Strong food is not for the stomach of babes, nor strong   light for their eyes. If ye don't understand this thing ye must be made to understand. No more revelations except through  me; no more stealing, no more scandal. Do ye take me for a puppet?",/p>
<p>A light dawned upon Elder Silvertung. He saw where the wound of the great man lay. His genius suggested a remedy.       Assuming a cringing tone, he replied:</p>
<p>"My zeal misled me. Henceforth I will be guided by your wisdom. But to return to the subject of the pilgrims. There are some remarkably fine people among them. For example, Oreana Brentford."</p>
<p>"She <hi rend="italic">is<hi> a splendid girl, there's no mistake, and such a devoted spirit; why, she is Joel and      Deborah and Esther all in one," said the hand-cart leader.</p>
<p>"Such grace and elegance," added Silvertung. "She sings like an angel, plays on the piano, speaks two or three          languages."</p>
<p>"That's all very well, but if you could have seen her leading the emigrants, inspiring them, comforting and cheering    them; why, I felt like adoring her. The storms seemed to respect her. I don't believe the snow fell upon her as it did uponus. She's a woman that is a woman; and looking all the while like a beautiful picture."</p>
<p>"What do you think of that, Brother Stimpson?" exclaimed the chief, turning to a new arrival. "Isn't that a woman for   you?"</p>
<p>"True, Brother B--, she is the loveliest female I ever set eyes on."</p>
<pb n="78     A TRYING AUDIENCE."/>

<p>"It is strange some Saint didn't grab her before she reached here. Woman-grabbing is the order of the day.  The Lord hasgone into the business, it seems; but I am going to close down on it right away. As for this girl, I can't think she's so  beautiful, or she never would have got here unmarried."</p>
<p>"Why, you see there is a very good reason for that. There was a smart young fellow, a kind of affianced husband, to lookafter her and keep her safe from the sharks. But I don't think he will be in the way now. She don't seem to yearn after himvery much. She's awful on the reform; the way she goes in for Jed's mule is a caution."</p>
<p>"Humph! I will see to her salvation myself," said the chief, rubbing his hands--a fashion with him when pleased. During the conversation about Oreana, the lids drooped over his eyes, completely hiding their expression, the frown became a sneer; but the face still looked ominous and unpleasant.</p>
<p>"Brother Stimpson, how goes the reform?"</p>
<p>"Finely! The people are firmly convinced of the Lord's anger; and confessions and baptisms are all the rage. Jed's mule did it this time."</p>
<p>"Encourage it all you can. It will prevent the people from dwelling on unprofitable subjects; it will prepare them for anew revelation; not from the devil, like some we had lately," (he darted a furious look at Silvertung), "but one according to the covenant. We must be ready to fight the battles of the Lord. In the mean time, push on the reform: make the people
mad to fight as the Israelites of old. Look after these immigrants, get husbands for the girls. The building up of the     kingdom cannot be delayed. The poor
<pb n="A TRYING AUDIENCE.     79"/>

families must be scattered in the distant parts of the territory; but keep those who are well off near here. We must have  the money in our hands.</p>
<p>"Of late the tithing reports are unsatisfactory. Do you steal money as well as women? A precious fool you must take me  for."</p>
<p>The look that accompanied the remark made the trio feel rather uncomfortable, but just at that moment Mr. Robert        Delville was announced.</p>
<p>Brother Stimpson whispered to the great man:</p>
<p>"Delville's the richest we've had yet."</p>
<p>These few words acted as a talisman upon the chief. The despot changed into the father. So great was the metamorphosis  that one would have declared that it was another man who filled that arm-chair. Nature endowed that strange man with       marvelous histrionic powers. He could assume any role at will. He could be all things to all men and still be himself. To  Mr. Delville he wished to appear the God-chosen father of this people. His aspect became benign. A chastened sorrow sat on his brow and expressed itself in his voice. He welcomed the rich convert with fatherly tenderness, all the more, perhaps,  that his penetration saw in Delville the material for a first-class tool.</p>
<p>Mr. Delrille was captivated, enslaved. He laid himself and his substance at the feet of the chief.</p>
<pb n="80      JED'S MULE."/>

CHAPTER XVI.

JED'S MULE.

SOME writer has said that woman is at the bottom of all mischief.  Had he lived among the "Saints" he might have added:
"Sometimes it is a mule." Yes, once there was a great deal of mischief, and a woman had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It was all about a mule.</p>
<p>History does not mention any remarkable traits about the mule. It could not speak, like Balaam's ass; neither was it a  mule of consequence because of its master's fame--on the contrary, this mule gave renown to his master. It gave him a      vocation. But that mule did much more than this.</p>
<p>It inaugurated the reform.</p>
<p>The reform fostered blood-atonement.</p>
<p>From blood-atonement sprang the Danites, alias the Destroying Angels, who polluted Columbia's fair brow with the gory   stain of Mountain Meadows.</p>
<p>Only a mule, yet it caused the world to shudder.</p>
<p>It happened thus:</p>
<p>The "Saints" were rapidly becoming monomaniacs. Their mania, repentance. For some time a crisis had seemed inevitable.  Isolation, suffering, continual meditation upon the sanguinary record of the Israelites, and horrors of the book of Mormon,had done their work.</p>
<p>The failure of the hand-cart expedition intensified this morbid sense of sin and fear of God's judgments.</p>
<p>Reason was trembling, tottering upon its throne.</p>
<pb n="JED'S MULE.      81"/>

Such was the condition of the people that thronged one of the meeting-houses in Zion when a man suddenly cried out, as if  inspired:</p>
<p>"Woe, woe unto us ! In vain have we fled from the iniquity of Babylon, when the children of God turn from holiness to   abominations, when they seek after lying, and hunger for the flesh-pots of Egypt. Brother Grabbin stole my mule, and when  God looks down upon us he sees that mule and turns away in wrath. Woe, woe unto us! Brother Grabbin denies he stole my     mule, and the Lord visits us with condemnation, for we harbor iniquity. Repent, repent, children of Israel! Arise! confess yoursins and repent. Quick, quick, before God destroys us with famine and the sword. Don't let a mule kick us out of the   celestial kingdom. Arise, brethren, before it is too late-arise, and repent."</p>
<p>This address destroyed all mental equilibrium; it determined the crisis. Men and women accused themselves and each otherof sins, real and imaginary. Faster, faster, accusation followed accusation; louder grew the cries. The meeting-house      became a Babel with the sobs, groans, prayers, for baptism. The people were crazed; the craze extended far and wide. Every stream was thronged with men and women, imploring baptism. And as the madness grew, the chief looked on and smiled.</p>
<p>"It is well," he murmured. "Now for the extermination of the enemies of Israel!"</p>

<pb n="82     OLD ACQUAINTANCES."/>

CHAPTER XVII.

OLD ACQUAINTANOES.

THE Delvilles and Oreana were, upon their arrival at Zion, entertained at the house of one of the apostles; but Mrs.       Delville was so oppressed by the atmosphere of a polygamous household (the apostle had six wives), that her husband        hastened to find a home.</p>
<p>They soon moved into an adobe building, a sorry apology for a house; but it was the only one to be had, and Mr. Delvillecheered them with the promise that he would soon build the handsomest house in the city.</p>
<p>In spite of this promise, Mrs. Delville slowly pined. The sufferings of the journey had worn her to a shadow of her     former self. A great change appearedin her manner. The serene affection--serene, because secure--that beautifies the wife  and mother of civilization, had given place to a restless, feverish demonstrativeness. She lived in fear and trembling. Her
husband gloried in the new creed; would he, could he, notwithstanding its counsels, keep his promise of fidelity to her?</p>
<p>The poor woman scarcely dared speak of her fears and her dislikes. The women whose sorrows she had shared during the    long pilgrimage were scattered far and wide. Oreana chilled her with terror. Julian was her only friend, and he was so     troubled and heartsore that he needed consolation as much as she did. Still it was a comfort to mingle their sorrows.</p>
<p>They are talking of home, as they sit in the room which is kitchen, dining-room, parlor, all in one.</p>
<pb n="OLD ACQUAITANCES.     83"/>

<p>It is, however, difficult to recognize in this thin, sickly woman the once portly Mrs. Delville, or in the sad, stern   man, with furrowed brow, the once brilliant and light-hearted Julian Bellew.</p>
<p>Poor Julian! truly Oreana had been a cruel Fate to him!</p>
<p>"Oh, Julian, how I wish we were all back home! If I had only listened to the misgivings of my heart I never should have consented, never; no matter how much they preached that a wife should follow her husband--no, I never should. Just think ofmy darlings dead on the desert, the solace of visiting their graves denied me. If we were only back!"</p>
<p>"Great God, I would give half my life to be at home again with you and Oreana. What has come over Oreana?"</p>
<p>"Why, she is half crazy. Just think, she has been baptized twenty-five times since she came."</p>
<p>"Twenty-five times! What in the name of Heaven for?"</p>
<p>"For her own sanctifiation, and for her dead relations. She was dipped for her grandmother and yours, for my mother; in fact, for all our deceased female relatives."</p>
<p>"Poor Oreana! so kind to the dead, so cruel to the living. Think of her father, dead of a broken heart for her; think of the desolation of our once happy homes. Why did I leave them? I thought then it would be so easy to save her, that love would work the miracle. Most strange infatuation! that can even justify adultery  What hope have I? None! And she turns from me. Can I have offended her?"</p>
<p>"She is angry that you refuse to take your Endow-
<pb n="84     OLD ACQUAITANCES."/>

ments. If you could pretend to be a fervent Mormon, I think she would listen, perhaps."</p>
<p>"But how could I, when I hate it so? I have been angry with myself for receiving baptism from the hands of such rascals: then these Endowments, vailed in mystery, must be evil, or why be so secret concerning them?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing evil about them, Julian. They are--" the woman stopped, looked around to assure herself that no one was listening, then, approaching
Julian, whispered, "they are silly! The only time I have laughed, since my darlings died, was in the Endowment House. But 0! don't tell anyone I said so, or Heaven knows what they'd do to me. We take an awful oath not to reveal the ceremonies. But I haven't revealed them, have I? It isn't revealing to say they are silly."</p>
<p>"Make your conscience easy, Mrs. Delville: I will not betray you. But if these Endowments are only silly, and if you think my taking them will reconcile
Oreana to our marriage, I will submit. But I fear there is more than that. Has not Oreana changed?"</p>
<p>"Changed! She frightens me, Julian. Then, too, she is so dreamy--so unlike her old self. This reform has made her crazy."</p>
<p>"Crazy! who is crazy?" demanded Oreana, who, entering that very moment, had heard so much of the conversation.</p>
<p>She was more beautiful than ever: yet she was changed.</p>
<p>"Why, you look as if I had caught you plotting treason. I suppose it is I who am crazy. The Saints are always crazy to those who love Babylon. Ah,
<pb n="OLD ACQUAINTANCES.     85"/>

But you will change your ideas when Christ comes in His glory. It is time for meeting. Are you going to implore the Lord's mercy, or do you fancy you are without sin?"</p>
<p>"We are going, Oreana. Wait a minute and I will be ready: Julian has no preparation to make."</p>
<p>"Don't be long, Cousin Lucy, for I promised to call for Mary."</p>
<p>"Then I am not going with you, Oreana. I cannot bring myself to speak cordially to Mary, after all that she has done. To forsake a good, honorable husband, to wreck his life,--to become a creature of scorn,--to bring up her child for such a fate; no, I can't speak to her."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Delville," said Julian, "this poor woman is to be pitied; vent your indignation not so much upon her as upon the creed that urged her to it."</p>
<p>"But she ought to have known better, Julian. As if God wished any one to commit--It is all wrong, and I never will countenance such evil. I wonder God does not strike her dead."</p>
<p>"Cousin Lucy, beware let God strike you with His wrath for daring to speak against Celestial Marriage. You and Julian seem to forget that the ways of God are inscrutable, His judgments past our finding out. In the pride of your heart you dare to arraign Him. Ah! but I see desolation coming upon us for this audacity. Awake, ye lukewarm I awake and repent, ye who still love Babylon, ye for whom the city of God hath no charms. Awake and repent, ere God destroy! But I will pray for you. Mary, whom you despise, but whom God loveth, shall pray. I will have you prayed for by the band of Saints. Good-bye."</p>
<pb n="86     THE NEW REVELATION."/>

<p>Julian made a step forward, as if he would follow her but Mrs. Delville held him back.</p>
<p>"Don't follow her, Julian; wait, it will be all right by and by. I am afraid we are lukewarm; let us appear more fervent; as a beginning we will go to meeting. But I do hope they won't preach the shedding of blood as atonement. It makes the cold chills run all through me."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Delville, it is an infamous, a damnable fraud and delusion; we will, we must get out of it."</p>
<p>"That's easier said than done. Oh, I do wish we were back home; but Julian, we shall never leave this place alive. I know it, I feel it."</p>

CHAPTER XVIII.

THE NEW REVELATION.

<p>BEFORE Oreana reached Silvertung's house, she met her friend.</p>
<p>Mrs. Silvertung had lost much of the charm that distinguished Mrs. Lascelle. There was a frightened look upon the woman's face, and her eyes were heavy and swollen. Her voice had lost its sweet timbre, and a tone of weary complaining struck painfully on the ear.</p>
<p>"I am so glad you've come, Oreana. It seems something like home to see you. Isn't it dreary and lonesome in this place? and those mountains give me the horrors. I imagine they are going to crush me."</p>
<p>"What ridiculous fancies you have, Mary; they come from the evil one, and you must banish them. It
<pb n="THE NEW REVELATION.     87"/>

is your duty as a Saint. I think Zion is a delightful city. Look at these broad streets, watered by the mountain streams and fringed with trees. In a few weeks, when these are all in bloom, think how beautiful it will be. The mountains are glorious. I won't allow you to say a word against them. But what delights me most is the absence of money, of the filthy lucre, of the base coin for which men sell their souls, Now this exchange of meat for flour, of butter and eggs for cotton and flannel, is just like the patriarchal times. Is it not beautiful?"</p>
<p>"I suppose it is. You know best," Mary sighed.</p>
<p>"And as for its being lonesome,--why all the Saints are like brothers and sisters; and I should think you would find good company in Sister Alice Silvertung."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't say anything about her, dear; she is very nice, but--oh, dear, it is hard, so hard. I don't like polygamy. I know I ought to like it, but I don't."</p>
<p>"Mary," exclaimed Oreana, "you too, are you one of the rebellious? No wonder the Lord is wroth against this people. Think how the Lord has favored you with visions and revelations, and dare you provoke him with faint-heartedness? By the sufferings of the just will the world be redeemed!"</p>
<p>"Oreana I don't, don't. When you look at me so you frighten me. Did I not obey when the Lord commanded? But the cross is very heavy; and surely I may sometimes complain just to you, who are so strong."</p>
<p>"Mary, complaining is not worthy of a Saint. If you acquire the habit of complaining to me, you will do the same when you are with others."</p>
<pb n="88      THE NEW REVELATION."/>

<p>"Don't scold me, dear, I will try to do better; but I scarcely know what I am doing. It is all so strange; then this reform terrifies me. Yesterday some teachers came to the house; they tortured us with the most horrible questions, and when I cried, they denounced me as faint-hearted."</p>
<p>"So they should do. You ought only to weep for your sins. A mother in Israel should exult. If you would occupy yourself more with works of salvation, there would be no time to indulge in these weaknesses. Have you been baptized yet for your mother?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Mary, this is sinful remissness. I have been baptized for all our departed female relatives. I hoped Julian would do as much for the men, at least for my father; but no, he hardens his heart against the voice of the Lord, and he thinks I can still love him. Love one who hungers after the flesh-pots of Egypt? Never. If my father be lost it will be his fault. The thought fills my heart with indignation."</p>
<p>"Why don't you be baptized for them?"</p>
<p>"Mary, is it possible you are so ignorant of our principles? Women can't be baptized for men. But I have digressed. I was going to tell you that to-morrow I am going to be baptized for the Princess Charlotte, Lady Jane Gray and Charlotte Corday. You must come with me and you can be baptized for your dearest relations. Will you come?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I dread going into the water."</p>
<p>"It seems to me you dread everything. What a weak little thing you are! Where is Elsie to-day?"</p>
<p>At the mention of the child Mary quivered. It was with some difficulty she answered: "Alas! what can I
<pb n="THE NEW REVELATION.     89"/>

do with Elsie? She is always asking for her papa; then, too, she is so cross and naughty to the elder, and to-day he punished her."</p>
<p>"I am glad that he has taken her in hand. The child has a spirit that must be subdued. But here we are at the Tabernacle. Won't it be glorious when the new Tabernacle is finished and our Temple built?"</p>
<p>"I hope we shall have some nice sermons this afternoon," sighed Mary Lascelle.</p>
<p>"We shall be certain of two good stirring ones; for the President and Elder Silvertung will speak."</p>
<p>The addresses were certainly stirring enough. The speakers had searched the ancient Scriptures for passages that they could best interpret according to their sanguinary ideas. The first text startled the hearers. Mrs. Delville shuddered. Julian frowned. It was from Leviticus xvii. 11: "For it is blood that maketh atonement for sin."</p>
<p>The speaker, Elder Silvertung, eloquently persuaded the people that as some sins could only be effaced by blood, the sublimest charity consisted in shedding the blood of the guilty, that, being washed in their blood they might be saved. The second speaker followed in much the same strain. The people became excited. At length the chief arose. In a sonorous voice he read the verses from the fifteenth chapter of Chronicles: "Whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</p>
<p>"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found of them, and the Lord gave them rest round about."--Chron. xv. 13, 15.</p>
<pb n="90     THE NEW REVELATION."/>

<p>"Now your position towards God to-day is exactly the same as that of the Israelites three thousand years ago. As they were the people of God, chosen from among the nations of the earth, so are you. He has made a covenant with you, as He did with Abraham, with Moses, and with David. Like the Israelites of old, you are surrounded by the enemies of God. They swarm like flies; they must be destroyed as you would destroy flies.</p>
<p>"God says so. He wants it done. If you don't do it He must do it Himself.</p>
<p>"Now, then, what does it behoove you to do? Will you stand lazily by with arms folded while God, does this dirty work? Or will you come forward as good servants should,--as did these brave old Israelites,--and say, 'Lord, don't you trouble yourself, I will do this for you.' Let all those who want to help the Lord hold up their hands." (A multitude of hands went up.), "Good! I told the Lord you were made of the right stuff.</p>
<p>"Now I have something to tell you, something mighty grand.</p>
<p>"The Lord has made to me another revelation. He wants to form a Society for the Defense of His Cause. He is very anxious about it. He has dictated the rules, and given me the names of those He wants. I tell you the Lord is mighty kind and generous to this people; and if any of you go back on Him, that man or woman should be buried in the deepest pit of hell, and every devil on the top of him."</p>
<p>This harangue increased the excitement a hundred-fold.</p>
<p>Julian was horrified. For the first time he felt 
<pb n="THE NEW REVELATION.     91"/>

afraid. Mrs. Delville clung to her husband, who appeared almost beside himself with joy.</p>
<p>"I suppose I may tell you," he whispered, "the Lord has chosen me,--me, Robert Delville,--for one of His soldiers. Ain't you proud of your husband, Lucy?"</p>
<p>For response Mrs. Delville shuddered.</p>
<p>Mary Silvertung trembled in silence.</p>
<p>Oreana's eyes sparkled with triumph. Pointing to Julian, Mrs. Delville and Mary, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>"It is good that you tremble, ye unregenerate, ye faint-hearted. Julian, I did not see your hands uplifted. Don't you fear the wrath of the Lord? Do you think He will allow your open contempt to pass unrebuked? Is not this new revelation glorious? My heart leapt with joy at the news. And you are chosen, cousin Robert. Would that I were a man, to wield a strong arm in the cause of God. But I will not repine; I can work if I cannot fight."</p>
<p>Julian regarded Oreana with astonishment: this was a new phase of her character. The revelation pained him. He dared not trust himself to speak.
The company of these fanatics became unsupportable. He must be alone; and, without a word, he rushed away.</p>
<p>"Julian forgets his manners," remarked Mr. Delville; "that's bad policy."</p>
<p>"When one feels badly, one can't be polite. I know I can't," replied Mrs. D.</p>
<p>Elder Silvertung, bland and smiling, now came up. He made a point of being exceedingly polite to Mrs. D., while she shrank from him in disgust. Oreana considered this conduct of the elder as sublime.</p>
<pb n="92     THE NEW REVELATION."/>

<p>"See how gracious he is to Mrs. Delville, who treats him as if he were a dog," remarked Oreana to Mary. "Your husband is a remarkable man; you ought to be very proud of him. Look, he makes Lucy speak to him. I am so glad. There, be is coming for you; so I suppose I must resign you."</p>
<p>With a great deal of demonstration the elder took possession of Mary; then, turning to Mr. Delville, he said:</p>
<p>"Is not the Lord good to me? He has given me four loving wives, among them, this, our beautiful little Mary. Ah! I am a happy man, Delville, and truly grateful to the Lord. May He some day be as bounteous to you. How proud you will be then, Mrs. Delville, to be the queen of five or six fair, fruitful wives. I hope that day is not far distant."</p>
<p>He bowed, and walked off smilingly, with his victim on his arm. He felt happy, for he knew he had stung Mrs. Delville. He noted the indignant flush on her cheek, the twitching of her mouth, the look of agony she gave her husband. The sight was happiness to him. How nicely he had punished her for her condemnatory remarks.  Silvertung seemed to be clair-audient, so well he knew what people said about him.</p>
<p>"Now, Mary dear, tell me, is not plural marriage the only true, happy marriage? You have experience in both, answer me. Isn't it the only one?"</p>
<p>Mary choked down a sob, and answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>"I knew you would say yes; and we will bring up Elsie a good little saint. We will teach her all the duties, all the virtues becoming to a celestial wife."</p>
<pb n="SHE MADE AN IDOL     93"/>

CHAPTER     XIX. . 

SHE MADE UNTO HERSELF AN IDOL, AND, BOWING DOWN, WORSHIPED IT.

<p>OREANA walked away slowly, her head bent, apparently in deep reverie. Mrs. Delville was right. Oreana was becoming dreamy. She sought solitude, and often laughed softly, then sighed, as if she followed a bright vision that continually escaped her; again, she hummed snatches of sweet melody. When a woman acts in this wise, it may be safely inferred that she is breaking the first commandment. Oreana was no exception, and her religious absorption did not prevent her from enthroning an idol in her heart, before which her soul bowed in worship.</p>
<p>In the long ago, when meditating upon the new gospel, she loved to picture to herself the second Moses, the chief appointed by the Lord. In imagination, she saw him clothed with majesty, crowned with celestial light, the embodiment of all that was great, holy, venerable, and sublime.</p>
<p>Her soul had bowed before him in ideal worship.</p>
<p>But since her arrival in Zion, the spiritual began to give place to the material. Ideal worship merged into actual worship.</p>
<p>As she had been enthralled by the idea, so now she was psychologized by the man. She saw him only as he willed that he should be seen. Thus his ignorance appeared to be wisdom, his coarseness, simplicity, and his animal boldness, God-like strength.</p>
<pb n="94    AND WORSHIPED IT."/>

<p>She had not spoken to him, yet she thought of him continually.</p>
<p>The eye of the serpent fascinated her; and there were none to snatch her from its fatal coils. The delicate intuition, the sensitive purity, the mercy, all that constitutes woman's higher nature, her heaven-appointed guardians against evil, were dead,--killed by the poisonous atmosphere of polygamy and blood atonement.</p>
<p>Pure affection could not shield her; for she had pitilessly sacrificed it when she broke the sacred ties of home, and trampled under foot a lover's true devotion.</p>
<p>Still in a reverie she entered her room, and sat down by the window to dream. Suddenly she started to her feet in glad surprise. She saw her uncle approaching the house accompanied by a gentleman.</p>
<p>Oreana hastily smoothed her hair, and arranged her dress. She was putting the last touches to her toilette when she heard a well-known sonorous voice address Mr. Delville. At the sound, her heart stood still; then, as if to make up for the lost time, it beat as fast again as it should have done, madly propelling the blood through her veins, flushing her cheeks, making her eyes to glow and her lips to quiver. Never before had the sound of a man's voice affected her in this way.</p>
<p>"Oreana, Oreana!" called Mr. Delville; and Oreana, vainly trying to still her heart, entered the room, and literally bowed before her idol.</p>
<p>"President, this is my niece."</p>
<p>"I have heard much in praise of you, Sister Oreana, and for once rumor falls far short of the truth."</p>
<pb n="SHE MADE AN IDOL.     95"/>

<p>"There now, President," said Mr. Delville, who appeared exceedingly pleased, "don't make the girl vain. I'm sure I thought you were above noticing looks."</p>
<p>"Brother Delville, the exterior is a reflection of the interior. In our sister's beauty I see the soul,--the soul that showed so much faith and heroism during that painful journey decreed by our Lord, not only as a punishment, but also to show of what kind of metal those converts were made. You see I know all about you, Sister Oreana; and I hope you have quite recovered from the hardships."</p>
<p>By this time Oreana had regained her self-possession, and was able to answer without trepidation. The conversation became general. A brusque courtesy distinguished the chief. He appeared much pleased, and often rubbed his hands while he listened to Oreana, whose brilliancy astonished even her friends. The atmosphere of the being deified by her fancy seemed to give her inspiration. She spoke words that glittered and sparkled--bright gems of fantaisie.</p>
<p>At length the visitor rose to go; but he promised to come again soon. He shook hands with the family. The touch of his fingers thrilled Oreana. The serpent watched the effect. Still holding her hand, he looked at her for a few moments, then said:</p>
<p>"Sister Oreana, I have seen you before; the first time about a year ago. Since then, frequently. Have you, ever seen me?"</p>
<p>Oreana blushed. Could she tell him of her fancies, of her ideal worship? No. She hesitated, and was silent.</p>
<p>He did not appear to notice her agitation, but continued as if speaking to himself:</p>
<pb n="96     DELUSIVE HOPES."/>

<p>"Yes, in visions the Lord has shown you to me. A great destiny lies before you. Be faithful: listen not to the ungodly. How wonderful are the ways of the Lord!</p>
<p>"Good-bye, my friends; good-bye, Sister Oreana."</p>
<p>"That bait took finely," said the great man to himself. "A magnificent girl! What a bust, what arms, what lips! What devotion to the cause! You shall be mine, my beauty. Our bridal day is not far distant."</p>

CHAPTER XX.

DELUSIVE HOPES.

<p>WE left Julian hurrying away from the meeting, in order to conceal his emotion. He walked rapidly, without thought as to his destination, and soon found himself beyond the limits of the city, on the sage-brush plain. There he met with some acquaintances, fellow-pilgrims, who were equally disgusted with the big fraud.</p>
<p>These young men unfolded to him a scheme of escape. Escape seems a strange word to use in a free country, in a free age; but a glance at those mountains, a thought of their isolation, is sufficient to justify its use.</p>
<p>The plan appeared very feasible. Under a pretense of settling in the southern part of the territory, they would make their way to California. The route was pleasant and easy compared to that by which they had come.</p>
<p>Five contemplated going; two of the number
<pb n="DELUSIVE HOPES.     97"/>

were women. They had health, strength, and money, and were, moreover, inured to hardship; so they did not fear.</p>
<p>Julian was delighted. This plan of escape made all his troubles seem light.</p>
<p>But he must manage to marry Oreana. She had avoided him of late. She appeared very much changed towards him. Then, like a true lover, he began to lay the blame upon himself. He had been churlish and too outspoken; he must flatter Oreana's prejudices. Yes, were it necessary, he would receive the Endowments,--anything to get her free from this delusion. To effect this, no sacrifice was too great.</p>
<p>Memory pictured to him those other days when they were so happy and hopeful,--yea, those days on board the "Eagle" had their delights. Oreana then promised to become his wife upon their arrival at Zion.</p>
<p>He would try to bring back those days; then perhaps she would fulfill her promise; and then to California, across the oceans home, to those dear ones so anxiously waiting.</p>
<p>These resolves cheered Julian. A settled plan of escape restored courage and hope, He turned his footsteps homewards feeling comparatively happy. For the first time he saw the city of the desert in all its solemn beauty.</p>
<p>He stopped to gaze upon the picture, when his curiosity was excited by the sight of a very little girl trudging through the sage-brush towards the mountains.</p>
<p>He looked from the distant, shimmering lake to the peaks towering above him, across the gray plain,
6
<pb n="98     DELUSIVE HOPES."/>

dotted here and there with verdure, over the infant city nestling among these solitudes, but that wee child figure was the only moving, breathing thing visible.</p>
<p>There was no house near, and Julian wondered what could have brought her so far from home. He hastened towards her. As he drew near he perceived that she carried something wrapped up in a cloak or shawl, and to which she seemed to speak every now and then. A few more steps and Julian stopped amazed. It was Elsie Lascelle, his little pet Elsie. A great friendship has always existed between the young man and the child, but of late he had somewhat forgotten her in his many troubles.</p>
<p>The child was getting tired; at last she sat down upon a rock half-hidden by a clump of brush. Julian approached; but the child did not perceive him, so intent was she in talking.</p>
<p>"Kitty dear, never mind (sob), we go to Papa. We won't be whipped (<hi rend=”italic">sob</hi>). Papa is good   Papa loves Elsie. Papa is other side of big hills. A long way; Kitty mustn't get tired. We'll find him and Downie. Nobody good here (<hi rend=”italic">sob</hi>); nobody loves us not even Dudie. Don't cry, Kitty."</p>
<p>Dudie was a pet name Elsie had given to Julian.</p>
<p>"Elsie, darling, Dudie does care for you," cried Julian, coming forward and clasping the little waif in his arms. "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"I and Kitty are going to papa. Nasty preather man ain't Papa, is he? He whipped me, kicked Kitty, and made Mamma cry. You whip him, Dudie, and I will give you my pretty beads and lots of kisses."</p>
<p>"But perhaps my little Elsie was naughty. No one would whip her if she were good".
<pb n="DELUSIVE HOPES.     99"/>

<p>"I wasn't naughty, was I, Kitty? Kitty doesn't like preather man. We want Papa."</p>
<p>"But you could not find Papa. He is ever so far away. Now, let me take you and Kitty home before it is dark."</p>
<p>"No, no, we won't go home 0, Dudie, take me to Papa!"</p>
<p>"Elsie must be good, and I will tell her something. Papa is coming to Elsie soon."</p>
<p>"And will Papa take me away from this ugly place. Will he bring Downie?" (Downie was Elsie's pet rabbit.) "When is he coming? He will give us pretty things."</p>
<p>"Yes, but my little Elsie must stay here so that Papa will know where to find her, and she must be a good little girl."</p>
<p>"Does Papa know where to find me? Can he find his way through those big hills?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Dudie told Papa where to find Elsie, and Elsie will be good."</p>
<p>"Oh I so good; won't you, Kitty? We will watch for him. Will he come to-night?"</p>
<p>"No, not to-night."</p>
<p>"To-morrow, then?"</p>
<p>"No, darling, nor to-morrow, nor the next day, nor next week,--but he will come."</p>
<p>The joy died out of Elsie's face; the tears flowed from her eyes as she said:</p>
<p>"Perhaps I and Kitty will be gone to Grandma in heaven before that long time."</p>
<p>"It won't be long. Papa will be here this summer, when the leaves are on the trees."</p>
<p>"Won't Mamma be glad?"</p>
<pb n="100     DELUSIVE HOPES."/>
<p>"You must not tell Mamma," said Julian, fearful lest he had been indiscreet.</p>
<p>If Silvertung should learn of Lascelle's expected arrival, Elsie would certainly never see her father.</p>
<p>"No, my pet, don't tell Mamma, nor Oreana, nor anyone; we must surprise them."</p>
<p>"Will they be gladder, if we surprise them?"</p>
<p>"Ever so much gladder."</p>
<p>"But Kitty knows."</p>
<p>"You may talk about it with Kitty only in a whisper."</p>
<p>"Like this," said Elsie, whispering softly.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear; and you will promise me to be good?"</p>
<p>"Ever so good! Won't we, Kitty? And we watch for Papa--"</p>
<p>"When the leaves come?"</p>
<p>"Kitty, the leaves will bring Papa."</p>
<p>Julian took Elsie to her mother, and then hastened to the Delvilles, anxious to efface the bad impression he had made in the morning.</p>
<p>He found Oreana joyously excited: her favorite exhortations and denunciatory texts seemed forgotten ; she smiled like her old self. Julian rejoiced.</p>
<p>Little did he suspect the real cause of the change.</p>
<p>They spent a pleasant evening, discussing the president's visit and plans for the future.</p>
<p>Julian hinted at their marriage, and Oreana did not repel him, as usual.</p>
<p>He was elated--overjoyed.</p>
<p>"Cousin Lucy, it will all come right yet."</p>
<p>"God grant it may, Julian."</p>
<p>A sigh accompanied the prayer. Her woman's intuition had rightly read the secret of the change.
<pb n="DELUSIVE HOPES.     101"/>

Julian was too happy to go to his lonely room and forget his bliss in sleep. He lingered outside the Delville house, watching for a shadow on the blind.</p>
<p>Oreana also seemed restless. He saw her pass and repass, as she walked back and forth. At last she approached the window, the blind went up, and Oreana looked out into the night.</p>
<p>Her head rested against one of the panes as if it craved support. The dreamy rapture in her eyes lent a new charm to her beautiful face. A smile parted her lips; they moved slowly, softly, as if uttering sweet words of love. Her arms were slightly out-stretched, and hands loosely clasped, saying, in their mute language, "Come, I am conquered."</p>
<p>The priestess had vanished, the woman only was there, wooing Eros from his home in the stars, opening her heart to give him welcome.</p>
<p>But alas for Oreana, it was not rose-wreathed, myrtle-crowned Eros, that she clasped to her bosom, but Anteros, "brow-bound" with cypress,--Anteros of the poison-tipped spear.</p>
<p>Julian saw her lips move. "She thinks of me," he whispered.</p>
<p>Alas! the words her lips murmured would have pierced his soul, could he have heard them.</p>
<p>She was adoring her idol, and pitying Julian, her true lover.</p>
<pb n="102 THE INITIATION OF THE DANITES."/>

CHAPTER XXI.

THE INITIATION OF THE DANITES.

<p>THE sun shone brilliantly, the air vibrated with sounds of life, the streets were full of busy people, when a number of influential Zioniites directed their steps towards the Temple block. They laughed and talked among themselves and with the friends they met as if nothing unusual occupied their minds.</p>
<p>They entered the building called the Endowment House, the entrance of which resembled an ordinary bathing establishment more than a sacred temple. Those admitted spoke of making their toilette; and they disappeared behind the curtained        partitions.</p>
<p>There was a noise of splashing water; then in a few minutes they emerged looking very much as if an earthquake had      surprised them in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>A white, tunic-shaped garment covered the body and descended a little below the knee, white trousers, <hi rend="italic">&acute; la T1rque<hi> (but these evidently were considered a luxury, as several were without them), and a white head-dress--a something between a night-cap and a baker's cap.</p>
<p>Such were the Endowment robes, made according to millennial fashions.</p>
<p>They entered a dimly-lighted, long room, its farthest side screened by a crimson curtain. Before this curtain sat the   chief and the "twelve."</p>
<p>The white-robed ranged themselves in a semi-circle.</p>
<pb n="THE INITIATION      103"/>

<p>One of the twelve arose, and stretching forth his hands, said: "Welcome, brethren. Are ye ready to receive a new        covenant from the Lord?"</p>
<p>"We are."</p>
<p>"Will you take the oath commanded by the Lord?"</p>
<p>"We will."</p>
<p>"Then bow your heads in reverence; hearken to the oath commanded by God."</p>
<p>They bowed their heads, and a voice strange to their ears uttered the awful command:</p>
<p>"Thus saith the Lord: 'Even as I made a covenant of everlasting priesthood with Phineas because he slew his brother     Israelite, who had transgressed the law, even so will I make a covenant with you, my servants, if ye will swear to do my   will."</p>
<p>The white-robed answered: "We swear."</p>
<p>"Those that I command you to destroy, ye shall destroy; even as Nephi killed Laban, even so shall ye destroy them."</p>
<p>"We swear to destroy them."</p>
<p>"Even though they be of thine own blood or kindred, yet must ye destroy them, that their souls may be purified in their blood."</p>
<p>"We swear."</p>
<p>"The transgressors of the law shalt thou destroy; even as Phineas slew Zimri, even so shall ye slay them."</p>
<p>"We will slay them."</p>
<p>"The children of Baal who putteth to death my saints, them shall ye exterminate, men, women, and children, even as the  Israelites exterminated the Amalekites and the Canaanites; so shall they perish by your hands, and their riches ye shall   divide among you. But they shall perish."</p>
<pb n="104     OF THE DANITES."/>

<p>"They shall perish."</p>
<p>"And this shall be no murder. The shedding of innocent blood only maketh murder; but the slaying of the ungodly is as   incense in my sight.</p>
<p>"And the word murder shall not be named among ye as servants of the Lord; neither shall ye reveal secrets of this my    covenant, or your place will be no more upon earth nor in my kingdom.</p>
<p>"And in the night shall ye do this thing; your faces hidden, that the wicked may not lay snares for ye. And if,         according to this my law, you shed blood without command, and that blood be not innocent blood, ye shall make an offering  of thy goods to my church, and I will accept the offering, and ye shall be clean; no sin will be found with you.</p>
<p>"And now let each one of the servants that I have chosen, take an oath that he will observe these, my commands. Let my  servant whom I have placed over my people, record the oath, and I will receive it. Woe be unto him who shall break this my covenant: upon him will I visit my vengeance: upon him, and upon his children: but to them who observe my law and do my    will, will I give the fruits of the earth, and wives; and his children shall be numerous as the sands of the sea, and his  throne shall be exalted above the sons of men."</p>
<p>A few minutes' silence followed, then the chief spoke. His voice trembled as with emotion.</p>
<p>"This is a great and mighty covenant the Lord makes with us. Let each one think over these words, and these commands.   The work must be done, and we will do it; and the proud nations of the earth shall tremble. Our knives shall avenge our    dead." "Amen,"
<pb n="THE INITIATION OF THE DANITES.     105"/>

responded the white-robed. "And now, brethren, you shall witness my oath: then I will witness yours."</p>
<p>The oaths were taken. Then officers were chosen; the Man of the Mountain being elected grand chief.</p>
<p>This business done, they consulted upon the best means of preserving the secrecy enjoined by the covenant.</p>
<p>It was not such a difficult matter. Two phrases were sufficient to express their designs: "To assure one's salvation."  "The Indians." "Over the rim of the basin."</p>
<p>"'Tis well, brethren: we will pray to our Master and then depart to our duties." The initiated knelt in prayer. Suddenlya rolling noise was heard like distant thunder.  It came nearer. Currents of air rushed through the room, then the curtain was rent, and in the midst of flashinglight stood a transfigured form, a flaming sword in its hand.</p>
<p>"Lo, it is the angel of the Lord!"</p>
<p>"It is our prophet, Joseph Smith!"</p>
<p>The form waved the sword, as if to command silence,--then a voice like a silvery echo cried out:</p>
<p>"Destroying Angels ye shall be, scattering the wicked before my face.</p>
<p>"Ye shall be called Danites; for the tribe of Dan was a lion's whelp.</p>
<p>"And your watch-word shall be, 'Our swords are ready, our arms are strong.'</p>
<p>"The ungodly shall perish."</p>
<p>The vision vanished. The Danites were ready for work.</p>

CHAPTER XXII. 

JULIAN LEARNS HIS FATE.

<p>THERE is a cruel kindness that showers favors upon a victim, simply because he is doomed.   Such was the kindness that
Oreana showed her lover.</p>
<p>Julian forced himself to please her, and matters went smoothly; although the terrors of the Reform increased.</p>
<p>But the smoothness concealed much inquietude, sorrow and weariness. It was a painful probation for Julian. His          impatience to get away prevented him from taking an interest in Mr. Delville's schemes, and the role of devout proselyte hehad assumed to win back Oreana was most repugnant to his feelings.</p>
<p>Nature had not fashioned him for a hypocrite. Just indignation often threatened to spoil all; but love gave him strengthto control the impulses of his nature. He delighted Oreana by receiving baptism for the salvation of her father,           grandfather, and great-uncles. He flattered her by listening to her explanations of the Mormon principles. Yet he seemed as
far off as ever from winning her. Oreana was kind; but her kindness forbade love's expression. She received him graciously,but a private talk was an impossibility.</p>
<p>But the worst trial was the constant attendance of the chief upon Oreana.</p>
<p>The great man joked with Mr. Delville, courted Oreana, and patronized Julian; for all which Julian cordially detested   him.</p>

<p>Our hero found the society of the Saints very irksome. Their coarse jokes, their brutal conduct, their avaricious dreams, disgusted him. If such constituted patriarchal simplicity he preferred modern civilization.</p>
<p>Time pressed. The party who wished to escape became anxious. It was necessary to bring matters to a crisis.</p>
<p>Julian tried to see Oreana alone; but chance was against him; and the young lady adroitly excused herself each time he  asked for a private interview.</p>
<p>One day he caught her walking alone by the creek. The opportunity so long sought had come at last. He hastened to her   side and took her hand.</p>
<p>"Oreana, at length I can speak to you. Nay, you must listen" (as she tried to give the conversation a turn), "neither   will I let you go till my story is told."</p>
<p>Oreana's cheek flushed with mingled feelings of guilt and anger: then it paled; for she knew how this conversation must end, and she pitied Julian. Perhaps she might yet defer the fatal blow.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, Oreana, if I appear rude; desperation makes me so. But you know it arises not from want of love. I have    assured you of that by proofs more powerful than words. For your sake I am here. But you know all, darling. I have not cometo speak of this, but to decide our future. Let us come to the point. Upon what day this week will you fulfill your promiseto be my wife?"</p>
<p>"This is very sudden, Julian!"</p>
<p>"Sudden! when we ought to have been married nearly a year ago!"</p>
<p>"But--"</p>
<p>"There are no buts. You promised that when we
<pb n="108     JULIAN LEARNS HIS FATE."/>

reached Zion we should be united. We have been here now three months, and you hesitate. Surely you have not ceased to love me."</p>
<p>"Julian, you talk too much of love. Saints marry from principle."</p>
<p>"Principle! Oreana, have a care; some day perhaps you will repent these words." (Sorrow made Julian prophetic.) "But    come, love, let us not evade the question, or trifle with it. What day shall it be?,This is Tuesday; suppose, then, we say Thursday."</p>
<p>"I must consult the President."</p>
<p>"What in heaven's name for? What has he to do with us?"</p>
<p>"He is our chief. Through him God speaks."</p>
<p>"Say rather, the devil."</p>
<p>"Julian,I won't stand this insult. Brigham Young is a second Moses."</p>
<p>"He is a first-class fraud."</p>
<p>"How dare you speak so? Let me go, sir."</p>
<p>"Forgive me, darling, forgive me. I did not mean to offend. If I did, it was through madness,--the madness of love. My  life depends upon you; not only my life, but others more precious than mine. Think of your mother, widowed, broken-hearted,and lonely; think of mine."</p>
<p>Oreana's lips quivered--yet she answered, calmly:</p>
<p>"And what difference will it make to them whether I marry you or not?"</p>
<p>"Why I every difference; it would restore you to them."</p>
<p>"Restore me to them! I begin to think you are really mad."</p>
<pb n="JULIAN LEARNS HIS FATE.     109"/>

<p>"Mad with grief because you frown. O, my love, my queen, have pity upon me."</p>
<p>"Julian, don't make a scene. I hate scenes; and here we are in the street.",/p>
<p>"Where else can I speak with you? The trees and the brook are our only witnesses. For God's sake torture me no longer.  Oreana, do not trifle with me--answer. Shall we be married on Thursday?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then, upon what other day?"</p>
<p>"Upon no other."</p>
<p>"No other! Do I hear aright?"</p>
<p>"Julian, we are not fitted for each other. My husband must be a king, a god among men. Now, I have told you the truth.  It has pained me exceedingly; but it was my duty. I must go. Brother Brigham will be awaiting me."</p>
<p>But Julian was really desperate. The strain of the last few weeks had weakened and irritated him; and now the           annihilation of all his hopes goaded him to frenzy. Prudence, his promise of secrecy, were alike forgotten. His grasp on   Oreana tightened.</p>
<p>"No. I will not let you go to that impostor--to that brother of the Father of Lies. You shall not stay in this infamous place. I will carry you off. I will save you or die. Ah! you need not laugh. You laugh, but it is all planned; next week weleave for California. Then from California, home!</p>
<p>"A determined will can overcome all obstacles. We must, we will get away from this blood-stained polygamy. For honor's  sake, for virtue's sake, leave this place and come with us. It is a pleasant route, summer is before us, and if my presenceannoys you
<pb n="110     JULIAN LEARNS HIS FATE."/>

I will go another way or at some other time. There are two women of the party. Come, leave this city of iniquity."</p>
<p>"Hush! I will hear you no more. You are blaspheming; you are an apostate, a renegade--crimes that can only be effaced inyour blood. You would leave Zion, leave the Saints. I renounce you!" With a vigorous effort she threw off his hand.</p>
<p>"Oreana, hear me I hear me!" But Julian spoke to vacancy. Oreana was gone.</p>
<p>In spite of herself the girl was troubled. Julian's entreaties found an echo in voices she thought were forever stilled.Her good angel whispered to her. Will she listen and be saved? Tears glistened in her eyes. Tears are of good omen.</p>
<p>She reached her house.</p>
<p>"My dear child, what is the matter?"</p>
<p>At the sound of that voice, at the touch of hand, her struggle ceased. Parents, home, devotion fade from her mind. Her  gardian spirit flies away affrighted.</p>
<p>"My dear Oreana, tell me all that troubles you,--all. What troubles you, pains me."</p>
<p>Oreana could not resist the will of her idol. She told him all: Julian's love for her, his detestation of the creed, theplanned escape.</p>
<p>Quietly the man listened, his head turned away, so that she should not ee the cruel smile that gave to the prophet's    countenance a very tigerish resemblance.</p>
<p>When she bad finished, he exclaimed, in pathetic tone:</p>
<p>"It is this that saddens me: so many apostates, so many lost, eternally lost."</p>
<pb n="JULIAN LEARNS HIS FATE.     111"/>

<p>"But does not God say that blood is an atonement for sin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, God be praised! He permitteth an atonement. He forces me to preach it; but yet we shrink."</p>
<p>"Shrink! Do you also shrink?"</p>
<p>"Would you not do so? Take, for example, Julian, would you not do everything to save his life?"</p>
<p>"Not if his blood would atone for his sin, I would even give the blow, if God willed. What is this life compared to     eternity? If blood effaces sin, let it flow. Does a mother hesitate at any operation that will save her child?  No! Shall  Saints see those they love link into perdition and make no effort to save?"</p>
<p>Oreana uttered these words in a frenzy, her tall form straightened to its fullest height, her head thrown back, her eyesglowing, and her arms uplifted. She looked a pythoness. Her attitude brought out every beauty of her person. The chief     gazed enraptured.</p>
<p>"God does not will you to do it, my brave, my beautiful one. But He accepts your noble devotion. He chooses you as a    priestess, a queen. Be my bride, lovely Oreana. I will make you a sovereign queen, a goddess, in the celestial kingdom, andhere upon earth you shall be the star of my life, my aid, my inspiration."</p>
<p>"Your bride, your inspiration," faltered Oreana.</p>
<p>"Even so. You are my queen, chosen by the Lord. Did he not reveal to me your face in a vision? Come, my beloved one.    Come."</p>
<p>The lord of her will called her, she was powerless to resist.</p>
<p>Trembling with emotions of joy and awe, she placed her hand in his.</p>
<pb n="112     JULIAN LEARNS HIS FATE."/>

<p>Did no thought of the many wives in his harem make her recoil? No. She thought only of the deified chief, whose         sovereign queen she was to be.</p>
<p>"Oreana, you consent."</p>
<p>A glance, a whispered yes. His arms embraced her, his kisses are on her lips. Oreana is lost. Lost to honor, lost to    happiness, save it be the fevered exaltation that now intoxicates her.</p>
<p>A step is heard at the gate. Oreana recognizes it.</p>
<p>Julian must not enter now. She hastens out to meet him before he reaches the door. The young man has sobs in his voice. </p>
<p>"Oreana, do not be angry. Reflect before you refuse. I will give you a week. Then we shall be ready, and you will come."</p>
<p>"Never, Julian. I cannot, will not, be your wife: neither will I go with you."</p>
<p>The emphasis of her manner startled him. Looking keenly at her, he thought he perceived a deeper agitation. Just then   Mr. Delville came up, and, with a hurried good-day, passed in.</p>
<p>The open door revealed the chief.</p>
<p>Julian looked from the man to the girl, whose face was now crimson. A sudden light broke in upon him. Approaching       Oreana, he placed his hands upon her shoulders, agony written on his face:</p>
<p>"My God! Oreana, speak. It is not true--it can't be."</p>
<p>Slowly she lifted her eyes to his. The blushes were gone now, and her gaze was steady.</p>
<p>"It is true. I shall be his wife, a queen in Heaven."</p>
<p>The blow was struck. Julian reeled. He rested a
<pb n="BROKEN HEARTS.     113"/>

moment on the gate to recover strength. He heard the door shut. Oreana was gone--gone from him forever.</p>

CHAPTER XXIII.

BROKEN HEARTS.

<p>FROM the time Julian left Oreana at the gate, he wandered about bewildered, neither knowing nor caring whither. Wearied with fatigue, he at length sought his room, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The morning's light brought comfort. The events of the previous afternoon seemed like a hideous dream. It could not be  true that the pure, lofty-minded Oreana would consent to become No. 11 in the harem of this Mohammed of the Desert.</p>
<p>It must be some horrible phantasm of his brain.</p>
<p>He would revisit the Delvilles. He started out with this purpose; but he had not gone far when he met Mrs. Delville.    Julian sighed, she looked so thin and ill; her eyes, too, were red with weeping.</p>
<p>"0, Julian," she cried, "take me somewhere, where I can have a good cry; my heart is bursting. I didn't think I could   ever feel so again."</p>
<p>Julian took her to his lodging.</p>
<p>"Cousin Lucy, what is the matter?"</p>
<p>"It is killing me, Julian: I wish I were dead. Why did we ever come to this horrible place? My beautiful home gone, goneforever. But that isn't all. Tomorrow,--oh dear! if I only could die. Kill me, Julian, if you love me. Robert is going to  take another
<pb n="114     BROKEN HEARTS."/>

wife to-morrow, and they say I must go and give her to him. It will break my heart. After all the years we have lived      together so happily. What a disgrace for my Stanly. Would to God I had died with my Lizzie! My heart feels heavy enough to sink me to the bottom of the lake. The teachers tell me it is because I am unregenerate; but I can't help it. And you, too,my dear boy, it is hard for you. How can Oreana do it?"</p>
<p>Julian gasped. It was true, then. Should he let the infamy be spoken? Yes, he must hear it, even if the hearing of it   should kill him. Perhaps it was not true after all: it might be of Oreana's refusal that Mrs. D--was thinking.</p>
<p>"Do what, Couain Lucy?"</p>
<p>"Why, she has promised to marry the great priest, who has a dozen wives. Is it not horrible?"</p>
<p>Drops of agony stood on Julian's brow. Alas it was then all true.</p>
<p>Cousin Luey, can we not save her from this infamy? Will you not help? We might carry her off. I had planned to leave    next week."</p>
<p>"Carry her off! Why, you are mad to think of such a thing. Look at those mountains that hem us in. Think of that band   who have sworn to kill apostates. Robert is one. Oh, God! that I have lived. No, we must submit till we die,--we women. As for the men, they seem to like it. No doubt you will comfort yourself for Oreana's loss with four or five wives."</p>
<p>Julian answered with such a look of scorn and anguish that Mrs. Delvill cried out:</p>
<p>"Oh, dear I don't look at me like that. I'm wild to talk that way of you, Julian. But just look at my Robert. I have    sworn upon his goodness,--see what
<pb n="BROKEN HEARTS.     115"/>

he is going to do. Pray to the Lord to take me. I bless Him that He took my Lizzie."</p>
<p>The wretched woman wept and moaned. Julian could not comfort her. Perhaps tears were her best consolation.</p>
<p>When she left, she begged Julian not to go to the house that day. But Julian was restless. He could not stay in his room. He wandered out and made his way mechanically to the Delvilles.</p>
<p>Mr. Delville was at the gate. He met Julian, took his arm, and led him into the garden.</p>
<p>As they passed the window, Julian saw his rival paying court to Oreana.</p>
<p>At the sight he clenched his hands: his blood boiled with rage.</p>
<p>"Be calm, be calm, Brother Julian," said Mr. Delville. "It is concerning this little matter that I wish to talk with you. It is pretty rough on you just now, but is a fine thing for Rena; in fact, it is a jolly good thing for all of us. I     expect she will be the favorite, and good chances will be ours even without the asking; good thing, you know. Now don't    look so glum; there are plenty of pretty girls here, and one woman is as good as another; their beauty don't last, you know. But the jolly thing is that here you can always keep the article fresh. Those are the very words of the president.       To-morrow I'm going to try it. Fine stunning girl Old lady feels rather blue about it: but she will soon get used to it.   The word of God must be obeyed; and as for you, I will find you two nice wives to make up for Oreana. There, now, don't    look so murderous."</p>
<p>In truth Julia did look dangerous; indignation
<pb n="116     BROKEN HEARTS."/>

and horror gleamed from his eyes and distorted his features. He shook off Mr. Delville's hand, as if contagion were in the touch, recoiled a few paces, then, in a burst of passion exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Great God! have I lived to hear such blasphemies from the lips of a man, a loyal, God-fearing, Anglo-Saxon, a husband, a father. 0! thrice-accursed creed, whose teachings thus destroy humanity! thrice-accursed place, whose influence changes  men to beasts! Ah! you wince. Have I struck the right chord? Robert Delville, leave these crazy people; flee from this     infamous place before these horrible ideas become living acts; leave it before your wife dies, crushed by your hand; leave it before Oreana is dishonored, and I become a murderer, for think you I will calmly yield her to that demon of lust? She, the star of my life! See, here is her picture. It has lain next my heart for many a year, sacred as an angel's, reverenced
as an image of all that is purest and holiest in womanhood; it has been my shield in temptation, my inspiration in virtue. Can I cast it from me now? Can I stand meekly by and see my love the victim of that tigerish, blasphemous, polygamous hypocrite, to whom women are no more than cows? No! I have sworn to save her, and I will do it if I have to wade through blood. My wealth, my strength, my life, I consecrate to that purpose; so help me the All-powerful God."</p>
<p>Julian walked rapidly away. Mr. Delville stood motionless, dazed apparently by what he had heard. He did not move even when the chief came out. The latter had heard, perforce, Julian's denunciations and oath, which had somewhat disturbed his wooing; for the exalted passion of the young lover made the stereo-
<pb n="THE TIGER AWAKENED.     117"/>

typed phrases of the old polygamist appear vapid indeed. He felt this, and his usual mask of saintly patience failed to conceal the looks of sinister malice he gave the retreating form of his rival.</p>
<p>"Brother Delville, that young man is in a bad way. If he repent not, the vengeance of God will consume him in the midst of his days. It is not fit that an enemy of God, an apostate, should carry about him the picture of our beautiful Oreana. If you would do me a favor get it from him without delay."</p>
<p>The chief drove off. Mr. Delville bowed in answer; he still remained as if rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>"That young relation of yours will dance over the rim of the basin, if he doesn't take care, eh? Brother Delville," remarked a neighbor, who had witnessed the scene. The words seemed to recall Mr. Delville to life. He repeated the words, "Over the rim of the basin," laughed loud, then began to walk up and down the lot, humming and singing, the burden of his song ever the same: "Over the rim of the basin."</p>

CHAPTER XXIV.

THE TIGER AWAKENED.

<p>THE doctrine of blood atonement caused a terrible struggle in Mr. Delville's mind. At first he recoiled in horror. "He to take life?" "Never!" But the idea was too ghastly to be dismissed at will; it pursued him--fascinated him.</p>
<p>He pondered over it, contemplated it, until the
<pb n="118     THE TIGER AWAKENED."/>

phantasm became tangible. Its presence flashed lurid light into the lowest depths of his nature: instincts hitherto undreamed of awoke and cried out: "Blood! blood!" The man trembled at himself.</p>
<p>Then came his election to the ranks of the Destroying Angels, his oath to destroy the enemies of God, and the horror changed to mad enthusiasm. In imagination he re-enacted the Israelitish drama of extermination, he reveled in carnage, gory visions haunted his brain. He grew moody, restless, possessed with the desire to see the crimson life-stream flow. Beauty inflamed his secret madness. The sight of Oreana’s throat, so round, full, and white, distracted him. He could scarcely restrain his hand from drawing a knife across it, that he might see the ruby drops gush forth. But there were moments when the vivid ghastliness appalled him, when he started back, affrighted, from his thoughts. He tried to throw off this nightmare; he devoted himself to business—to pleasure. He resolved to take other wives. Alas, for the resolve! The sacrifice of his honor, the profanation of his home, deadened still more of his conscience. Daily the man grew weaker, the brute stronger. The savage animal nature, underlying humanity, that society has chained and the harmonies of civilization have lulled to sleep, was fully aroused. It shook itself free of its chains, and turned upon its master.</p>
<p>Julian's manly protest overpowered, for a moment, Delville's coarser nature. The little manhood still remaining bowed in shame before Julian’s nobility; but animality quickly recovered strength, and the words, <hi rend=”italic">"Over the rim of the basin,"</hi> reawakened his savage desires. He went into the house and began to
<pb n="THE FIRST VICTIM.     119"/>

examine his stock of knives and razors. His son Stanly went to him with a request, but the child spoke to deaf ears.</p>
<p>"I can't think," said the boy, "what has come over father; he scarcely notices me, and talks all the time about killing and marrying. Mother, what is the matter with him?"</p>

CHAPTER XXV.

THE FIRST VICTIM.

<p>"LOST, lost!" groaned Julian, as he hurried from Delville's hateful presence, "lost to honor--to manhood, and I--Oreana,will you force me to crime?" He stopped, aghast, at the dark abyss yawning at his feet, he saw nothing save its gloomy depths--heard nothing but Oreana's voice dooming him to its horrors.</p>
<p>A touch upon his arm recalled him to the outer world. He looked down and saw Elsie.</p>
<p>"Dudie, can't you hear? I called you ever, ever so much."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Julian, mechanically.<p/>
<p>"I've been so good, Dudie, but Papa doesn't come. Kitty and I watch for him all the time. The leaves are coming. Where'sPapa? If he don't come, I and Kitty will run away."</p>
<p>"We will all run away, Elsie."</p>
<p>"O will you, Dudie, and take me--take me to Papa? Dudie, isn't a basin what you put water into?"</p>
<pb n="120     THE FIRST VICTIM."/>

<p>"What a queer question. Yes, water is put into a basin. Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"That wicked preather man said some day you will go into a basin."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Preather man said he'd put you into a basin; but he than't, he can't--can he? Mamma's calling me. Kiss me, Dudie. Don'tforget to take me to Papa if he don't come."</p>
<p>Elsie was gone. Julian repeated her strange words.</p>
<p>What could they mean? Danger, death--anything was possible in that isolated city. Dazed, bewildered, he walked on, on, from street to street, out towards the mountains. He must walk or go mad.</p>
<p>For a day or two heavy clouds had obscured the sunlight, and the weather-wise prophesied snow. Snow in Spring! The delicate blossoms shivered. To them snow was death, but Julian hailed the storm with delight. The discord of the elements found an echo in his heart. For once, an echo in his own heart. For once, nature sympathized with human woe.</p>
<p>At sundown the snow began to fall, silently, swiftly, enshrouding the beautiful blossoms with a weird vindictiveness as if it envied them their happiness.</p>
<p>The Zionites hastened to their homes, fastened tightly doors and windows, so as to shut out the timely visitor. The citywas silent as a city of the dead. At its best, Zion was a solitude. A few thousand occupied an area as great as that of some mighty city.</p>
<p>The rough adobe houses embosomed in trees with their gardens, orchards, and fields, resembled small farms rather than town dwellings; and to complete
<pb n="THE FIRST VICTIM.     121"/>

the isolation, sime of the houses were screened by a dismal wall. Lonely, indeed, were the wide streets; and Julian shuddered as he traversed their long dreary stretch that no lamp brightened: whose stillness was unbroken by aught living. A prey to anguish, Julian had wandered mechanically without heed or care: suddenly he stopped bewildered.Where was he? On his lefttowered the trees, a spectral file; on his right, a dead wall. A shroud of snow enveloped all. An indefinable terror unnerved him: he tried to hasten, but his trembling limbs refused to obey his will.</p>
<p>Across the road a light glimmered through a window. It was an unsteady light, and moved restlessly about the house. Julian watched it nervously. Stories of "will o' the wisp, and goblin lights," forgotten nursery lore, flashed across his mind,and with the childish legends, came thoughts of Mother and of Home.</p>
<p>Tears fell from Julian's eyes--tears, not of weakness, but of power, the power of pure affection.</p>
<p>The flickering flame seemed more ghostly than the cold gleam of the snow, or the murky darkness; yet it drew him on, on.A dark shadow crept over the snow. A glittering something pierced the air.  A stifled moan,--a dull thud. Juilian's vow to save his love, or die, was accomplished. He was dead.</p>

<p>The chief holds in his hands the medallion picture of Oreana, which Delville has delivered unto him. A dark stain dims the brightness of the setting; but that renders it all the more precious. The chief contemplates it admiringly. "A very beautiful woman,
<pb n="122     THE FIRST VICTIM."/>

Delville, very beautiful. How does she feel about this young man whom the Lord has cut down in the midst of his days?"</p>
<p>"She thinks it a divine interposition. His apostasy had troubled her very much, but now she thinks he is saved. I hope he is."</p>
<p>"The ways of the Lord are inscrutable, His judgments just, and His mercy great. May this young man's fate be a warning to those who would deny the Lord's covenant. But let us speak of more cheerful subjects. Oreana is to be sealed to me next week, and as I wish to honor my wife's relations, I will give you the prettiest girl in Zion. Does that suit you, eh? Silvertung wants her: but you deserve the preference. You have shown yourself a zealous son of the church, and the Lord will bless you with abundance, and clothe you with honor. Prepare yourself to receive bishop's orders,--and this pretty girl shall be sealed to you with the other one of your choice. The more the merrier."
<p>After the sealing Delville met Silvertung. "Got a-head of you this time, Brother Silvertung. None but the brave--you know the rest;" and Delville pointed to the blushing beauty leaning upon his arm.</p>
<p>Silvertung smiled in reply. If Delville had been less obtuse, that smile would have greatly disturbed his bliss.</p>
<pb n="THE CARAVAN.     123"/>

CHAPTER XXVI.

THE CARAVAN.

<p>ONE bright evening in August, 1857, a goodly caravan of Arkansas families bound for the Golden State descended the low hills to the north-east of the city of Zion.</p>
<p>It was a goodly sight, that rich, well-equipped train of stout-hearted, well-to-do colonists, taking civilization to thesummer land of the west.</p>
<p>First, drawn by strong-limbed horses, came comfortable, covered vehicles, which might be termed the family wagons, for in them sat the mothers, surrounded by their children, whose bright faces peered out eager and jubilant.  Here and there a pet kitten nestled in the arms of its child-mistress; merry dogs gamboled around the horses, or leaped up to kiss baby hands, and in one of the wagons hung a bird cage, whence issued sweet notes and trills that filled the air with melody.</p>
<p>These wagons also carried the clothing, camping necessaries and provisions required for daily use. Nothing was wanting, for the leaders knew well what was needful for the comfort of the travelers, and the emigrants fortunately possessed the means to procure those comforts.</p>
<p>After the family wagons came others, larger and stronger, drawn by long teams of sturdy oxen and laden with household goods, implements, and provisions for the future use of the colony.</p>
<p>Then followed some hundred head of cattle, kept from straying by trained dogs.</p>
<pb n="124      THE CARAVAN."/>

<p>Horsemen galloped to and fro to maintain order. Youths and maidens walked along talking and laughing. Some couples absorbed in their own happiness sauntered behind the train.</p>
<p>All were happy! Ambitious youth dreamed golden dreams; men builded golden castles, and women wove chaplets of golden immortelles wherewith to crown their loved ones.</p>
<p>The captain of the band reined in his horse and gave a loud hurrah, then, pointing towards Zion, he said:</p>
<p>"Thank God, my friends, we are once more among our fellow men."</p>
<p>"Only they are Mormons, Cap."</p>
<p>"What does it matter? They are white men, their language is ours, they have been emigrants as we are now. A threefold tie binds us to them. It makes my heart glad to see that blue smoke curling up into the air; for it comes from a white man's home-like kitchen, not from the wigwam of a painted savage. Once more, hurrah!"</p>
<p>Men; women and children took up the cheer, the horses neighed, the dogs danced and barked, the bird carolled forth his gayest song.</p>
<p>But there was one whose voice did not shout hurrah,--one, whose brow grew dark at the sight of Zion,--a man who traveledwith the train, but who was not one of them,--a moody, brooding man, whom they called "Stranger." The active youthful mindsof the train, had imagined many a romance, having for its hero that gray-haired, care-worn man, aged by sorrrow. But the stranger was reticent. He was going to Zion for his child; that was all they knew.</p>
<pb n= "THE CARAVAN.     125"/>

<p>"Hi, Stranger, don't hurry off like that; stop for supper. There'll be plenty o' time to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain, but I must go on," replied the strange man, hastily striding on even as he spoke.</p>
<p>Did he see a little face growing sad and pale watching for his coming? Did he hear a child's voice wearily sighing, "Theleaves came long ago, and Papa's not here."</p>
<p>"And now, friends, to supper."</p>
<p>A hundred voices shouted, supper! At the word, Hero, Capt. Fancher's dog, started to make his evening tour of inspection, for Hero was the guardian in chief, the head sentinel of the train; eye and ear ever watchful, he kept a strict lookout, and never was known to give a false alarm.</p>
<p>Supper was a very important event in the lives of the emigrants, and soon all hands were busy. The men attended to the horses and cattle, milked the cows, and ranged the wagons, the boys gathered fuel, or fetched water from the creek. Some of the girls improvised tables upon which to spread the viands, others brought from the wagons coffee-pots, gridirons, baking pans, and waited upon the neat housewives who skillfully prepared the evening meal. A dozen fires flamed upon the hill-side. Snowy biscuits, baked in ovens hidden under the coals, huge, juicy beefsteaks broiled upon the gridirons, long, skewered rolls composed of layers of rabbit and bacon, roasted themselves to a turn on cunningly-devised spits, savory stews simmered in their bright pans, potatoes steamed into flakey balls or fried into crispy golden brown morsels, fragrant coffee emitted streams of vapor, and pails of milk, frothy and warm, stood temptingly around. The

air was redolent with appetizing odors, most grateful to the hungry travelers.</p>
<p>After supper our travelers turned their attention to the infant city, with its tree-fringed streets and rural dwellings.It all seemed so quiet and peaceful that the emigrants declared it was rightly called Zion.</p>
<p>Ah! little did they dream that in that city madness reigned supreme, that the homes they so much admired were the abodes of terror, of crimes born of fanaticism,--that brother there feared brother, parents dreaded their children, and children their parents, that the destroying angels were ever on the wing with swords unsheathed ready to immolate victims. The air was heavy with woe. Could it have uttered its terrible secrets society would have risen in horror; but the wind floated by and spoke not, the sun shone with unvailed radiance, the mountains trembled not, for nature works out her laws, heedless of the misery of the ephemeral being--man.</p>
<p>But no such thoughts marred the happiness of the emigrants. Gaily they chatted about present pleasures and future projects, Utopian, as are all the visions that allure man to distant wilds. A fierce growl from Hero interrupted their conversation. Looking around, they saw a Zionite approaching the camp. It was Robert Delville, anxious to learn the condition and in
tentions of this colony, whose rich equipment had excited Mormondom.</p>
<p>The emigrants were only too happy to have an attentive stranger to talk with, and Mr. Delville was soon acquainted with their history, condition and projects. Perhaps there was a little boastfulness in their manner when they emphatically declared:</p>
<pb n="THE CARAVAN.     127"/>

<p>We ain't no needy adventurers, but honest folks from Arkansas going to California to make our ever-lasting fortunes. We want to show the world how this emigration business should be done. Just look at our train; nothing wanting there. Our flour and corn are getting rather low, for we didn't want to burden ourselves extra when we knew we could lay in a stock here in your country. That will make business lively for you, eh, stranger? But now, ain't we well fixed? Did you ever see anything completer?"</p>
<p>Delville gazed upon the heavily-laden wagons, upon the cattle and horses, as if he had never seen anything finer. He noted the comfortable appearance of the travelers, and their air of calm assurance which the sense of plenty gives. He compared the luxuries of these Gentiles with the poverty of the Saints, and his soul filled with wrath. Should this thing be? Should the children of Baal exult over the children of God? Should those revel in riches while these starved? Of what avail wasthe birthright of the Elect, to whom God had given the earth and the fullness thereof, if hirelings could thus rob them of the gift?</p>
<p>These thoughts so tormented Delville, that he was obliged to leave the camp in order to conceal his agitation. But again and again he paused to look back upon the caravan and curse it. Slowly a project took form in his brain; a project worthy of a Danite. He hastened back to counsel with his brethren.</p>
<pb n="128      DEAD! DEAD!"/>

CHAPTER XXVII.

DEAD! DEAD! 

<p>THE Zionites, who lived in daily expectation of an invading army, were much alarmed at the approach of the Arkansas train, and the leaders, objecting to the passage of Babylonish Gentiles through their sacred dominion, exerted all their influence to increase the general alarm.</p>
<p>Rumors were circulated that these emigrants were emmissaries of the army; that among them were the murderers of the prophets. This was enough to inflame, with hate and revenge, the half-crazed people. The Saints declared it would be a heinous crime to hold any communication with the enemies of God, and all, even the children, were strictly forbidden to speak with them.</p>
<p>Two days before the caravan encamped upon the hills of Zion, Dauiite scouts brought full particulars to the priestly council, and Silvertung well knew the name of that stranger who traveled with the train. He had expected him. Elsie's confidences to Kitty had not been whispered softly enough to escape Silvertung's quick ear. But the news did not disturb his equanimity; he made his plans and waited.</p>
<p>The stranger, who was no other than Edward Lascelle, soon reached Main street. The suspicious glances of the passers-by somewhat surprised him; still more the curt, "Don't know," with which they answered his inquiries about Julian. He walked about seeking, but not obtaining, information. A store, larger and finer
<pb n="DEAD! DEAD!     129"/>

than the others, with a sign-board announcing that Robert Delville dealt in general merchandise, attracted his attention. Delville! that was the name of Oreana's relatives. He entered; a stout man received him.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me where to find Miss Brentford--Oreana Brentford?"</p>
<p>"Sister Young, she is now; and she lives in that fine house up there on the hill."</p>
<p>"And Julian Bellew?"</p>
<p>"Dead and buried."</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Did you expect him to live forever?"</p>
<p>The rough tone jarred upon Lascelle. He must hide his sorrow from this cruel jester.</p>
<p>"And Oreana is married?"</p>
<p>"The thirteenth wife of our president. She is the favorite. No wonder; magnificent girl, my cousin."</p>
<p>The look of disgust with which this news was received delighted Delville, who knew full well who his questioner was, andframed his answers accordingly.</p>
<p>"Where is Elder Silvertung?"</p>
<p>Lascelle jerked out the name as if it tortured him to utter it.</p>
<p>"His house is two blocks round the corner. Anyone will show it to you. Where the elder is just now I can't say. And, now, who are you?"</p>
<p>"My name is Lascelle."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes; I have heard Oreana speak of you,--yes,--well,--come in again,--yes, the ways of the Lord are past finding out. When he speaks, we must obey; that's whatour president says, and he is right. Yes, the Lord--"</p>
<pb n="130"/>

<p>Lascelle did not wait for the end of the phrase; he thanked Delville, and hurried out of the store. What did Delville mean by his strange, hesitating words? Julian was dead, Oreana in a harem. Had anything, more than he already knew of, happened to his Elsie? A dread suspense grew within him. He talked aloud to reassure himself.</p>
<p>"In a few minutes I shall see my Elsie; I shall clasp her in my arms. They can't hide her from me. My darling shall be saved."</p>
<p>He reached Silvertung's house. It was closed--deserted. He inquired of the neighbors, but they knew nothing. Sick with disappointment, he sought the house upon the hill.</p>
<p>Oreana was in the garden.</p>
<p>The sight of her maddened him. Her father's grave, those desolate homes, his own dishonored hearth, the dead Julian,--he saw them all, accusing her, crying but against her: and there she stood, so gloriously beautiful, calmly smiling at the misery she had wrought.  His long pent-up agony and passion burst forth; he rushed towards her, he clutched her arm.</p>
<p>"Fiend, not woman, cruel daughter, false friend, murderess, parricide, how dare you live?"</p>
<p>For the first time, perhaps, in her life, Oreana screamed; she would have fallen but for Lascelle's terrible grasp.</p>
<p>"Ah I you may well tremble. I've come for my wife and child, the wife whom you enticed to dishonor, the child you so treacheously stole from me. Where are they? Give them up. Where's the false priest? Where? I will knoW."</p>
<pb n="DEAD! DEAD!     131"/>

<p>Oreana was frightened into dumbness. She had expected Lascelle's arrival; but this, fierce man, wrinkled and gray-haired, was not the Lascelle of her memory. His conversations disturbed her slumbering conscience.  She could find no words to answer this awful accuser, before whom she quailed a thrice guilty woman.</p>
<p>"Speak, answer me. If this cursed creed has left you any spark of humanity, tell me where are my child, my lost wife?"</p>
<p>The insult to her creed nerved Oreana to action. She looked at Lascelle, and said: "Ask them of the Lord, not of me. He it is who giveth and taketh."</p>
<p>"Ask them of the Lord? What do you mean? I don't understand, can't,--are they living or--"</p>
<p>"Dead, yes, dead!" solemnly answered Oreana.</p>
<p>"Dead," repeated Lascelle dropping Oreana's arm, and retreating a few steps, "Dead--perhaps it is well,--she could not survive dishonor. But Elsie, is--"</p>
<p>"Dead. Seek them both in the grave."</p>
<p>"No, it cannot be. Elsie, my little flower!"</p>
<p>"Death loves to gather flowers. Mary prayed for you to the last, Edward, that the Lord would enlighten you to see the heroism of her conduct. She only obeyed the commands of God,--and He exalted her by celestial marriage."</p>
<p>A fierce gleam in Lascelle's eyes warned Oreana. She stopped suddenly, then added: "I have something to give you."</p>
<p>She entered the house, and soon returned with a small envelope. Inside were  bright curl, and a thick clustering ring of dark-brown hair.  Oreana gave them to Lacelle. "I cut them off for you."</p>
<pb n="132     DEAD! DEAD!"/>

<p>"Dead, dead," repeated Lascelle, mechanically. At that moment some people came into the garden. "Dead, dead," he repeated, too stunned to ask questions; then suddenly he turned upon Oreana: "It is your work! May their blood be upon your head."The next moment he was gone.</p>
<p>He staggered on his way as if drunk,--drunk with grief and misery. At length, a ray of hope illumined the darkness. Perhaps Oreana had deceived him, as she had done on that never-to-be-forgotten night, when he kissed his little ones for the last time. He stopped and looked around him; the camp was near, and a man was slowly coming from it. Although it was dusk, yet Lascelle recognized Delville.</p>
<p>Delville could tell him.</p>
<p>"Friend, you are a father, a husband?"</p>
<p>"I should say so. Two of the prettiest girls in Zion call me husband; am looking out for a third."</p>
<p>This speech grated on Lascelle. He could not bandy words with this coarse jester. He spoke sternly:</p>
<p>"Tell me, did Oreana deceive me? Are they dead?"</p>
<p>"Who are dead? Lots of people die."</p>
<p>"My little Elsie,--Elsie Lascelle and her mother."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, poor little Elsie; yes, I remember it all. Oreana's words are the wordsif the gospel. It is pretty rough on you, but become a Saint, and I'll find you plenty of wives, and children will come as a matter of course. My wife died not long ago: bless you, I didn't miss her, the others were so affectionate."
<p>"When was it?"</p>
<pb n="DEAD! DEAD!     133"/>

<p>"About two months ago. Silvertung felt awfully cut up. He is South."</p>
<p>"South, is he? Thank you. Good night."</p>
<p>Delville looked back at Lascelle, who was slowly climbing the hill to the camp.</p>
<p>"Didn't he take that bait nicely? Only let us get you down South, my fierce fellow, and you won't care much who's dead or alive."</p>
<p>Delville laughed at his joke.</p>
<p>Lascelle reached the camp. Captain Fancher and Hero were taking a last look.</p>
<p>"Captain," said Lascelle, "you go South?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I go with you. My heart is dead. I live not but for vengeance."</p>
<p>That night, while the emigrants slumbered peacefully on the hills, the destroyers plotted in the city below.</p>

*      *      *      *      *      *     *     *

<p>Early the next morning, Delville, mounted on a fleetfooted horse, took the road to the south-west, crying aloud, as he rode through farms and settlements:</p>
<p>"The murderers of our prophet approach. Sell them no grain, no food. Cursed be he who gives the stores of the Saints to the enemies of God."</p>
<p>To the right, the left, the watch-word flew, and the emigrants, as they passed along, wondered at the evil looks, the sullen answers they met with everywhere.</p>
<p>They had been disappointed in replenishing their stores in Salt Lake City. No one there had anything to sell them, but they hoped that in the country it would be different. A vain hope, as the result proved.
<pb n="134      MOUNTAIN MEADOWS."/>

In the farm-yards they saw barns full to bursting, they passed through towns whose store-houses were overflowing, yet everywhere they met the same answer: "We have nothing to sell you." Double, triple prices were offered, but the Saints would notsell. This strange conduct made the emigrants uneasy; they felt themselves in an enemy's country, and longed for the wilderness.</p>

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.

<p>A NARROW gap opened into a valley whose placid beauty and rich verdure contrasted strangely with the surrounding desert.
There, the mountains lost their ruggedness, and descended in gentle rolling slopes, clothed with tall, luxuriant grass, somewhat yellowed on the upper slopes by the mid-summer sun; but on the bottom-lands it was kept ever fresh and green by numerous crystal brooklets that flowed from two abundant springs, one near the northern, the other at the southern extremity of the meadows. The meandering courses of these streamlets were overarched by the wild cherry, around which twined the virgin's bower, a mass of creamy-white, feathery festoons. Scattered here and there were oaks, clumps of cedars, fantastic rocks, and, near the northern gap, two giant cedars, lightning-scathed, reared their withered branches.</p>
<p>A few tardy columbines nodded their bright heads as if in welcome to the emigrants, and myriads of blackbirds, disturbedby their approach, fluttered in
<pb n="MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.     135"/>

the air, their scarlet underwings aflame in the sunlight.</p>
<p>To the wearied travelers it seemed a paradise. The children ran delightedly through the grass; the animals sniffed the perfume-laden air, and greedily began to feast upon the herbage. Hero, alone, was restless and discontented; growling and whining he followed his master, his nose to the ground, his ears pricked up. Evidently he scented danger.</p>
<p>His conduct excited the suspicions of his master, who believed firmly in Hero's wisdom. He called to him some of the more experienced of his band; together they scanned the valley, but not a shadow of danger was visible.</p>
<p>"I tell you what, Cap, I don't like those hillocks over yonder; let us go and reconnoiter a little."</p>
<p>The speaker was a frontiersman, whose advice was of great weight in the councils of the emigrants. The men were on the point of starting when Hero barked fiercely and dashed towards the hillocks in question.</p>
<p>A whirring sound, a piteous cry, and the brave dog rolled over dead, one arrow in his brain, and another in his heart.</p>
<p>"Boys, to your arms!" cried the captain. Scarcely was the command given when a bullet whizzed through the air, pierced the frontiersman's hat, struck the bird-cage, killing the bird, and at last lodged in the frame of a wagon. Another one, aimed at the captain, grazed his shoulder and struck one of the horses.</p>
<p>The utmost consternation prevailed. Mothers ran madly about seeking their children, who had wandered off in quest of flowers. Men rushed for arms, and
<pb n="136      MOUNTAIN MEADOWS."/>

shouted to those on the hills, "The Indians, the Indians." The bravest paled before this invisible foe. Balls rained aroundthem: one of their number lay wounded unto death: not a moment must be lost. The women and children were placed in a protected spot, and the men prepared for the defense. They were skillful marksmen, many already accustomed to Indian warfare; andwhen a momentary swaying of the brush or grass revealed to their quick eyes the tawny forms crouching beneath, a well directed volley ushered many a savage into the happy hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Suddenly a band of red demons, hideous in warpaint and feathers, sprang out of the ground, the trees and the rocks; a murderous swarm, yelling and whooping, flourishing aloft their tomahawks and guns. The contest waxed hot and furious: the airbecame murky with smoke, and rivulets of blood dyed the fair earth. Desperately fought the emigrants, never missing a mark;but the Indians were strong in numbers: instead of decreasing, their ranks seemed to increase, while the numbers of the emigrants rapidly diminish. In the heat of the battle, two savages dashed across the meadows and spoke to the warrior chief. Thereupon the latter signalled for the fight to cease; and in a few minutes the Indians retreated, driving off several head of cattle.</p>
<p>The emigrants saw this; it gave them hope. Yet not until the last savage was far beyond range did they breathe freely. The danger was past for a time; but they knew not how soon it might return, and they must be prepared.</p>
<p>They lifted the dead and wounded into the wagons and moved to an open spot on the hill-side, where
<pb n="THE SEIGE.     137"/>

they would be safe from any hidden foe or sudden attack. Here they buried their dead in prayerful silence; and over the graves, despair and woe kept vigil.</p>

CHAPTER XXIX.

THE SIEGE.

<p>ALL through the night they listened and watched. As the hours flew by, and no sign of danger appeared, they began to hope. But the morning light brought despair; for it showed to them all the peril of their situation. They were corraled in a narrow valley, whose only outlets were two somber gaps, guarded by merciless savages. Even had the road permitted them to present a solid front to the enemy, to cut through the ranks of these war-breathing Indians would have been a daring imprudence; but for a long train, slowly filing through a narrow pass, to attempt it, was madness. Their only course was to entrench themselves on the hill, and prepare for a vigorous defense.  They enclosed a square with the wagons, chaining the wheels together to make a solid barrier. In one corner they pat the milch cows; and in the center a rifle pit was dug, sufficiently large to shelter the entire company in case of an attack. Out of this excavation the men could fire without being seen bythe enemy. Sentinels, relieved every three hours, kept ceaseless watch.</p>
<p>Slowly passed the hours of anxious waiting. To while away the tediim, the emigrants related all the
<pb n="138     THE SEIGE."/>

Indian adventures they knew, and tried to make the experiences of the past yield guidance for the future.</p>
<p>Some of the more experienced declared that if no attack was made that night the danger would be over.</p>
<p>The dawn of the second day assured them in this belief; for the passes were free. The Indians had left the meadows. A few men were scattered here and there; but they were white men. Overjoyed at this discovery, the emigrants began their preparations for departure.</p>
<p>Some of the men left the camp to reconnoiter. Suddenly a sharp report was heard; another and another followed, bullets rained around them.  The men hastened back to the camp. They reached it unhurt; but with hats pierced and hair singed by glancing balls.</p>
<p>The emigrants were crushed with despair; for they knew now it was a deadly siege. How would it end? A white flag was hoisted, and there it fluttered unnoticed save by the breeze. Were the white men blind, or (horrible thought!) were they in league with the Indians?</p>
<p>The water in the camp was wholly insufficient for their need; still they dared not risk the lives of the men. The women volunteered, but their enemies paid no respect to sex. The firing recommenced, and one woman fell wounded. They must go without water. But the peril made heroes of the children. Unknown to their parents, they crept out under the wagons and ran down to the creek. The firing ceased, for even the cruel besiegers respected childhood; and the brave
<pb n="THE SEIGE.     139"/>

little band constituted themselves the water-carriers for the camp.</p>
<p>The emigrants talked and planned; for their position was fast becoming untenable. If help came not soon, they must all perish. Two brave young men--brothers--volunteered to go  to Cedar City, and implore help of the Mormon militia. In the shadowy twilight, they started on foot, the easier to escape observation. The distance was thirty-six miles; but they were strong, and love of life lent wings to their feet.</p>
<p>Another day dawned, the third of the siege; a day of feverish excitement, when every eye and ear was strained to its utmost, to catch a glimpse or a sound of coming relief. Now hoping, now despairing, the emigrants watched and waited, neither speaking nor eating; shuddering, ever and again, when the report of guns fired in wanton sport startled the air. The sun slowly ascended the heavens, it passed the meridian, it sank towards the western horizon, and still no sign of aid.</p>
<p>A creeping motion in the tall grass arrested the attention of the sentinels. What could it be--an Indian ambuscade? A friend would not approach in that snake-like manner: it must-be a foe. The sentinel was about to fire, when a man, pale and bleeding, struggled to his feet and staggered towards the camp. It was one of the volunteers--only one. Where was the other?The corral opened, loving arms received the wounded man, and anxious hearts stood still to hear the tidings. He saw the madness of suspense in their dilated eyes, and, rallying himself, he cried:</p>
<p>"The Mormons are against us: they killed my brother, and wounded me! No hope, no hope!" He fell back exhausted.</p>
<pb n="140     TWO PICTURES AND TWO PRAYERS."/>

CHAPTER XXX.

TWO PICTURES AND TWO PRAYERS.

<p>THE young moon shed a silvery radiance upon the green meadows, the crystal streamlets and the white-canopied wagons of the corral. Within, reigned the silence of sorrow and despair. There was nothing more to discuss, to plan, nothing to hope. Surrounded by fierce foes, noneto help, no escape; nothing was left them but death. Oh! it was hard; young, strong, rich, loved and happy, to bid adieu to their dreams, their hopes.</p>
<p>But death was not the worst. Captivity and torture confronted them, and the bravest quailed. Tiny, innocent hands were raised towards heaven, and childish tongues lisped prayers for father and mother. Youths and maidens knelt in suppliance, and men with bowed heads silently repeated the earnest petitions of wives and mothers, who all through the night wept and prayed: "Father in Heaven, save us!"</p>

*      *      *     *      *      *

<p>Under the withered trees at the northern extremity of the valley, a camp-fire glowed. Dusky, tattoed savages crouched around, or moved stealthily to and fro seeking food for the fire, whose flames leaped and writhed, now gleaming on the dusky faces and snaky locks of the red men, now lending a weird life to the mis-shapen rocks and gnarled cedars whose skeleton arms seemed eager to clutch the forms beneath.</p>
<p>At a little distance a band of pale-faces were exhorting and gesticulating. In their center was Delville.</p>
<pb n="TREACHERY.     141"/>

<p>"Saints of the Latter Days," he cried, "no more shrinking. The enemies of God must perish. The murderers of our prophet must die. Death to the murderers of the Saints! Let their riches be given to the children of God. Not a drop of innocent blood shall stain your hands. Our brethren, the Lamanites, will attend to that. Will you not, my children?" For answer, the savages flourished their tomahawks, leaped for joy, and were about to yell triumphantly, when Silvertung, always wary, said:</p>
<p>"Hush, my children; no noisy demonstrations. You will betray us to the Gentile. Be ready tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Yes, be ready to-morrow; you understand the plan," exclaimed one who seemed to be the leader. "At the cry, 'Do your duty,' remember. And now, brethren, let us pray to the Lord to guide and strengthen our arms, that His enemies may be all destroyed."</p>
<p>"Amen," responded the white saints. They knelt in prayer; the red savages looked on in wonder.</p>

CHAPTER XXXI.

TREACHERY.

<p>FRIDAY morning came, dark and ominous. But the clouds that obscured the sun were faint shadows of the black despair thatbrooded over the ill-fated camp.</p>
<p>A great commotion prevailed in the valley. A number of men, some on horseback, some on foot, moved to and fro, seeminglyin eager consultation.
<pb n="142     TREACHERY."/>

The emigrants thought they perceived a military uniform. At last, a man detached himself from the mass, and took the direction of the besieged. Soon the cry: "A white flag, a white flag!" resounded through the camp, and eyes, dim with hopeless watching, beamed with joy at the sight of a white man approaching, bearing in his hand the flag of peace.</p>
<p>A deputation went out of the corral to meet the welcome visitor, who, after the usual salutations, said:</p>
<p>"My friends, I come from the commander of the troops, to offer you protection. We did not know of your peril until last night. We immediately hastened to your assistance. The Indians are bent upon your destruction, and some of our own people aid and abet them, for they think you have entered our territory with evil intent. But we can save you, if you agree to our conditions, namely: to deliver up your arms. This is absolutely necessary to pacify our own people. However, we will not hold them; they shall be placed in the wagons you see yonder, and which we have brought for those unable to walk. Your wagonsmust remain here. We cannot guarantee them a safe passage to-day, but they shall be guarded."</p>
<p>The emigrants demurred to these terms; but they were not in a condition to refuse, surrounded as they were with enemies,and their ammunition nearly exhausted.</p>
<p>Life was dear. Even if they lost their goods, they still bad health, strength, and some money. They consented.</p>
<p>"Lastly," said the negotiator, "the men will be under guard until they are out of the territory."</p>
<p>This clause was scarcely heeded. As long as
<pb n="TREACHERY.     143"/>

they and their families were safe, it mattered little whether or not a guard watched them.</p>
<p>But when the wagons, each under the charge of two sinister-looking men, drew up to receive the weapons, the emigrants repented of their consent. But there was no other alternative. The children over two and under five were placed in the wagons, also the wounded.</p>
<p>While this was being done, the emigrants secured about their persons their money and some portable valuables.</p>
<p>When all was ready, the order was given to march. The wagons took the lead, and the women and larger children were ordered to follow.</p>
<p>"Why separate us?" asked Captain Fancher, who seemed to distrust this manoeuvre.</p>
<p>"It is necessary, if you wish protection," was the answer. The defenseless people were forced to submit.</p>
<p>About a mile from the Southern gap, the road made a sudden bend. Upon the right was a clump of cedars, on the left a ridge of hillocks covered with brush. The road skirted the cedars for some dozen yards, and then passed over a mound-like elevation. A few yards north of the bend, the troops were drawn up in double file, wide enough apart to admit of the passage ofthe wagons and the women. As soon as the latter reached the bend, the soldiers dropped into single file, their guns on the left arm, and marched to the right of the emigrants, a soldier to each man.</p>
<p>The emigrants marched in silence, depressed by a sense of coming evil.  Mothers drew their children
<pb n="144     THE TREACHERY."/>

closer. The once fearless, joyous youth tremblingly crept together. The men watched their guards, and chafed in helpless anger. Fear stalked by the side of all, and rang a death knell in their ears. The fluttering of a bird, the waving of the grass, the rustle of leaf, the roll of a pebble startled them. </p>
<p>The wagons passed over the brow of the hill, out of sight: between the cedars and the chapparal walked the women--far behind, hidden by a bend in the road, came the men.</p>
<p>Little Amy Fanoher crept to her mother's side and whispered: "Mother, look; there's something behind the trees."</p>
<p>Her mother looked; terror blanched her cheek, for there, behind the treacherous trunks, black savage orbs glared fiercely upon her. "Betrayed, betrayed."</p>
<p>She ran back towards her husband. The women, alarmed, turned to follow her, when loud and clear rang out the words, "Do your duty."   All stopped bewildered. What did it mean? Ere the thought took form, a volley shook the earth, and rocks and trees vomited forth hundreds of yelling savages. Well planned was the fiendish ilot. An armed soldier to each unarmed man, a trio of savages to every defenseless woman and child. A moment changed the blooming, peaceful meadows into a field of carnage. The crashing of bones, the firing of guns, the clash of knives as the savages disputed over their victimes, groanss, shrieks, yells and curses affrighted the air; birds dropped dead, and the cattle, frenzied by the roar, rushed madly bellowing over the hills.</p>
<p>The soldiers did their work well; yet, quick as they were to fire, Captain Fanchert dashed aside his
<pb n="THE FIELD OF BLOOD.     145"/>

murderer's arm and ran to save his wife and child, or to die with them. He saw savage hands clutch the loved tresses; he saw the tomahawk gleaming above them. Ere he could arrest its descent, a ball pierced him to the heart. He fell across two mangled bodies.</p>
<p>Four minutes had barely elapsed since the signal was given, yet the massacre was complete. Bright hopes, roseate visions, golden dreams, castles and chaplets were drowned in blood, and naught remained of the brave, the loving and the happy butinert, bleeding masses--dead--dead--dead. But a voice from the Beyond answers: "Nay, not dead, but living ever, to condemn,to avenge."</p>

CHAPTER XXXII.

THE FIELD OF BLOOD.

<p>IT was the hour before dawn. The hour when darkness grows ashen and chill, quivering in the throes of death.</p>
<p>Upon the gore-matted grass lay the murdered victims; from their bodies gleamed a spectral light, its half-revealments adding fresh horror to the scene. Fetid exhalations arose from the reeking charnel-field, and hung over it in murky clouds, as if to hide the ghastly spectacle from the sight of heaven.</p>
<p>Upon the upper slopes glittered fiery eyes, and savage howlings broke the stillness of the night. The coyote and the wolf were there.</p>
<p>Three horsemen rode among the nude, mangled corses. They were Delville, Silvertung, and one other, upon whom the law hasvisited retribution.</p>
<pb n="146     THE FIELD OF BLOOD."/>

The suggester, the planner, and the commander of the fiendish butchery came to contemplate their work. The sight appalled them. Even Delville's tigerish blood-thirstiness was glutted. These reeking shambles sickened him. Silvertung grew faint and dizzy. Cunning and cowardice had kept him away from the massacre; he only came when all was over, to assure himself that Edward Lascelle was among the victims, but he recoiled from the search; the ghastly stare of those sightless eyes burned into his brain.</p>
<p>"Come away, come away," he gasped, "they are all dead. Not one escaped? You are sure, not one?"</p>
<p>"Not one. The boys did their work well."</p>
<p>"Too well. Thank God, my hands had nothing to do with it."</p>
<p>"If your hands had nothing to do with it, your head had plenty to do with it."</p>
<p>"Oh! that's a very different thing. I had no idea there were so many. It will be a bad day's work for you, some time or other. I wouldn't have it on my conscience."</p>
<p>"You needn't try to cry quits; you are as guilty as anyone, and take care how you throw off on those who obeyed your commands."</p>
<p>"Didn't we obey the Lord?" cried Delville; "but let us get out of this. I can't breathe. I shall go mad. No more blood for me."</p>
<p>"Well, it's no use to be faint-hearted now the deed is done, but it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> horrible."</p>
<p>The trio hastened along the road as fast as the stumbling and tripping of their horses permitted them. They had nearly passed the scene of carnage when they were startled by a groan. There was an unearth-
<pb n="THE FIELD OF BLOOD.     147"/>

liness about the sound which caused the men to stop aghaast. The horses commenced to rear and plunge. Delville lost his seat, and fell, and, after many vain efforts to control their steeds, the others dismounted. The animals rushed away, leaving the men on foot amongst the dead.</p>
<p>The unearthly groans were repeated; the blood of the conscience-stricken men curdled. Bolder than the others, Delville advanced to the spot from whence came the the sounds. He found the body of a young and beautiful woman. The savages had spared the lovely features, and a mass of luxuriant, amber-tinted hair fell around her. A few crimson drops slowly trikled down her white cheeks. One arm, torn and mangled, had fallen by her side, the other pressed to her bosom a babe. Its head was cleft, and the weapon that had dealt death to the child had opened a ghastly wound in its mother's breast. Delville placed his hand upon her heart. The murderer's touch thrilled the dead. The woman rose, stared wildly around, then looked upon her babe. A fiery light, not of this earth, gleamed out of her stony eyes. She raised the bleeding arm, stretched forth the mutilated hand till it almost touched Delville, a voice dread and awful issued from the set lips. The three men, frozen with terror, speechless, motionless gazed at this oorpse galvanised into life by the spirit of vengeance.</p>
<p>The voice pronounced their doom:</p>
<p>"As you have shed blood, so yours shall flow. Years may roll on, but vengeance is sure. And you, you" (the hand pointed to Silvertung and the third one) "shall meet me here. Here will I demand your lives, your souls. Here will I be avenged."</p>
<pb n="148"/>

<p>The light died out of the eyes. The spirit vanished. A corpse fell back; and, as the gray dawn crept over the hills of that valley of death, three panic-stricken men fled away, crime-haunted forevermore.</p>

CHAPTER XXXIII.

BY THE LAKE.

<p>THE desert sea lay asleep in its mountain cradle, hushed to rest by the dreamy Indian summer. A sapphirine haze, fleckedwith gold, vailed the slumbering waves, vailed their cradle of rocks.  Through its vapory sheen, sky, mountain, and lake, seemed to blend in soft tremulous tints, sweet, vague, changeful, harmonious. No resonant chords, no haunting undertones--none of these voices of life, voices of victory joy, or sadness, broke the spell.</p>
<p>Nature dreamed, and nothing, not even a bird on restless wing, disturbed her revery.</p>
<p>Upon a rocky promontory a man stood gazing upon the vast expanse of shimmering lake, upon tinted mountain rising upon mountain till they dissolved into the ether. A shadow rested on his brow, but as he gazed it vanished.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is Zion," he exclaimed, "Zion, seated on the everlasting hills. I will not doubt,--man is ever inclined to evil, but God and His covenant are holy. They must be holy."</p>
<p>The man who thus tried to convince his doubting
<pb n="BY THE LAKE.     149"/>

mind, was the preacher Menly, with whom Julian and Lascelle once held prophetic converse.</p>
<p>He had reached Zion at last; but alas! he found discord, sorrow, grossness and despotism where he had hoped to find peace, love, spirituality and freedom. He heard whispered, hints of dark deeds done; those whom he had expected to see disgraced (such as Silvertung), were in high favor. Doubt assailed him. He thought of Lascelle's prophecy: "When you become acquainted with Zion and Zion's ruler, you will abjure Mormonism." Would the prophecy be realized? Menly trembled. He had sacrificed much for this creed, which seemed to him to contain truth and freedom. But that was not the worst: his conscience was uneasy, for if he was deceived, then he had been the means of deceiving thousands of others. The thought was torture. In his trouble he sought the wilds of the lake-shore to commune with himself and with God, whose voice is best heard in solitude. The charm of nature so peacefully dreaming, calmed him as by a spell, doubts vanished, peace returned; and Brother Menly dreamed glorious dreams of Zion, and the wonderful plan of salvation, revealed in the Latter Days. He lifted his voice and sang jubilant hymns, as he walked on the shore of the Desert Sea, when suddenly he stopped in amaze; there on the sand, partially sheltered by a bowlder, two children lay asleep.</p>
<p>The eldest, a fair-haired boy, might have seen ten summers; we say might, for he was one of those children whose well-developed frame and features make them appear older than they are. He evidently considered himself the protector of the wee maiden whose head lay pillowed upon his arm, for he had placed
<pb n="150      BY THE LAKE."/>

himself so as to shield her from the fresh breeze of the lake, and had, moreover, wrapped his jacket around her. This little girl was a delicate, elf-like child, with glossy raven curls, among which gleamed a few half-withered mountain pinks. Her dress, once a pretty rose-color, was stained and torn, her shoes, cut and worn into holes, exposed her baby feet, all sore and bruised. The boy's clothes, being more substantial, were whole, but so dust-stained that color and texture were doubtful.</p>
<p>The children's faces were haggard and pinched, and their slumber seemed more like the stupor produced by hunger and fatigue than the smiling sleep of happy childhood.</p>
<p>The noise of Brother Menly's approach disturbed the sleepers  The little girl moved uneasily, opened her eyes, and, seeing Brother Menly, said:</p>
<p>"Are we in heaven? Please, Mr. Angel, take us to Papa; we are so hungry."</p>
<p>Hush, Elsie, we ain't in heaven. That is a man, not an angel," whispered Stanly, who rose quickly to confront the stranger. "Please, sir, can you tell us where to get something to eat?"</p>
<p>"I think, my little friends, I have something in one of my pockets. Yes, here is some bread and meat and apples. But now, tell me how did you get here? Where is your home?"</p>
<p>The children eagerly took the food, but they remained silent and confused at these questions.</p>
<p>"What made you think you were in heaven just now, little one?" said Brother Menly, addressing the girl.</p>
<p>Oh! 'cause me and Stanny were so hungry, so
<pb n="BY THE LAKE.     151"/>

tired, and we wanted to go to heaven, so we laid down, like the little boy and girl in my picture book, that the birds covered all up with leaves. Then we went to sleep like they did, and I thought we were in heaven."</p>
<p>"And would you leave your father and mother?"</p>
<p>"My papa's in heaven and Stanny's mother's there. All the nice people go to heaven. Grandma's there, and Dudie. Dudie said Papa would come, and I watched by the window every day, so long, so long, and he didn't come. He went to heaven, and I want to go to."</p>
<p>"Yes, but your mamma--is she in heaven, too? and Stanny's father?"</p>
<p>"My father has two wives; he don't care for me. Nobody cares for me, but Elsie."</p>
<p>"But Elsie's mamma!" inquired Menly, growing more and more surprised, and hoping by these indirect questions, to find out whence came the wanderers.</p>
<p>"She is Elder Silvertung's fourth wife," added Stanly.</p>
<p>"Yes, and he whips me, and Mamma scolds, and Mamma cries. I tried to run away long time ago, but Dudie took me home."</p>
<p>"He is a very naughty man to whip you. He shall not do it any more. And so Stanny and you ran away and got very hungry."</p>
<p>"It was great fun though, wasn't it, Stanny?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," exclaimed Stanly, won over by Brother Menly's sympathetic words. "It was grand fun. We've talked about it ever so long, that Zion's the hatefullest place. Well, just think, father went away, and the elder and Elsie's mamma went away, there was nobody to watch, so we ran away. If we didn't
<pb n="152     BY THE LAKE."/>

get so hungry,--but there, I'm going to make lots of money like my father does, one of these days."</p>
<p>"How are you going to make it?" asked Menly, amused.</p>
<p>"That's a secret; but you seem good, perhaps I'll tell you some time."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my lad, I'll try and be very good. Now tell me, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"Stanly Delville, and this is Elsie Lascelle."</p>
<p>"Lascelle!" repeated Brother Menly.</p>
<p>"Yes, my name is Elsie Lascelle; that nasty elder ain't my papa. My papa is gone to heaven, and I want to go too," and the wee maiden began to cry.</p>
<p>Brother Menly walked away to hide his emotion. That name recalled painful thoughts. It brought back doubts and fears lulled to rest by nature's sweet lullaby. He stood some time, absorbed in these sad reflections. At length the sound of the children's voices aroused him. They must be taken home. He returned to them. "Elsie, dear, don't cry. Just think, I knew your papa, and also your mother, Stanly."</p>
<p>"Did you? How nice! Wasn't Papa nice?"</p>
<p>"He was very nice; but he would be very, very, sorry, and so would Stanly's mother, to see you children running away like this. You must let me take you home."</p>
<p>"No, we won't go," cried both the children.</p>
<p>"They will whip me," sobbed Elsie.</p>
<p>"They are wicked people; they killed mother and cousin Julian," exclaimed the boy. "No, I won't go; don't let him take you, Elsie. I can make lots of money getting the salt out of the lake, and selling it; everybody eats salt; we'll get along famously."</p>
<pb n="BY THE LAKE.     153"/>

<p>Brother Menly could not repress a smile at the boy's courage and enterprise.</p>
<p>"You are a brave lad, but you can't get the salt out of the lake without a bucket; and a bucket costs money. Then, too, it will take a long time to get enough salt to sell; in that time you will die of hunger and thirst. I must return to-night. I cannot stay with you. Then, when winter comes, with its snow and ice, where will you sleep? You had better put off this enterprise. I promise you that you shall not be whipped nor scolded. Come back with me."</p>
<p>Stanly looked thoughtful, and Elsie's tears flowed afresh. They still remained a little obstinate, but they could not long resist Brother Menly's persuasive tact. He knew how to act upon the childish mind and heart. In less than an hour Stanly and Elsie renounced (though with many a sigh), their mad project, promised to stay at home in the future, and allowed him to lead them back Zionward.</p>
<p>"Never mind, Elsie," said Stanly, choking down a sob; "never mind; wait till I'm a man,--you bet I'll get out of that hateful place, and I'll take you with me. Only wait."</p>

PART SECOND.

CHAPTER I. 

SMITHVILLE.

<p>TEN year have passed away. In the United States of America (for one seldom thinks of the other parts of the continent), ten years equal fifty elsewhere. In spite of its moral and social burdens, Utah is no exception. It lags not in the quick march. The desert is rapidly disappearing. Thriving farms and orchards cover the plain and clothe the mountain-side; and thelowing of cattle, the song of birds, and the hum of industry, give life to the once silent solitudes.</p>
<p>The Mormons have taught the world a great lesson. They have demonstrated the worth of co-operation and patient industry;--and, certainly, that which has been done by poor, shiftless emigrants, under the selfish, degrading rule of Mormonism, can be done, and better done, by skillful, energetic workers, guided by wise and elevating influences.</p>
<p>When judicious co-operation supersedes individual efforts, when migrant colonies forswear mining until the "earth be well tilled, and the barns well filled,"--when tree-culture becomes a religious duty--when intelligence weds the crystal stream to the thirsting plain--then the desert will become a fruitful paradise, its horrors a legend of the past. Then fields of golden 
<pb n="SMITHVILLE.     155"/>

grain and feathery corn, vineyards and groves of luscious fruit, and the perfumed mulberry, will flourish where once was the desolation of desolation.</p>
<p>From the glorious Wasatch Mountains that extend through Utah from north to south, several dependent ranges jut out, forming numerous flowery canyons and fertile valleys. In one of these valleys was the town of Smithville.</p>
<p>The background of lofty peaks, ever changing in hue, the wealth of flowery vendure, the many streams rippling sweet music, lend a charm to Smithville--a charm increased by a glimpse of the gray arid plain stretching afar in the distance.</p>
<p>Smithville is the centre of a large tract of farming country. The farms of Utah are small; consequently farming-tract is well-peopled. The farm-houses, consisting of adobe huts (one to each wife generally), built together in a rude fashion, are scattered over hillside and plain--very ugly spots on the fair landscape. Mormonism and the beautiful seldom combine.</p>Whether it is that the Mormons despise beauty, or that beauty despises Mormonism, I leave the reader to decide.</p>
<p>A broad street, fringed with young trees, divides the village into East and West Smithville. In this street stood a one-story brick building, over the front of which glared an immense eye, supposed to be an exact likeness of the divine optic as revealed to the prophet.  Under this visual organ is the motto: "Holiness to the Lord." This building is the one store of the village.  Here the Smithville Saints bought and sold,--or, to be more correct, bartered, for money had not at that time become the common
<pb n="156     SMITHVILLE."/>

medium of exchange. Here they supplied their wants, even to snuff and tobacco. Here they obtained their letters--here they gossiped--all under the supervision of that eye.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the street was another brick building, a little raised from the ground, and approached by steps. This was the meeting-house, which also served as theater, dancing-hall, and schoolhouse.</p>
<p>In the village were a few buildings somewhat pretentious, consisting of two stories: the upper story remarkable for its Liliputian windows placed about eight inches from the floor, so that a looker-out was forced to kneel.</p>
<p>These houses were all alike, individuality not being consistent with sanctity.</p>
<p>Smithville prided itself upon its holiness. The fullness of the Gospel reigned there triumphantly. No cursed Gentile, nobad spirits named Knowledge and Progress, had, as yet, dared to invade its sanctity.</p>
<p>If a brother fell from grace, or committed the unpardonable sin of doubting the Powers that were: if a sister, forgetful of her high prerogative of building up the kingdom: if, aweary of toil and misery, she became rebellious; blood-atonement could efface the guilt, and the soul, washed and purified in the blood of its own sinful body, could wing its flight heavenward.</p>
<p>Blessed Smithville! thus to be able to atone for sin, and no son of Babylon to cry murder! In this holy settlement, the vain follies of a corrupted world were unknown. Modern improvements, that give time for the growth of foolish thoughts, were not dreamed of.</p>
<p>There superstition, ignorance, polygamy, and blood-
<pb n="THE SCHOOL MASTER.     157"/>

atonement flourished.  Smithville, in fine, was a saintly Mormon village,--one in which Nephi or any of his brother patriarchs would have felt quite at home; but a strange feature in this age, and in a land of enlightened freedom.</p>
<p>It was the season of blossoms, when apricot, peach, apple and cherry robed the country in a perfumed mantle of pink and white; when the birds woo each other in glee, and all nature sings a joyful alleluia; yet, amidst all this gladness, Smithville was not gay. The dazzling spring sun brought out in full relief the ugliness of the adobe houses, the untidy yards, where swarms of dirty children screamed and quarreled; it flaunted in mockery upon the hopeless, forlorn looking women in dingy calico and shakers, who labored in the gardens, or worked in the squalid interiors, half seen through the open doors.</p>

CHAPTER II.

THE SCHOOL-MASTER.

<p>BROTHER SMITH merits an especial introduction on account of his originality.</p>
<p>The Smithvillites thought themselves very much favored when Brother S. consented to impart instruction to the juveniles whose parents could pay twenty-five cents per month, or its equivalent in butter, eggs, and vegetables. Brother S. wouldn'ttake cabbages. As coin became plentiful cabbages depreciated, and Brother S. said there must be a line drawn somewhere. He drew it through
<pb n="158     THE SCHOOL-MASTER."/>

cabbages. In person he resembled the missing link for which Darwinians are so anxiously searching. Heavy-jawed, chinless, short-necked, and flat-nosed, with a small amount of forehead, and a great deal of hair. His eyes, indistinct in hue, were so lost in mutual admiration that their glances upon other things were exceedingly crooked and uncertain.</p>
<p>Brother S. was a good Latter Day Saint, living the fullness of the Gospel. As a reward for his zeal the Church had given him four wives to increase his power in the celestial kingdom. Before the revered chief and revelator arrogated to himself and council the sole right to visions and revelations, Brother S. had been often favored with these spiritual visitations;hence le boasted that he was well acquainted with the patriarchs of old, and that his school was governed by their directions.</p>
<p>Still he was not contented. The Smiths are all ambitous. Revelation had taught the Saints that in the grand Milennium all zealous, polygamous, patriarchs should be gods, and create worlds to suit themselves.</p>
<p>Brother Smith's ambition was to be a big god, to make it a big world, and have plenty of subjects to people it. At this time his family consisted of about twenty, with the possibility of a goodly addition. According to the law of Mormon increase, the next generation would give no doubt a couple of hundred; and the second!!--but here lay his trouble. Would his grandsons or great-grandsons have the right to branch out as independent gods, or would they all be subject to him for aye?</p>
<p>The Urim and Thummim had never revealed the number of generations constituting a kingdom or a
<pb n="THE SCHOOL-MASTER.     159"/>

godship in the heavenly Jerusalem. This cruel neglect upon such a vital question gave great anxiety to some of the brethren, especially Brother Smith. Had he been assured upon this point he might have consoled himself with the success of Adam andEve. Still, this is doubtful, for Brother S. was ambitious, and ambition is impatient.</p>
<p>For some time past the good brother had resolved to add one or more to his harem. In this he was actuated by pure principle, for it cannot be supposed that a Saint who had received visions could possibly take pleasure in courting young silly girls; or that he was in any wise jealous of Brother Leeson's train of eight wives.</p>
<p>Most certainly not!  The Mormon Saints and Gods,<hi rend="italic"> in poss&eacute;<hi> are far above any motives so earthly! Like their chief, they do all from principle; they marry,  cheat, and kill, on principle.</p>
<p>We have mentioned the disinclination of Brother Smith's vision to take a straight line.  Aware of his peculiarity, the good brother aimed to make his persons, interior, as well as exterior, accord with it; and his nose, his legs, and his temper, were croser than his eyes.</p>
<p>His pupils trembled in his presence.</p>
<p>If they did not respect the man, they did the man's crossness, and its interpreter--his cane. No amount of familiarity with this object could ever degenerate into contempt.</p>
<p>The spelling-class stood before the master. This class generally came to grief, owing to the originality of the master's method, which was a phonetic marvel. Brother Smith boasted very much of this method; in-
<pb n="160     THE SCHOOL-MASTER."/>

deed, he used to tell his friends, that if he only had the time he would make a grammar and a speller, that would "beat anything yet seen, and make the English easier than wink."</p>
<p>This genius rejoiced that he was born in the mightiest city of civilization, that the music of Bow Bells had been his lullaby; and one of his inherited peculiarities was his use of the aspirate, which he considered merely as a mark of emphasis. The degree of his mental excitement could be accurately ascertained by the number of 'H's,' scattered about his conversation.</p>
<p>"Now you spellers, prick up your hears. Spell as if you knowed something. Spell, Pertaters."</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Smart boy<hi>. " P-o-po-t-a-"</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "Wrong. I didn't say pota, I said perta."</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Smart boy</hi>. "But the speller--"</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "How dare you say speller?--they ain't worth a cent, any nee of your spellers. Go hon."</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Timid girl</hi>. "P-e-r-t-a-t-o."</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "Stop, t-o indeed! I'm ashamed of you. Where's yer hears? Hain't ye got but four senses? Pertaters, once more." Anominous flourish of the cane accompanied the second giving out of the word.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Sly boy</hi>. "P-e-r-t-a-t-e-r-s."</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "Right; go the head of the class; you will be a honor to your country, one of these days. Now attention, class. Spell herth."</p>
<p>A dead silence.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "Can't you spell the herth hon which you live?"</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">Smart boy</hi>. "E-a-r-t-h."</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "Wrong. None but fools put a ha in herth."</p>
<pb n="SCANDAL AMONG THE SAINTS.     161"/>

<p><hi rend="italics">Smart boy</hi>. "The speller says"--</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">B. S</hi>. "How dare you? That's the second time to-day you've said 'speller' to me. 'Tis of such has you that hapostates hare made. But hi will take the bad spirit hout of you; hi will teach you (<hi rend="italics"whack</hi>) to (<hi rend="italics"whack</hi>) dispute (<hi rend="italics"whack</hi>) me."</p>
<p>The learned master continued to bruise the lad's body until his attention was called to another quarter, where some boys were indulging in a free fight on their own account. This outbreak demanded more cane exercise, until Brother S., panting and perspiring with his efforts to quell the bad spirits, thought it necessary to take a little recreation.</p>
<p>So, placing the sly boy in command, he strolled across the street to the store over which the Eye watched, to recuperate himself in saintly converse.</p>
<p>This store was the headquarters of the gossips of Smithville. Gossiping was a masculine privilege in Smithville; for the women worked too hard to have either the heart or the time to indulge in such pleasures--pleasures to which the future gods took very kindly, actuated always by principle.</p>

CHAPTER III.

SCANDAL AMONG THE SMITHVILLE SAINTS.

WHEN the school-master entered the store, he found, besides the usual clique, Brother Leeson, of patriarchal fame, and Elder Silvertung, who looked as young and smiling as when he revealed the will of the Lord to Mary
<pb n="162     SCANDAL AMONG THE"/>

Lascelle. They were all deeply absorbed in oonversation, and the eager expression of the faces showed that something more than common was under discussion.</p>
<p>"What is it?" anxiously inquired Brother S.</p>
<p>"Brother Menly has fallen from grace."</p>
<p>The news revived the school-master.</p>
<p>"There, now, hain't I a prophet? I told you so, you know. I knowed he would come to the bad."</p>
<p>"So you always said, Brother Smith. Well, we all felt something was wrong when he refused to build up the kingdom."</p>
<p>"Satan clutched him some time ago. To think how he imposed upon the Church with that meek way of hisn!"</p>
<p>"What's disgraced him now in headquarters?"</p>
<p>"Preached against blood atonement and polygamy."</p>
<p>"The vile apostate!" in chorus.</p>
<p>"Says that men and women have a right to think for themselves, and should do it."</p>
<p>"Well, now, for the men, that wouldn't be so bad; but for the women, it wouldn't do nohow."</p>
<p>"I should say not. Just think of my eight women, each with a religion and opinions of her own. There would be some fine scratching. Why, such a doctrine would subvert all order, and anyone who dares preach it will go to hell, and I would like to give him a lift upon the road."</p>
<p>"So would I, Brother Leeson," chorused the Saints.</p>
<p>"I guess we'll have to do a little surgery to cure Menly's disease. We haven't had any of that work this long time. My hands are aching for want of use."</p>
<pb n="SMITHVILLE SAINTS.     163"/>

<p>"Yes; Elder, tell us the orders.  Any blood-letting?"</p>
<p>"My dear friends, you horrify me with your out-spoken jokes. Why do you forget the Lord's injunction? I suppose you wish to know whether the Church intends to assure his salvation?"</p>
<p>"That's the question, Elder. We ain't got your soft way of putting it, you know."</p>
<p>"Are we to assure his salvation?" in chorus.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for his sake to be obliged to tell you--no. The Church considers his crime too great for salvation. He is togo to perdition without let or hindrance."</p>
<p>"Them's the orders?"</p>
<p>"They are."</p>
<p>"The Church drops him."</p>
<p>"Drops him completely. No one is to speak with him, notice him, or deal with him."</p>
<p>"Well, we can answer for Smithville doing her duty in that. He shall be let alone with a vengeance."</p>
<p>"A glorious punishment. The very best. His friends (there are plenty round about) would like nothing better than to make a martyr of him."</p>
<p>"That's so. But how about his wife, whom he pretends to love so much? Wouldn't it be a holy judgment upon this oontemner of celestial marriage if the Lord would take his <hi rend="italics">one</hi> wife to Himself?"</p>
<p>"It would indeed be a just judgment. She has always been rebellious."</p>
<p>"Rebellious! I should think so; doing all she could to prevent our girls going into polygamy; and then allowing that nephew of hers to insult authority--you remember?"</p>
<pb n="164     SCANDAL AMONG THE SAINTS"/>

<p>"We remember" (in chorus). "They actually gave a tea-party without permission; yes, and drank tea,--yes, we remember."</p>
<p>"That is not all. When pardon for such conduct was asked in full meeting, I saw her smile."</p>
<p>"Such wickedness cannot be allowed in Smithville."</p>
<p>"There is no danger of any one making a holy martyr of Emily Menly."</p>
<p>"Poor thing! she is misguided by her husband. It would be a great act of charity to send her to heaven."</p>
<p>"A charity, for which she ought to be grateful."</p>
<p>"Well, brethren, to-morrow evening we will have a special meeting. Do not fail to come."</p>
<p>Elder Silvertung passed out. The brethren formed themselves into groups of twos and threes, and began whispering. Brother Leeson went to the door, followed by Brother Smith.</p>
<p>"Bad case, this of Menly's."</p>
<p>"A warning, Brother Smith, a warning to those who are remiss in fulfilling the Everlasting Covenant."</p>
<p>Brother Leeson with eight wives gave himself airs.</p>
<p>"The Good Spirit speaks through you, Brothers. "My mind's been rather troubled of late about that very thing. It seems to me, I could and ought to do much more towards building up the kingdom."</p>
<p>"That's right, Brother, it cheers me to see you growing zealous." The many-wived man made this remark hurriedly: at the same time, he smoothed his moustache and beard, gave his hat a tip to one side <hi rend="italics">a la cavalier,</hi> straightened himself, then walked up the street with a dandified step.</p>
<pb n="BROTHER SMITH'S REVELATION.     165"/>

<p>These proceedings aroused the curiosity of Brother Smith. Was it possible that Brother Leeson was not yet satisfied?</p><p>That the man of eight wives and forty-seven children still sighed for more?</p>
<p>Was his heart so large that this number could not fill it?</p>
<p>Now if Brother Smith had studied classic lore, it would have seemed to him only natural that Brother Leeson should desire to make his eight the "Sacred Nine." But such studies did not suit his practical mind, and Brother Leeson's manner worried him. However, if he knew nothing of legends, he knew enough about spying; and he posted himself so as to watch the gallant patriarch.</p>
<p>A few minutes' observation discovered to him the secret of the manceuvering. The discovery was a revelation that coincided exactly with his desires. This coincidence is a peculiarity of revelations. Brother Smith's heart overflowed with thanksgiving.</p>

CHAPTER IV.

BROTHER SMITHS REVELATION.

<p>WHAT did Brother Smith see? Only two girls whom he had seen daily for years, but who now appeared to him in a different light, for Brother Leeson's gallantry told him these children were marriageable.</p>
<p>"I have it. There's that Helsie. She is too hugly for anyone to want to marry her; but she'll be pre-

cious useful to me, for if she ain't pretty she knows a lot; got quite a knack of teaching, too. Now I'll marry her for teh school. Elder Silvertung ought to be glad to get her off his hands. She is such a homely thing. It will be no pleasure, but it will be money in the pocket. And then if I can get Kleena; she is a regular beauty. That old Leeson seems crazy over her. It is a glorious hidea: a revelation. There will be the income from the school without any trouble on my part. A man of my talent has hother things to think of besides school drudgery. A teacher and a wife hall for nothing but her board. Then, too, I can add to the dairy,: that Kleena has a strong arm. Of course they will both jump at the chance--a young, good-looking man like me, with a good farm, dairy and school, and the largest house in the place."</p>
<p>Thus soliloquizing, Brother S. posed himself as gracefully as his legs allowed him, and smilingly awaited the arrival ofthe two girls.</p>
<p>The elder, who might have numbered seventeen summers, was a well-built, clear-skinned, rosy-cheeked Norwegian, whose muscular limbs an athlete might have envied; and the heavy bust, full, sleepy eye; the dull flaxen hair told of a mild, prolific temperament, untroubled by vagaries of the mind, or spiritual aspirations. A fine specimen of the human kine with whom polygamy agrees.</p>
<p>Such was Kleena, the belle of Smithville, the cynosure of all polygamous eyes.</p>
<p>Her companion was a slender girl of fifteen years, taller than Kleena, but wretchedly thin: only saved from gaunt angularity by symmetry and smallness of bone. Her features were fine and regular; but their
<pb n="A MORMON WOMAN'S WORK.     167"/>

worn expression, and the dull, colorless skin marred their beauty.  Even the eyes, dark and lustrous, shaded by curled, ebon lashes, increased the homeliness of the face by their size, and the restless, wistful, haunted look, that dwelt in their depths. Her hair, black and abundant, was twisted up in utter disregard of appearances.</p>
<p>Poor Elsie Lascelle! It was not strange that sensual minds considered her plain. Yet an artist would have said:</p>
<p>"What a beautiful girl if--yes, if happiness could wave its magic wand over her; then, indeed, she would be beautiful."</p>
<p>Brother Smith received the girls with bows and smiles. He prided himself upon his politeness, and he was desirous of eclipsing Brother Leeson.</p>
<p>Kleena appeared delighted with his attentions, but Elsie felt annoyed, and as soon as she made her purchases she ran home, leaving Kleena and Brother Smith to captivate each other.</p>

CHAPTER V.  

A MORMON WOMAN'S WORK.

<p>ELDER SILVERTUNG was a wealthy man. He owned a large farm, numerous cattle, five wives, well stocked orchards, and gardens, a town house, several city lots, besides being interested, <hi rend="italics">sub rosa</hi>, in mines--paying ones, be it well understood.</p>
<p>But with all this wealth the elder's house at Smith-
<pb n="168     A MORMON WOMAN'S WORK."/>

ville was a model of primitive simplicity. It consisted of a two-story center building, with a wing on each side. These wings were miserable huts with no other floor than the soil.</p>
<p>The main building was very little better; and uglier, more forlorn dwelling could with difficulty be imagined. Within its walls four wives and seventeen children ate, slept, drudged--we dare not say live for life implies something better.</p>
<p>The elder preached industry, and these wretched women doubly earned their miserable subsistence and that of their families, while making believe that they were happy and doing the will of God. Faint traces of beauty still remained to show thatthe elder was a connoisseur in good looks, but misery and toil effaced all charms.</p>
<p>The master of these women (husband is too sacred a name) seldom honored Smithville with his presence except on business. The time not employed traveling on church affairs, he spent in his house at Salt Lake City, where dwelt No. 5, the favorite, because the last.</p>
<p>There was a tradition that this house had built for No. 8, then Mrs. Lascelle had reigned their a short time, and now another lived out her day of triumph.</p>
<p>As Elsie approached the gate she made an effort to shake off her gloomy feelings, but the wan smile only made more evident the sadness of her crushed youth. She looked in at the open door of the right wing. A group of dirty children were there playing, but the one she sought was absent.</p>
<p>Laying down her packages she went to the garden.</p>
<pb n="A MORMON WOMAN'S WORK.      169"/>

A sound of wood-chopping, the strokes feeble and unsteady, arrested her attention.</p>
<p>An angry flush crimsoned her cheek as she darted across the garden into the orchard, where she found a woman trying to fell a withered tree.</p>
<p>"Mother, mother, stop! Let me do that; you will kill yourself."</p>
<p>"So much the better, Elsie, if I do, for I only cumber the ground."</p>
<p>"Hush, mother, you must not talk so," replied Elsie, as she took the axe from her mother and commenced a vigorous attack. The quivering of her delicate frame told how painful was the effort. Her mother leaned against a tree, and, taking off her immense sun-bonnet, wiped from her brow the sweat of labor.</p>
<p>How changed is that face since we last gazed upon it! The eye of love could scarcely recognize in this gray-haired, wrinkled, tanned, hollow-eyed woman, of shrunken form and wasted features, the once lovely Mary Lascelle.</p>
<p>Hopeless endurance had placed its seal upon her brow, baffling all scrutiny.</p>
<p>Did she battle with despair?</p>
<p>No; for despair implies doubt, and this woman had never doubted, but accepted her condition as the will of God.</p>
<p>Did she suffer from remorse--remorse for sacrificing her child, remorse for wrecking her fond husband's happiness, yea, his life?</p>
<p>No. Remorse is the consciousness of evil doing, and the credulous woman firmly believed she had done right.</p>
<pb n="170     A MORMON WOMAN'S WORK."/>

<p>Was she happy?</p>
<p>No--a thousand times no. Happy! She had almost forgotten the meaning of the word happiness. Each day brought some new misery to crush still more her woman's nature. Yet she knew neither despair nor remorse, only hopeless endurance.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! I hate to see you work so, Elsie; but to-morrow is wash-day and we must have the wood--there isn't a speck in the house."</p>
<p>"Never mind, mother, we shall soon have some. It is hard, though. I don't see why women have such a terribly hard-life, I wish I were a man."</p>
<p>"Hush, Elsie, you must repress that rebellious spirit. The Lord has placed a heavy cross  upon our shoulders; but it is His will, and He fits the back to the burden.  Pray to the Lord, Elsie."  Then the miserable woman and mother turned and entered the house.</p>
<p>Elsie paused and gazed at the retreating form. The child's eyes were, flashing and her lips compressed. "I don't believe the Lord has anything to do with it. If He has, He is wicked, and I don't like Him." Having relieved her mind by this emphatic declaration, Elsie returned to her labor of felling the tree.</p>
<p>It was a strange ocoupation for this child, whose ancestral civilization showed itself clearly in the gracefully-poised head, with its thoughtful brow, and delicate face, and the small shapely hands, albeit they were callous from toil. The tree was very hard. Her strokes scarely made any impression.  Her hands grew hot and blistered: her body ached: the tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>"God does not care any more for His children,
<pb n="THE APOSTATE.     171"/>

than our men do for theirs," muttered Elsie, as she rested a moment to recover breath. "Heaven, and the world, and everything is just as hard as that tree. But it shall come down."</p>
<p>She renewed her efforts.  But tears and pains made her strokes inefficient.</p>
<p>"Good girl; Elsie; you are growing quite smart. I'm glad to see it. Girls nmust be industrious," said the oily voice of Elder Silvertung, who was leisurely making a tour of inspection. "You should aim your strokes better, my: girl; industry is nothing without skill." With this admonition he strolled away.</p>

CHAPTER VI.

THE APOSTATE.

<p>THE tree was certainly very hard.  Elise began to despair. It was not the first time that she had done such work; but somehow she could not succeed to-day.</p>
<p>"My dear child," said a kind voice near her, "that is rough work for you. Give me that axe."</p>
<p>A strong hand seized the implement, and by the time the blurr passed from Elie's eyes, so that she could see her helper, the tree was down.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Brother Menly," said Elsie, "thank you."</p>
<p>"Tut, tut, child, no thanks, it is nothing more than my duty. This is man's work, not fit for a slim girl like you. Now we will soon have this in firewood. Is this other one to come down as well?"
<pb n="172     THE APOSTATE."/>

<p>Elsie nodded assent. A few vigorous strokes and the work was done, to Elsie's great satisfaction.</p>
<p>"I wish God were as kind as you are, Brother Menly, then He wouldn't make women carry such heavy crosses as He does."</p>
<p>"Hush, dear. God is kind--it is men who are cruel. But it will all come out right in the end."</p>
<p>The good man was gone. Elsie began to gather up the wood, when she was again accosted by the elder.</p>
<p>"Girl, who was that man you were speaking with?"</p>
<p>"You must have seen him plainly enough to know without asking."</p>
<p>It was not a gracious reply; but graciousness is not much known in Mormon settlements.</p>
<p>"I wish you to tell me who that man was--a lover of yours, perhaps?"</p>
<p>At this taunt Elsie's eyes flashed scorn, and her nostril and lip quivered with indignation. This little pantomime greatly amused the elder, who loved to see this high spirit beat itself impotently against its prison bars. But the menaced storm did not burst, and the girl answered, with only a slight shade of defiance:</p>
<p>"It was Brother Menly."</p>
<p>"I thought as much. It is time you knew that this <hi rend="italics">good, dear Brother Menly</hi> is an apostate. The church drops him; the Saints break off all association with him. If you speak with him again you will be accursed."</p>
<p>The elder rolled out the last word as if it made sweet music.</p>
<p>"Yes, accursed," he repeated, and turned away; but a second thought brought him back to his victim. Elsie stood as if transfixed. She had taken off her
<pb n="THE APOSTATE.     173"/>

huge bonnet, that the air might cool her fevered brow. No longer disfigured, she made a pretty picture, with the sunlight gleaming on her wavy, glossy hair, her cheek flushed, and her bosom heaving with emotion. The elder stopped, surprised. For the first time he saw that she was beautiful. "You hear me? You are not to speak with him again."</p>
<p>Elsie turned upon him, her eyes now swimming in tears.</p>
<p>"Yes, I hear you."</p>
<p>"But you must not spoil those pretty eyes with tears. Why, I declare, you are growing quite handsome;" and he patted her under the chin. Elsie shrank from his touch. The elder smiled. It was a cruel smile. He put his arm around the child, and drew her towards him in spite of her struggles, which seemed to amuse him.</p>
<p>"The little dear must not cry because her pet turns apostate. We will find her some one else to love. Now give me a kiss and don't cry."</p>
<p>"Leave me alone," cried the girl, almost beside herself, wishing, at the same time, that she were a snake, so that she might sting him to death. Her vehemence and evident dislike had no effect upon her tormentor. He stroked her hair, kissed her, and with a parting injunction "not to cry," sauntered away, chuckling to himself.</p>
<p>"That girl is actually growing pretty," thought he. "I believe were she well dressed she would be beautiFul--beautiful enough to suit me. That gives me an idea."</p>
<p>The elder, seemingly preoccupied with this idea, entered his harem.</p>
<pb n="174     THE APOSTATE."/>

<p>As soon as she was released poor Elsie ran to a favorite retreat hidden from the house by the barns.Here the mountain torrent formed a succession of tiny cascades, whose laughing songs had often soothed her out of her sorrows.</p>
<p>But never before had she lain down on the moss-covered rocks with a heart so heavy with woe. Her soul was torn with rage against the elder, whom she hated, with grief about her friend--the only true friend she had ever known--her teacher, her counselor, her second father, dear Brother Menly. But worse than all was the despair at her helplessness.</p>
<p>It was pitiful to hear those agonized sobs, to see that child-like form prone to the earth with anguish.</p>
<p>Elsie had inherited the strong passions and powerful reasoning faculties of her father, whose superior mentality had absolutely psychologized the very negative highly impressionable mother.  Hence the girl could not help rebelling against her unnatural surroundings.</p>
<p>To think was as natural to Elsie as to eat. Her active mind detected weak points, compared contradictions, sought causes, and drew inferences.  She reasoned, in a disorderly way, for thought requires training more than any other faculty.</p>
<p>Her creed did not satisfy her. An indefinable something in her soul repelled it, although she knew no other.</p>
<p>Vague memories of a beautiful home, of a tender father, whose coming she had watched with loving delight, of flowers, music, birds, and happiness haunted her in dreams. But she dreaded to speak with her mother upon this subject, it seemed to inflict so much pain.  Once the elder overheard Elsie's questions
<pb n="MARRIAGE PROPOSALS.     175"/>

about their former home, and the memory of the punishment it drew upop her mother and herself prevented her from ever repeating them.</p>
<p>But memory did not die; and in dreams, both waking and sleeping, came the sounds of the Long Ago, vague as the sounds of an AEolian harp, --as sweet and sad.</p>
<p>They floated to her with the streamlet's song as she crouched on its mossy bank; and with them came words oft uttered by Brother Menly: "Pray to God. He will help you."</p>
<p>And she prayed,--prayed that she might escape.</p>
<p>"God will help me, for Brother Menly says so. He will let me get away from this, some way or other."</p>
<p>Then, somewhat calmer, she knelt and vowed that no one, nor anything, should ever make her give up Brother Menly.</p>
<p>This pious act relieved her mind. She then bathed her face, put on her sun-bonnet to hide her tear-stained eyes, and ran home to work.</p>

CHAPTER VII.

MARRIAGE PROPOSALS.

<p>THAT day was destined to be an eventful one in Elsie's life.</p>
<p>In the evening, after the children had been put to bed, and the chores were done, Elsie coaxed her mother to take a walk.</p>
<p>That poor wreck of womanhood was her mother;
<pb n="176      MARRIAGE PROPOSALS."/>

and to her Elsie turned for sympathy. Advice or guidance she did not expect--only sympathy.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of hearing, Elsie began an indignant protest against the "dropping" of Brother Menly.</p>

Mrs. Silvertung became alarmed.

"For God's sake, Elsie, be quiet. Don't let the

trees hear you. I can scarcely move for fear. Did

you not hear some one ?"

The woman trembled violently. Her great dread

silenced Elsie; but the girl's mind was too full to be

thus easily repressed. Disappointed in her hope to

gain sympathy, she tried to obtain information.

"All the world is not like this place, is it ?"

" Why, no, Elsie. What a foolish question."

"And the people don't think as the Latter Day

Saints do."

"No, child; are not missionaries continually going

among them to'convert them ?"

"Well, if they are any worse off than we are it

must be a horrid world. Were you a Gentile once ?" 

"Don't talk of these things, Elsie : you must like .

to torture me." 

Elsie was too much absorbed in her thoughts to

notice her mother's appeal.

"Yes," she continued, "that was before we en-

tered that big ship-before that long journey that

puts everything that went before out of my mind.

Yet I remember sometimes. Mother, don't the Gen-

tiles have beautiful houses, and gardens full of flowers,

and all kinds of other lovely things? Have not the 

women white delicate hands ? Don't they wear shin- .

ing dresses, and the men seem kind and gentle ? The

books Brother Menly lent me say so. But he told me

not to believe all the books said. Is it really so, Mo-

ther ?"

" Yes, Elsie, some of them have these things."

"Didn't we, Mother ?"

" Yes; dear but these are foolish vanities that God

condemns, and the Saints renounce."

"I don't see why. It seems to me that these vani-

ties are very nice and pleasant. I wish I were a Gen-

tile."

"Oh I my child, would you lose your part in the

kingdom, and be lost with the Gentiles, whose days are

numbered? Soon the wicked Gentiles will be swept

from off the earth. Only last Sunday, Elsie, you heard

those very words from the bishop."

"Mother, did God make the Gentiles ?"

"Certainly, dear."

"Then it is very cruel in Him to destroy them."

"But if He sees that they are not good ?"

"Why, if He made them, He should have made

them good. Don't you think so, Mother ?"

" I don't think at all, Elsie, and it frightens me to

hear you talk so about thinking. People who think

for themselves always apostatize, like Brother Menly:

then they are lost."

" Will Elder Silvertung go to heaven ?"

" Of course, Elsie; the elder is one of the chosen

of the Lord."

"Then I don't want to go to heaven. I'd rather

be lost in company with Brother Menly."

"Elsie 1"

"Very considerate of you, Brother Smith."

"Hand now, helder, we comes to the point. Will

ye consent that Helsie be sealed to me ?"

Elsie could hardly repress a scream; and if the

men had not been so engrossed in their conversation

they might have heard the beatings of her heart.

"Come, now, Brother Silvertung, what d'ye say ?"

"Give me a little time to reflect upon it, Brother.

You are just the man of my choice. But, to be candid

with you, I have been deeply impressed that it is my

duty to make Elsie's salvation sure. You see, I feel

somewhat responsible for the girl; and if she had been

of proper age, I would have married her at the same

time I did her mother.

I This seems to me the will of the Lord. However,

I will consult further the Holy Spirit in this matter."

"Ho, in that case I have nothing more to say.

Hon second thought, it is more in haccordance with

the law that you should marry Helsie. But we won't

say hany more about it. Now-    "

The rest of the conversation was lost in the dis-

tance, as the speakers moved on, leaving Elsie trans-

fixed with horror at the revelation.

-In the last few moments she had lived a lifetime.

ELSIE'S DESPERATE      RESOLVE        181

Her childhood was buried. The idea of marrying

that squint-eyed, monkey-headed Smith, to become

No. 5 in his harem, was sufficiently repulsive; but to

marry the husband of her mother-that cruel, detested

man! 0 God I death would be preferable. The

thought froze her blood-paralyzed her limbs. She

fell to the earth unconscious.

CHAPTER VIIL

ELSIE'S DESPERATE RESOLVE.

t_^i HE touch of the chilly night-air recalled El-

sie to consciousness. It was quite dark,

and she felt a secret terror, lest, her ab-

sence being noticed, the elder might come

to seek her, and thus get a clue to her knowledge.

The terror nerved her to return.

Fortunately, the women had not all retired, and

they were too wearied and busy to notice her looks.

The elder had not returned. A fire was burning upon

the hearth. Elsie crouched over it, hoping its warmth

would dissipate the chill that numbed her; but the

material warmth and light made her still more sensi-

tive to the horror of the future.

Soon she heard the elder's footsteps. Shrinking

from the sight of him, Elsie ran to her room, and tried

to forget her troubles in sleep, but her secret fright-

ened away slumber. Her mind was busy trying to

form some plan of escape; but the more shbAhought

over the means of getting away, the more difficult be-  -

and ugliness, should yearn for that wonderful world

shut out from her by those giant mountains.

"Ah 1" sighed Elsie, "that I were a bird, how

quickly would I scale those dizzy heights."

If she had known of fairies, she would have invoked

the queen and all her host to grant her request. Per-

haps they did look kindly upon, for as she sighed the

rocky sentinels lost their grimness, and appeared in

dazzling splendor, crowned with the rays of the rising

sun.                -

Elsie's heart beat with re-awakened courage. All

was not yet lost. Heaven smiled upon her.

But it was a weary, weary world after all. Her 

friends, the flowers, had lost their charms. She scarcely

glanced upon them, as she threw herself down upon

her accustomed seat, and pondered over her new idea.

Suddenly a voice aroused her. It was the voice of her

old friend.

"My child,-what brings you out so early? Why,

are you ill?"

" No, but I wish I was ill-ill enough to die 1"

"My little Elsie, do not talk that way; youth re-

coils from death."

"Well, I don't. I must die, or run away, which

will be certain death, if you-  "

Here Elsie stammered and blushed.

"How does this desperate resolve depend upon

me?" said Brother Menly, with a forced attempt at

gaiety. "You are going to die or run away if I--"

" Yes, I must do one or the other unless-" Here

Elsie stopped; but she did not blush this time. With

jeyes and face pale and set she looked at Brother Men-

ly, and in a voice forced and unnatural finished the

sentence: " Unless you marry me."

"I marry you " exclaimed Brother Menly, in a

tone that expressed a doubt of the child's sanity. "I

marry you! What does it mean."

"It means," said Elsie, who was now desperate,

"that I am in awful trouble. My step-father says he is

going to marry me; and I would die rather. Yes,

you may well stare. It is all true. I found it out last

night. I heard them talking-the elder, and Brother

Smith, who wants to make me No. 5. Oh! it nearly

kills me. I hate them both; and I don't know where

I could run to. I like you-you are so good, and I

thought you might save me."

Here the girl broke down. She had been talking

loud and fast, as though she were forcing herself to

speak by some desperate effort. The tension gave

way, and the burdened heart relieved itself in tears.

Brother Menly felt shocked and grieved. He seated

himself by the side of the weeping child, and tenderly

soothed her. Elsie did not shrink, for he touched her

reverentially. To him she was sacred.

"My poor little wild blossom," sighed the gray-

haired mentor, as he thought of the many victims he

had seen sacrificed. But now it was his little Elsie;

and the tears of this man, himself a martyr, mingled

with those of the child victim.

When her grief had spent itself, Brother Menly

questioned Elsie to find out more concerning Silver-

tung's designs.

"Elsie, my child, take courage; something tells

me that this scheme will never be realized. Our'Father

in Heaven will watch over you, and save you from.^

bishop."

"But he has four wives 1"

"All the better. Don't you see he will be ever

such a grand man in the other world, and wives come

in there for a share of the grandeur."

"Then you are going to marry him."

"Well, now, that isn't certain. He hasn't asked me

yet; but he will, for he is so awful polite, and talks so

beautifully about the salvation of my soul-and of my

pretty eyes, and teeth-them's sure symptoms of a

proposal. But now I want to talk over matters. You

have an awful lot of ideas, and I'm rather jumbled

atween the wish to get up in the world, and principle."

"You should choose principle, Kleena. But I did

not know you bothered yourself about principles."

"Well, I don't generally. Let those who make 'em

do that.  Howsumever, I do think that families

shouldn't be broken up; that you should stick to ye*r

own. Now, you see my sister and cousin are both

married to a pretty nice man. They are as happy as

birds. He's pretty well-to-do, and he is going to build

another house so that they may each have one for their

very own; not that they want to live apart, for they

are just so happy. Well, sister and cousin think that

I ought to be the third wife, and I think so too. It

would be such a .pity to let such a nice man as Brother

Gibson go out of the family. Now, that's my princi-

ple, Elsie, and you see it goes right agin my prospects.

There's Brother Leeson, too, an actual bishop, he's

rather sweet, but not quite so far gone as Brother

Smith. Now, give us your opinion; don't forget the

principle. Come now, speak out."

when she reached her mother's apartment

bher fears were realized.  .

L       The tone in which the elder said this revived th

horrors of the preceding night. Elsie felt certain th

What could she do? 

"I don't want to go without Mother."

" What you want is not the point in consideration.

We know what is the best for you. You will be ready .

to start with me to-morrow morning. No more non- 

sense, if you please. As for you, Mrs. Silvertung, you 

do very wrong to allow your daughter to be so self- 

willed. Obedience is theolnly virtue a woman needs. 

You must answer for this to the Lord; but we will 

speak of it at a more convenient time. Do not forget 

to-morrow morning."

The elder said this in a no-appeal manner, and then 

walked out. 

"See, Elsie," pleaded Mrs. S., " how you get me  ;

into trouble with your self-will! The elder will not 

forget, and it is I who must suffer. Ah I but it is a

heavy cross. And Elsie, I want you to go to town; it ~'

that even a hint of such infamy must never come first :

from her lips.

Answer me, Elsie; what other motive can he have ?"








<pb n="193"/>
THE   ELDER   MAKES A     MOVE.       198

Elsie knew not what to say. Thon a bright thought  r

came to her. She answered:

"To take me away from ry only friend, my dear

Brother Menly. But we won't say anything more

about it. What shall I do to get ready ?"

There was but little preparation to make, yet that

little kept Elsie very busy. Whenever she tried to

steal away to say good-bye to her mentor, she was

always recalled by her mother or by the elder, who

seemed to be continually watching her movements.

Another sleepless night. Black.circles formed under

Elsie's eyes.

She rose at the first glimpse of dawn, in the hope

of finding Brother M. at the Retreat; but early as it

was she found her mother up and the breakfast in

preparation. Elsie's assistance was required for num-

berless services, then the elder came in, and Elsie was

forced to abandon all hopes of seeing her friend.

As the moment of separation drew near, the hearts

of mother and child grew heavy; yet it was not so

much the parting as the terror of the future that made

Elsie cling to her mother in tearful agony.  .

The sound of wagon-wheels told them that tlelast    -

moment had arrived. 

"My child, what shall I do without you?" cried

the mother, as she clasped Elsie in her arms.

"Come, come, you women; don't make fools of

yourselves. I have no time to waste in silliness."

The sound of the elder's voice iced all Elsie's affec-

tion. She drew away from her mother, and, immobile

as a statue, awaited the next order.

"Now, then, jump in, Elsie, You will soon see

youj mother; so there's no use to spoil your eyes with

crying about her."

#        XElsie obeyed. The horses started-the girl turned

N   to take one last look. As she did so, she caught sight

of a dust-stained, rough-looking tramp, who seemed to

be watching the departure with uncommon interest.

Elsie started involuntarily.

The elder's family of four wives and seventeen

children were assembled to see Elsie start. The good-

byes were prolonged till the sound of the voices died

away in the distance. Still Elsie gazed. One spot es-

pecially attracted her. It was the ravine of the tor-

rent-the sacred retreat in heremory,-and near

the retreat, standing out in bold relef against the gray

rocks, was the solitary figure of a man. It was Brother 

Menly.

Elsie waved him a Obwell.

Often in after years the scene would burst uponl

her with the vividness of reality. Again she would

see every detail of that picture-the mountains, so

grim and stern-the gray, desolate plain-the isolated,

sorrowful figure of Brother Menly-the forlorn adobe

house before which stood her weeping mother-the

crowd of white-faced, dirty children-the'ragged, des-

perate-looking tramp-the living misery intensified by

the mocking garish sunlight, by the va re and bloom

of orchard and meadows.

CHAPTER XL 

THE TRAMP.

" ':..-.S^AY, friend, is that Brother Hebson ?"

I'~~ !   The speaker was the tramp we have

:-~-||    already noticed.

~'~ ....       "That? No. It is Elder Silvertung,"

answered the person addressed.

"A pretty galthat he has with him. Wife or

daughter ?" 

The tramp wasKnquisitive. Many of the Saints

would have quickly informed him of the fact; but as

it happened, the brother he addressed was very fond

of talking.

"It just happens she ain't neither. She is a step-

daughter; and you are the first one who ever called

Elsie Lascelle pretty."

"Don't admire your taste, myself."

"That's nothing, Brother; there's no accounting

for taste. I suppose that was the mother saying good-

bye."

"Yes, that is her mother. She used to be pretty,

and no mistak, just as pretty as a doll. But that's

years ago. Aifame over about the time of the

hand-cart expedion. Good-day, Brother."

.  ramp appearde he lost in thought, so much

' so t Vle  did not return the parting salute of the gos-

aipy brother.

The next movement of the tramp looked supicious.

He walked up to the door of Mrs. Mary Silvertung's

apartment, and knocked.








<pb n="196"/>
196               THE TRAMP. 

"My good lady, will you give me a drink of '

water?"                     .

Mss. Silvertung, instead of replying, dropped into a 

chair, iembling from head to foot, just as if she had ;

heard or seen a ghost. Perhaps she had. Many, many 

ghosts confront us during life-ghosts of dead hopes,

dead aspirations, dead loves, and dead happiness. 

"I'm feared I skeered ye, lady."

The tramp now spoke in a gruff voice, very dif-

ferent to the tone of his first speech. The gruffness

seemed to reassure the frightened woman. She looked

up and saw a rough-looking man, gray, grim, travel-

stained, a battered hat was drawn over his eyes, a

thick unkempt beard concealed mouth and chin, his

face (all that remained visible) bore deep, terrible scars.

He must have held a charmed life to have survived such

wounds.

"I didn't mean to skeer ye. I know I ain't very 

handsome. The Indians spoiled my beauty long ago."

"Poor man. No, your looks didn't frighten me; 

but that voice," she continued as if speaking to herself, :

"that voice, but then he is dead, yes, dead." Then *

.she said aloud, "I feel rather weak and fanciful this

morning. You asked me for some water; I have never

refused that yet-I will get some." Saying this, Mrs.

Silvertung took up an empty pail.

"Just give me that ere bucket. No woman draws

water for Jim Tracy while he has the use of his arms.

Show me where to get it, I'll fill that there pail toe" 

(pointing to another empty one), "cause ye'll want it '

all when ye come to do up the chores."

The tramp, directed by Mrs. Silvertung, returned

with two pails of water brimming full. This kind act








<pb n="197"/>
THE TRAMP.                  197

won the woman's heart. -She placed on the table a

bowl of milk, with some fresh-made bread and butter,

for the man's breakfast.

" Hard country this ere for women."

"Yes, it is hard for all; but I suppose  e Lord

knows what is best for us."

"Don't ye wish to get back to yer old home ?"  X:"

" Go back to Babylon and be lost ! That would be 

terrible," said the woman, shuddering.

"Excuse me, ma'am, I didn't know that ye belonged

to the Church of these parts. No offense, I hope, '

ma'am."

"None at all."

"That were yer darter that went away just now?"

"Yes; her step-father has taken her to town."

"Is she a Mormon ?"

"Yes, and I hope she will be a good Saint. Her

step-father wants to put her to school. Is he not

good ? She was not learning anything here, and then,

too, there were bad influences."

Mrs. Silvertung felt she was doing wrong to talk

this way with a stranger, but she felt powerless to

resist. A group of children came in, and eyed the

tramp curiously.

" These yer children, ma'am ?"

" Only two ; the others belong to the other wives."

"My father has five wives," said a boy of ten, in a

boastful tone, as if he had said five houses, "and," he

continued, " Aunt Mary is the fourth, ain't you, Aunt

Mary ?"

The woman turned away and the tramp fancied he

saw her wiping off a tear. It was all fancy, no doubt.

This tramp was given to fancies; for as he looked at

room, there rose before him a vision of a dainty pkrlor f

framing a graceful figure of a lovely woman, clad in i

trailing robes of shimmering blue, perfumed roses

nestling in her hair and on her snowy bosom, by her

,. side a bright-eyed, white-robed, laughing sprite, the ^

sun and the sunbeam of a happy home.

A strange vision for a tramp; but he was a queer

tramp, without even an appetite.

"Wall, I must be off on my journey. Many

thanks, my good lady."

Yet the man lingered at the door as if loth to go.

Again he spoke to Mrs. Silvertung:

"Excuse me speaking so; but wouldn't ye like to

get out of this ere place, if ye had a good chance ?"

"No, no. I am dead to the past-dead-dead,"

murmured Mrs. S., more to herself than to the man,

who moved off slowly, muttering as he went, "Dead,

dead I"

CHAPTER XIL

THE BUTTERFLY AND THE PISTOL.

HE tramp followed the direction taken by

the elder.  He soon arrived at a point

where a road, or rather a wagon trail lead-

ing to some mines, connected with the

main road, and a few yards beyond a narrow path led

up the mountain to a snall canyon.

There he found the elder engaged. in very earnest

conversation with some mining men.'

'            AND   THE    PISTOL.            199

l cannot stay any longer," said the elder. "I

' ha4-already delayed nearly an hour; but I will re-

turd to-morrow night." '

.' "For certain, to-morrow night."

" Yes. Be at my house in the village to-morrow

night about eight o'clock."

"' All right," replied the men. "To-morrow night."

The wind shrieked the words in the tramp's ear-

to-morrow night !

He hissed-back, to-morrow night I

He then looked at the fast disappearing vehicle,

then at the trail, by following which he might meet

the travelers on the main road, as the latter made a

long detour round a spur of the mountain.

The tramp looked but once, then ran up the moun-

tain path, repeating ever, as he hurried along: "To-

morrow night, to-morrow night." Then he drew forth

from an inner pocket, a small, beautifully wrought

pistol, which glistened in the sunlight as though it

were a thing of life, and not an instrument of

death.

The tramp gazed at it lovingly, tenderly. "Art

thou tired of waiting, little friend ? Well, only one

day more, and then thy destiny shall be fulfilled.

Only a few hours,-until to-morrow night. But why

not to-day ?-yes, why not now ? To-morrow night

may never come."

The thought lent fresh speed to his steps; he

-seemed to fly, his gaze riveted on the pistol.

" Yes, all is ready : then to-day my revenge."

The deadly toy seemed to smile in answer; but it

was only the glint of the sunbeams as they danced

over the shining' metal. Attracted by the sparkle, a

butterfly lit upon the pistol's mouth,-joyous life

playing in the jaws of death

It was a very trifling incident; but trifles are the

axles upon which turn the wheels of destiny. This

caprice of the butterfly awoke a dormant conscience.

The tramp stopped. A smile lit up his face and

chased away the cruel shadows lurking there; for the

sight of the pretty insect brought vividly to his mind

a legend that once charmed him,-in the days of his

youth-in the long ago. " The butterfly ! 'tis the em-

blem of the soul," he murmured. " HIas then, some

friendly spirit left its home to watch over me ?" He

sighed, the smile vanished; but the pistol was re-

turned to its hidingaace. The disturbed butterfly

hovered around the ian, poising itself here and there

on his arms and shoulders, then finally rested upon his

hat. Over the gray mountain trail hurried the man.

Along the road came the light wagon wherein sat

Elsie and the elder. The latter hummed a tune.

When the tramp's ear caught the sound, his eyes

flashed, he leaped along the trail, he gained the road;

the light wagon  ape in sight and the tramp's right

hand sought " that friend" lying close to his breast.

"Revenge at last !" be cried; but again the butterfly

diverted his attention. The pale-winged insect fasci-

nated the rough, scarred man, who, forgetting his re-

venge, watched its movements as it circled round him

twice, then winging its flight towards the wagon, it

alighted on Elsie's shoulder.

The man started, as the girl's pale, troubled face

turned towards him; and the mute appeal of her sad

eyes thrilled his soul. That look cred out unto him,

"I'm in the toils; help me !" and the man's awakened

soul answered, "I will help you." His right hand

dropped empty by his ide. "I must help her," he

murmured, "and a blood-stained hand can not give

help."

The wagon passed on,-the elder still hummed

merrily, the butterfly flitted from Elsie back to its

first friend, the tramp. The latter stood gazing upon

the vehicle till. it was out of sight, then he took the

trail. His head was bent, seemingly in deep thought;

and a word his lips muttered ever and again, sug-

gested a predominating idea. That word was " money,"

-money, the potent talisman, the all-conquering

sword of the nineteenth century.

At length the tramp fouii*imself upon the spot

where he had heard the wors, "- to-morrow night,"

and once again commenced the struggle.

Revenge regained the ascendency; he muttered,

"Why not to-morrow ?"

His brain seemed on fire,-he took off his hat to

wipe his brow; this movement disturbed the butterfly.

It stretched its wings, fluttered about the man, then

flew down the road leading to tb mines. The man

looked fondly after the insect, to him, a wanderer, it

was a friend. -.Perhaps the butterfly also felt lonely

upon the desert, and wanted a companion ; for it soon

returned, hovered round the man, then flew off again

in the same direction, then back and forth, as if it

would say, "Come, friend, follow me."

" And I will follow thee, strange butterfly," cried

the man  "once this morning thou hast brought me

good, now, perhaps, thou wilt bring me fortune."

202        JOURNEYlrG     TO  TOWN.

CHAPTER      XIIL

JOURNEYING TO TOWN.

1.    . .FTEN had Elsie pictured to herself a trip to

town. Next to escape, it was her most

cherished desire, and many an hour had

she spent painting every detail of the trip

in the most brilliant hues of youthful imagination.

How different was the reality ! Separated from

her mother, in the power of the man she hated,

knowing his secret designs, and dreading that this

trip was only a pretext for the better furtherance of

his scheme,-the girl suffered tortures.  How she

envied the birds, and the lizards ! they all seemed so

free and happy.

There was no hope, unless Brother Menly was a

true prophet and God would help her.

It was a most miserable journey. The only relief

was the memory of the tramp. Of him Elsie thought

often, and always as a friend. From the moment she

started at seeing him watching her departure, her

mind interested itself in him. This interest was very

much intensified by his second appearance upon the

road. Evidently he had awaited them. For what

purpose? Why had he gazed upon her so intently ?

Would he meet her again ?

These problems excited Elsie's natural curiosity;

her thoughts became less somber, less concentrated

upon self.

The elder was in a very happy mood. At first he

tried to conciliate Elsie by polite attentions, but her

gloomy sadness repelled him. He very naturally at-








<pb n="203"/>
JO7URNEYING    TO  TOWN.           203

tributed this sadness to the separation from her mother

-a sorrow that would soon wear off, if let alone; and,

as he disliked the role of sympathizer, he soon left

Elsie to her own thoughts, and amused himself with

reflections upon his actual prosperity and in projecting

schemes for its increase.

Everything went well with this zealous servant of

the Lord. If sometimes the doom pronounced against

him on Mountain Meadows affrighted his memory, he

soon laughed away the superstitious dread, for bless-

ings, not curses, seemed to be his portion. Riches,

power, and a numerous progeny, were his. What

more could a Saint desire ?

The idea that now possessed him in regard to Elsie

promised to afford him much amusement and pleasure.

To own her in spite of her dislike, to break that

proud spirit, would indeed be delightful. However,

he was in no hurry. He would wait to see whether

her beauty would be worth the trouble. Then, too,

she must receive some little accomplishment. He

could afford an ornamental wife.

So in silence they rode along, the man laughing,

the girl sighing,-on towards Zion; both indifferent

to the grand beauties of the mountain scenery through

which they passed ; one blinded by sensual egotism,

the other by sorrow.

But when they emerged from the mountain-pass on

to the plain where stands the city of Zion, Elsie forgot

all in ecstasy as she gazed upon the glorious scene be-

fore her.

At her feet lay the city, the oasis in the desert; its

tree-lined streets, its blooming orchards, looked in the

distance, like a fairy lake of amber-tinted green and

silvery gray; upon it floated masses of purple, pink,

and white foam, out of which rose the buildings, like

so many islets. A gray belt of desert encircled the

city, enhancing, by contrast, its beauteous verdure.

Away in the distance, the waters of the great Salt

Lake gleamed in the sunlight like a golden mirror,

reflecting the savage beauty of the cedar heights;

while around on every side, arose, in silent majesty,

the snow-clad peaks of the Wasatch.

The traveler, satiated with nature's loveliness,

would have declared it a scene of surpassing beauty.

To unsophisticated Elsie, it was one of heavenly

splendor. Words died on her lips; a gentle sadness,

akin to heavenly joy, took the place of despair.

But the beauteous scene began to fade. Mrs. Lucy

Silvertung received Elsie somewhat ungraciously;

and the first night spent in town was as miserable as

the preceding ones.

But the next morning Mrs. Oreana, the reigning

favorite, called to see the child of her old friend. She

was so much pleased with Elsie that she carried her

off to the Beehive House for a few days, and then

insisted that Elsie should take lessons with the

"royal" children. When Mrs. Lucy saw how atten-

tive the powers were to Elsie, she deemed it best to

be gracious; and when Elsie returned from the

"royal" house, Aunt. Lucy met her in the most

affectionate manner, and Elsie suddenly found herself

of very great importance.

The elder came and went, without hinting his

intentions by either word or sign. Elsie began to

think she must have been mistaken. Perhaps it was

a feint on the part of the elder to save her from

/'.

Brother Smith, without giving that worthy direct

offense. The more Elsie thought of this the more she

felt certain it was so. How easy it is to believe any

thing that we earnestly desire !

Once persuaded of her mistake, Elsie commenced

to enjoy the pleasant life opening to her.

In her new home she saw none of the horrors of

Mormonism. The house was pretty and nicely fur-

nished, the table well supplied, and Mrs..Lucy ele-

gantly dressed.

Elsie's wardrobe underwent a great change. The

sun-bonnet disappeared altogether, much to Elsie's de-

light. Her new dresses were various and tasteful;

her friends gave her numerous presents, and for the

first time she knew the pleasure of possessing ribbons,

trinkets, and pretty things.

Then her lessons delighted her. She was freed

from toil, and could walk when she pleased, read,

study, or play.

Often, indeed, the tears would flow at the thought

of her mother, and her cheek would flush at the cruel

injustice of polygamy. He heart would yearn for her

old friend Brother Menly, whose wise counsels had so

often befriended her, the friend whom no one could

replace, not even Mrs. Oreana, who had inspired Elsie

with the most enthusiastic devotion. Still Elsie was

young, her. heart was buoyant, her life pleasant.

Therefore it was impossible to be unhappy.

206          SISTER  SARAH D.ILY.

CHAPTER XIV.

SISTER SARAH DINLY.

HE next event in this drama was Sister

Dinly's party. Not that the party was one

like those recorded  in the annals of

fashion. Indeed, as a party it was scarcely

worth mentioning. But if this social gathering was

commonplace in itself, the hostess, the occasion of

the party, and its results, were unique and extraordi-

nary. Sister Sarah Dinly was decidedly peculiar ac-

cording to received ideas; but holy in repute was she

among the Saints. Apostles pointed her out as a shin-

ing light, and bade tls lukewarm follow her glorious

example. She was president of the Relief Society of

Josephville, secretary of the Woman's Co-operative

Society, and chief spokeswoman of the Saintesses.

Her portly figure, bright eyes, and dictatorial manner

appeared delightfully refreshing among the sad,

pinched, wan faces of our previous acquaintances.

Sister Sarah was not a beauty. A sharp nose, large

features, sallow complexion and loud voice are not -,

attributes of beauty. But she was a go-ahead woman

and a Saint. Sanctity and go-aheaditiveness can dis-

pense with beauty, and they generally do.

Sister Dinly was an apostle of marriage-plural

marriage. She had commenced at the early age of

eighteen by marrying John Dinly, a bashful, timid

young man. Next, she tried to marry off her acquaint-

ances.- The moment she heard of a religion whose

great feature was much marrying, she hastened to em-

brace it; and, with her husband, came to Zion.








<pb n="207"/>
SISTER   SARAH DINLY.             207

Her dream was to reign queen over a harem. But

here she was balked by her husband's perverseness.

To please her he had been baptized-he had come to

Zion. But another wife-when he found one altogether

too much-frightened him into firmness; and he said

no, for the first time in his life. In vain she urged

upon him the necessity of building up the kingdom,

and brought counsel to bear upon him. He was deaf

and blind. Then she represented to him the labor that

devolved upon her, the only wife.

"Hire another gal," was the imperturbable answer.

She then talked to him of the humiliation awaiting

them in the next world.

"Peace in this is all I ask."  Poor Dinly I It was

a vain asking, as long as there iras an unmarried girl

that pleased Sister Sarah's fancy.

Many a time, returning from his work, he would

take a furtive glance through the window to see if

any of the fair sex kept his wife company; in which

case he would slink away unperceived, and trust to

chance to supply his evening meal.

Once only did he have a respite. This was when

Sister Sarah was marrying off her children. The mat-

rimonial business of her neighbors not being of such

vital importance, allowed her plenty of time to plan

and make attacks upon Brother Dinly's peace.

She never wearied of her labors; and how much

she did labor to find wives for her husband, none but

the angels knew. Blondes and brunettes; shrinking,

violet-eyed nymphs, and laughing, brown-eyed houris;

sisters grown wise in experience, and innocent dar-

lings; prayerful maidens, and mischief-loving sprites;

good girls, naughty girls, smart girls, silly girls; little








<pb n="208"/>
208         8IsTEBR  SARAH DIILY.

and big, plump and slender, she had found and offered

to her husband, as of old Sara offered Hagar to

Abraham.

Suddenly Sister Sarah left off struggling with her

husband. She let him go his own way. She grew

silent. Brother Dinly rejoiced. Foolish Dinly; he

had never studied human nature, or he would have

quaked; for, in women and children, silence means

mischief.

Sister Dinly, finding it impossible to marry off her

husband, was meditating marrying herself to some one

else, high up in the kingdom.

But there were several things to consider. She

wished to be made joint queen with the first wife:

the idea of being sixth or seventh did not suit her.

Neither did she wish to relinquish her position, for

Brother Dinly was well-to-do in the world, and the

luxuries of this life are not to be despised.

A luminous idea gradually dawned upon her. One

day she informed her husband that she wished to go

to town    visit her daughter. She could not have

had a wish more delightful to Brother John, who

did all he could to facilitate her departure.  The

only question he asked was, "How long she would

be gone ?"

"Two months; perhaps longer. I have a great

deal of Church business to attend to, several friends

to visit, and I shall be baptized for Queen Elizabeth

and a few others. So you see I have a great deal to

do. I am not a do-nothing like you."

With this parting thrust she left.








<pb n="209"/>
THE   LOVERS' WALK.             209

CHAPTER XV.

THE LOVES' WALK.

HE Temple Block in Salt Lake City is avery

pleasant promenade. The sidewalks are

always in good order. The stream run-

ning by is ever clear and pure, and the

lofty trees make refreshing shade, even in a July mid-

day. It is often called " The Lovers' Walk;" and on

a moonlight evening numerous couples may be seen,

attentive only to each other; for although polygamy

excludes real love, it includes courting, and very much

of it. Hence, the " Lovers' Walk" is quite necessary.

A week or so after Sister Dialy's arrival in town,

one bright, moonlight evening, a couple were prom-

enading the "Lover's Walk."   The lady appeared

more advanced in years and experience than the usual

class of wooed damsels; moreover, she seemed in dis-

tress of mind, for she held a handkerchief to her eyes.

The gentleman seemed to be endeavoring to comfort

her. In this effort he was quite successfst for soon

the lady restored the handkerchief to her pocket, and

took the gentleman's arm. The conversation became

absorbing, and when the twain parted, under the shade

of the spreading locust, their parting embrace was a

little too warm for purely fraternal affection. The

lady was Sister Dinly; the gentleman, one Brother

Simpson, the proud possessor of four wives and numer-

ous children.

The next day Sister Dinly arrayed herself in her

very best, a bright red dress, crimson shawl, and a hat

trimmed with white ribbons, an orange feather, and

210          THE LOVERS' WALK. 

bunches of cherries and grapes. She made a very im-  .

posing figure, her huge crinoline taking up most of the

sidewalk.

As she walked up Main street her smiles faded and

a look of trouble darkened her face. The climax had

arrived.

Sister Dinley had found the man who could exalt

her in the kingdom-a man also rather pleasant to

look upon-an important factor when eternity is in

consideration. The man was willing; but Sister Dinly

had principles-principles that must be scrupulously

observed.

She had constituted herself a judge, an authority

in all the intricacies and etiquette of plural marriage;

she had drawn upa code for the benefit of her sisters,

and she felt in honor bound to scrupulously obey its

statutes.

Now, according to this code, wife number one had

the right to choose her husband's subsequent wives.

Therefore, she could not be sealed to Brother Simpson

without the consent and approbation of his wife num-

ber one. Fortunately, this lady was a particular friend

and pupil of Sister Dinly. Still it was a trying matter

to broach the subject; it filled her mind with a vague

unpleasantness. While pondering over the ways and

means to introduce the subject to Mrs. S., she suddenly

met the very person.

"Why, Sister Dinly, you in town, and not called

upon us I"

"Ah, Sister Simpson, it was just because I have

been thinking about you so much that I did not call."

"Well, that is a queer excuse."

"Yes, dear, things are queer now; and I was








<pb n="211"/>
THE   LOVERS' WALK              211

a-coming to consult with you when you found me."

Sister Dinly sighed.

"I do hope you ain't in trouble."

" That's it, dear; I am in trouble."

"Well, then, tell me all about it, and if I can help,

rely upon me."

"That is just like you, Sister Simpson. I knew

your great heart. But we can't discuss the matter

here on the streets."

"No, certainly. You will come with me home."

Discoursing upon less important subjects theyeoon

reached the house of Sister Simpson.

Sister Simpson No. 4 lived under the careful eye of

No. 1, who thus kept the powers of priority and nov-

elty in her own hands.

For this secret, so useful in polygamous house-

holds, she was indebted to Sister Dinly.

"You see, Sister Dinly, your instructions are good.

Brother Simpson makes this his home. He only visits

the others, and his visits are short. We get along fa-

mously."

"Ah I Sister Simpson, how I envy you."

"Envy me I la, now, you are joking."

"No, indeed, I envy you. Think what you will be

in the Celestial Kingdom ! Then think of me after all

my labors,-nowhere I all on account of man's per-

versity. The thought of it is killing me. I can't

sleep for worrying about it. Then too, you are quite

a lady, waited on by so many sister wives, while I

have to do everything."

"It is hard, certainly; still perhaps it would be

worse: 'tain't very comfortable always; some don't

get along at all."








<pb n="212"/>
"81 That           th      t .w T      tL mALK.

"That is because they don't know how tp manage:

with us it is very different. As for me, I,.am actually

ashamed of Dinly's remissness. But that ain't all, dear:

lately I have had strange dreams, I might even say

-revelations, that trouble me greatly."

"Why, Sister Dinly, I should'be delighted to have

a revelation."    *

"But if it toldji. to do something almost impos-

sible,-something vMy difficult to do." 

" Difficult ! Don't the Lord always make it easy ? I

thought, dear sister, you. were brave ?"

"Yes, dear, I'd do it immediately, if it rested with

me; but this will of the Lord can only be done with

your consent."

"With my consent I You surprise me more and

more; but rest assured, I shall never oppose a revela-

tion. What is it, dear ?"

"Ah," replied Sister Dinly, excitedly seizing the

hand of Sister Simpson, "it has been made clear to me

that my exaltation in the kingdom entirely depends

upon my being sealed to Brother Simpson."

"Sealed to Brother Simpson?" Sister Simpson

looked blank. Sister Sarah Dinly for a friend was

very nice; but for a sister wife-it was altogether ,

different.

Mrs. Dinly read her friend's thoughts.

"You see, dear, I wouldn't leave Brother Dinly;

it would break his heart; he thinks the world on me;

and I might be the means of saving him yet. No, I

never will leave Brother Dinly. But-"

Sister Simpson's brow cleared.

"But," continued Sister Dinly, "don't you remem-

ber the case of Sister B- , who was sealed to Bishop








<pb n="213"/>
THE 'LOSRt     WALK.           218

W-, and-yet remained with her husband? Now.

why oouldn't I, without leaving Brother Dinly, be

sealed to your husband for eternity ? If I could be

made a joint queen with you in Bishop Simpson's

kingdom (think of my exaltation in eternity), I should

then worry no more."

Sister Simpson was smiling nob. A sealing for

eternity was very different frowm ealing for time.

"Well, dear Sister, I don't.&We why you shouldn't

be sealed to Husband for eternity" (a great stress on

the eternity). "If every one is willing, I'm sure I

am; and what Sister B-       did, certainly you can

do."

"God bless you, dear Sister, I knew you would

help me. Will you break it to Brother Simpson ? You

know, dear, that it is your right; and I wouldn't, for

worlds, encroach upon your rights, which are our

rights."

" Just like you, Sister Dinly, always upholding our

rights. I'll speak to the bishop this very day."

"Another thing, dear; I don't want this matter

spoken of. If Brother Dinly should hear of It, his

feelings might be hurt, and I want peace and good-

will around me; so please don't mention it to the

other wives."

"Not a word, dear; rely upon me."

Thus it was all arranged for Sister Dinly's happi-

ness. The sealing took place, and Bishop S. did not

look any way oppressed by it. Sister Simpson No.

1 never knew of the moonlight stroll around

"Lover's Walk ;" and Brother Dinly remained in

blissful ignorance of his wife's sealing operation. So

all were happy. Neither did Sister Dinly dread any

Y dear Lucy," said Mrs. Dinly topter

daughter, Mrs. Silvertung No. 5, "I

do feel so happy. I have managed to

make my eternal exaltation sure."

"Glad to hear it."

"I know you are, my dear, and we really should

give a little party. Let me see, we will have that dear

Brother Simpson and his wives--"

"Not all, Mother ?"

"Oh, no, dear, only Emily and Alice; they live

together, you know; then Brother Delville and my

adopted daughter, his number three."

liar, but then you are peculiar too, Elsie; and bless

me, why I had forgotten, didn't you and he run away

together some ten years ago. Quite a little romance.

Woh't it be nice ? You shall be a queen, my little

ought at least to have six wives. So put down Stan-

ly's name. There, never mind me, Elsie, it is only a

joke; he won't so much as look at you-more's the

pity; for this Stanly hates all our sex, especially

girls: Doesn't he, Lucy'?'

The match-maker gave a sly look at her daughter,

as much as to say:

"Don't you see my trick ?"

frs. Lucy understood, and was silent. She did

not sympathize with her mother's mania.

"And Sister Silea, we must not forget her, the

most gifted of our women. She will represent the

President's family."

"We ought to invite Brother Lewis, who has just

returned from a mission."

"Let him come, he will entertain us; and there's

that beautiful new-comer, Sister Laima; and of course

you will invite the elder; so that's all settled."

The invitations were given and accepted. In those

good old times the Saints never dreamed of refusing

an hIvitation. 

The ladies, Brother Simpson, and the missionary,

came early. In the afternoon, other gentlemen drops

ped in as early as business permitted. It was a very

nice party; every one in the most amiable qmod, that

is, if smiling is any evidence of amiability. Still the

pleasure was marred by a certain anxiety and preoc-

cupation, which appeared in the manner of many of

the guests. 

The rival wives were engrossed in watching each

other, so that no one should take more than her share

of the attentions of the husband; and he, not daring

to speak to one, for fear of offending the others,








<pb n="216"/>
216        SIBTER   DINYL'S PARTY. 

ignored the wifely trio, and devoted himself to Elsie

and Laima.

The hostess bestowed all her smiles and attentions

upon Brother Simpson, tdfthe evident discomposure

of Mrs. Simpson No. i1rkw.     no doubt thought

that her friend ought to wait tor the arrival of eter-

nity. Brother Simpson seemed to enjoy this "time"

demonstration, although his glances wandered in

Laima's direction more than Mrs. Dinly considered

allowable by the polygamic code.

The lady was troubled. She felt angry that she

had invited this girl, who seemed to turn everyone's

head; for there was the missionary, whose adventures

ought to have been the capital stock of the conversa-

tion, entirely absorbed in Laima; and Sister Silea, the

gifted, who was supposed to despise everything ex-

cept mind, and who knew every interesting item of

the past, present, and future of Desert, she also

seemed wholly occupied with some great idea inspired

by Laima's bright eyes.

And Laima certainly was very handsome-wickedly,

saucily handsome.  Her figure, slightly above the

medium height, was beautifully framed, perhaps a

shade too voluptuous; but in Zion this was a charm,

not a fault. But Laima's greatest attraction was her'

rich coloring; half blonde, half brunette, every fea-

ture glowed and sparkled. Then she tossed her small

shapely head with such a charming air of defiance;

this toss, added to the infinitesimal celestial tendency

of a pretty nose, gave to her beauty a piquancy alfo.

gether irresistible.

Women generally disliked Laima; and the moment

she entered room Elsie hated her. But this antipabhy








<pb n="217"/>
SISTER   DINLY'S PARTY.            l17

decreased when she found that Stanly was not be-

witched by the glowing belle; for Elsie, piqued by

Mrs. Dinley's remark about Stanly's non-susceptibil-

ity, had determined to mnke a conquest of him. Lit-

tle she dreamed thattq.p ls already conquered, that

the remembrance of litSe'Elsie made him indifferent

to the charms of Zion's belles.

Elsie's memories of Stanly were very vague, yet

they were tender. Stanly was once her friend, her

confidant; together they had watched for the one who

never came, together they had sought escape from this

hated place. Yes, Elsie remembered, but that was all

so long ago, it seemed to her like a different exist-

ence.

Stanly, who hated parties, eagerly accepted Mrs.

Dinly's invitation.

Was that tall, graceful, dignified girl little Elsie of

old ? And that moustached young athlete, could it be

the boy playmate? For a few moments they stood

dumbly looking at each other, bashful, embarrassed,

then Sister Dinly went to the rescue.

"Well, Elsie, did you think that that nice little

boy who used to play with your kitten would ever turn

into such a. fierce-looking creature who won't even

smile when he meets a fair sister."

" Sister Dinly, please don't give me such a morose

character to this young lady, who no doubt has for-

gotten all that passed ten years ago."

"I haven't quite forgotten," answered Elsie,

laughing. That laugh put the young people some-

what at their ease. They chatted about old times, and

found the party delightful.

When all were assembled, and the conversation

10








<pb n="218"/>
218        SISTER   DINLY'8 PARTY.. 

was flagging on account of the engrossing interest in

Laima, gaiety was restored by the announcement of

supper.

"And after supper we will have a dance," cried

Mrs. Dinly.

Eating has a wonderful influqnce on the spirits.

The Saints are not unlike other people in this respect,

and they did ample justice to the very substantial re-

past, which in more pretentious circles would have

been called dinner. 

;; ~v   Among a people whose church includes politics,

business, and every life interest, the conversation must

necessarily be churchy; and if these people seem to

talk in a canting style, it is because they could not do

otherwise unless they avoided every subject of interest. 

"Brother Delville," said Elder Silvertung, "this

co-operative revelation is a grand thing. I suppose

you are one of the chiefs in the business."

"Not I. I have too much to do to attend to my

own affairs, and I don't think it will be a success."

"Why,. Brother Delville, what's the matter with

you? Why, of course it will be a success. Every-

thing the Church does is a success. If the Lord does

not know how to manage things I should like to know

who does. I thought you would go right into it as

"All right; let him show his zeal. It is time he

did. I have shown mine for many a year. I'll stick

to my own this time."

"But surely you wouldn't make an enemy of the

Lord, and offend our dear President ?" chimed in Sister ,i

Silea.

"No danger, my good sister; and as for offending

the President, he couldn't afford to get angry with me.

See what I have done for him. Then look at Oreana,

who is like my own daughter. No woman ever influ-

enced him as she does. Why, he adores the ground

she walks on.. I af all right in that quarter."

Sister Silea winced at this allusion to Oreana; the

reign of the favorite was the drop of bitterness in

Silea's cup of saintly joy.

Brother Delville knew it; it was an intentional 7 

wound, a'little revenge on the sex for the domestic  '

miseries he suffered.

Sister Silea, the gifted senior wife of the President,

said miothing, but the look she gave her tormentor

boded no good. 

The elder saw this look, and smiled.

" Well," continued he, "I think the church can do

without us."

"A mistake, brother; you, and Brother Simpson,

and Brother Silvertung, in fact all of us, support the

church; we are its pillars. I am a pillar, and a big

one too."    t

Brother Delville said this pompously; showing

the bull-dogism of his English nature, its disagreeable-

ness intensified by prosperity.

" Come, my friends," cried the hostess, "the dance-

you forget the dance; but before we go, what say you

about getting up a pic-nic to the lake for next week."

"Delightful," exclaimed Stanly.

" So I say," replied Sister Dinly, "and I leave it in

your hands, young man. Talk it over, but don't let it

end in talk. Now, Brdther Simpson, shall we set these

young people a good example ?"

220              THE HAREM. 

"Certainly, my dear sister, a good, lively quadrille."

The couple walked off, followed by the company.

Sister Simpson, number one,looked very black.

"I shall just tell Sister Dinly that this is time, pot

eternity," grumbled the lady, as she took a back seat.

The excitement of the dance did not prevent Sister

Silea's cultivation of the belle of the evening. Before

they separated, Laima promised to spend the next day

with Sister Silea.

The conquest of this distinguished lady very much

delighted Laima, who desired for many reasons to

become a visitor at the Lion House.

The party broke up at ten o'clock. Such was the

saintly custom; for the chief, though an advocate of

dancing and theatrical amusements, insisted upon early

hours.

Judging from the triumphant smiles of Sister Silea

and Laima, the quiet joy of Elsie, and Stanly's happy  J

whistle, the party was a very pleasant one to some of

the guests.

It was an epoch in the lives of many in Zion.

CHAPTER     XVII.

THE HAREM.

:B«i1 ~ HE most interesting spot in Zion, or at least

A           THE HAREM.                  221

Now, a wall is a direct challenge, an insult to the

social, liberty-loving spirit of the age. A fence should

be sacred from invasion; but a wall-bah ! A prize

to the one who scalest.' So thinks the traveler as he

goes up South Temple street, twisting, turning, stretch-

ing his neck till it aches, trying to look upon the other

side of the wall.

And what does he see ? An immense yard with

numerous buildings, sheds, and a few cottages; then,

a two-story house, or rather two contiguous houses,

painted a dull yellow. They have queer little gables

in front, and over the portico of the larger house is a

representation of a bee-hive, while over the other a lion

couchant keeps watch. Just beyond the Lion House

the wall opens, forming a large, arched gateway, over

which a stony eagle spreads its wings. Passing through

the Eagle Gate, the explorer finds himself upon a road

leading to the highland, called the Bench. On each

side of the road rises a wall. In the one on the left

are several gates, through which may be seen glimpses

of gardens, of vast granaries and cattle-houses, to

whose shelter at evening-close come a goodly herd of

fat, glossy beeves and kine. Further on, a rushing,

foaming, mountain stream gives vigorous life to the

huge machinery of busy mills.

But there is nothing remarkable in these things

except it be 'the wall, with its vain attempt at pillar-

making, which gives it a dropsical look. Nothing re-

markablel Why, in all the land it stands alone !

Civilization stares at it in astonishment.  It is the

stronghold of the American Mohammed.

Grandmother.

That yard is the tithing-yard of legendary fame,

where beings, neither feathered nor four-footed, have

bled in various ways.

These gardens, granaries, herds, these busy mills,

are the riches of the chief. Behold his harem. Yes,

those dingy, prosaic-looking houses of the Bee-hive

and the Lion are the seraglio of the Modern Mo-

hammed.

A harem   The most lethargic imagination rouses

at the sound, and bids arise visions of sculptured halls,

gleaming with tinted marbles and golden arabesques;

of porphyry fountains filling the air with freshness and

music; of jeweled vases emitting aromatic odors;

of hasheesh vapors, laden with Elysian dreams, float-

ing through fantastic chibouques; of beauteous slaves,

wooing gentle zephyrs with perfumed fans, while, on

luxurious couches, recline gazelle-eyed, languishing

Fatimas, bewitching, child-like Dudus and inspired

Zuleikas. Such the harem of the Orient-its repul-

siveness masked 'neath barbaric splendor.

But the harem of the Occident ?

Adobe walls, rough floors, contracted space; here

no perfumes, no slaves, no jewels, no gorgeous sheen,

no lazy dreaming. Ugliness banishes beauty; rude

work replaces the divan; the newspaper and ballot

the chibouque; women who think and work, instead

of dreaming slaves.

O America I nature's wonder-land ! Hast thou ex-

hausted all thy poesy on thy mountains, lakes, rivers

and forests, leaving life so commonplace that even a

harem must be shorn of its dreamy splendor?

But it must be so; for ajharem in America, in the

19th century, is a moral anachronism.

It is at variance with the requirements of civiliza-

tion, with the ruling ideas of the age-which are indi-

vidual freedom and equality of the sexes.

That a beautiful Persian, incapable of thought,

whose heaven is indolence, whose only desires are

sweetmeats, jewels and hasheesh; who never heard of

a soul, of woman's responsibilities, can enjoy all the

happiness of which she is capable, as a nabob's No.

16-or 160-is very possible; but that a spiritual

woman, the evolvement of generations of culture,

should thus uncrown herself, is a mystery. It shows

how much fanaticism can distort the purest mind, and

argues most strongly for a sound philosophical educa-

tion for that very emotional being-woman.

CHAPTER XVIIIm.

SISTER SILEA AT HOME.

NE day our new acquaintance, Laima, en-

tered this unique establishment by the

outer gate, hurried up the steep, narrow

steps, and went into the "Bee Hive"

house without knocking. She passed by the reception

room, ascended the staircase with the air of one be-

longing to the place, and stopped at the door of Sister

Silea's sitting-room.

Sister Silea joyfully welcomed the new-comer,

exclaiming:

"He is coming here,-actually coming. here. See,

right along into my bed-room, take off your 

and fix up your hair. I want you to look your love

I'm so glad you've put on that red dress. It is o8

coming." Running on in this excited manner, 

Silea hurried Laima into the bed-room to prepare

the royal visitor. While the ladies are there, we

inspect the room of the sweet Silea.

This good lady was wont to say, that no

Saint ought to use anything made by Gentiles;

she bewailed exceedingly that necessity forced

sometimes to violate her principles; but as far as

sible she endeavored to carry them out.

Her dress was of home-spun, the straw of

bonnet was plaited by Zion's daughters. The fitt

up of her apartment showed, in a marked degree,.th

laudable purpose. The furniture was home-made, a

of native wood, upholstered in patch-work

tapestry worked by saintly fingers. A rag carpet 

ered the floor, and bright rugs, woven of native w

displayed their unique patterns before the fire-pl

and doors. Home paintings (dis)graced the w.

The mantel-piece, tables, and shelves were orname

with wreaths and vases of flowers in hair, in 

in wax, and numerous other works of curious

anything but artistic.

The ladies had scarcely returned, when a

announced the Lord of the Harem.

What can possibly have brought him? for

familiar tells us that it is not the great man's op

to visit the ancient ladies who bear his name. This

the first time in years that he has stood in 








<pb n="225"/>
SISTER   BILEA  AT HOME,           225

Silea's private room. We Uhrn the cause of his august

presence from a little note in his pocket.

" MY DEAR PBEBIDENT:

"Will you allow me to submit to your criticism

some flower-paintings done' by Sister Laima, whom

you have already been pleased to notice?

"She will bring them this afternoon at 2 P. M.,

aqd will await any time you choose to appoint for an

interview.                      "SISTE SILA."

The President's answer was a message to the effect

that Sister Silea might expect him at 2 P. x.

He had noticed Laima's visits to,the house, and

had publicly spoken of her beauty.

He was faithful to the appointment. The paintings

were examined and admired. The truth was, he only

saw Laima's pretty face. He put off the great man,

and chatted familiarly. The conversation must have

been very interesting, for it kept the visitor nearly all

the afternoon.

Sister Silea could not conceal her triumph. Laima

seemed glad, but for some reason she appeared in a

hurry to go as soon as the President left.

" Well, dear, if you must go, I will say good bye,"

said Silea. "Good bye, Sister. It won't be long be-

fore you will be my sister, indeed."

"Nonsense, Sister Silea; that is naughty."

"It all depends upon you, Laima."

"There, there, good bye."

"Yes, it all depends upon her," said Silea, as she

paced her room; " and she won't refuse, not she, the

minx. A fine scheme. Lady Oreana, you will have

to come down to our level-nay, you will sink below

it, for we were never favorites. Your day is fast de-

clining. I'll punish you for your patronizing airs

The day I tell her of the wedding will be the happiest

day of my life. I wonder whether she will faint."

And Sister Silea actually danced for joy. Poor

woman ! perhaps she too had given all her small store

of affection to this man; perhaps she had suffered

until sweetness had turned to gai.

However, we will not read Sister Silea's heart. It

was not a large one, and, it is certain, she had never

been a pet of her lord's.  She had been a pretty

woman in her day, and had pleased his fancy at a time

when women were rather scarce; then she was a blue-

stocking, and amused the great man.

But when Oreana came to queen it over the harem,

Sister Silea vowed vengeance. Years had not weak-

ened this bitter feeling. Apart from the fact of being  i

the favorite, Silea detested Oreana.

Regal natures are seldom popular; for royalty,

unless it be vailed in sympathy, is an affront to human

nature, which loves better to look down than to look

up.

Oreana felt herself superior to her surroundings,

and did not conceal it; consequently she offended.

Her noble bearing was considered affectation, her 

courtesy appeared condescension, her kindness, patron-

age, her smile an insult, and her dislike to the petty

offices assigned to women was construed into haughty

indifference.

If she were humbjed many would rejoice.

CHAPTER XIX.

A   GLANCE    AT  OBEANA.

_        _REANA still reigns as the favorite sultana. 

Her rooms are larger and handsomer,

than Sister Silea's. Although luxury is

strictly banished, yet an air of elegance

reigns through out. A beautifully-tinted carpet cov-

ers the floor, the furniture shows taste and refinement;

and music, books, and flowers tell of culture. Dainty

curtains shade the windows, and well-chosen pictures

grace the walls. Evidently Oreana does not patronize

home productions.

As we look in, e find her seated at the table

reading.

The beautiful girl we first saw in a rustic pavilion

long years ago, has developed into a dignified, hand-

some matron. Beautiful still, although gone is the

inspiration that then illumined every feature: gone

the heroism that transfigured her on the desert. Years

of association with sordid sensuality have deadened

the soul. Oreana is no longer grand.

Only the divine element, the sympathy born of

pure love could retain its glowing lustre, its life-giving

influence in such. an atmosphere; and this divinity

Oreana did not possess.

She is happy in that her pride is satisfied: she is

united to the one she admired, and still admires above

all men. She loves him; he is the father of her chil-

dren: she has never known poverty or jealously, for

her husband is rich, and she is his favorite. Many

children call her mother, a' gueen is'she in the'

celestial kingdom. Women envy her. Still, at times

a something seemed wanting, a shadow clouded her 

faith, conscience made discords, and jarring memories

disturbed her peace.

But these emotions were only transitory.

She knew not whence they came, or whither they

went; Oreana was not an analyzer of self. Introspec-

tion is an outgrowth of philosophy, not of fanaticism.

w   Neither does this beautiful woman feel the sorrows

' of others. The human hearts around her she knows

nothing of. So she is content and happy.

Through the open window come the sounds of

children's voices; and, standing at the window, ap-

parently absorbed in listening to the children, is Elsie.

- Oreana loves Elsie, and the young girl returns the

affection a hundred fold.

Oreana is too much interested in her book to hear

what is going on; but we, who are on the alert for

sounds in the harem, catch a very characteristic con-

versation held in the garden by some of the children.

*re    First.voice: "See, Oreana and Bessie have new

dresses."

Second voice: "Oh ! they are always having new

and pretty things; we don't get half as much."

Third voice: " Of course: ain't their mother papa's

favorite? I wish my mother was the favorite, then

I'd have lots of pretty things."

Fourth voice: "Now, you girls, you had better

qhut up. If father hears you grumbling you'll catch

it. He won't have ahy scratching or quarreling around

hifn  He swore that' the other day, when Aunt Silea

and Aunt Jane had a fuss."

Fifth voice:  Women and girls are always fussing

and quarreling like a lot of hens. Ypu just wait till I

get to be a man, won't I make my wives mind, just as

father does ? You bet I will."

The polygamous chief carried his genius into the

minute details of his complicated household, and peace

apparently reigned within the harem. I-eart-burnings

and jealousies were kept out of sight; but here and

there the skeletons peeped out, and children see every-

thing.                                         4

Not a word of this conversation was lost upon' "

Elsie. It recalled vividly to her mind the miserable

women and children of her home; and Elsie sighed so

deeply that it startled Oreana, who inquired what was

the matter. Elsie considered Oreana an authority

upon all matters, and without thinking of the inappro-

priateness of the question, she asked:

"Do you think polygamy is right ?"

"Do I think it right? Why, of course I do, or I

should not be in it. Has your mother never explained

to you, Elsie, the principles of celestial marriage ? That

by it alone can the iniquity of the world be eradicated,

and women exalted in heaven ? Do you not know that

polygamy is to purify the world, and give birth to a

holy race, worthy to receive Christ ?"

"Then, if it be right and good, why are so many

unhappy in it ? "

" Most generally because their hearts are still unre-

generate, and yearn after the follies of Babylon. But

I do not think there are so many unhappy. You are -

given to fancies, Elsie. See how happy I ani; how

kind and affectionate my husband is; how blest I am

in my children. I could not be happier."

"And his other wives, are they happy?' Elsie

asked this more of herself than of Oreana, who laugh-

ingly replied:

"Why, certainly they are. Why should they not

be? I am happy. What queer questions you ask, child.

Why, certainly they are happy; who ever heard of 

such a thing ? Don't ever go to any one but me, Elsie, 

to ask such questions. Ah, here come the children."

CHAPTER XX.

GREAT SALT LAKE.

NE morning shortly after Sister Dinly's

soiree, a large wagon, filled with a pic-nio

party, left Zion, bound for the Great Salt  ]

Lake.  Pic-nics and excursions to the

lake were not so common then as they are now, when

the railroad takes you there in half an hour.

This pic-nic was quite a sensation, and Elsie was

nearly wild with delight.

Besides the ride, the gypsy dinner, and a dip in the

briny wave, they were going to take a sail on the lake.

Could anything be more delightful ? Of course Sister

Silea was there, and Brother Simpson and Elsie. Stanly

was the captain of the party, and distinguished him-

self so much that Sister Dinly told him she would

find him three wives, all young, pretty and amiable,

whenever he wished to assume the honors of matri- 

mony.

The great topic of conversation was the lake, which

is just as much a curiosity to the Zionites as it is to

strangers.








<pb n="231"/>
GREAT    SALT LAE.              281

"Whenever I hear Salt Lake mentioned I always

think of the Dead Sea," remarked Sister Silea.

" Why, you don't suppose that there ever were big

cities here, like Sodom and Gomorrah ?"

" Yes, I do believe it; for once. I had a vision" (Sis-

ter Silea was addicted to visions) "of the catastrophe.

I saw proud cities --"

At that moment Elsie caught Stanly's glance, full

of mischief. The result would have been an explosion

of laughter, when, fortunately for them, some one made

a diversion by exclaiming, "There it is, there it is I"

Every one turned to look. Yes, there it was-the vast

expanse of water in mountains framed. Over all floated

a misty atmosphere, an opalescent vail, through which

mountain and sea shimmered and glowed, their hues ever

changing-now green, now gold, now blue or rosy gray.

"How beautiful, how beautiful! Look at the is-

lands. Are they the cities come afloat ?" cried Elsie.

"And that thin, misty vail. Do you see it ? What

makes it ?"

" Oh, that must be the army of ghosts that hover

over the lost cities. Ghosts are vapory, and ought to

be somewhat blue, you know."

" Hush, you naughty boy. If Silea hears you she

will never forgive," whispered Brother Simpson.

"Come, now, some of you who go to school, tell us

all about the lake, and how big it is. Don't all speak

at once," said Sister Sarah.

"Ladies and gentlemen," answered Stanly, "this

lake is nearly ninety miles in length, and its greatest

breadth is about fifty miles. That island you see in

the south-east is Antelope Island; the one still farther

east is Fremont Island; this one to the west is Stans-

282          GREA T   SALT' LAKE.

bury Island. There are several others that you can-

not see from here. As to the water, I wouldn't advise

you to drink it. But it is glorious to bathe in; and if 

ever you are in want of salt, come here, take out four

barrels of this water, let it evaporate, and you will

have one barrel of pure salt. In case you meditate

suicide, and are not very serious about it, throw your-

self in; but should you want to get rid of anyone, 

don't choose Salt Lake. It is not a good place, for

nothing will sink in these waters. It is all 'I'm

afloat, I'm afloat,' with them."

4     « "Well done, Captain Stanly; you will have to be a

missionary, you talk so well. I'm afraid you will go

after your wives and get them, without giving me a 

chance of being amiable-that won't be fair. But l

now, when are we to have our sail, young man ?"

"Oh ! let us wait until afternoon. It is going to

be a little cloudy and the sunset will be magnificent--

well worth staying for; then we can return by moon-

light."

"All right, that is settled. Now, my dear brothers

and sisters, if you are in my condition dinner will be

the next thing. I'm awfully hungry." No one objected

to this, for a country ride is a great appetizer; and the

contents of the baskets rapidly disappeared.

At last, the hour for the sail arrived. Stanly took

charge of the boat. Several of the young ladies sud-

denly developed great nautical skill, but Stanly ma-

nceuvered so well that Elsie remained his assistant

without the other fair ones feeling at all jeaous.

"Just think, we are sailing on the top ! a moun-

tain; isn't that so, Stanly ?"

·   ,.








<pb n="233"/>
GREAT    BALT   LAKE.           288

"Yes, we are forty-three hundred feet above sea

level; quite a respectable height."

"Look at the clouds, young folks; your bright eyes

should see all kinds of queer things up there."

"It looks to me," said Sister Silea, "like the army

of the Lord."

"And thete is an army, a big one, too, of the oddest-

looking dwarfs, led by a giant."

"There are ships, too."

"And pretty fleecy lambs, whole flocks of them."  ; 

"Oh   don't look at the clouds any more," cried

Elsie, "look at the west. Did you ever see such a sky ? 

It is blue and green and pink; is it not lovely ?"

"I fancy it must be the gleam of the palm groves

and rose gardens of Paradise, seen through the pale

blue sky," remarked a sentimental young lady.

" What a pretty thought for a poem !" cried Sister

Silea. "I must make a note of it."

As she spoke, the sun sank, a ball of fire, behind

the western mountains. Instantly there streamed up

from the west salmon-hued pennons fringed with flame.

They reached the zenith, they touched the clouds; and

lo the aerial army shone resplendent in rose, purple

and orange. Ships of burnished gold sailed on amber

seas, and fleecy cloudlets, pink as the heart of a sea-

shell, floated afar to the rook-bound horizon.

The lake sparkled and glowed, a mass of molten

rubies, gold and sapphires ; its islands caught the bril-  a.

liant tints, and glittered in prismatic glory.

An apethystine vail flaked with gold enwrapped

the moui4ains, while over all, gleaming in virgin

purity, rose a snow-crowned peak: the sun threw it

one last kiss, and it blushed. The colors mlfted one

into another: the gold into rose, the rose to crimson,

the crimson to purple. Masses of vapor crept over

the lake and gathered round the islands. The beauty

was dying, dying, when one last vivid gleam streamed

over the sky; mountains and lake again caught fire;

then the radiance paled, it vanished; all save a cloud

of crimson glory, that crowned one of the islands,

lined its belt of purple gray fog, and rolled from un-

derneath, a cloud of fire, upon the dark waters. The

pic-nic party gazed in silence upon the gorgeous

spectacle. But in the midst of the glory Stanly looked

at Elsie. Their glances met, and their hearts fol-

lowed their eyes.  From  that moment they were

lovers.

CHAPTER YXX

OREANA MEETS HER RIVAL.

i ._:.   N the reception-room of the Lion House are

assembled the elite of the Saints, to cele-

brate the birthday of the favorite. But

||C  iei    the reigning lady appears ill at ease;

a cloud rests upon her brow. It is caused by the pres-

ence of Laima The favorite is eclipsed by the bril-

liancy of the new star.

It was the President's wish that the young lady

should be invited. His wish was a command. Oreana

obeyed, but she inwardly rebelled, for without any

apparent reason she dislike Laima. It was an intui-

tive antagonism; and intuition is prophetic.

This reunion was more brilliant than Mrs. Dinly's








<pb n="235"/>
OREANA MEETS HER        RIVAL.        s8

party. Rivalry was less apparent, for the chief would

not allow it.

"No scratching around here," he preached and

practised; but if the faces were gayer, and the tongues

merrier, the hearts were no lighter. Society is much

the same everywhere. However, there is. one peculiar

feature about the Mormon society. The men are all

and always matrimonially eligible. Only the women

are married and settled.

After politics and finance had been discussed

among the men, and church matters and household

duties among the women, the President, whose eye

had been wandering towards Laima, made a move to

include the sisters. The sisters smiled and twittered,

delighted at the condescension. Sister Silea was more

than usually talkative: she attached herself particu-

larly to Oreana, playfully reproaching her for indiffer-

ence to the societies. Oreana was not given to active

benevolence: she preferred remaining perdu, and

from behind her domestic screen, turning, or fancying

she turned, the wheels of government. Once she as-

pired to the role of prophetess; but the chief allowed

no woman to infringe upon his special rights; and

Oreana schooled herself to be content with silent influ-  \-

ence.

"Sister Oreana, don't you think we shall soon have

the happiness of receiving another sister? See how

attentive the President is to Laima"

Oreana winced, and made an effort to turn the con-

versation. A futile attempt. Sister Silea was too

tenacious of purpose: she drew some of ladies around

Oreana and herself, and whispered the thought to








<pb n="236"/>
23.      OREANA MEETS HER RIVAL.                 7

them  with laughs and witticisms, all pointed at 

Oreana's heart. 

The position was becoming unendurable. 

It was a relief when refreshments diverted the

company. But here a painful surprise awaited her. 

The President, who considered himself superior to

etiquette, escorted Laima to supper.

It was a shock to Oreana, the beginning of woe.

She shuddered at the thought of what might be: she

sensed the approach of humiliation, and the smile she

had summpned to hide her chagrin died away.

Oreana loo6e as she felt-gloomy.

It jas a moment of triumph for Laima, and she 

exerted'herself to secure a victory. Nature had be-

stowed upon her a ready wit, sparkling as her eyes,

4Z And the chief, who prided himself upon his jokes,

t;found he had a rival in Laima. It gave new zest to

the game. Her beauty fascinated, her wit dazzled,

her strong, unscrupulous will enchained the leader of

Zion. He who had enslaved woman, was himself to

become a slave to woman's wiles.

His arm thrown over the back of Laima's chair, he

toyed' with her curls, he joked and laughed at her

bright repartee. What was Oreana, what were all of

his wives, compared to this charming novelty? This

thought caused him to glance at Oreana He noticed

her sad face. He must put an end to that. Touching

Laima's shoulder, and pointing to Oreana, he said,

loud enough to be heard by all:

"Ain't she jealous of you, my beauty?" Then

speaking to Oreana, he said roughly: "Come, old

: lady, don't look so glum. You've had your day, and

there must be no jealousy among the Saints."

OREANA MEETS HER        RIVAL.       237

"That's the beauty of plural marriage," remarked

one of the brothers; "it kills all jealousy. Why, be-

fore the Gospel was revealed to me, my one wife was

more bother than all my wives to-day. One wife is

more bother than a dozen. Isn't that so, Brother

President ?"

"Yes, that it is. I pity the monogamists."

"How young and mirthful the dear President is,"

remarked Sister Silea, in a loud whisper.

Oreana quivered at the insult, but her pride came

to the rescue, and she smiled-smiled i stite of her

agony. Elsie's question, " Are the other wives happy ?"

rang in her ears above the noise of the converition.

But perhaps she was deceiving herself. Her hus-

band might have reasons for so acting. The coarse-,

ness of his sermons, his treachery, his lies--yea, worq' '

crimes than those-had been excused, justified under 4

the plea of necessity-as the most potent weapons

wherewith to fight the enemies of the Gospel. Nay,

had he not induced her, for the same reasons, to com- 

mit many an act that her better nature abhorred?

Yes, perhaps he could explain all by and by. With 

these thoughts she endeavored to quiet her heart-

anything for hope. But her heart would not be still.

Her pride, her love, was insulted, and a woman will

forgive anything but an insult to her love. That is,

to her, the only unpardonable offense in the dark cate-

gory of sin.

CHAPTER XXIL

THE BROKEN IDOL. 

REANA was at last alone with the man who   '

had so cruelly insulted her; the man whom

she called husband, the father of her chil-

dren-he who was yet her idol, although

the gilding was fast wearing off, showing her that

what she had fancied gold was naught but brass. But

as she onoejdealized him, so she must ever love him.

That faasti   passion, blinded by which she had gazed

indifferenty upon the blood-stained corpse of the lover

of her youth, still ruled her, absorbing her faculties,

her emotions. When that passion died out she would

also die. It was her life, it would be her death.

But she must know why he had insulted her.

Trembling with passion, born of outraged love, she

approached him.

"My husband, what did you mean to-night by

those cruel words ?"

"Cruel words I You speak enigmatically. What

do you mean ?"

"Oh, you know    You must remember. Say it

was only a joke, uttered while fascinated by that art-

ful girl.'

"No woman's meanness here, madam. I am not

usually fascinated. Do you hate a sister because she

is tandsomer than you ? Explain yourself."

A hectic spot glowed on Oreana's cheeks: her

. pride was taking fife.

"I cannot, cannot say the words: they were so

21'








<pb n="239"/>
THE BROKEN      IDOL.           289

cruel, so degrading. Tell me you did not mean them,

and I will try to forget."

"Oreana, you anger me with this nonsense. Re-

peat what I said, that I may know what all this fuss

is about."

"I cannot."

" I command you to do so." At that tone, so keen

and cold, a tone so merciless that few had ever re-

sisted it, Oreana shuddered. He knew well what the

insult was of which Oreana complained; but he was

determined to force her to utter the words' she so

much hated. Of late, she had been growipg monoto-

nous: this ebullition promised to be anm.nteresting

study. Not that women in his opinion were worthy

of much thought. He despised the sex, and nothing

lately so delighted him as to see woman, whom civiliza-

tion exalts to sovereignty, fall to her proper sphere

of man's slave: to see her writhe in the pangs of

jealousy, wounded love, and pride; yet, submitting to

her master, not daring to rebel. He had seen it in

many women who had come to him for counsel and

aid, and at whom he had laughed. It was a cruelty

he could indulge in without drawing down upon him-

self the world's anathemas.

These cruel propensities developed themselves in

the sunshine of prosperity. A few years ago they

had no life; now, day by day they grew stronger,

fiercer.

For some months he had anticipated this enjoy-

ment of Oreana's agony: an enjoyment of which his-

other wives had disappointed him; but here was one

whose tortures would be too great to be concealed.

With his metallic eyes gleaming, his thin lps com-

pressed with a sneer, he watched the heightening glow,

the convulsive twitching of her throat.

"Oh, you must remember; don't make me say

them," cried Oreana, kneeling by his side.

"Enough of nonsense; tell me, now.  Do -you

hear ?"

Her frame seemed convulsed as she rose, and, with

one hand pressed upon her heart to calm its beating,

she said, with a gasp:

" You said that my day is over. Tell me that I did

not hear^gight-that it is not true."

Heaswered with a coarse laugh.

The cruelest words of mockery or hate could not

have tortured Oreana as did this laugh, coming from

lips she once thought divine.

She covered her face with her hands, as if to shut

out the horror.

The laugh ended; words interpreted it.

I Well, have you not had your day, and a pretty

long'one, too ? I suppose you began to think that you

were the only woman in the world. It is time you un-

deceived yourself. Look at my other wives; they

don't make fools of themselves. I have spoit you

with kindness. A little bitterness will do you good:

it is time you had it."

"Have you, then, ceased to love me ?"

"Love I Why, you have been spending your time

yours, and don't bother me with any sentimental non-

sense, or you will be sorry for it."

A groan escaped from Oreana's heart, her hands

fell from her face, and the gaze that now met the tor-

turer's eye fully realized all he had anticipated.

" Now I tell you, once for all, I won't have any glum

faces around me. You are pretty good-looking yet,

not a hundredth part as tempting as Laima, but then

you'll do for a change, once in a way, if you don't grow

cross-looking. Think well upon what I have said.

Silea will call upon Laima to-morrow afternoonbuI will

have the carriage here at 2 P.M. It will be no use to have

a headache, for you will have to go. Good-night."  t

Oreana sank into a chair, and the morning light

found sitting there a pale, worn woman, aged by sor-

row.

Those hours of darkness, alone with the ghosts of

the past and the shadows of the future, upbraiding,

menacing, counted as years in the record of life.

fort for happiness, and, enjoying the good they pos-

sess, sigh not for that beyond.

Sister Dinly had everything to made her comforta-

ble in this life, and she began to think that she was

a fortunate woman. Self-satisfaction is the most com-

fortable of sensations, giving to everything and every-

body a good-humored look.

Sister Dinly, successful in her overtures for eternal

exaltation, felt very self-satisfied, therefore very com-

fortable, both in regard to this world and the next.

Accordingly, she overflowed with kindness, and Elsie

thought her one of the nicest of people. Her experi-

ence in matrimonial auguries enabled her to detect the

love passages between Elsie and Stanly. Her sympa-

thies were immediately enlisted, and many an undis-

turbed meeting the young lovers owed to the old lady.

Sister Dinly began to think of Brother Dinly;

what could he do, poor man, how could he live with-

out her ? It was unkind to leave him so long. How-

ever much it grieved her to part from her husband for

eternity, still her husband for time must be thought

about a little; he who had no one but his one wife to

take care of him. So, one bright morning, Sister

Dinly took the stage for her home. She felt in the

sweetest of moods at her success in eternal matters.

She had not written to her husband; for she wished

to give him a surprise. Now surprises are, of all ter-

restrial things, the most contrary; and this truth

Sister Dinly was doomed to learn.

It was dusk when she reached her home; and the

bright warm light that streamed through the sitting-

room windows gave a cosy look to the cottage.

"I am so glad he is home," said Sister Dinly to








<pb n="243"/>
SISTER   DINLY'S SURPRISE.          248

herself. "Poor fellow, he little thinks I am so near;

now I will just take a peep at him through the window.

There, Jim, don't drive up any nearer, I want to give

him a surprise. Poor, lonely man."

Sister Dinly opened the gate, approached the win-

dow, and saw-oh! it was a picture, but not of a

lonely widower. The table, set for two, was graced

with a fine ham, a dish of eggs, potatoes, and biscuits

smoking hot.

A bright fire glowed in the grate; over it sput-

tered the tea-kettle; standing on one hob the tea-pot

emitted a fragrant vapor; before it the cat purred;

while in the arm-chair rested her husband, but not

alone; on his knee sat a plump, fair-haired girl-the

very one Sister Dinly hired as housekeeper before her

departure. Now this astounding vision ought to have

delighted Sister Dinly, who had labored so long to

marry her husband to another.

But who can understand a woman ?

Instead of being delighted, Sister Dinly was en-

raged. In a fury she burst open the door. At the

apparition of Sister Dinly, the girl jumped up, stepped

on the cat's tail, thus calling forth vehement feline

screams; but the girl, instead of running away, clung

to Brother Dinly's arm. This gentleman sprang to

his feet in such trepidation that he broke his pipe and

upset the tea-pot. However, he also held on to the

partner of his fright. Moreover, he was the first to

recover the use of speech.

"My-dear Sara, how you have surprised us I And

we intended to give you a nice little surprise."

" I think you've done it; though about its little-

ness or niceness, I don't see it. What does it mean, sir ?"








<pb n="244"/>
244      SIETER DINLY'S SURPRISE.

" Why! my dear, it means that I have done what 

you have wanted me to do all these years. I have

taken another wife."

"Without my permission, you wretch !"          j

"I thought it would please you."

"It pleases you, anyhow." 

"Well, yes, dear, Jane is such a nice, pretty little

girl, and she is so fond of me. Come now, Sara, say

you are glad, let us all kiss and make friends. Jane

will be such a help to you."

"Nothing of the kind, sir; and as for that minx,

she ain't your wife at all. You can't humbug me."

"But she is, my dear; we went up to town last

week and were married."

"That's a likely story: why didn't you come to

see me ?"

"Why, they told me you had gone to York; and

besides, we wanted to surprise you: we thought you

would be so delighted."

"Delighted ! You didn't think no such thing; but

she ain't your wife, I tell you, nor won't be till I

choose to give her to you; and you may wait a pre-

cious long while for that, I can tell you."

" No, dear, you need not give yourself that trouble.

I explained everything, and it is all right. Bishop

Simpson told me so before I tried it."

"Brother Simpson !"   shrieked Sister Dinly.

"Brother Simpson, did you say ? What did he tell

you ?" 

"That you wero at York, and that my marriage

with Jane would be all right. Come, let us go to

supper; it will all get coldS,

"If.you.,ink Iam g      sit down to table with

a No. 2 that I didn't choose, you ara very much mis-

taken." Sister Dinly said this spitefully, but in a

lower key; the name of Simpson acted as a sedative.

What if her husband knew ?

"Never mind her, Jane," said Brother Dinly,

embracing his No. 2. "Never mind her; it will all

blow over, I expect. If it don't, you shall have a cot-

tage to yourself; I'm rich enough."

The twain sat down to supper. Sister Sara sat by

the fire, bolt upright, glowering furiously. But hunger

is a great tyrant. Sister Sara began to cast longing

looks at the table. Jane, who was a good-hearted

girl, saw them, and quietly prepared an appetizing

supper, which she placed upon a tray, and the tray on

a small table, wheeling the latter to where Sister Sara

sat by the fire-side. Then she quietly took Sister

Sara's furs, shawl, and bonnet, and put them away.

Somewhat mollified by this attention, Sister Dinly ate

her supper.

So ended the surprise. Sister Dinly, however, was

by no means pacified, and poor Jane often wished she

wasn't Mrs. Dinly No. 2.

have a voice in the government. They assemble to

discuss, to confer together upon Church matters?

Delusion of delusions ! They come to listen submis-

sively to the bulls the fiats, the anathemas of the

Mormon pope; their only privilege is to give assent

to the will of the Lord.

Well did the Mormon leaders know the signifi-

cance of words, and their power over the mass,

who hear with their ears, but not with their under-

standing.

Conference comes twice a year-in April and Oc-

tober: then Zion looks its gayest, or rather, it used

so to look, for Conference is no longer the general,

picturesque gathering it was ten years ago, when Zion-

ites kept open house, and dwellings were crowded

and the streets thronged; when to Zion came the

young and the old, the patriarchs, the mothers in Is-

rael, the halt, the blind, the rejected of nations, the

poor of the earth-a motley crowd, stamped with the

seal of toil and poverty, yet rejoicing in the name of

Saint.

Wagons of every size and description, but all re-

sembling each other in their innocence of paint and

attachment to dust, some drawn by oxen, some by

mules, a few by heavy-boned horses, lined the Taber-

nacle Block, the tithing-yard, and adjacent streets.

Countrymen, half-hidden under gigantic hats,-

umbrella, parasol and snow-shed, all in one,-bar-

gained and stared. Smiling, wife-hunting patriarchs,

in very new clothes and their Kossuth hats poised

on one side in a rollicking, youthful style, scanned,

with a knowing air, the bright eyes and strong arms

of the maidens, who, arrayed in unique toilettes of

pink, blue, green and violet, passed up and down

the streets in the hope of finding a husband, or a

fraction of one.

Conference was the time of marrying and giving

in marriage.

Saintesses of the Sister Dinly order gossiped and

buzzed about the gaily-decked stores. Forlorn-looking

women, in ugly, ill-fitting dresses, and huge sun-bon-

nets, wandered listlessly about, or compared babies.

One great feature of Conference was the baby-

the ubiquitous, cross, dirt-loving baby.

Here and there among the crowd an Indian, wrapped

in a bright-red blanket, strutted about with a lordly

air. The Red Man feels at home with these Pale

Faces, who call him " Brother," and talk to him of re-

venge on the Gentile usurper. He can understand

their creed, based upon polygamy and blood-atone-

ment.

Conference is also the time to pay up the tithing:

that chief duty of a Saint, without which none other is

meritorious. The tithing-office overflows. The thea-

ter offers its choicest attractions; thus prayer, busi-

ness and pleasure, make Conference the two great

events of the year.

The crowd moved towards the Tabernacle. The

Tabernacle is unlike anything on the earth, under the

earth, or above it, unless it be the tortoise that, ac-

cording to Hindoo legend, sustains the world. The

Tabernacle is said to be the direct work of revelation.

If so, it is not successful in architecture-doubtless

owing to insufficient practice.

One peculiar feature, distinguishing it from unin-

spired temples, is the repetition of the speaker's words

intention is, doubtless, to impress the Gospel deeper on 

the people's minds. Unfortunately, the effect is more

comical than serious. Some would imaginb it was an

acoustical defect; but angels, as well as men, make  '

The monster tortoise-shell is supported in mid-air

by a wall and pillars, innocent of any beauty. Several

doors give entrance to the unwieldy building, which, 

galleries included, seats fifteen thousand. More than

'that number thronged the Tabernacle on this occa-

sion, which was one of unusual interest.

It was a crisis in their history of crises.

Three reading-desks, graded high, higher, highest,

within them earlier than usual. The twelve apostles

over mighty problems. Civilization and progress had

he must change his plans. The inspired was equal to

world. But the people must not handle it. He must

able to move as he willeth.

These are his meditations while the hymn is sung

by ohe hundred and fifty voices, accompanied by the

great organ of which the Saints are so justly proud.








<pb n="249"/>
CONFERENCE.                 249

The chief aros4-we would like to add, and a hush

fell on the vast multitude ; but it would be too untrue

even for fiction. Great as was the power of the seer

and revelator, one class of his subjects defied him-the

baby class, and there were some fifteen hundred inside

the tortoise-shell- fifteen hundred strong-lunged

mountaineers who had no idea of keeping silent.

The mothers sang hush-sh-sh, but it was of no

avail. Then thirsty children move to and from the

drinking fountains, and some irrepressibles keep up' ,

perpetual perambulation.

The great man grows angry, and gives them all a

good scolding, which settles the children and the irre*

pressibles, and silences the mothers; but the fifteen

hundred babies continue their concert unperturbed.

So the discourse begins, the echo piously repeating

the last syllable of the words, and the innocents per-

forming a staccato accompaniment.

Ten years have passed since we heard the chief ad- 

dress the multitude ; but time has left no trace upon

him; and when we look at the commanding face and

vigorous form, it seems as though the decade was of

months, instead of years.                        4

periods. He talked to the people, told them plainly

what to do; and cursed them freely if they did not

do it. Texts he ignored ; for he was a text of himself,

or of what use was revelation ?

His voice filled the vast building, and could be

heard above the noise. It was an earnest, pleasant, so-

norous voice, and to its power, he owed much of the

influence he possessed over this people, and those of

the Gentiles who became acquainted with him.

"I want to talk to you about serious things.

What did I bring you here for ? To be God's people,

to receive Christ when he comes. Should He come

now, how many of ye would know Him ? Why, you

would jostle Him in the streets, push Him down into

the gutter, while you shook hands with the devil and

asked him how to get rich. Yes, you would, and you

know it. You didn't come here to become rich in-

dividuals, but a rich brotherhood. No Latter Day

Saint can possess riches. It is the Church who pos-

sesses them. Some of ye say that I have houses and

lands (yes, I know what you say), but I haven't. They

belong to the Church. God wants me to look after

the Church; and if you know of anyone that can do

better than I, let him come and try it; but you know

there isn't a man who would do for ye as I have done,

and I'm going to hold on till I die. But as a people  :

we must be rich. Rich, to fight our enemies. We

must get all the money we can, and keep what we get.

Don't send your money outside to buy French gew-

gaws for the women: let them make all they wear,

yes, and things to send outside as well. We must

have the Gentiles' money. It is our right. It is all  'I

we want of them. Now I have a plan of a Co-opera-

tive Union, a Trades Union that will put things right.

It is a big thing to start. We want money. Now

every one of you brothers and sisters must come for-

ward and take shares in this business the Lord is go-

ing to open for your benefit. Bring money; but if

you can't possibly get money, bring flour, butter and

yarn; but come forward and take shares. Those who

don't will be cursed. Yes, they will. God always

curses those who won't do His will. Now I say, come on,

every man and woman, let us start this thing. It is

the business of no one individual; it belongs to every

one of you: you will get the profits. As it will be

your business, you must support it. Those from the

country will bring their produce there, for exchange.

All will buy from this, the Lord's house, every thing

they want. Those who don't, had better look out.

The Lord knows how to deal with reprobates.

" Brother X. resigns his business to take charge of

it. He will be greatly blessed. You know now what

to do. Do it: be quick about doing it; we will be a

great people yet; we will issue our own money, we

will be independent of the cursed Gentile. But a day

is fast approaching when the Gentile, who murdered

our prophets, who drove you from your homes, who

burned your hard-earned property, who slaughtered

your old men, your wives and children,-these cursed

Gentiles will come to you begging for bread. They

will sell themselves to you for food and raiment. Yes,

this day of triumph is near at hand, if ye obey the

Covenant of the Lord. But there are some among you

(I won't mention names to-day), who boast of the great

things they have done for the Lord-who think that

the Lord can't get along without themeg Well, sup-

pose they have done great things, hasn't the Lord re- 

paid them, and well repaid them, in riches, in houses, 

in flocks, in wives, in children? The Lord does not

owe them one cent; and I want them to understand

that the Church of the Lord can do without these vain

boasters. Yes, it can; but the Lord wants to do you  i

good. He wants you to help Him, so that He may re-

ward you. He wants you all to join in this co-opera- 

tive institution. Woe be unto him who goes against 

the will of God ! Will any one dare to keep his store

open to rob the Institution of the Lord ? If there be

such a one he will be accursed. And all those who

dare to buy of these robber usurpers, they also will

be accursed. Now, lay these words up in your heart.

I have done my duty, now do yours."

The chief sat down, and a loud chorus of "amens"

testified to the good will of the listening thousands.

Then was read the list of those chosen for missions.

Among those called was the name of Stanly Del-

ville. Elsie started involuntarily, and Mr. Delville

looked annoyed; for Stanly was very useful to him.

The young man was away, and little dreamed of

being among the conscripts.

As the people came out of the Tabernacle, Sister

Silea and Laima found themselves close by Mrs. Oreana

and Mr. Delville. The latter seemed troubled; his

coarse face was purple, but he still carried himself 

pompously. 

Oreana bowed rather haughtily to the two ladies; 

she could not forget that one was her rival.

"How high some people hold their heads." whis-

pered Silea to Laima; "but we shall see." 

Laima answered with a smile of malicious delight.

CHAPTER XXV.

STANLY     RETURNS.

HE Thursday after Conference, Elsie was

returning from her lessons in a very impa-

tient mood with the world in general, and

Stanly in particular.

This young gentleman has been absent for more

than ten days, and Elsie was anxious for his return.

Not that she cared to see him ! Oh I dear, no. Young

ladies never care to see young gentlemen; it would be

improper; but Elsie wanted to hear from home.

Stanly had business at Smithville; and before leaving

he had promised to call upon Brother Menly. Then

too, there was the missionary call to be discussed.

The idea of Stanly being a missionary was exceed-

ingly comical. Supposing Stanly should refuse; it

would be just like him. These subjects were very im-

portant, and even proper people would sympathize

with Elsie's impatience.

The young girl walked slowly; her eyes kept

watch for somebody; and her heart whispered: " Will

he come to-day ?"

" Why I Elsie, where do you keep yourself ? I do

believe you are growing proud."

Elsie started at the voice, and could not conceal

her annoyance; for it was not the one.

proud, but I have so much to do; lessons to learn,

and practising; you know I im learning to play the

organ."

"Oh, my! how grand you're getting; but you

mustn't go back on your friends; and then, too, you

owe me something."

"Of course, I owe you friendship."

"Lots more than that; you have to make up to

me for that proposal I lost through you."

"A proposal ? I don't understand."

"Oh    so you've forgotten our beau, Brother

Smith."

" Kleena, don't say ' our.' I had nothina to do with

him."

"That's all very fine; but when he couldn't get

you-he wanted you for the school-he came to town

to get a learned wife, and came back with two. Not

that I care, for I am going to marry brother-in-law;

but then it is nice to have a proposal; it makes one

feel kinder good. But I'm making up to brother-in-

law, and Em and Min are doing all they can. You

should just see how happy those two are; you would

never say a word against plurality, not you. But

there! I forgot, have you heard the latest Smithville

news ? Menly's wife was shot dead last Sunday."

"Oh," gasped Elsie, "shot! Where is Brother

Menly ? Who did it ? Is the murderer caught ? The

wretch !"

"It was done by some tramps. One can never

catch those tramps; they are off before you can say  i

Jack Robinson. Officers have been down, but can't

find nothing. Everybody says it was a just judgment

on her, for her rebelliousness. Why, she was always

a-doubting and a-talking against plurality; and the

Lord just sent those tramps to get rid of her. Those

are the very words Brother Smith said; he was in

yesterday."

"But Brother Menly I" sobbed Elsie.

"Oh, as for him, who knows and who cares I Ain't

the Church dropped him? Brother Smith said we

should think more of our salvation than to go in the

devil's way."

There was silence, broken only by Elsie's sobs.

She loved the Menlys. The news brought back all the

old misery. If Kleena would only go away. She

thought of several excuses, but none succeeded in dis-

missing KIeena, who deemed it her duty to cheer Elsie

by saying the worst she could think of against the

Menlys. And Stanly, who might come at any moment.

Elsie and Stanly had reached that stage when a third

person is always one too many. The girl grew des-

perate and broke out:

"Kleena, I won't have my friends spoken of in

that way. If you can't talk differently, go away."

"Don't be cross; we won't say any more about it.

Here is something nicer. Look, Elsie, Stanly Delville.

I like him very much, and if it was not for principle,

which speaks for brother-in-law, I would set my cap

for him. Oh, don't be jealous, he could marry you all

the same, and you could be first.  Now, ain't I

good ?"

At that moment Elsie hated Kleena for daring to

be there, and making her blush before Stanly. But as

she could not annihilate the intruder, nor appear un-

concerned, she took refuge in sulky crossness, scarcely

noticing Stanly when he spoke. Kleena was all smiles.








<pb n="256"/>
236            STANLL   RETUIRNS.

That was too much for Elsie, who, not knowing what

to do or say, abruptly left them and ran home.

"What is the matter with Elsie ?" inquired Stanly.

"Oh, I just told her about Menly's wife, and she

feels awfully. Can't see what she can find in such

people to care about. But, la! you are going to Nor-

way on a mission. Don't you feel proud ?"

"It will be time enough to talk about that when I

am ready to go. It is a pity you said anything about

the Menlys to Elsie. Bad ne.ws always travels fast

enough.. Good afternoon."

" Well, some people are queer," was Kleena's com-

ment as she walked on.

Stanly hurried after Elsie, and overtook her before

she reached home. The girl was very angry with her-

self, and when she heard Stanly's step she stopped,

ready to make apologetic advances.   But Stanly

attributed her brusqueness to grief, and hastened to

condole with her.

·' .'  "I am so sorry you heard of this so suddenly; it is

horrible I"        *   .

"It is worse than homble.:. Oh, Stanly I can't they

"They could do it so easily tiht 'won't try."

" What do you mean ?" 

"Elsie, did you never hear of blood-atonement?

Great God ! I can see before me-npw the body of my

cousin, Julian Bellew, a fine, nobl4 young fellow as

ever lived. He was the first victim. Sister Menly is

our last. Who will be the next? Hundreds have

been killed within the last ten years."

"Stanly, you make me shudder.    Suppose-but

there! are you going to be a missionary ?"

..^








<pb n="257"/>
BTANLY RETURNS.                257

"Not I; although I would like to go out to the

world, and tell them a few facts. How I could expose

the wicked system ! Julian's wounds, and my mother's

broken heart, would inspire me. But I cannot afford

to go. I must look after my father and-"

The young man hesitated. Elsie looked up, and

read in his glance the little word his lips dared not

utter.

Elsie blushed, and Stanly took courage.

" May I take care of you, Elsie ?"

"If you don't get tired of the responsibility; you

know I am awful wicked," replied Elsie, archly.

Stanly's answer is not recorded. No doubt it was

very foolish, but all insane demonstrations were checked

by the publicity of the situation. People who despise

foolishness will find that the busy street is just the

right place for a matter-of-fact business-like proposal;

but it is very awkward for such as Stanly and, Elsie.

However, it was done. There followed a few moments'

silence, when Stanly exclaimed:

"I had nearly forgottet 'I- have a package for

you."

"For mes     if IJ from Mother ?"

"No; friSr'tyther Menly. He gave it to me

with the injunction that I was to place it in your

hands, unseen by anyone. I don't think anyone will

notice it now, for there is too much going on. It is a

very small one -tt he seemed very mysterious

about it."

" What can it be ?" said Elsie, taking it. "I will

leave you now to find out, for I see you are half dead

with curiosity. Good-bye."








<pb n="258"/>
258      THE MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE.

CHAPTER     XXVI.

THE MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE.

LSIE hastened home. To her great relief

she found Aunt Lucy abset. As soon as

she could lock herself in her room, she

tore open the parcel. It contained a note

from Brother Menly, and a small packet, neatly done

up, and addressed to Miss Elsie Lascelle. Opening

this, there fell out a ring, round which was wound a

slip of paper. With trembling hands she unwound

the paper and read:

"If ever you need a friend, send this ring to J.

Tracy, box 200. God bless and protect you. Tell no

one, fiot even your mother."

Elsie examined the ring: it was a heavy gold one,

somewhat worn. On the inside was inscribed, " Mary

$;. to Ed., May, 1852." It was a mystery. But there was

^".^ Brother Menly's letter; perhaps that would throw

some light upon the affair.

The letter was dated some monihs back, only a

few days after her departure.

It was as follows:

" My dear child:

"The day you left us, as I was returning from my

usual morning walk, I fell in with a man having the

appearance of a laborer or a miner, except that his

conversation was much above that class. He was a

singular-looking man, his face terribly scarred. He

asked numerous questions about the people here, and

about you. When he discovered our friendly relations,

and that the Church had cut me off, he manifested great

satisfaction.

"Though inquisitive, he was not impertinent-

quite the reverse, and when we parted we seemed

almost like old acquaintances. That same evening he

came to my cottage and left the enclosed package for

you, enjoining me on oath to either give it into your

hands myself, or through some one I could trust as

myself.

"You know it is impossible for me to come now to

see you ; so you will excuse any delay that may ensue.

I will send it by the first trusty messenger.

" The Church has dropped me completely, and my

life here would be insupportable were it not for the

devotion of my dear wife, my guardian angel, my

faithful companion. The solace of her love, and,4he

sense that I have obeyed the dictates of my conscience,

nerve me to endure isolation and obloquy.             -

"How merciful is our Divine Father. He will watch 

over you, my child. Be true to yourself, and God    -.'

will help you.

" My wife and I think of you often, and pray that

you may be happy.

"Your old friend,

" T. MENLY."

Elsie wept: she forgot herself and the mystery

of the ring in sorrow for her old friend cruelly be-

reft of his one faithful companion whom he mentioned

so lovingly. What must be his anguish. How terri-

ble the loneliness of his life.

For some time sympathy prevailed over curiosity;

but when her eyes looked at the ring curiosity re-

260      THE   MYSTERIOUS     PACKAGE.    , 

gained its power. The entrance of Aunt Lucy inter- A

rupted her cogitations.  Hastily concealing the letter

and ring, she prepared herself for the evening meal.

As soon as it was over, she retired, pleading a

headache.

Again she studied the letter. This time a light i

dawned on the mystery.

"A man, terribly scarred, looking like a miner,

who appeared the day she left." The memory of the

tramp, whose glance impressed her so vividly, flashed

across her mind. He must be the sender of the ring.

Then, who was he ? What was he ? Why did he in-

terest himself in her? Jim Tracy ! she never had

heard the name. What a mystery it all was; and she 

must not tell any one. Oh, dear ! what a heavy load

was that mysterious secret: it kept her awake three

long hours. If only she dared tell Stanly-but he was

. some one.

, aV r   The next morning she hid the ring and the note

from the mysterious Jim Tracy, burned Brother

Menly's letter, and tried to appear asf nothing had

happened. 

Sister Menly's murder occasioned but little excite-

:i ment, and that little soon died out, effaced by the

more absorbing subject of the co-operative institution.

Money possessed more interest than a life, especially

the life of a rebellious woman.                *

The co-operative promised money: every one has-

tened to take shares: some disposed of the little prop-

erty they had worked so hard to gain, and put it all

into the stock of Zion's Co-operative Mercantile In-

stitution. All Zion was in commotion. The Lord

His own account. The people must help Him, for he

dislikes doing things alone; besides, they laid it to

heart that the Lord should succeed, or He might be

angry with them. So their savings went into the Co-

op, as the new store was called, and the priestly con-

clave smiled ineffably upon the people, promising

future wonders while they pocketed present cash.

CHAPTER XXVII

RUIN.

ELVILLE'S store, usually the busiest on the

.?;1i         1 sstreet, was closed. For two days it had

given no signs of life: dark, deserted, no

customers, no clerks, the show windows

empty. 

The passers-by shook their heads. Some of the   r' ?'

bolder went to the door as if to enter: then they

stopped, hesitated, and passed on to the new store-

the Jord's store.

The street gossips drew nearer together to discuss

the question of Delville's ruin.                    V 

"He's squelched," said one.

"I'm mighty glad, for he gave himself no end of

airs."

'It's a just judgment for his share in that Mountain

Meadows business."

" Do you think he had anything to do with that ?"

"'Tain't always best to tell one's thoughts; but I

wouldn't have his conscience for all the gold mines in

the world."








<pb n="262"/>
262                   RKIN.

"Well, he wasn't alone in the business; and rd

stick it out with the old lion if it were me."

"Yes, and get chawed up for your pains."

a  "Tut, tut : those days are gone by."

"Don't be too sure o' that. Any how, old Del is

ruined: he's in a pretty tight fix, I can tell ye."

The gossips were right, as they often are. Mr.

Delville was ruined. Relying upon his excellent busi-

ness, he had expended beyond his -means in building

and speculations. Debt, the evil genius of the busi-

ness man, held him.

But how is it that Mr. Delville, the pillar of the

Church, the right hand of the chief, is in this condi-

tion ? In his boastfulness, he had acted independently

of the Church; and the Church crushed him. In the

Tabernacle, before all the people, he had been cursed

by name, for daring to be a rival of the Lord; and all

the Saints were forbidden to enter his store, under

peril of going across lots t an ultra-tropical region.

Across lots signifies a short cut. It was, on account of

its forcibleness, a favorite phrase of the saintly

leaders.

The anathema had crushed Mr. Delville. He sat

in his deserted store trembling, stunned by the awful

blow. It was not only the dread of being cast off, the

pain of public censure; more than this, ruin stared him

in the face.

He had visited Oreana in theahope of obtaining her

influence. He found that influence rapidly waning,jf

not dead. He appealed to the chief; but the stony in-

difference of the latter crushed the hopes of the pre-

sumptuous Delville. His boasts had turned against

him. Ruin, nothing but ruin. And in the silence of








<pb n="263"/>

his loneliness, the curse rang in his ears, the curse he

had tried to forget in the noise of gold-seeking and

pleasure.

Stanly tried in vain to cheer his father.

"Father," said he, "be a man. Resume your busi-'

ness. They have declared war upon you, now declare

war upon them. It will be a tough contest, but it will

not last long. The people will favor you, if you are

only brave. Many of them are exceedingly indignant

at the attack made upon you in the Tabernacle. Open

the store in spite of the Co-op."

"I can't do it. I dare not. Satan would claim

me."

"Nonsense; who cares for Satan when conscience

is clear and the will honest ?"

Mr. Delville winced at this home thrust, so inno-

cently made by Stanly, who never dreamed of his

father's blood-stained career.  The wretched man

trembled at the thought that the Church might repu-

diate her debts. God might revoke her promise; then

who could save him from perdition ?

"No, Stanly, I can't go against the Lord. If I am'

cut off my soul is lost."

Stanly was about to reply when Brother X., ac-

companied by a clerk, entered, and informed Mr. Del-

ville that the Co-op committee had sent him to nego-

tiate the sale offthe stock.

When Stanly heard this he drew his father aside

to make one last appeal.

"Father, don't be driven in this way. Think of

that which you have at stake. Here's my plan. Sell

the things that won't do to keep, but don't part with

the rest. We can move away, open in some other

place, or, if that don't answer, wait just a little, and

you can do splendidly here. Gentiles are coming here

fast, and as soon as the railroad unites us with the

outside world, the power of that old Fraud will be

gone, and your fortune will be made because you had

the courage to defy him. Father, mark my words, in

a very short time Zion will be free like any other city,

and that insolent priest will fetch up in a jail, where of

right he belongs. This cursing business is played out.

Hold your own, Father; don't let them steal it from

you; and all will be right. Look at others who have

not the slightest intention of closing. Father, you are

worried and ill; let me see to this business for you.

I think I can manage the rascals. Come, what do you

say ?"

Mr. Delvill hesitated ; his son's words impressed

him. Were he only untrammeled, unstained as this.

young man--but, alas ! he had sold himself to the en-

emy. The compact was written in blood. He must

submit.

"You are brave and energetic, Stanly, but it won't

do, it won't do. I must have money immediately.

Then the President wants me to sell out. If I submit

perhaps the Lord will reinstate me in favor."

Stanly left the store: he could not stay to see his

father swindled; for he knew that the offer of the

Church would amount to a swindle. This ruin sorely

affected the young man, for he had looked forward to

a partnership which would enable him to marry Elsie.

Now the ruthless hand of avarice and jealousy was

to destroy all his hopes.

However, he did not lose courage. He would get

work, he would succeed.








<pb n="265"/>
RUIN.              '     e6

When he returned, he found Brother X. and the

clerk busy taking an inventory. Mr. Delville had

accepted the offer-not daring to refuse-although it

involved a ruinous loss.

"Well," exclaimed Stanly, when his father told

him the terms, "if I wanted to rob in that wholesale

fashion I would go on the highway, I would break

boldly into houses, I would declare myself an enemy

of man and work under the devil's banner.       I

wouldn't sneak in with a saintly smile and make God

father my sins."

Mr. Delville groaned. The honest bravery of the

young man shamed him.

All through the long day he sat in the deserted

office alone with ruin and the specter-haunted past.

Scenes forgotten in prosperity re-appeared with start-

ling vividness; for adversity clears the mental vision

in a most wonderful manner. Again he heard the

doom pronounced against him. The ruin, the curse

had come. Would the rest follow? Again he saw

Julian fall. But it was all for God: why need he

tremble? Why did he groan? Was it because of the

memory of the faithful companion of his happy, stain-

less, early manhood, the partner of all his joys, sor-

rows and toil, the mother of his noble son, stricken

with madness and death at the sight of his first victim ?

He prayed; he shuddered while he prayed. Did

he repent? No, for it was all done for God. His

sufferings were not of repentance, but of trial. Thus

he consoled himself: the past must be forgotten.

The Church could not cast him off: one of its strong-

est pillars, whose tithings and gifts had done so much

to sustain it in its struggling years, whose dagger was

CHAPTER     XXVIII.

JIM TRACY AGAIN.

LSIE'S smiles begun to fade; her reveries

became sadder. Not that she was a girl

to make for herself sorrow. She had suf

fered too much to do that; besides, nature

had given to her a happy disposition; but now every-

thing was going wrong.

Her friend and protectress was unhappy. Like all

proud natures, Oreana avoided old friends lest they

should perceive her woe. Perhaps she shrank more

from Elsie knowing the questioning, doubting charac-

ter of the young girl, whose last question, " Are his

other wives happy ?" still haunted her. How differ-

ently she would have answered now I Elsie felt deeply

this avoidance on the part of her adopted mother.

But that was not all: Elsie trembled for her lover.

Stanly had fallen under the ban of the Church by

his non-compliance with the missionary call. The

Elder Silvertung smiled blandly, while he reidxai 4 '

every effort to keep them all right.             ~ .

"Just look, for instance, at the Delvilles. Did I 

not advise Brother Robert for his own good? And

when I saw Stanly falling into bad company, I used

all my influence to reform him, for there is nothing

equal to a mission for elevating young men, and

grounding them in the faith; but it was all of no use.

However, I will yet try to do all I can to save them."

Elsie heard and trembled. That word-" save "-

was very ambiguous.

Some years ago Mr. Delville outwitted the elder in

a speculation, and courtship; and Silvertung possessed

a good memory. He never forgot. Whether he for-

,ave remains to be seen. Moreover, he was one of the

co-operative ring; the Lord's enemies were therefore

his. They must not cumber the earth.

* He forbade Elsie to hold any communication

with the Delvilles; but love knows no obstacle, and

the young lovers continued to see each other in spite

of the fiat. Their meetings were so different. Their

lover-like talks about nothing were at an end. All

was serious earnestness.

Stanly never had been a very light-hearted youth;

the death of his mother, the murder of Julian (though

he was far from suspecting the murderer), had dark-

ened his youthful thoughts and dreams; and the late  .

troubles made him a grave and determined man. He

hated the Church organization more than Elsie did,

and his vehement denunciations often caused the young

girl to shudder with fear that the trees might betray 

him.

One pleasant afternoon Elsie took a stroll by the

creek, hoping that its song would cheer her.

As she walked up Main street she noticed a man

roughly clad, but possessing an air of superiority,

standing at the corner of South Temple street. For

some time he had stood there, apparently watching the

passers-by.

When Elsie came out of the Lion House his atten-

tion centered upon her. He followed her up Main

street.  Arrived at the north side of the Temple

Block, the man, after looking to see that there were

no observers, hurried after Elsie. Hearing the sound

of footsteps, the young girl turned. She started, for

there was something familiar, something that inter-

ested her, in this stranger who looked at her so wist-

fully. He came nearer. She recognized the myste-

rious Jim Tracy.

"My "- the stranger stopped suddenly, then said:

"Are you Elsie Lascelle."

His voice thrilled the young girl's soul, but aston-

ishment rendered her incapable of action.

She faltered out: "Yes."

"Did you receive a package containing a ring from

one Menly ?"

"Yes."

"All right. Keep a good heart a little longer. It

will all be right soon."

Just then some people came in sight; and the man

turned away hastily.

Elsie, who had recovered her self-possession, ran

after him.








<pb n="269"/>
JIM  TRACY AGAIN.              29

"Stop ! Tell me who you are. Why you are

interested in me. Tell me, who are you ?"

"A friend. Ask me no more; it is not safe, and I

cannot tell you yet. Soon you shall know all."

"It is strange, very strange; how I wish I might

tell Stanly," thought the perplexed maiden.

Full of astonished curiosity, Elsie found herself at

her home before she had an idea of being near it. Too

bewildered to enter the house, she rested a few min-

utes at the gate. In those few minutes, the sufferings

of her life crowded through her brain; and the long-

cherished hope of escape returned with greater force.

A few months and Stanly would free her. She looked

towards the mountain barriers. Dark clouds of fog,

rift upon rift, hid peak and base. Slowly the rifts

broke from on high, a snow-crowned crest appeared,

now gleaming golden, now blushing love's bright tint

at the parting kiss of the sun's good-night. Slowly

other peaks shone out of the black rolling fog waves.

Far around spread the glorious light, tinging with

opalescent hues the upper rifts, while beneath all was

black fathomless fog.

"How   glorious!" thought Elsie. "A vision of

hope. Stanly and I will succeed, and be happy. The

light will come."

270  A HAPPY POLYGAMOUS HOUSEHOLD.              1

CHAPTER XXIX. 

A HAPPY POLYGAMOUS HOUSEHOLD.

:UNT   LUCY    was cross that evening, so

i.       :.._Elsie asked permission to visit her friend 

nKleena. In spite of the great difference

in the character of the girls, they sought

each other's company,-Elsie, because she could talk of

Smithville; Kleena, perhaps, for the same reason.

But this evening Elsie was prompted by another

motive.  She wanted to see some happy people.

Kleena's sister and cousin, married to Brother Cowles,

presented -a model polygamous household. The two

women lived together, went everywhere together,

dressed alike, talked of "our husband," and made

plans for having Kleena as No. 3, without a tinge of

jealousy. Moreover, in this household the right of

priority was never discussed. Emma and Minna be-

came brides on the same day, and at the same hour.

The Mormon high-priest tried to introduce these

bigamous weddings, in order to do' away with the

absolute priority assumed by some first wives.

In this case, the plan worked well. No jealousy,

no discord had as yet disturbed this Mormon house-

hold.

When Elsie felt more than ordinarily bitter against

polygamy, she liked to visit this family, and contem-

plate their happiness-happiness of a very negative

kind, but Elsie knew nothing about negative and posi-

tive conditions. Absence of discord and misery was

to her happiness, the only happiness of which she could

form an idea.








<pb n="271"/>
A HAPPY POLYGAMOUS HOUSEHOLD. 271

But this evening Elsie found Kleena in a very

cross mood trying to pacify a still crosser baby.

Emma tended another baby, who seemed very sick,

while Minna was occupied in preparing her liege lord's

toilette, to go courting !

If we collect the words floating in the atmosphere

of the two rooms in which the members of the Cowles

household are congregated, it will give a better idea

of the happiness of this model family than any trite

description.

Minna. "Dear me, how tired I am ! Amos, I wish

you would speak to those children, they are quarreling

again;" 

Amos. "Sorry, my dear, but I haven't time just

now. Where is my blue neck-tie ? Julia likes blue.

Why don't you women keep things in order?"

Minna. "We do try, but there's the children, and

sickness, and washing and-here's your blue tie."

Emma. "Min, do come here."

Minna. "Yes, in a minute. Amos, can't you stay

with us to-night ? Em's baby is so sick."

Amos. "Stay! how inconsiderate you women are.

Here, don't go off, tie this bow for me; you can do it

so nicely-and don't frown, Min, it don't suit your

style."

Child. "Papa, see what I got at school to-day."

Amos. "Don't bother me now."

Second Child. "Jim is saying naughty words,"

Amos. " Minna, you should look better after these

Kleena. "Ain't it wicked that he won't make me

Amos. "My dear, I can't; have I not an engage-

Amos. "My dear, what would you have said if I

had been remiss in my engagements to you in tlie days

when we were courting ? Some of the girls can go."

Em. "Oh ! dear, I am afraid baby will die."

Amos. " Nonsense; baby will be all right. Women

always frighten themselves about nothing. I would

stay with you, but Julia would be so disappointed.

Good bye, dears."

Twirling his moustache, flourishing his cane,

Brother Cowles was off to see the lady of his fancy,

his mind quite untroubled by any thought of sick

baby, tired wives, or children growing wkid for want

of a father's restraining influence.

"Dear me," cried Minna, "if Amos had fancied

Kleena, instead of that airy, stuck-up Julia."

"I wish so, too; it would have made everything

so nice ;-but oh ! somebody must go for the doctor."

"I'll go," said Kleena, who had just managed to

get her baby to sleep.

" will go with you," said Elsie.

The girls started, and all the way Kleena poured

her griefs into Elsie's ear-what a pretentious creature

Julia was, how she had visited the wives of her lover,

boasting to them that Amos had never loved any one

but her.

Confidence invites confidence, and Elsie, who had

love griefs also, told Kleena all about Stanly, and the

intended marriage and escape. After the communica-

tion was made, Elsie felt sorry; but it was then beyond

her power to recall it.

" Kleena, don't tell any one ; it might bring trouble

upon us-I mean upon me and somebody."

"Don't bother yourself; and may you be more

fortunate than I. But there, you will be lucky, because

you don't act from principle. Im that mad that I'll

marry the very first one that will give me a chance.

It is perfectly awful, this marrying out of the family;

but you never can depend upon men, and Julia tried

awful to catch him. She's got the sweetest dress and

· bonnet, and I do believe that's what's done it. But

here we are at the doctor's."

The girls did not have a chance for any more con-

fidences that night, and Elsie went home without re-

entering the Cowles house.

Kleena's wrath at not being number three did not

amuse Elsie; it saddened her.

"Why am I not like Kleena ? Is it that I belong

to the unregenerate ? All these women seem resigned;

why should I feel for them ?"

Why indeed I Thesb were problems beyond Elsie's

power to solve for years yet to come. '

As Elsie approached the Temple Block, the silvery

moonlight disclosed to her two figures walking along

very lover-like. They were Amos Cowles and Julia,

number three elect.  The latter seemed radiant.

Brother Cowles was an adept in the art of matrimonial

."fishing. 'Indeed, a man who could capture and har- 

moniously lead to Hymen's altar two young ladies at 

once, must be well skilled in the sjdence.

'As Elsie looked at the twain, there swept over her a

wave from the ocean of inspiration. She longed to 

hold up to the world's contehmt the heartless father,

the merciless husband, the creatures of a creed whose

sanctityconsists in trampling under foot all that makes ,

a, man noble. Scathing words burned her lips; but at

whom could she hurl them? To the trees, waving so

far above the earth and its woes ? To the wall, hard as

the heart of the people ? It was useless. The sense of

her impotency overwhelmed her; and the sea of bitter-

.  ess, repelled from her lips, flowed out from her eyes.

OREANA IS FORSAKEN.

OME time passed, during which Oreana only

saw her master at dinner, when he noticed

her no more than be did the other women.

Already she perceived the commiserat-

she cried, and she carried her head higher, assumed

gaiety, yea, even laughed at the chief's infatuation.

But out of her love (for she loved this man, even

now that he had abandoned her) grew a hope that he

would return to her, that she would regain her 'nhftl

ence, her place in his heart: his heart? This hope be-

came a fixed idea. A lter thoughts, her aims, centered

in it. She must see him again before he was totally

lost to her. She would be bold, she would ask him to

visit her. The day slb decided upon this course, she

spent considerable time upon her toilette, in the hope 

of effacing t4e traces of suffering. As the hour of

dinner drew near, she grew nervous. Alas ! what a .,'

change I She now begged for that attention she had

hitherto deemed her right. Bq her reflections of late

proved to her that celestial marriage gives to women

no right save that of suffering.

She hoped to prefer the request unheard by any

but in this she was doomed to disappointment. The

inhabitants of the Bee-Hive hummed ps 'f   ously

round the pet lion who took such delight in iashing

them. 

If she asked, it must be before them all. For a

moment she hesitated; but desperation spurred her 

on. Ask she must.

Assuming her pleasantest smile, she asked him to'

visit her that day or evening.

" I can't, I have an engagement."

"An engagement , and with the freedom of a 

favorite, she asked, " What engagement ?"      t 

The words escaped her unconsciously. No soon  s'

were they uttered than she would have given worldl

for the power to recall them.

"That is my affair, not yours. Inquisitive women

are odious," was the answer.        -

Oreana shivered. Her quick eye noted the look

that passed from one lady to another. ft-was suffi-

is,

" :ient to arm her ride. Recalling her smile she pre-

tended to be amused at the rebuke, and added, in as 

playful a manner as she could assume: 

"Then, perhaps, you can come to-morrow ?"       l

"I shall come when I get ready," was the brusque

reply.

,      It was galling, but nothing save a heightened color 

' ~ denoted her inward pain. Oreana withdrew, digni-

fled, courteous, a very queen-dethroned-but still a

queen.

But as the months passed on Oreana faded. Hap-

piness is the beautifier, misery the defacer of man's

countenance.

-  Sorrow, watching, and tears had done their mar-

ring work upon Oreana, furrowing the smooth brow,

hollowing the cheek, and dimming the eye. The

b illiant matron became an anxious, worn woman.

IIer thoughts no longer afford her pleasure: she

seeks distraction in work,-in moving restlessly about

the rooms.

A child enters.

"Mamma, Father says he is going to take you to

the social to-night."

The abrupt message was sufficient to make any

lady angry. A time was that Oreana would have felt

incensed. Now it brought her unspeakable hope.

He was returning to his allegiance I the thought

' was an elixir. Oreana caught up in her arms the lit-

tle messenger, and almost suffocated her with caresses.

The day passed in a flutter of excitement examin-

ing her different toilettes. As a favorite her ward-

robe was ample; although Oreana, imbued with the

spirit of the First Christians, affected a severe sim-

r'                              .  9

plicity in dress-a simplicity which harmonized well

with her majestic beauty. For this night she must be

lovely. Oreana had learned that beauty is potent, even

over a prophet of the Lord.

But, although hope electrified her soul and made

every fiber to thrill and glow; although she called to

her aid every art to her known, the ravages of misery

could not be effaced. The work of months could not   JE

Ie undone in a few hours.

Oreana sighed for the first time over her lost

beauty. Still she was a handsome woman, far more

beautiful to the cultivated eye than any in the city,

not excepting Laima, whose highly-colored charms;.

might win the sensual but not the aesthetic.

During the ride to the hall, Oreana asserted all her

conversational powers to charm her escort. Not a

reproach, not a sigh, escaped from her bruised heart

These efforts were received in silence; still undaunted,

Oreana hoped.

Arrived at the hall, relieved of her wraps, Oreana

entered the room leaning upon the arm of her lord,

who, in the glare of the light, noticed for the first time

the change in Oreana's looks.

" So you are going like the rest. You are not half

as good-looking as you were. Quite time you dropped

into the background-the fitting place for ugly women.

Don't you think so, Brother Simpson? Why can't

women keep handsome, like men, eh ?"

The last part of this harangue was addressed to

'Brother S., and some others who came up to salute the

great man.

" Well, at any rate we can replace the old stock by

younger ones," replied Brother K-.








<pb n="278"/>
278         ORIANA   IS   FORSAKEN.

"That's good," said the President, laughing. "A

Saint can always have a wife, young and handsome."

"Thanks to celestial marriage," added Brother'

Simpson.

Oreana boiled with indignation. Her ears had

grown accustomed to coarse jokes, but she had never

been their target. She tried to leave her husband's

side, but he retained her arm, having no intention of

allowing his victim to escape one iota of the torture.

He paraded her round the room, till the entrance of

*- Laima, when he left her, without making any excuse,

and hurried to welcome the new-comer.

Almost fainting with humiliation, Oreana tried to

hide herself in an obscure Seat. How she envied her

sister wives, several of whorf were thre, seeking their

-;own amusement, talking and laughi'g with their

friends, oblivious, apparently, of the ghas man's pres-

ence, as if they owned no interest in him I They had

,jever been distinguished by that debasing term, " The

Favorite."

"The Favorite" of the Prophet is naturally the

belle of every party. This dubious honor had for so

long been enjoyed by Oreana, that she considered it as

her right, and never dreamed that another could sup-

plant her.

The Prophet opened the ball with Laima, which

courtesy installed her the queen of the evening.

Oreana sat alone. A meaning look passed from

one to the other 4  the company. The men smiled,

the women sighed; thus expressing uncooniously

their destinies as Saints. To the men pleasure, to the

women pain.

Oreana had a few friends who tried to make








<pb n="279"/>
ORtAYNA   IS  FORSAKEN.           270

amends for the neglect of the One; and the ex-favorite,

anxious to appear unconcerned, danced, laughed and

talked while her heart was breaking.

It was over at last. All things must end; and

Oreana prayed that life might end; but such mercy

was not for her, doomed to expiate a double parri-

cide.

After that night, grief benumbed her faculties.

Her death-knell had sounded; for her hopes, her joys,

her life, centered in that being who now threw her

ruthlessly aside. Without him, she knew not how'

to live ; for she had allowed her heart, mind, and soul, 

to be absorbed by him. Her children could not oon- 

sole'her; Jor in Oreana maernal love was secondary.

Her love demanded companionship, which as yet her

children coul4.ot give. And the agony of crushed.;-

pride. OreSa was proud of her influence over the

chief. An influence whose power and duration sur-

prised the Mormon world.

In the days when enthusiasm was requisite to fire

credulity, Oreana's influence was useful to the ambi-

tious leader. Her spirit, ever soaring among the dizzy

heights of fanaticism, drew up with it the common-

place mind, that only dreamed of self-gratification and

power. But when consolidated authority gave him a

secure throne, and allowed full sway to his lower

instincts, this influence became irksome.

Before Oreana, the second Moses had felt compelled

to wear a mask. He- had songA.i to hide his real

nature,hshamed of its ugliness. To her he could not

divulge all his schemes or the abject enslavement of

the people. The woman's spirituality forced him up-

ward to uncongenial heights.








<pb n="280"/>
280         OREANA   IS  FORSAKEN.

The restraint chafed him. Had not Oreana been

blinded by satisfied power she would have perceived

his efforts to throw off her chains: efforts hitherto un-

successful, for Oreana's beauty charmed him, her ac-

complishments flattered him; and he felt awed by a

superior nature.

At length came Laima-beautiful, witty, unscrupu-

lous, coarse. Her smile gave strength to his lower na-

ture. The brute conquered the man.

In Laima he found a congenial spirit; before her

m mask was needed. The.deeper he sank in iniquity,

in Laima greater depths attracted him. Together they

gloated over massacres. No appealing to Scripture or

to religious frenzy to justify the deed: no, only a laugh

at the credulity, the weakness of mankind.

Skillfully Laima bound him in chains; her beauty,

her wit flattered his passions, while, with subtle craft,

she discovered his secrets. Every revelation was a

scepter in Laima's hands-a scepter, whose power she

knew well how to use when the opportunity should

come. She despised him as much as he despised the

people he misled; but she loved his position, his

wealth, his fame. These must be hers. Once hers,

she knew well how to keep them.

Oreana's fate gave her no fear. Love had made

Oreana the slave of the man; passion should make the

man the slave of Laima. No tender emotion could

weaken her power over him, for the tender emotion

did not exist. Laima was mistress of herself and of

the man.

Oreana had fancied the brass gold. Laima took it

for brass, and doubted whether the brass was not hollow.

For Laima there could be no disappointment;








<pb n="281"/>
THE   OBDEAL.                981

neither did she fear the pain of abandonment. Love

only feels this pain.

The polygamous chief might marry as many wives

as he pleased. They should never keep him away from

her, for these women would never possess her charms

-charms impervious to grief or anxiety.

Thus Laima triumphed; thus Oreana sorrowed-

sorrowed for the )dol now broken, the idol she had

worshiped, whose "fragments she loved so much that

she would gladly have spent her life in putting them

together.            *

CHAPTER XXXI.

THE ORDEAL.

NE morning about two weeks after the so-

cial, Sister Silea called to see Oreana. This

occurrence was extraordinary of itself ; but

to make it still more so, Sister Silea was

accompanied by Sister Martha, a sister wife, who had

never before called upon Oreana.

Sister Martha prided herself upon her housekeep-

ing skill. She had learned every culinary mystery,

and the problems of domestic economy were as familiar

as household words to her. Without Sister Martha's

aid, the harem would have been a financial failure.

Not even the prophet of the Lord, with all his rev-

elations and inspired genius, could have carried it

through.

Sister Martha, like many others, despised what she

did not possess. Silea's literary talents anDtaste an-

noyed her, and she lost no opportunity to snub her

sister wife.

As for Oreana,'the active housewife looked upon

her as a proud, lazy creature, whose influence was ex-

ceedingly prejudicial to the interests of the Church.

Being i plain-spoken woman, she did not conceal her

thoigts, and many a time Oreana felt the sharpness

of Martha's tague.

Great thef was Oreana's surprise to receive a visit

from these two, who scarqfy speak to each other

without quarreling, and whf  dislike to her was so

well known. Some new misery was about to enfold

her: she could read her fate in their triumphant

glances; but her calm dignity rather disconcerted the

visitors, who looked and acted as if they didn't know

exactly what to say. However, Silea, considering her-

self Sister Martha's superior in social matters, thought

it fitting to make some excuse.

" I suppose, dear sister," she began, "we ought to

apologize for negligence in calling; but really, what 

with Church responsibilities and literary work, you

know."

"Excuse yourself, if you like, Silea; as for me, I

don't think it is needed. Every one knows that my

work leaves me no time for gadding, nor for fine

dreaming either."

Silea took to herself this last remark, and hastened

to cut short Martha's speech.

"Yes, indeed, we have but little time for social in-

tercourse; but my dear Oreana, you seem to be suffer-

ing."

" Only a headache ; a very common complaint with

me."








<pb n="283"/>
THE   ORDEAL.               288

"That is just because you haven't enough to do.

A few days in my dairy would soon put you right."

" I am afraid not, Martha, for the reason I don't

like such work."

" Don't like such work! No, you like better to dress,

play the pianner, read and study all kinds of :nnsense,

which don't do nobody no good. That's what 1'used

to tell my girls, and just look at thesjoP-day, all in

polygamy, and as comfortable and as happy as my

cows. No nonsense about them: they find plenty

to do, to keep them fro"'eadaches and miserableness.

I do wish there were no books."

"O, Martha 1" exclaimed Silea, "you forget the

book of Mormon, and the Bible, and all the beautiful

things written in the Millennial Star, and our many

other Church works." The most beautiful of these

things, in Silea's estimation, were the productions of

her own pen I

" No, Silea, I don't forget. If the Lord chooses to

write books, of course He can do it, as He does'just

what he pleases; and if He tells the apostles to write

hooks, why that's all right. There must be books, I

suppose, but I don't believe women have any right

with them: 'taint their sphere. Women readers and

women scribblers ain't no account-at least in the

Church of Saints. Who are the rebellious wives, the

women who complain of plurality, but these who

bother their heads with what don't concern 'em ?

That's what I told my girls, and you won't catch any

of them moping. But there ! we are wasting time, and

forgetting what we came for. We intend to celebrate

to-day, don't you think we ought ?"








<pb n="284"/>
84              THE   ORDEAL.

"Why, to-day ?" answered Oreana, finding she

must say something.

" Why, to-day ?" exclaimed Silea. " Why, because

a marriage day should be a gala day. A Mormon

wife should rejoice when her husband exalts another

sister to eternal glory, and we of the President's

household should be shining lights to the rest of the

sisterhood; so we intend to celebrate to-day. When

I mentioned it to the President, he thought it a very

excellent idea."

"Well, Oreana, I don't know what you think of it,

but Sister Silea has expressed my ideas exactly. Some

time ago I told Brother Young that I thought it was

high time he took another wife, and that when he did

I should make a feast.

"Last Monday-yes, to-day is Wednesday-yes,

'twas last Monday, he came to me all smiling and said:

'Martha, Wednesday next Sister Laima will be sealed

to me for time and eternity.' 'All right,' says I, 'we

will celebrate.' Lor, didn't he look pleased ! and this

morning, while he was a-getting ready, he sang and

laughed and danced just like a boy. -I couldn't help

thinking of King David, and I told him so. I always

says just what I've a mind to Brother Young. Well,

they are married by this time. I can't stay any longer.

Why, what's the matter?"

Oreana had fallen with a dull thud on the floor.

"She has fainted," said Silea.

"Fainted ! Why, I never fainted in all my life.

What a woman !"

Silea did not reply at first. Her vengeance was

greater than she had anticipated. She had expected a

storm-tears, denunciations; this horrible, silent woe








<pb n="285"/>
THE   ORDEAL.               285

did not suit her. The fact that some people actualiy

felt those sentiments she so glibly talked about, be-

came a truth. At last she said:

"Martha, call some one."

"Indeed I will; and now that we have had our

triumph let's go. I can't stay here all day."

Sister Martha left, and in a very short time all the

harem knew that the ex-favorite had fainted at the

marriage news.

The desire for the fete dinner became greater.

The first one Oreaga saw when consciousness re-

turned, was Silea, who had stayed to see it all.

With the sight of her enemy came the thought

that her misery was known-known to those that had

planned it; they would triumph over her, they would

pity her. She closed her eyes and sought strength in

pride. The will that once made her the heroine of the

desert must carry her through this frightful climax.

When she reopened her eyes, a smile played upon

her lips. It was a sad smile, but it was better than a

tear.

" I am better now," she said, " all right. Lately I

have been subject to this weakness."

This declaration was untrue: but woman's pride

dictated the fib.

"Don't be alarmed, Silea, I shall not miss your

celebration. Your ideas about such things are ex-

cellent. Elsie, run and tell the governess to give the

children a holiday, then return, I shall want you.

And now, ladies, I will lie down for a little while;

there is nothing like a nap for restoring strength."

With a smile, meant for a dismissal, Oreana arose.

She could scarcely stand, but they must ffot see her








<pb n="286"/>

weakness. And they would not go. Was she a show

for vulgar curiosity ? It would seem so. Again she

expressed her wish to be alone; but the women, under

pretense of lending assistance, insisted upon staying.

Annoyance came to the aid of pride. With a vio-

lent effort, she steadied her limbs, and walked into

her bed-room and fastened the door. The spur re-

moved, her strength left her. She sank upon her

couch, a weak, broken-hearted woman, thinking of

nothing, caring for nothing, feeling nothing, save her

great wretchedness.

But even wretchedness must pass away.

Oreana arose at last, all her misery concentered

in one idea-the fete at which she must be present.

Her will was not strong enough to bear her through

those hours.

Faith and hope, powerful supporters, that formerly

upheld that will, were now dead. The morning's

effort of a few minutes had exhausted her. What,

then, should she do during those long hours of torture,

the anticipation of which made her'writhe.

She must succumb, and her enemies would triumph.

Her looking-glass confirmed her fears. Those hollow,

lustreless eyes, encircled in black rings, those sunken

cheeks, that drawn mouth-she was ugly. And he,

would compare her wanness with Laima's blooming

charms. He would joke about it. 0 God.! the thought

stung her to madness. Was there nothing she could

do   Could not factitious strength-artificial 'charms,

be obtained? Yes, yes. A gleam of triumhh, not of

joy, lit up her face. She went to her purse-a hidden

purse, in which she kept the superfluities of brighter

days. The purse was well furnished. Next she took








<pb n="287"/>
T,-. ORDEAL.                 287

pencil and paper, and placed it upon the table. Then

she went to a book-case, and took from it some books

on medicines or the properties of drugs. She looked

over several, then she wrote a nAme on $ piece of

paper. Again she paused and laughed-a chilly laugh

-then on another piece she wrote -several orders.

Taking these two pieces of paper and her purse, she

entered the sitting-room, where Elsie sat reading.

"Elsie, take these orders to a drug-store, and have

them filled as quickly as possible. Here is the money,

so that you need not answer any questions."

'Elsie obeyed.

Left alone, Oreana called her children, hoping to

forget her sorrows in their prattle; but their naive re-

marks upon their father's last marriage were unendur-

able. She soon sent them away.

The dinner hour arrived, and the women of the

harem, with their intimate friends, gathered in the

reception-room, anxious in appearance to welcome the  '

bride, but in reality to see how the ex-favorite would ''

bear the ordeal. That this was the case the disjointed  '

phrases that formed their conversation testified.

"She won't come."

"Yes she will, and you will see her the gayest of

the gay."

"Not a bit of it; she is quite broken down."

"Yes, but she is awful proud,-she will come."

"That she will, and stand on her dignity."

"'ike a statue of a queen."

The remarks stopped with the entrance of Oreana

whose appearance disappointed all. A great change

had taken place since the morning: the wrinkles had

disappeared, a delicate bloom gave rotundity to the

cheek, a tranquil smile banished all sorrow from the

mouth, and her eyes beamed with a dreamy, happy

look, while the black circles so ghastly in the morning

were scarcely visible. Her dress of gray silk and lace

betoken4b extraordinary care in its arrangement. A

rose japonica in her hair, and at her throat lent bright-

ness to the toilette. Never had she appeared more

beautiful.

But her manner created the most surprise. It

showed neither the forced gaiety of concealed misery,

nor the icy dignity of wounded pride.    An air of

blissful reverie pervaded her looks, words and actions.

She welcomed the usurper of her joys with graceful

sweetness; her dignity, beauty and gentleness dis-

armed her enemies, and forced all, even her brutal

master, to treat her with deference.

True, she ate scarcely anything; and as the hours

passed her conversation grew strange, her glance dull

and fitful, but none noted the change. Oreana's tri-

umph was complete. Alas! that triumph cost her

dear. To obtain it.she had sacrificed her womanhood,

her future. The heroine, admirable in spite of her

fanaticism, Oreana, majestic even in wrongdoing, we

shall see no more. To drown sorrow, to secure the

triumph of an hour, she had steeped her brain in

opium vapors. She had reveled in intoxication, she

yielded to its potent spell, and followed the mirage of

happiness till she was lost.

flourished the Zion Co-operative Mercan-

tile Institution,-flourished on the flesh

and blood of the poor, flourished upon

the tears, the ruin of those it reduced to beggary, for

Delville, although the greatest sufferer, was not the

only one.

From all parts of the territory the farmers and

laborers brought their produce to the Institution.

There they exchange it for merchandise; or if they

wished money, the Co-op gave them its paper, which

was not redeemable any where else-thus the mass of

the people became the slaves and victims of of the so-

called Co-operative Institution.  They found them-

selves growing poorer, for, of course, they could not

be hard upon the Lord, although He was rather hard

upon them.

Nevertheless, they rejoiced in the Institution; for

did it not belong to them ? Was it not the Co-opera-

tive, and did not the word Co-operative signify work-

ing together. Yes, they must be all working together,

and some day everything would come out right.

A writer gays: "Any one who wishes to manage

the masses, needs only two or three popular, empty

words, well tuned and humored; with these he may

whistle the people backward and forward, upward

and downward, till he is weary, and get upon their

backs when he is so."

This assertion is verified by the people-_whom

Mormonism has gathered to the basin of the Great

Salt Lake. These hard-working, well-meaning, honest,

confiding people were whistled over mountains and

deserts into an abyss of crime and poverty, by the

words: "Saints, apostles, conference, co-operation."

But there were some who perceived the hollowness

of these terms. Few in number, as must always be the

thinking portion of a community; but strong'in cour-

age, these men protested against fraud, raising their

voices for the righteous cause in the very midst of the

priestly conclave.

Astounded by such ahdacity, the priests quailed,

and the people looked on anxiously; and some ranged

themselves with the protestants.

It was not a simple apostasy, but a schism,--

schism that threatened the church with the most cer-

tain destruction, the death that comes from disintegra-

tion.

In the early days the usurpation of Brigham Young

and the marriage revelation divided the Church of

the Latter Day Saints into the Josephites and Mar-

Inons proper; then from the blood of Joseph Morris

and his associates (shot by the Morthons.,becalse they

assumed to have revelations), sprang the sect of the

Morrisites. These were not only cut off from   tlf

Church, but driven out of the territory; whereas the

new schism might be cut off from the Church, but it

could not be banished.

The men were rich, powerful in the territory, and

known in the world of-commerce. .The chief had con-

p sidered them safe, for they were polygamists, and

members of the priesthood, and thus bound to the

system. But he drove them too hard, and they re-

belled; defied him in his stronghold, and laughed at

his tbathemas.  The people looked on in amaze-

ment.

Some thought that the wrath of God would con-

sume the rebellious, but the little band pursued their

way quietly, troubled only on one subject: "What

to do with their harems." Rather a serious ques-

tion.

It was expected that Mr. Delville would join the

schismatics; but liberty of spirit was lost to him.

Indeed, he rather liked 'despotism, provided he could

be the despot, or the despot's favorite; and he still

hoped that the Church would reinstate him in her

favor. The disgrace and loss of property incurred by

his non-affiliation with the Co-operative Institution

destroyed all his energy. He fretted, he grumbled, he

hinted at foul play; but he dared not assert his man-

hood. He still believed in the teachings of the Church,

and he spent many a sleepless night thinking of the

curse fulminated against him in the Tabernacle. His

wealth was fast disappearing; three large families

were dependent upon him,-and the means of gaining

an income hadlbeen taken from him. In such a ease,

one. family often drives a man to desperation, what

then, of three ? Mr. Delville bad not learned the secret

of making plural wives profitable. One day, feeling

more wretched than usual, he wandered into a saloon.

A friend urged him to drink. It was the first time for

many years that liquor had passed his lips, and as the

fiery element coursed through his veins, the darkness

and misery disappeared. Once more he felt rich and

powerful; in the cup he found delight. From that

day he was doomed, doubly doomed; for his. tongue,

elopement, he could not repress a whistle of delight.

But after the joy of the discovery had somewhat

subsided, a doubt arose in his mind. Should he, -by

keeping silent, avenge himself upon the elder for the

slight of refusal,-a slight which scarcely merited the

name; for the elder had done it very politely, and at

the same time gave excellent reasons for so doing,-or

should he, by disclosing the plot, take vengeance upon

Elsie for the many insults she had offered him, and at

the same time be doing a service to the Church.

He did not hesitate long,-the last idea was so de-

cidedly the better one. It would .give him the satis-

faction of seeing the elder considerably annoyed, of

punishing Elsie, and of enhancing his chances of

Church preferment.

A wise man was Brother Smith.

With her books under hetarm Elsie wended her

way homeward, feeling very happy, yet very sad.

Happy because the future looked bright. In a few

months Stanly would be able to take her away. Mr.

Delville was regaining confidence, drank less, and as.

soon as he could arrange his affairs he intended to

leave, Zion was not a safe place for him or for Stanly.

The railroad had put them in easy communication

with the outside world, and through the friendship of

one of the apostates, Stanly heard of a position which

gave her sorrow. She had just said good bye to school,

-and Elsie loved school-and she knew now that

rumor was true, and that Oreana, her loved ideal, was

killing herself with opium.

She had been to say good bye, and the sunken,

blood-shot eyes, the wrinkled, yellowish skin, the

moody abstraction of the woman once so beautiful and

brilliant, struck Elsie most painfully.

It was the beginning of the end. In the beginning

'  Elsie had brought the fatal drug to her friend and

When she came in sight of the house she saw the

elder walking up and down the garden, apparently

watching for her,

Elsie trembled. The sight of this man always an-

noyed her, although she had tried lately to feel kindly

towards him for gratitude's sale. But Elsie's efforts

were failures: the elder was her antipathy.

As she entered the gate she fancied that the elder

eyed her peculiarly; he spoke to her with that sneer-

ing amiability infinitely worse than anger. Her heart.

sank, and it was with idifficulty she could answer his

numerous questions about her studies and progress.

He kept her talking, evidently enjoying her embar-

rassment, until supper was announced.

At supper the elder appeared very jocular.

"Lucy, my dear, have you noticed how pretty our

Elsie is growing ? and so ladylike. We must get her

a husband,"

The look which accompanied these words brought

to Elsie's mind those words she overheard at Smith-

ville in the Long Ago.

"I don't think she will give you that trouble," re-

torted Lucy, who did not like the beauty of others to

be praised. "Young ladies now-a-days manage that

business for themselves, and Elsie ain't no ways back-

ward."

"I should be very sorry to hear of any such pre-

sumption upon Elsie's part: it would almost kill her

mother. Ah I that reminds me, Mary will be in to-

morrow. I sent for her to-day."

"Indeed    How did you know that it is con-

venient? You ought to have asked me," said Lucy,

bridling up.

"My dear, it is always convenient for a wife to 

submit amiably to her husband's wishes. Only the re-

bellious do otherwise. I know it will be a great

pleasure to you to receive Mary. Dear me, how de-

lighted g woman must be to know that her husband

has the power to win' such wives as the ladies I pos-

sess. The Lord has been good to me, and who

knows what blessings of love and beauty he has yet in

store for me ?"

The elder addressed these words to Elsie, and ac-

companied them with such a leering smile that it It-

tracted Lucy's attention, making that lady so indignant

that she jumped up and flounced out of the room. El-

sie was trying to join her, when the elder asked her to

bring him a book.

She could not do otherwise than obey.

" Ha," he said, as she gave him the book; "how

nice to be waited upon by such a pretty maiden I No,

you must not leave me yet."

He saw she was trying to escape; to prevent it he

seized hold of her.

"Elsie, my dear, you are so lovely and well-be-

haved that I think I must marry you myself. Won't

you -be happy to be my wife ? Come, give me a kiss,

my bride elect."

"Never !" half screamed Elsie; "never 1"

"Control yourself, dear; you need not be so vehe-

ment. I know you will be glad to be my wife. There,

you need not act so furiously. A lady's ' no' always

means 'yes.' Oh! I understand you, my little coy

damsel. So a kiss."

Never since that terrible day, never to be forgotten

by Elsie, had the elder essayed a caress. Since that

day, Elsie had learned to love. A pure, natural love

now lived in her heart, giving her strength and dignity.

She struggled, fought to free herself. Her resistance

seemed to amuse her tormentor. He laughed a cold,

mocking laugh, and stroked her cheek.

"The pretty dear I how modest and proper she is.

Ah, well, I can wait. When you are my wife you

will not be so shy. You can go now, and remember

let him beware, for I can crush him as easily as I can

crush a fly."

He hissed these words in her ear, then released

her. The poor child ran to her room, and buried her

face in her pillow as if anxious to hide away from her-

self, from her fate.

The dread that had haunted her for so long, the

secret she dared not put into words, was at last an out-

spoken reality. What could she do? Then hope

whispered, " Stanly." Yes, he might find some means

of saving her. And the mysterious friend? All was

not yet lost. These thoughts somewhat reassured

Elsie, and she began to think how she could -keep her

tryst with Stanly (for they were to meet that evening)

unseen by her enemy.

While she was planning how to compass this, she

heard the sound of angry voices. Aunt Lucy lectur-

ing the elder. Poor woman ! as well might she have

beaten herself against a jagged rock. Soon the noise

subsided; the elder went out. Elsie watched him out

of sight, then glided noiselessly down-stairs, out of

the gate, and hurried to the trysting place.

She arrived some five minutes before Stanly.

These minutes seemed to her an eternity; a multitude

of bewildering thoughts, perplexities, horrible possi-

bilities distracted her mind.

"Why, Elsie, ain  late ?" exclaimed Stanly, very

much surprised to find her awaiting. " I am so sorry,

but, my darling, what is the matter ?" 

"0, Stanly I I shall go mad. We must escape,

,now, this very night."

with superuition, as supernatural being.

for an occupant. On being answered in the affirma-

rtive, he ordered that Elsie should occupy it for that

night. The young girl obeyed without demur. She

knew a baftjor a long contest, was inevitable, and

she kept herstrength for the latter. They might kill

her, but neter would she marry that man.

Mrs. Lucy was indignant. She had thought that

he would never take another wife, and therefore, her

reign was secure. But here he was, about to marry a

chit of a girl, whose beauty Lucy had been often

forced to acknowledge, much against her will. She

never dreamed that the girl would resist.

Elsie slept but little that night, her mind being.

busy, devising some means of communicating with

Stanly.

The next day was Sunday.

Elsie soon found that the elder's keen eyes watched

her movements closely. She sat at the window watch-

ing for Stanly, but he came not. Elsie felt disap-

pointed; if he had passed by it would have seemed as

though he were bestirring himself in her behalf-it

would have been a satisfaction; a foolish, one no

doubt, as she was virtually a prisoner, but despair

yearns so madly for hope, that it hails gladly the

faintest reflection from the bright star.

About 11 AM. a message came for the elder.

The message seemed to please him. Re-entering the

sitting-room he said:

"I am called away for a little while; shall be back,

no doubt, within an hour. Elsie, your mother may be

here any minute. I hope your filial affection is suffi-

ciently strong to keep you here to receive her. Lucy,

youth is sometimes wayward; I shall look to you for

Elsie's safe keeping. I do notwish her to go out orto

speak with any one; and, by the way, the window is!

not a fit place for a modest young lady,..wishing to re-

trieve past errors. Sit over here."

He placed Elsie as far as possible froi  window,

reiterated his command to Lucy, and pass  out into

the hall, where one of his sons, a five-year-old likeness

of the father, was playing at ball.

A bright thought came to the elder in the form of 

the adage: " Fools and children tell the truth."

He called the child and promised him lots of candy

if he would watch Elsie, and tell if she spoke to any -

one or went out. The child readily promised, and

rushed into the room, saying:

"I'm going to tell on Elsie and get candy."

CHAPTER XXXIV.

AN UNEXPEOTED FRIEND.

*H  E~l SLOW, weary hour passed. Lucy talked a

little with her pet boy, and Elsie pondered

over her fate.

Suddenly, a cheery voice broke the si-

lence. It was Sister Iinly's voice.

Perhaps we ought to inform the reader that Sister '

Dinly could not forgive her husband for cheating her ·

out of the privilege of giving him a wife of her choos-

ing. The country became too narrow a sphere for her

activity, and shie found herself often called to town

upon Church business.

Her husband never objected to these calls. To tell

the-truth, her absence was often eagerly'resired, espec-








<pb n="302"/>
of. fl     A4     UfEXPEOTED PRBW    . .

ially by Mrs. Dinly number two, who liked her queen

better at a distance.

One of these business calls brought Sister Dinly

to town at the present juncture; and she took up

her abode with her dear, dear friend, Sister Simp-

son.

"Why, I declare you all look as solemn as owls;

here Spencer, come and kiss your grandmother."

"Can't; I am to tell on Elsie, and she won't do

nothing, so I won't get candy."

"Elsie is a very naughty girl; but see, I have

brought you some candy, in a cart, drawn by a big,

shaggy dog, with-a bell on its neck."

Spencer forgot everything in delight over his new

toy, and the candy. Still, father might bring him

some also, so he still kept an eye upon Elsie; but the

glance was rather doubtful.

"And now, how is it, Lucy, I find you looking so

glum ? Elder going to take another wife?"

"You have guessed it pretty well I should think

lhe bed enough." 

' Utes, Tfur are enough for one man to keep; but

there, ohe can't keep count upon 'em. Just look st my

husband, aftr all I had done, to go and cheat me out

of my rights  But you can't complain of that, Lucy,

for you ain't the first."

· Anyway, I thought I should be the last."

"So did I, child, or I wouldn't have given you to

him."

"You need not worry about it; as far as this mar-

riage is concerned, Aunt Lucy shall be the last," said

Elsie.

"Why, what have you to say about it, little one ?"

AN ',VS XP:OTED    FAIEfRD.      -     .. 

"Everything, since I am the proposed victim," re-

torted Elsie, bitterly.

"You!" exclaimed the old lady; "is this true,

Lucy ?"

"Yes," was the sullen answer.

",Of course the elder can do as he pleases, and he

couldn't have made a better choice. Elsie must feel

quite flattered."

"Flattered I you mean insulted. Have the women

here lost all self-respect, that they are pleased with

degradation ? I am not,-and I will kill myself rather

than become that man's wife."

Elsie paused, trembling with excitement.

"Hey day, what a spirit we have !"

"She talks fine fow, but she will change her tone

when it comes to the point," remarked Lucy, who from

experience knew it was no easy matter to resist the elder.

" Rebellious spirits, be calm," said Sister Dinly; "I

didn't come here to listen to such talk.  I came to

tell you the news ;" and she branched off into a rich

piece of gossip about the apostates, who in -their new

profession of faith were as much puzzled what to do

with their many wives as a newly-converted African

lhief.

The lady was in the midst of her story when the

elder reappeared.

" Why, Sister Dinly, how do you do ?"

"Salubrious, thank you. But la, now, allow me to

congratulate you the very first thing. Really, elder,

you have excellent taste."

"Of course, or I should not be your son-in-law."

"The dear man, he just knows how to flatter; but

I can't let you interrupt my story." 








<pb n="304"/>
30 "      AN   UN EXPECTED    FRIEND.

The old lady exerted herself to be piquant, and her

audience laughed, even to Elsie. The story or the

laugh seemed to have restored a better feeling. The

elder saw a friend go by, and hurried out to speak

with him. Lucy went to the kitchen, and Spencer, re-

lived, rushed into the garden to play. Sister Dinly

and Elsie were left alone.

Immediately Sister Dinly began to act strangely.

She looked out of the window, then out of the door;

when fully satisfied that no eavesdropper lingered near,

she came up to Elsie with a note in her hand.

"Little one, read this quickly, then destroy it. I

will watch that no one surprise us."

Elsie took the paper. It was Stanly's note. It said:

"I have everything ready for escape. To-morrow

morning at half-past ten leave your house-you will

certainly be able to find a way. Walk quickly to the

Hot Springs road; there father will meet you in a

buggy; he will drive you-to-Ogden. It will be less

suspicious than for me to do so. I will go on to-night

and  w.e everything ready.   Sister Dinly is our

friend."

'Wth a bpaming face Elsie concealed the note.

"It Will never do for you to look like that. You

will be'foand out sure. Look glum. Remember, my

dear, that you must play fox when you live with foxes.

Now, you can trust in me. I have vowed, for reasons

of my own, that the elder shan't marry you. The

wretch shall find that a woman is a match for him.

Stanly wants you to-well, we know; better not pro-

noune dangerous words-suppose we say, take a walk

-fie wants you to take a walk to-morrow. Are you

ready ?"

"Ready? Yes, I am ready now; but how can I

get out ? That man watches me-and mother is com- .

ing. He will make another jailer of her."

"There, there, don't I know all about it ? I shall

manage it beautifully. All I ask of you is to oppose

any plan of mine that is laid before the elder."

"How good you are, Sister Dinly. How can I

thank you ?"

"You needn't thank me; haven't I reasons of my

own for getting you off ? Then an elopement is much

more exciting than a wedding. I haven't had .such

fun for a long time. But don't tell me any of the par-

ticulars. The less I know the better, or I shall get

into a peck of trouble."

The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of

Elsie's mother. The pleasure of this meeting was a

good excuse for the light in Elsie's face.

CHAPTER XXXV.

PLANS.

iFTER the departure of Elsie apd thbtder,

Stanly remained motionless at bl* tryst-

ing place. But the calm was only exte-

rior; a cataclysm swept over his heart and

brain. In a brief quarter of an hour emotions had

become passions, the smouldering flame a volcano.

At length prudence and common sense succeeded

in restoring a calmer state of mind. The young man

shook himself as if to see that he was all there ;then

he began walking back and forth, hi/i brain grew

steadier, thought clearer.








<pb n="306"/>
Something must be done, and that quickly. Wait-

. ing until all was ready was out of the question now.

Elsie must be saved, and his father and himself mjat

leave the territory. War was declared; the first at-

tack made; the final blow might come at any moment.

But how do it?   Now that his relations with Elsie

were known, it would be impossible to speak with her.

If he attempted to carry her off, any one they met on

the road would suspect and betray them.

Slowly a plan suggested itself. He would go away

first alone, as if be had reaounced hope; his father

should follow with Elsie.  ailed, she might pass for

one of Delville's wives, The more Stanly thought

over the plan, the more feasible it appeared.

If the old man would only consent I The old man

might object to leave in such a hurried manner: if he

did, why he certainly would not object to take Elsie to

Ogden, so that she would be saved. But there was

not a moment to be lost. The success of the plan de-

pended upon its being carried out immediately. Late

as it was, he must visit his father. Stanly tried to re-

member where the old gentleman was likely to be

found--a difficult question when a man has three

homes; at least, so Stanly found it, for twice he wa

disappointed. At length he found Mr. Delville at the

house of his first wife, where he had fixed up a tem-

porary office, secured by bolts, locks and bars.

The room Mr. Delvjlle had dubbed office, was a

wing of the house having a separate entrance. It was

lighted by two windows; the front one looked on to a

porch, and from this window, two panes were missing.

completed the furniture of the room. Here the ruined.

Jan spent most of his time looking over the ledgers,

and account books of his once flourishing business.

Since the reception of the friendly warnings, Mr.

D. had put bolts and bars upon the doors, and care-

fully restored the fastenings of the windows; but the

missing panes were not replaced,

Stanly found some difficulty in obtaining admission.

"To tell you the truth, Stanly," said the old man,

"I'm getting afraid. Old friends give me strange

hints and warnings; however, I have nearly every-

thing prepared for "-here he pointed towards Ogdea.

" I can't utter the word, Stauly. It goes awfully har4.

Then too, the women might hear."

" You are right; for the women are the slaves of

the Church. But I am glad you are preparing, for I

came to urge you to go immediately."

Then Stanly made a confidant of his father, the 

result of which we have already seen.

Mr. Delville was to be ready to leave Monday,

Stanly preceding him Sunday night; taking the line

of the almost finished railroad, so as to avoid'any com-

ments. - Stanly had work on the railroad. 

* The great difficulty was to communicate with Elsie;

but Stanly felt assred that this wouldbe overcome.

- "It seems e.an to leave the women and their fam-

ilies," said Delville.

"I don't see that you could do them any good by

staying; in fact, not so much as by going. Each one

'has a house, and you can send them money."

" That is so, and the sale of the farm will enable

me to leave them some money."

8*                   PLANS.

" Don't give it to them in any such way that they

will surmise your intentions."

So fearful had Stanly become, so anxious was he,

lest his plans should fail. All that night he could not

sleep. He lay awake, trying to devise some means of

speaking with Elsie. But the morning found him still

perplexed. To approach the house would be to spoil

everything; for he knew he could not do it, without

being seen by the elder. Dare he trust any one to

take a note to her? It was a question he could not

answer. Perhaps opportunity, that had often be-

friended him heretofore, might favor him now. Pos-

sessed with this thought, he went out and walked up

and down the streets.

As he was passing by the house of Brother Simp-

son, he saw Mrs. Dinly in the garden. His remem-

brance of this lady was a very pleasant one. During

her previous visit, she had shown great favor to him.

"Why, Stanly Delville, I'm so glad to see you:

come in and tell me all the news. I've only just

,~    arrived, haven't yet been to see the folks. How is

*  Elsie ? Why, you don't even smile at that name: what

.     is the matter ?"

" A great deal is the matter. It is all up with my

love."

"Why, Elsie hasn't refused ye, has she ?"

"No; but the elder chooses to take her himself."

"Stanly Delville, no joking with me.'?

"It is no joke: I only wish it was. Mrs. Dinly, it

is true. I   "

" You mean to say, that Elder Silvertung wants

to marry another wife ?"

"He does, and his choice is Elsie."

"And she gives you up ?"

"No, indeed ! Poor girl, she is in despair."

"And you stand idly by ?"

"What can I do ?"

"What can you do I Why, run away with her.

Stanly Delville, this marriage shall never take place, if

I can help it. When I gave my Lucy to Silvertung,-it

was distinctly understood, that she was to be the last.

That is next best to being first. No betweens for me,

or any of mine, Now, look here, boy, if you will try

to carry her off,-why, bless me! here's the railroad

within thirty miles of us, just a nice drive; it will be

very easy, and I will help you; and if we two can't

spoil the elder's fun,-why then we ain't of much ac-

count."

Stanly looked at the old lady as if he-would read

her very soul.

" Oh, you can look at me as much as you like,-no

deception here. I don't intend my Lucy's nose shall

be put out of joint: that's what's the matter, young

man.   You may always trust people when your G.'

interest is theirs."

"We can run away to-morrow if you will see 

Elsie, and arrange it."

"Write it, Stanly. I don't want to compromise

Myself by knowing all about your plans. Come into

my room and write it."

"But can you get Elsie out of the house to-morrow

morning between 9 and 10 A. M.?"

"Yes, I promise that."

COUNTER-PLOTS.

HE message Elder Silvertung received, so

opportunely for the lovers, called him to a

priestly council. The Presidency had been

absent on an extended tour, and great was

their dismay to find, upon their return, the heretofore

submissive people in great agitation. The apostates

seemed bolder, stronger than ever, they flourished un-

der curse and anathema.  They even presumed to

build a hall, where they could talk openly to the

people of the delusions of the Church, and the iniqui-

ties of the priesthood.

The despot raged. He, who had passed triumph-

antly through so many crises, he who had ttought

people across an unknown desert, the founder of

cities, the successful fighter of public opinion, whose

cunning policy had brought the government to terms,

mde friends and admirers of those sent to conquer

b'hrm, turned a military camp into a harmless, pictu-

resque accessory to the scenery of Zion, and changed

Gentile rule into a pleasing farce, he, the Napoleonic

Moses, the future master of the world, to be defeated,

defied, by a few men, his former slaves,-it was intol-

erable. He thought of those days, now gone friler,

when, by lifting a finger, he could have crusl n

all.  He groaned in' spirit, while his coun4i gave

utterance to their griefs.

"The people begin to hold opinions."

"They call us murderers 1"          -

"And the Co-operative Institution a 'Sletts

managers thieves 1"

"The women become rebellious."

"Congress threatens to crush polygamy."

"It is no use, brethren, to believe all we hear," said

Silvertung, "they say that Delville has been talking

of late, that he knows who killed B. 4nd S. and-- "

"Has that worm dared to turn ?" roared the chief.

"He not only turns like a worm, but he tries to play

the viper and sting. His son Stanly is trying to

seduce my ward; he is another viper."

" And have ye all grown so faint-hearted that ye

let these vipers sting? Have the people I have brought

to Zion gone back to their idols ? Have the Danites

forgotten their oath ?"

"No, no, we have not forgotten," cried several

impatient ones.

"What does Job say, my friends ? 'If they obey

not, thej 'they shall perish by the sword, and they

shall die without knowledge !'  Ponder upon these

words. They are our comfort in these evil days. For

the Lord has not yet forgotten us. We shall yet

triumph. I know it, I feel it, and my soul sings with',,. 

the psalmist * 'But God shall shoot at them with an

arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.' And again:

' Let the posterity of the wicked be out off; and in the

generation following let their name be blotted out.'"

"Amen, amen," responded the concave. Having

relieved tSenselves in these bitter prayers, which

seenfMfiti ive great delight to Silyertnng and a few

others, ift council commenced the discussion of busi-

ness. The chief gave his orders as calmly as if anger

had never troubled his mind.

When the business was over, he said: "I wish to

"But suppose they go contrary to us ?"     -

"Contrary?" cried. Silvertung, "as if their nus-

bands couldn't see to that."

"Brother &resident, it is a grand idea."

, "It is, indeed," cried all.

"I thought you would join with me, my friends.

As for women going contrary, you know they can't

enter heaven unless they obey their husbands. But

nothidti'taust be done in oa'urry. The Ballot must

Mrs. Mary was nothing loth io change the eonver- -

sation, and. the tfpe that the elder wished to be de-  '

voted to the furtherance of his suit, was spent in ltin'-

less gossip. By peroajsion of the master of the house-

hold, Elsie returned to her wn room. She gathered

up a few trinkets, precious to lWr" youthful heart:;

among these, the rfng so mysteriously received. This

done, she went to the window to watch. Perhaps

Stanly would pass by. In this she was not mistaken.

About pine o'clock the young man came along, loolt-

ing up at Elsie's window for a last sign. The day-had 

been cloidy, and the' evening sky was Qbscured by 

dark masses rolling one upon another, giving caasual

glimpses, in their hurried march, of the young moon,

sailing on to the westward horizon. One of'these

fitful. illuminations allowed the lovers to exchange

looks. The young man dared not stop; 'he moved on

slowly, looking back upon his love, who taved her

handkerchief and watched him   until a-lblatk rift

rushed over the moon, making all dreary darkness. 

-  Still Elsie lingered at the window, watching the

silver crescent as it emerged from clouds only to be

swallowed np again by the ever-increasing heralds of

storm. Already, in. the' distance,, rumbled the thun-

der; and lights like molten spears darted from out

the cloud masses, or played around the mountains.

The elements were going to rage fierce tar that night.

" Poor Stanly," sighed the girl, as she closed the win-

dow to keep out the rain.                 -

CHAPTER      XXVIII.

THE DESTROYING ANGELS ON THE WING.

ONTRARY to Stanly's advice, Mr. Delvillo

visited'all those dependent upon him, gave

his-wives money sufficient to keep them

some 'time, counseled his children, and

bade them all an affectionate good bye. This con-

duct seemed so strange that each one thought some-

thing was going to happen, or that trouble was

affecting his brain ; but as these ladies did not meet

to ''alk the matter over, it' faded fiom their minds, and

Mr1.'Delvil1e's pebuliar conduct was not publicly known.

Some friends noticed his depression, and very natju-

rally attributed it to the state of his affairs. But Mr.

Delville's 'great sorrow was the thought of leaving

Zion. He could not reconcile himself to the idea, now

that' it had become a fact. He almost hoped that

something would prevent its realization.

In the evening Stanly met his father according te-

the' agreement. Mr. Delville seemed in high spirits.

'" Stanly, I will take Elsie to-morrow to Ogden ;.but

I must return. I can't leave Zion. This afternoon I

met the President : he was pleasant and kind. I am

to call upon him Tuesday about business. Silvertung

is at the bottom of all the mischief. I always did

bate the sneaking raseal; but I will be even with

him i he sha'n't have Elsie. Trust me, boy, to see to

that biz. To-morrow at ten o'clock we're off."

'Thus talking, they reached the house. Mr. Del-

ville unlocked his office &oor and struck a light. A

gust of wind swept in through' the broken panes, and

blew it out. St'anly shuddered. "Father, don't stay

in this lonesome, cheerless place to-night; go into the

house. If anything should happen."

" E it love for me, or for Elsie, that makes you so

anxious, eh, young man? Suppose anything should

happen, I am not defenseless. See here," and he drew

a large knife from beneath some papers. " This is a

sure friend, and it-has done some good work in ts

time," he added musingly..

Stanly regarded his father in amazement. What

could those words mean ?

A few moments' silence, broken only by the moan-

ing of the wind; then the clock struck nine, warning

Stanly to depart. " I must go; yet suppose I stay and

take Elsie. Perhaps I had better."

"Well if you do, the whole town will know of

your elopement before you reach the Warm Springs.'!

"So they will; you are right. But you won't fail ?"

"Not if I am alive."

Stanly left. At the gate he looked back. His

lather still toyed with the knife, absorbed in its con-

templation; and Stanly heard him repeat: "You

have done good work in your day; perhaps you will

yet do more."

The words of fearful portent filled Stanly with

anxious alarm; an alarm that seemed ridiculous, now

that blood-atonement was unfashionable. "Am    I

growing superstitious ? Bah I I'm wasting time. I

must be off. What nonsense I am thinking. Nothing

will occur to-night, and to-morrow we shall be safe."

Stanly began whistling to cheer his spirits, and

hurried off to the stable, where his own. trusty Prince,

his faithful four-fQoted friend, awaited him. In less

than an hour he was across the Jordan. .The excite-

rent of the ride raised his spirits; but it was a grue-

some night for a journey. The elements were prepar-e

ing for a battle. Already the thunder-drum beat the

reveill6; and every now and then a flash announced

that the storm spirits were trying their guns. Prince

evidently wanted to get out of it as quickly as

possible, for he sped along with the fleetness of the

wind. Absorbed in his reflections, Stanly scarcely

heeded his rapid progress, till a peal of thunder

which startled Prince, aroused- him to a sense of his

position. Hot Springs Lake was far behind. The

farms grew   fewer, and farther from   each other.

There on his right was the sage brush plain over which

towered the mountains, Not a sign of habitation was

visible. On his left rolled the black seething waters

of the great lake. There was no course but to go

bravely on. About three miles further was a shed.

If he could only reach it before the storm broke, he

could there take shelter. He soothed his horse, who

seemed to understand his master's thoughts. A few

- minutes brought them in sight of the shelter. Then

Prince suddenly stopped, pricked up his ears, and

Stanly distinctly heard some one approaching at a

furious galop. Who could it be? It certainly was

·  .not an ordinary traveler, for he would have taken the

*   high road. Perhaps, he also was hastening to find

protection from the storm. At that moment a flash of

'   i ' iightning showed him a horseman emerging from the

i ;' 0l1d Stanly sensed danger at once; and he was un-

'&mriaed  From the road to the lake was open space,

marshy in places, but not dangerous; by taking this

·route he might baffle these men if they were really

pursuing him. If the danger was only imaginary,

the detour would give him a wetting, nothing more.

To think4 was to do.- 'He galloped 'a short distance.

God I that sound again. They are pursuing him. -He

turns to the right: he sees in the glare of the light-

ning an armed- horseman almost upon him. He wheels

to the left. 'Prince is fleet-footed, he may out-distance

his pursuer. -On this side another enemy rushes to-

wards him. They hem him in. Turn which way he

will, a foe menaces his life. 

Thbre is a 'lash, not of lightning, and a bullet

whizzes past him.

To the lake, to the lake ! The shore shelves gently;

his horse feats not the water: escape is yet possible.

He swiftly turns: another bullet grazes his shoulder.

"Faster, faster, Prince, or we die," breathes Stanly,

as he bends over his horse to escape the missiles of 

death. Prince replies with a snort and a leap. The

storm bursts forth in all its fury. The heavens are on

fire, mountain and plain with thunder shake and trem-

ble. The waves, lashed to fury, roll up in moun- 

tainous masses, surging, dashing, foaming, hissing, now. 

shrouded in thick darkness, now luridly gleaming in

lightning flame. The brave horse recoils; his' mas.

ter urges him on into the seething abyss. The waves 

dash over them, but they must not falter, Around, ^ *

above, roars the tempest; before them, the roaring  '

storm-tossed sea, behind them, murder. Death every- .

where. Stanly's idea was to ride along the limit.2 ,, 

the shore, hoping thus to evade his pursuers. I. y' ?.:

a mad hope, but it seemed the only one. Finding th t

in a step or two more the horse will lose his footing,

he tried, during a recession of the waves, to head to the

northward, but, blinded by the lightning, frnzied by

the rar of the storm, the animal rears, stumblesa,

every limb quivering with fright. Stanly looks back.

The murderers are in the water, their pistols cover him.

H.e must die. "Father in Heaven I save me and Elsie."

There is a flash, a crash! A huge wave engulfs

horse and rider, and deluges the murderers, who fall

back appalled. The .wave recedes, then out of the

foam, on to the land; struggled a horse, on his.back an

empty saddle.                -

About this same hour, out of the front window of

Mr. Delville's office crawls a man. The window is

hastily closed, all noise lost in the roar of the storm.

Standing on the porch the man slips his hand through

the broken panes, fastens the catch, then leaps out into

the darkness.

only anxious one. Mrs. Dinly felt disturbed. She

this business. Her saintly oonsoience reproached her for

helping a sister return to Babylon. Suppose it should

ever be found out, what *ould be the consequence 

But what nonsense; who was going to find it out ? Any

means that would secure Lucy's position seemed right

to her mother heart, although uponthis point an idea

had suggested itself-that if the elder was determined

to marry, Elsie would be less-difficult to manage than a

stranger. However, this idea had not had sufficient time

to work any change in Sister Dinly's nind, swayed as

it was by so many stronger motives. Perhaps the

strongest of these, although the least apparent, was her

desire to thwart the elder. Since Mr. Dinly's marriage

Sister Dinly owed all men a-grudge, and she laughed in

anticipation of the discomfiture of the would-be bride-

groom whed he should discover that his love had flown

away. What fun-it would be to see the blank looks,

to hear the exclamations, the surmises ! Then it would

give her a chance to display her histrionic powers, for

she was a born actress. Yet with all this delightful

anticipation, Sister Dinly regretted her part in the

affair, and once she thought of missing her appoint-

ment; but that would never do. She had always

kept her word ; besides, Elsie might get desperate and

run off anyway.- No, she would go; but it was rather

late when she started, On her way she met the elder,

who seemed more smiling than usual.

"Sister Sara, the women are waiting for you. I'm

off to the country, but I shall be back in time for your

party." 

"Thank God, he is out of the way: that will make

it easier," thought Mrs. Dinly, watching him as he

rode out of sight, ,

8J&9'               WAITING.

-When Mrs. Dinly reached Silvertung's house, she

found Elsie half wild with suspense. The girl's man-

-ner was so strained and unnatural, that Mrs. Dinly

feared it would betray everything. She must be got

out of the way. Her pre-arranged plans were upset

by the arrival of some visitors, who would detain them

an hour at least. But her wit aided her. She would

send Elsie- upon an errand. ·

"Elsie, dear, you are younger than -I, and do not

mind steps.    wish you would run up to Bishop

Jones'i and ask them to come round this afternoon;

then come up to the Bee-Hive; we shall be there.".

Elsie bowed assent; she could not speak. How

she longed to kiss her mother good-bye ; but she

dared not; it would look suspicious. A word even

would be enough to foil all plans for liberty. . Still

Elsie lingered; .perhaps she would never see them

again : tears filled her eyes. 

"Come, come," cried Sister Dinly, who trembled

in spite of herself, "come, when I was young, I didn't

:loiter. What's coming to the young folks ?"

" Elsie has been queer all the morning. What is

the matter ?" remarked Mrs. Silvertung.

Another word from her mother, and Elsie would

have broken down. She ran from the house. She

was out in the street, on the way. The moment she

had so impatiently desired had come; and it had

*bfought sorrow i/fstead of gladness. Mechanically,

she.reached the Jones' house, and delivered the mes-

sage. As she turned to leave, Mr. Jones hurried out

exclaiming, - It is twenty minutes of ten. Can't stop-"

Twenty minutes of ten! The announcement elec-

trified Elsie. She awoke from her dream of sadness.








<pb n="325"/>
°'- W.fITIYF.                m89

In twenty minutes she must -be on the Hot Springs

road, by the creek, ready to jump into Mr. Detvilie's

buggy. It.was-a long walk. Elsie walked as she had

never walked before. Once she stopped in a retired

spot to tie a thick vail-over her face and hat. At last

she arrived at the appointed place, all breathless with

haste and expectation. She looked up and down the

road, but no buggy was in sight. Was she too late?

Mr. Delville would certainly wait for her * minute. A

woman was working in the garden of -a cottage near

by. Of her, Elsie inquired the hour. The woman

good-naturedly went indoors to qonsult' the clock.

Elsie clutched the fence to support herself, so much

she dreaded to hear that she was late.

"Four minutes of ten; and our clock is right to a

minute. I put it by the town-clock this very morning."

Four minutes of ten 1. Thank God, she was in time.

She rested a minute to take breath, and then, to avoid

exciting curiosity, she walked down a block. Mr. Del-

ville was dot yet.iu sight; so she turned back, crossed

the street, and walked leisurely towards the creek.

She heard ten o'clock strike; the sound of wheels

caught her ears. It was only-a cart; then a buggy ap-

peared. It was he, surely. She started into the mid-

dle bf the road, so as to be all ready. . A stranger sat

in the vehicle: be did not notice the vailed woman,,

and passed on without a sign. Elsie drew back, sitk

and dizzy. Why was he late? Stanly would have'

been there long ago. She waited a few seconds; they,

seemed hours, and she fancied every one rof the'passers-

by watched, her as if they guessed her -purpose.

It had been agreed that if Elsie had to wait (for

some delay might occur), she should walk on towards

that five minutes more of inaction would drive her

her anxiety increasing with every disappointment. -On

she walked, block after block, stopping ever and again

to. scan the road. Nothing, nothing as yet. The sun

was hot and the path dusty, but jElsie did not know it.

She only. knew that Mr. Delville was late. She kept

on, still hoping, till her progress was stayed by a

smoking sulphur stream, running across the road. She

was a the Hot Springs, and yet no friendly Mr. Del-

ville in sight. 

Elsie groaned: "Why did he not come " How

anxious Stanly would be! It was no use to go any

further. She retraced her steps-perhaps she would

meet him; but her heart grew heavier, her cheek

whiter at every step. A pile of wood lying by the

way-side offered- a seat. She was so weary, a rest

would.do her good. She sat down and waited. Oh !

tie sickening suspense of that waiting. -Where could

they-,be? Was it Tuesday and not Monday ? No, for

every letter of thq note was stereotyped upon her

brain  and it was in Stanly's handwriting. Some de-

lay must have occurred. She recommenced walking,

meeting few, and none for whom she cared. As: she

turned the corner of South Temple street, the whistles

blew the hour of noon. The sound caused Elsie to

stop. Hope was dead for that. day. She must return

quickly, or her absence would lead to an inquiry that

would frustrate all future plans.

How weary she felt I The passers-by appeared in a

melting condition, but Elsie shivered with cold. She

and her mother must have returned. When she came

in sight of the house, she saw them entering.

"Why, Elsie, where have you been ?"

"Only for a walk, mother."

Mrs. Dinly could only exclaim, "Elsie !" The re-

appearance of the girl amazed her. / It overturned all

her ideas. Fortunately, Mrs. Silvertung never no-'

ticed anything; so Mrs. Dinly's astonishment passed

unheeded.. As soon as she collected her senses, she

called Elsie out of the room, and learned all that had

happened. Three words explained all the mystery

" No one came." 

As to the why and the wherefore, Elsie was too

sick at heart to surmise. She could only think of the

terrible disappointment. Mrs. Dinly did not know

whether to feel glad or sorry, She returned to'the

parlor in rather a confused state of mind.'

CHAPTER XL.

A TERRIBLE DISOOVERY.

·S we have already stated, Mrs. Dinly was so-

cially inclined. She loved company above

all things, exdept match:making. The fact

that she had no house in town did not in

any way interfere with her party giving. The Saints-

are all brothers and sisters; and one would think their

homes common property from the freedom with which

they are invaded; and quite unconcerned, Sister Dinly

invited her friends when and where she pleased; and

her conduct gave surprise neither to the invited

guests nor the invaded hostess.    '' '








<pb n="328"/>
* 8X8       A  TERRIBLE    DISCOVERY.

. Sister Simpson often repented the hour when she

allowed Sister Dinly to take a share in her husband's

eternal honors. However, it was no use grumbling

about it flow; it was done, and she tried to make the

best of it. The ladies came early, bringing their work

and their babies; for this gathering was to be quite a

family affair. But we will pass over the minor details.

A sensation was in store for the company.

"Why I" exclaimed Sister Dinly, who was on the

qui vive for news, "just look! here's Brother Jones

. and Sister Silea, and I;do believe they are running a

..iace to see who will get here first. Something's up,

I know by their faces." 

As she finished speaking, Brother Jones rushed in;

"Brothers, sisters, have you heard the awful news?'!

Before any one could answer, Sister Silea arrived,

her handkerchief to her eyes.

"It is horrible I but I knew it, I saw it in his face

yesterday."

"What is it, what is it ?"

- They both began to speak, but Brother Jones' big

voice drowned Sister Silea's thin-one,

-'  "John Delville committed suicide last night."

The company screamed. - Sister Silea lookec dag-

gers at Brother Jones for daring to forestall her- in

news. But the good brother was proof against black

looks. He had seven wives ! But if he had cheated

her of the grand coup;he couldn't give all the interest-

ing touches as she could; so she consoled herself as

she continued:

"Yes; he went home from    meeting last night,

locked all the doors, then cut his throat. The knife,

a horrible-looking thing, lay by his side as if it had








<pb n="329"/>
A  TERRIBLE    DIBO VERY. 89 

fallen from his hand. And the expression on his face

is so awful, that it just chills one all through to look

,at it. The eyes arestaring-as if they had seen a hun-

dred ghosts." Sister Silea stopped to give more effect

to her words. This gave her rival a chance.

". His hand 'still grasped the knife when the body

was discovered, this morning, about eleven o'clock,"

added Brother Jones, ignoring the scornful look of

Sister Silea, who, without noticing the interruption,

continued: "Yesterday he went to each one of his

wives, bade her good-bye, and gave instructiohs as to...

what should be done when he was dead and gone."  'i, S

By this time other visitors had arrived. One re -'

lated how he had sharpened the razor the morning

before. Another that he had left a letter, stating that

he felt his disgrace too keenly to live any longer. Ac-

cording to all accounts, it was a premeditated suicide.

The company were flushed with excitement; for of all

sublunary things'a murder or a suicide possesses the

most absorbing interest.

Mrs. Dinly's company knew how to make the most

of the horror.- -They exclaimed, discussed, condemned,

deplored.  Their excitement prevented them  froni:

noting Elsie's look of horror and anguish. She knew

at last why no kind deliverer came, why she had waited

in vain. Then Elder Silvertung arrived, a composed

funeral smile upon his countenance. "I feel it deeply.

Delville was a much loved brother. Yet, I am more

shocked than surprised.  I heard of it as soon as, I

returned to town, and drove immediately to the house

of mourning. There I met the President."

"Ah I What did he' say ?"

-   "He almost wept. He ordered all due respect 'to

be.paid to the remains of the unfortunate man. He'

tried to comfort the family; and, for their sake, he

says he won't allow the subject to be talked about."

"How kind he is I" exclaimed Silea. "When. i4

the funeral ?"

"On Wednesday. You see, Stanly must be found."

"Stanly I Why, he was here yesterday."

"It appears he left last night for Ogden, My ex-

perience tells me that young man will come to bad,"

continued the elders This was said for Elsie's benefit.

At the mention of 8tanly's name, the poor girl had

come forward to listen.

" Iexpect that is the reason Sister Oreana would not

receive us this morning. Don't you think so, Mary ?"

This query came from Sister Dinly, who, pitying Elsie,.

wished to turn the conversation from Stanly.

"Very likely, Sarah. How badly she must feel."

"Indeed you are mistaken," cried S;lea; "she

doesn't feel much now, more's the pity. I always did

think there was something wrong about her; and it

turns out that I was right." 

" What do you mean ? Nothing is wrong, I hope,

with my old friend, Oreana."

"I heard," said Lucy, "that she takes on awful;

never goes to table or cares for-her children."

" They say she is jealous," remarked Sister Simpson.

" Then she ought not to belong to our sisterhood.

Celestial marriage is not for the jealous," exclaimed

Sister Dinly. " But I see you know all about it, Silea;

What is the matter?". 

"I cannot tell you all; for I never was intimate

with Sister Oreana; but I know she keeps herself

drunk with opium. She has lost all her beauty, and

scarcely knows her own children. They say she is

ltad at times, pees awful things."

"How horrible. Well, pride will have a fall. All

through jealousy. Sisters, that is a lesson for us."

Such were the comments upon Oreana's downfall; but

whether from callousness, or a secret sympathy they

dared not express,.the sisters let the matter drop, and

returned to the absorbing topic of the suicide. Un,

fortunately, the. elder seemed unwilling to converse

further upon the subject; to change the conversation,

he asked for Elsie. Poor Elsie, no. one had thought

of her; and she was only too glad to escape notice.

But the elder wished to exhibit her accomplishments

to the company. She had to sing, play a waltz on the

wheezing melodeon, and answer questions innumerable.

She failed in all.. The elder was disgusted; but then

he consoled himself with the thought that these fail-

ures were evidences of her keen disappointment, and

he laughed in his heart.

About eight o'clock the party broke up. Sister

Silea produced a touching finale, by counseling the

mothers to guard well their babies, as the scarlet fever

was very bad in town.

The messenge' came back from Ogden with the news

that the young man had not been there, although

many testified to his departure on Sunday. This news

shocked Elsie more than all else. She was suspicious

t .' of wrong-doing. All the stories she had ever heard

', '- aBtdut the Danites flashed across her mind. They, no

':.^'doubt, could explain this disappearance as well as the

. so-called suicide. She recalled those words of the

elder to Stanly, at their last unfortunate tryst: "I'll

crush you ;" and she felt that he had executed his

'threat. She shuddered as she looked at that cruel,

smiling face, and thought of the awful deeds it had

smiled upon. 

Marry that man, she never would, never. They

should kill her first. What was death, anyway, that

she should fear it ? Death was preferable to the living

death of being that man's wife.

After breakfast, on Tuesday morning, Silvertung

told Elsie and her mother that he had spoken with

the President about. Elsie ;. and that the sealing was

fixed for Saturday at 10 A. x- He wished it sooner,

but that every day until then he would be occupied

with business. Elsie looked towards her mother, but

the latter made no sign. "Now," continued Silver-

tung, "it is my wish to make you quite comfortable.

You shall have'.ahouse in the Twentieth Ward. It is

all ready except Airhishing, that we can soon do. You,

Mary, shall bring your children from Smithville and

keep house for Elsie. Why, you will be as happy as

queens. We, will go now and look at the house.

Come, get ready; for I have not much time to spare."

At the mention of a house in town, Mary's face

brightened. To have a house to herself, and have

Elsie and her children around her in peaceful comfort,

was the one great longing of this crushed woman.

Misery had so degraded her that physical well-being

was-'the only happiness she could imagine. A house 

of her own outweighed a daughter's sacrifice. She 

looked imploringly at Elsie, who stood in a stiff, un- *t-

compromising attitude, the only signs of emotion the 'F.

twitching of her mouth. Evidently the girl was pre :

paring for'resistance. The thought of resistance made

the mother tremble.

"Oh, Elsie dear, think how-comfortable we shall

be in a nice house all to ourselves I"

Elsie replied by a look of scorn. She had not yet

learned the power of circumstances, or how to look

from other people's standpoint. Impulsive youth is

never tolerant, and she almost hated her mother -for

her weakness. Rebellion was rife in Elsie's heart;

she was determined to defy the elder, yet she faltered

at the supreme moment. The scathing words died

away in her throat, and tears drowned the annihilating

glances. The strain of the last two days had so ex-

hausted her, mentally and physically, that what seemed

so easy became most difficult. Still she must force

herself to speak. Collecting all her energy she turned

to the elder and said, in a husky voice that frightened

her, so unnatural it sounded: "El!pr Silvertung, I

cannot many you. It is cruel of you to wish me to

do so, knowing that I do'not love you."

" My dear young lady," replied the elder, "it is a

girl's duty to obey,-to accept the husband chosen for'

her by those who understand such matters. As for

love, all that is necessary will come. You must keep

in mind that Saints marry from principle." ....

Hi calm manner irritated the girl; it spurred her

to resist. "But I am not a Saint. I won't marry you.

I will kill myself first," sobbed Elsie. The words were

out, but they sounded weak and childish, compared to

the bold defiance she had rehearsed to herself. Silver-

tung laughed, as if it were a good joke.

"What a spirited Elsie it is I How handsome she

looks when angry I Pray, my dear, what kind of

death do you intend to try? Poison is the nicest,

because it won't spoil that pretty face; but it will

taste nasty.-' Don't you want some sugar-plums to

take after it? Please tell us when the tragedy is to

take place, so that we can make it a success. In the

mean time, we may as well visit the house in the

Twentieth Ward. I give you just five minutes to get

ready. One word,-Mary, I shall hold you responsible

for your daughter's conduct.: She is to be sealed to

me on Saturday, and we don't wish any scenes.  You

fully understand ?"

There is no use to defy the elder, it is wicked: you will

be punished, so shall I :'come, dear, put on your things.'

Here Mrs. Mary barst into tears. 

Elsie could not pdure to see her mother suffering.

'Her courage sank.    

Anyway, just going torsee the house was not being

up for his cruelty, by giving his victims a pretty dwell-

light: she did not speak again to Elsie about the mar-

riage, but her looks were more eloquent than words.

After visiting the house, the elder took them to

-op. He and Mrs. Mary bought a great deal of

niture for the new house. Elsie took no part in

ything, neither was she consulted. Both the elder

ad her mother seemed to consider the marriage as all

ttled. What could she do?

never could consent that the elder should take a sixth

wife, as he had promised me Lucy should be the last.

But dear, I have got over that now,snd I do think it

is best for you to marry him. You see, dear, Stanly

has proved faithless-nay, don't interrupt me. I un-

derstand men better than you do, my child; they only

look out for their own interests. 'Anyway, if he has

not proved faithless, he has disappeared. His father

killed himself the very night before he was to take

this ? I do: it is His will that you marry the elder.

It will make it so comfortable for your mother. It

will give her a nice home. Why, by this time next

year, you will bless me for having thus advised you."

Elsie was weeping. The allusion to her lover had

opened the floodgates. Leaving Mrs. Dinly rather     ''

brusquely, she ran to hide herself iu her room.

In the silence of her little room, Elsie meditated.

She thought of those she loved. How few there were

who loved her. Her mother would sacrifice her.

Her father-where was he? She was worse than an

orphan. And Stanly, where was he? Could he be

false ? No  she would not believe it. He, her friend,

her companion, her lover, her affianced husband, he who

loved her, who understood her so well. The thought of

their meetings, their-plans for future happiness; of

how they reveled in the joy of that unreal future,

with all the sanguine faith of youth that foresees no

obstacle, doubts not, fears not, because it never looks

beyond itself. Like the little peas in the pod, who

said, "The stalk that holds us is green, its leaves

are green, the pods are green, we are green; therefore,

all the world is green,"-so it is with the young.

Elsie hesitated a moment, then she wrote upon the

piece of paper in which she enfolded the ring, these

words: " I am to be sealed to Elder Silvertung. Save

me." She did not put the day fixed for the sacrifice,

because she could not bring herself to think of it.

She wrote the address in a large hand, so that nothing.

might be suspected; then, quickly putting on her hat,

she slipped out unperceived, and took a back street to

the post-office, trembling all the time lest some one

should see her and discover her errand. Fortune

smiled upon her. She reached the office, and mailed

the package without being seen by any one. All fear

of detection removed, her thoughts began a query as

to this mysterious friend named Jim Tracy. Who

was he? what was he? where was he? And why

should he take an interest in her? How was he

going to save her? Suppose he were dead ? She

shuddered at the thought.

When Elsie reached home she found two teachers 

awaiting her. It is the duty of the teachers to go 

round to the houses of the Saints to spur the in-

mates to greater zeal, and also to adjust any minor

difficulties that may arise. They had heard of Elsie's

resistance and considered it their duty to call. Their

admonitions to rebellious Elsie were a repetition of

the counsels already given her, with the addition of a '

eulogy on the elder, and a discourse upon the honor,

and the exaltation that Elsie would receive from this

alliance; with hints also, as to the punishments the

Lord must in justice inflict upon any one so blind and

ungrateful as to refuse such grant gifts. Elsie sat

through the long visit, silent. In truth, she scarcely

heard what was said, so busy was her mind with Jim

THE FUNERAL.                 41

CHAPTER XLIIL

THE FUNERAL.

NCE more night came, but Elsie could not

sleep. Her brain whirled with conjecture,

and in her heart hope fought a battle with

despair. Wednesday morning she arose,

languid, weary. Her physical strength was failing

from sleeplessness and want of nourishment; for since

her trial commenced she could not eat. The excite-

ment also began to tell painfully upon her system.

Very little would bring on an illness. The child

looked ill, her head ached as well as her heart; the

slightest sound made her tremble and gasp; one mo-

ment she was burning, the next shivering, her pulse

varied with her feelings.

Wednesday was the morning of the funeral. The

elder wished all the family to go; and the elder's will

was law. Elsie walked with her mother to the meet-

ing-house. As they were about to cross Main street,

Mrs. Silvertung stopped to speak with a friend. At

the same time, a man close to them hailed a passing

horseman. The latter reined in and drew near the

sidewalk close by the spot where Elsie stood.

A short dialogue, replete with interest for her, en-

sued, although the speakers were strangers. "I say,

Bob, are yer off to the mines?" "Off to Nevada,

this very minute." " Going anywhere near where Jim

Tracy is now ?" "To the very place, without stop-

ping; they have struck it rich. Got anything for

Jim ?  " Yes; here is a very small packet. It is very

important. Jim spoke to me about it wbi he was

here. He wants it delivered prompt at.sure. I

The horseman galloped off. Elsie could so

stand. The ring was on its way. She had seen 'i

horseman had promised to deliver to Jim Tracy,t

mysterious friend. But what chilled her to the h

She stood as if turned to stone, till aroused by

efforts of her mother to move her.

sacrifice. If Stanly were only near to help I Perhaps 

he was. Yes, he might be at the funeral. He must

be; she would see him. In vain she looked among the 

mourners; the one she sought was not there. 

After the service, Elder Silvertung told Elsie that 

the bishop wished to see her. Elsie quaked; she knew 

what that meant, but it was useless to refuse. The 

elder led her into a small room adjoining the large 

meeting-hall. Here the bishop and his two counselors 

awaited them. Elsie quivered; she felt herself grow 

.pale and blue. Her soul cried out to Heaven for help, 

for pity, for none could she find in man. The bishop's 'I

countenance was not one to inspire hope and confi- 

denoe. Sensual and tyrannical-the rebellious met no .

quarter from him. And women! Alas I This man 

enjoyed the unenviable reputation of being an ex-

cellent woman-driver. Many an indignant sister had

gone to him with her woes, asking help; they always

left him meek and submissive, asking help of no one

except, perhaps, of death. His counselors were shad-

ows of himself-cruel, sensual, unprincipled, greedy of

gain. Elsie knew them, and detested them. The first

salutations over, the bishop began: "My dear sister,

or rather, child, for you are nothing more, I have

heard some very sad accounts of you-that you are re-

bellious. Now rebellion leads to apostasy, and apos-

tasy to eternal damnation."

"Amen," said the counselors.

" Bishop," said the elder, " I think that my ward's

conduct is the result of bad influences, which, thank

the Lord, are now remonie Still, she is naturally weak

in the faith-so weak that I feel in duty bound to have

her sealed to me, so that.j may assure her salvation."

" Very virtuous and praiseworthy," said the bishop.

"For which kindness she ought to be most grate-

ful," added the chief counselor.

"Instead of that she refuses me-nay, defies me."

"And her reasons for such rebellious conduct ?"

"Ask her," said the elder, " she ought to know best."

"Give us your reasons for refusing Elder Silver-

tung, your guardian."

Elsie felt half dead with fear and shame. What

could she say under the glare of those eight cruel eyes.

Dared she say she loved another? But of what use,,

would that be, even were it the true one. But it was

not; for long before that "other" came, she hated

this union. She hated polygamy; and then that other

" Worse and worse. This is a matter that the Ch

be stopped. Now, elder, if your ward don't come to

reason pretty soon, bring her to us; but I think you

can manage the business, now that you have Brother

Leifert's excellent opinion. As for you, girl, I should

advise you to submit gracefully to the inevitable."

Elsie bit her lips till they bled. The humiliation

was horrible, and there was no hope.

CHAPTER     XLIV.

IMPRISONMENT     AND   BEPRIEVE.

j LIE  walked home alone; for since the

Delvilles were out of the way, Silvertung

did not deem it necessary to watch his

step-daughter. He knew well she could

not escape. It may seem strange that Elsie did not

seek refuge among the apostates, or at the-military

camp, but the idea never entered her mind. She was

so impressed with the power of the Church, its aveng-

ing power; her ideas of the elder's legal right over

her actions were so exaggerated, that if a stranger had

spoken to her concerning her troubles, she would have

kept silent through fear. To attempt escape, alone,

without money, as she once dreamed of, she felt

would be worse than useless. Her town experience

had taught her that. No, there was nothing left to

her but to die. She was willing to die, now that

Stanly was gone. Death would be freedom.

While thinking these sad thoughts, she came to a

cottage from whence proceeded cries and moans as of

a child in pain. She remembered that two children

latter looked as if she would like to give some one-*'

piece of her mind. Before Elsie could discover tha. -

trouble, the elder entered, and bade her follow him. '

The girl thought of the council: but it was useless to

resist. She followed him in silence. He led her to a  "

small room in the garret, politely invited her to enter,

thbn closed the door and looked it.

Elsie was a prisoner. From outside the door her

jailer informed her that he felt it his duty to drive

out the bad spirit ;' and that solitary confinement and

hunger were considered the most potent weapons. He

hoped that twenty-four hours would make her a true

obedient Saint. With this prayerful hope, the vir-

tuous elder left his prisoner, whose heart grew lighter

as the sound of his footsteps died away.

Imprisonment was preferable to his society, and

starvation would bring death all the sooner.

The room looked liked a cell. A straw bed and a

broken chair comprised the furniture. Elsie's head

throbbed with pain. She threw herself upon the straw

and tried to rest. Perhaps some kindly spirit lulled

her, for when she awoke the morning dawn was break-

ing. She felt very hungry; and as the long hours

passed she could think of nothing but something to eat.

The elder did not intend to kill lfeW ; and about

noon he ordered Mrs. Mary to takle her.ughter some 

dry bread and a cup of water; and tb report to him ' 

if the bad spirit was conquered. When he heard

Mrs. Silvertung go up the stairs, he started from his

chair as if a bright idea had just come to him, and he

watafraid of losing it; then he followed her stealth-

ily to the door Of the prison, and listened.

" My poor eai,?' said Mrs. Silvertung, " how hun-

gry you are I To' think you should be obliged to eat

dry bread."

"Dry bread is very good, Mother. Think how

many would be glad to get it. You'ought to be

pleased to see I have an appetite."

"Don't talk that way; don't be so self-willed."

" 0 Elsie I why will you make us all suffer so mucho?

"Very good, indeed, very good. Mrs. Silvertung,

row, when I hope to congratulate you on your success.

You know how to manage her, for she is just like her. 

father, and you managed him pretty well."

The elder locked the door. Elsie started to her

feet indignant at the insult. Her mother sank into a

chair. The elder overdid himself.  His last taunt

stung the woman's conscience into life. Elsie was

furious; she did not care for herself, but that her *

mother should suffer imprisonment and hunger was

more than she could bear. She vented her anger upon

the Church, upon the elder; and strange to say, un-

checked by her mother, who still sat mute and motion-

less. She was looking back into the past. She was

thinking of the husband she had deceived, the home

she had sacrificed; and for what? And her child

condemned to misery or death! Could such horror

be the will of God ?

The hours ps3sed drearily. Absorbed in their own

sad thoughts, mother and daughter remained silent,

for there was but little sympathy between them,,and

still less confidence; exchange of thought was impos-

sible. When darkness came, the women tried to make

themselves comfortable for the night; rather a diffi-

cult task with the meagre accommodations of their

prison. Elsie was glad to lie down, for her head

throbbed, her throat was parched, her limbs ached.

At one time her blood seemed on fire, then again it

crawled through her veins icy cold. Was her wish

going to be realized ?

The next noon brought the elder; but the bad

spirit was not yet conquered. When the door of the

prison closed upon them for another twenty-four hours,

Mrs. Silvertung's indignation died out. She was again

the timid, weak Mary Silvertung. She begged, she

IMPRIBONlENT AND       tEPPRIEVB.     349

.implored Elsie to yield. Elsie listened apathetically:

she refused to touch her dinner, saying her throat

hurt her too much. Mrs Silvertung began to think

that her strong-willed child had resolved to starve

herself to death; and she poured forth tears, prayers

and reproaches, till Elsie answered peevishly: "Let

me be until to-morrow morning, Mother. I will, yes,

but wait until to-morrow." Elsie uttered the words

with difficulty, as if in pain; her. head was so hot, her

ey&s heavy, and a bright spot burned in each cheek.

"You are ill, Elsie. I will make a noise, some one

will come."

"No, dear mother, no; wait until to-morrow."

At dawn the next morning the household were

awakened by a great noise from the garret. Mr. Sil-

vertung, who was a little uneasy concerning the prison

experiment, ran up-stairs, followed by Mrs. Lucy.

They found Elsie lying on the bed flushed with fever

and moaning piteously. Mrs. Lucy screamed out,

".Sie has the fever. Oh I my children, they will

catch it. Take her away from here."

"Of course," said Silvertung, "take her to her room."

"No;" said Lucy, " not there; the children will take

it, Iknow they will Can't she go to the other house?"

"Nonsense, woman I how do you know it is the

fever ?"

" How do I know ? Just look at her, feel her pulse."

"I will go for the doctor," said Silvertung. " But

she must be taken from here."

Mrs. Lucy began again to expostulate, when Mrs.

Mary begged she might take Elsie to the other house:

some of the rooms were ready.

. "Mother was in last night and said that everything

go at once; a few hours and you won't dare move

her. My girl can go with you. I will do without one.

Anything to get the fever out of this house."

Thus urged, Silvertung got a carriage and removed

Elsie to the house in the Twentieth Ward. When

the doctor came he declared it to be a case of malig-

nant fever. Elsie had obtained her reprieve.

tain, huge bowlders piled one upon another, with here

and there a ridge of gleaming quartz, a block, iris-

veined, the mystic sentinels of earth's hidden treasures,

sphinxes whose riddles have destroyed thousands.

Two hundred feet below, down a narrow precipitous

canyon, flows a mountain streamed fringed with ver-

dure. Beyond, to the 'North, stretches the great Salt

Desert, mountain-ribbed. As far as the eye can see, it

is desert and mountain, mountain and desert, an infi-

nite solitude. And yet beyond lies the busy world,

with its cities, its millions of restless beings. And

this world is but a drop, an atom in theuniuivese.

Aye, truly, the voices of the mountains are echoes

from the infinite.

Along the trail rides a solitary horseman. It is the

same one whom Elsie saw carry off that tiny package

upon the delivery of which her hopes depended. The

slow gait of the tired horse is unendurable to swift-

winged thought. So let him plod along, while we

speed onwards. As the trail ascends the mountains,

they appeai less rugged, the canyon grows narrower

and less deep, until at last it disappears, and the

mountain stream ripples over the rocks only a few feet

below the trail. Suddenly voices and laughter break

upon the ear. Turning a point, we come upon a tent

sheltered by an abutting rock.  At a few yards' dis-

tance is a habitation built of rough stone roofed with

canvas. Higher in the mountain is a rude blacksmith's

forge, by its side yawns a cavernous opening. It is a

mine in its first stage of development; and the primi-

tive habitations form a mining camp.

Half a dozen niners are assembled in the tent.

They are not begrimmed, dissatisfied, hopeless beings,

toiling in the bowels of the earth for a miserable

pittance; but sanguine, self-important men, working

their own property, or prospecting for a rich strike;

already millionaires in imagination. In the rough

stone habitation Jim Tracy sits alone. He was never

very social; few had ever seen him smile. He was a

man with a history. His companions felt this, and

respected his taciturnity ; but if not social he was

kind and generous, and his many good deeds had won

more than respect. Fortune had favored him. Not

only had he "struck it rich," but he had sold his

strike at ak good figure, a lucky event of rare occur-

Along the trail hastened the lonely man, a deadly

purpose in his mind, a deadly weapon next his heart.

Quietly the elder reposed in his comfortable bed, un-

disturbed by phantom or fear. His enemies were

brought low, and, in his triumph, he cried, "They will

trouble me no more." Foolish is the triumph of the

wicked. While he boasted in his security, swiftly

towards him sped Nemesis.

HANKS to a good constitfl        areful

nursing, Elsie soon became convalescent;

her recovery being doubtless accelerated

by the absence of the elder, whom busi-

ness called South abeutttwo days after she was taken

ill. Her friends declared that the fever was a punish-

ment for her rebellion. Elsie thought differently, and

with good reason, but she said nothing.

Health brought back the struggle. How would it

end ? At first, she believed that the reprieve was pro-

phetic of good; then, as time passed, each day bring-

ing nearer the elder's return, and yet no word, no sign

from her mysterious friend, hope grew faint. A letter

came from Silvertung announcing his speedy return,

and ordering that everything should be in readiness

for the sealing. The news destroyed every hope; it

put out every light in Elsie's heart and brain; for she

felt that resistance was no longer possible. She must

be one more victim.

narration was very long. Elsie felt too deeply to talk,

. :...iLSIE was beside herself with joy. Stanly

was safe, and her friend assured her of

freedom. She danced, she sang, and made

such a noise that her mother came to the

door, to see what was the mater. "Elsie, child, you

will catch your death of cold ; you must be crazy." 

" Yes, mother, I am crazy with joy ;" and to prove

her words, Elsie ran up to the mother, caught her in a

close embrace, and danced her into the house.

A lamp burned on the table, which was strewn

with work; for Mrs. Silvertung had no time to waste

in twilight reveries, even bad she been so inclined.

Elsie seated henmother, and then danced round the

room clapping her hands. "Don't, Elsie , you will

awaken the children, and I'm so tired. What ever can

you find to be so happy about ?" The woman sighed.

The words and the sigh touched Elsie; she stopped,

looked at her mother's wan, hopeless face, and sighed

too. What was there, indeed, to be so happy about ?

Since the imprisonment, Mrs. Silvertung's manner

towards Elsie had changed. It seemed deprecatory,

as if the Woman had become conscious of the wrong

she had inflicted upon her child. The affectionate

girl quickly perceived the change. She shrank from

qounding, by word or deed, the mother's heart, bruised

by remorse; so she checked her joyous demonstrations,

which savored of cruel mockery, and embraced her

mother, saying: "Mother, dear, I want you to re-

joice with me, for I have some good news; so don't

sew any more to-night. I will help you lots to-

morrow. Come now, there's a dear." The girl fondly

stroked her mother's pals cheek; in doing so, the ring,

which in the excitement Elsie had slipped on her fore-

finger, attached Mrs. Silvetung's attention.

"Why, Elsie, where did you get that ring?"

"That is a secret, Mother dear, that I will tell you,

;   if. you promise never, never to speak of it. But there,

I.. -  don't think you will tell the elder now."

': -' While Elsie was talking, her mother took the

png and examined it with eager scrutiny. Then she

rose, went to a little box, the only one se kept locked,

opened it and drew from its recesses another ring, the

counterpart of Elsie's, only smaller. " It is, it is," mut-

tered the mother; then, turning to Elsie, she cried:

"Speak, quick, tell me where you got thi ?" Mrs.

Silvertung uttered the command in a hollow voice;

her featsr lost their immobility; her eyeqglared.

Elsie had *ever seen her look like that. 4zinment

prevented her answering. "Are you dumb? Won't

you tell me how, and when you got this ring ?. Who

gave it to you ? What did he say? Don't look at me

so I but speak." The woman's voice ended in a shriek.

Elsie felt alarmed.

"Mother, for mercy's sake, don't get'so excited.

I will tell you all about it; at least, all I know, if you

will give me a chance."

Elsie. She listened while for the second time that

evening Elsie told all she knew about the ring and the

sender. "But, Mother," continued Elsie, "the strangest

of all is this. The day I left Smithville,-do you re-

member? as we passed that point where the old trail

meets the road, a man, looking like t tramp, stood

there as if waiting for ns. Something in the man's face

attracted me. He seemed to 19ok into my very soul."

" What was he like; can you remember ?"

"I can never forget! -He was dark, eyes large and

piercing, but kind; the lower part of his face hidden

by a heavy beard; not tall, but broad-shouldered. He

looked superior to most of the tramps, and somehow IK . 

thought he had suffered a great deal. After we hat *..

passed, I remembered that he was standing in the road . 

near the house when we started." 

Then it was not all fancy," muttered the womanu  .*

" Go on, go on."

"Well, he sent that ring to me, with promisei of

help;--for I met him, after that, here in Salt Lake;

but he was dressed better then."

" What did he say ?"

Oaly asked me if I had received the pahage. He

would t t answer any questions; but he is the man.

Brother Menly recognized him immediately, from my

description. Now I will show you the notes."

"The notes! He has written? Quick, child, let

me see them, and don't look at me as if you were my

judge ;" for Elsie stood, one hand in her pocket, gaz-

ing at her mother in utter bewilderment. That her

mother, always so hopelessly quiescent, should display

such violent emotion, was more of a mystery than that

surrounding the ring.

clutched the papers; but instead of reading th

notes. It seemed as if she-were afraid of seeing 

ten thereon some awful doom. "Why, Mother, lo

"Mrs. Silvertung, shivering, opened the first o

with fright, there was no one near to heed. Was thi

apd smoothed the damp brow.

At length the spasm passed away. Mrs. Silver;

tung lay quiet and still, save an occasional moaning

cry: " He has come, though they told me he was dead.

He has come; for what ?"

Elsie heard the words with trembling; she felt she 

was approaching a mystery that would color her life. ·

"Him I" repeated Elsie, "Who?"

"The husband of my youth-your father; he who

promises to save you."

"My father I"

"Yes, 'tis he. Don't reproach me I don't look at

me so pitilessly! I was blind, deluded. Oh! how I

have suffered ! Forgive me, Elsie; pray for me, pray

him to pardon me. Don't let his curse pursue me to

the grave. He will grant you anything, he loved you

so dearly. Ah ! how wrong it was-how he must have

suffered I and I- But God must forgive me, for I did

it for His sake. Elsie, can you forgive me?"

Elsie answered with a kiss, for tears stifled all ut-

terance. It was she who wept now, while her mother,  *

the woman of tears, looked on dry-eyed.

"God bless you, Elsie. Stay with me to-night,

I'm afraid. A crisis comes-I'm afraid. He is not

dead-not dead !"

TASIE was alone with her thoughts, with the

emotions awakened by the revelation just

fallen from her mothers lips. This man,

this mysterious friend, was then her father.

The father, for whom her heart yearned, with longing

affection. And he had promised to save her. Wasit to

save her or avenge himself ? Her tyrant owed her father

a terrble debt. A debt payable only in blood. An awful

, ~               RETRIBUTION. 

BELATED traveler rides into Mountainw

Meadows-meadows no more save in tray-

dition. The hills are bare, and scarred by :

deep chasms and clefts, as if rent by horror 

6      and despair. The springs have disappeared into the ,

earth. The trees are withered skeletons. The waving t

grass, the wild cherries festooned with virgin's bower, 

the bright flowers, are all dead, dead. The once

blooming paradise is a desolate waste of alkali and

sage brush-a spot accursed-the haunt of the wolf

and coyote, whose howlings make terrible the night.

Weird stories are whispered of phantom caravans that

camp in the valley at moonless midnight, of restless

*  lirits demanding vengeance; and the bravest quake

when compelled to cross at night the field of blood.

kL Sliftly they rush through it, with bated breath and -

i'~L  olosed eyes. On a hillock a pile of stones, heaped

,-' rMound a wooden cross, marked the graves of the mas-

sacred; but the stones have slipped away, the cross is

broken. Ruin and desolation everywhere.

Absorbed in angry thoughts, the traveler rides on,

heedless of surroundin:' IisB journey has been dis-

astrous. Failure has dogged his steps. Silvertung is

now hastening homewards to solace his chafed spirit

with domestic tyranny. How he will triumph over

the proud Elsie I how he will break that fiery spirit !

The anticipation is so delightful that he laughs aloud.

Echo caught the sound, and answered a wailing shriek

that roused him.. He stopped and looked around.

By the faint starlight he recognized the place; then

cold drops of agony oozed from every pore. Like all

tyrants, Silvertung was a moral coward; and now,. 

alone in the darkness, upon the crime-cursed field, his

heart grew chill. The horrors of that fearful night'

closed around him. Again he saw the ground strewn

with bleeding victims, again he heard the splash of

blood, its reeking odor filled his nostrils. He spurred

his horse; but the animal stumbled into one of the

many hollows and lamed himself. He must, perforce,

creep over the accursed valley, while ghastly specters

crowd around him, their blood-stained skeleton fingers

pointing at him, the unholy glare of their fiery eyes

burning into his brain. In vain he tries to escape.

To which ever side he turns the phantoms meet him,

pursue him-crying, Vengeance ! vengeance I

He reaches the grave mound. Guilty fear trans-

forms the scattered stones into gleaming skulls. But

ah  there is something yet more fearful-his hode 24

scents danger, it trembles and plunges; looming up om-

inously near the broken cross is a figure of a horseni. Ea

The figure approaches-the elder sees a dark, scarred ;

face and passion-lit eyes-eyes he thought were closed':

very spot where, years ago, a murdered victim pro-

nounced his doom. She rises up before him now, men-

acing, triumphant. By her side stands the avenger.

Silvertung felt his hair turn white. The awful moment

had come. The moment of doom.

The avenger spoke again: "I meet you at last, to

There was a flash, a detonation. The doom was

fulfilled. Edward Lascelle was avenged. Elsie was'-

free.

CHAPTER L

*· ~.~ ~        IT COMES.

LL the next day Mr. Silvertung lay in a

stupor. Once the children's noise roused

her; she cried out: "Elsfe'has it come?

has it come ?"

"What are you talking about, Mother?"

"I thought it had come, what I saw last night;

when it comes, I can go."

"Don't think about it now, Mother. Rest."

"Rest ! Ah, I shall soon rest now; you will take

care of the children, won't you, Elsie, when it comes ?"

" Yes, Mother, I will take care of them."

She sank again into stupor; but every time Elsie

entered the room, the sick .woman would start, and

repeat the same cry: " Has it come ?"

On the third morning ifter the dream, a delirious

excitement replaced the stupor. Elsie, alarmed, begah

to think of sending for a doctor, and some one to take

.care of her mother; but she hesitated. No one mus4

hear her mother's random words, lest they might lead

to discovery. Discovery-of what? Elsie dared not

put into words, those foreb4ing8 so horrible because

intangible. A formless terroris the worst of terrors








<pb n="367"/>
IT   COMES.                 867

Their nearest neighbor was a Danish woman, who

spoke very little English. She would send for this

women to take care of her mother; then she would go

to Brother Menly. Elsie thought first of Sister Dinly;

bat since that lady had changed her opinion in refer-

ence to Silvertung's marriage, Elsie felt rather suspic-

ious of her. But something must be done immediately;

for the sick woman's delirium increased. Elsie sent

one of the children to the neighbor. The child in pass-

ing out slammed the door. Mrs. Silvertung screamed

out:

" Ha I at last. It has come, it is at the gate."

"Mother, there is nothing here; it was the noise

of the door...'.t.:

But the Bick woman was right. Her bearing,

strained to the utmost tension, caught the sound of

the opening gate, of footsteps on the walk, while Elsie

heard nothing but the noise made by the shutting of

the door. Scarcely had the girl answered her mother,

when the door opened, and Sisters Dinly, Silea, and

Jones, stood before her.

The first glance at their faces told Elsie that It had

come, whatsoever that "It" might be. Sister Dimly

was the first to speak. "I had to come, dear, although

I left my Lucy almost'crazy; but I couldn't let you

bear it all alone."

" Where's Sister Mary'; we must comfort her; but

it is a terrible cros. The elder was such a good saint,

such a darling man." Here they all began to weep, or

at least to put their pocket-handkerchiefs to their eyea

"To be shot down," screamed Sister Silea, who

had her own ideas about the affair, and wished to see

the effect of a tragic announcement. "To be shot

down during the darkness of the night, as if he were

a malefactor."

"But he is a martyr, a blessed martyr," cried all.

"Who shot him," asked Elsie, whose heart grew

cold with fear. 

It was not known when the news came; but he

will be found. The vile wretch must be found. " He

shall be hung as high as Haman," shrieked Sister

Silea. "He shall." She was interrupted by a cry.

They looked towards the door. There stood Mrs.

Silvertung, her face as white as her garments, her

eyes staring wildly, her arms outstretched and hands

uplifted as if to ward off a cruel thrust. She wavered

a moment, and then fell. Sister Dinly caught the

frail form and laid her on the bed. A spasm passed

over the features, her eyes glanced wildly round the

room as if seeking for some one-her lips moved, but

no sound came.

"She wants Elsie," said one of the sisters. The

girl felt stunned, she had not noticed her mother fall.

"Come, Elsie, come, your mother is dying." Elsie

hastened to the bed-side. She kissed the cold lips.

The dying woman opened her eyes. One look of in-

tense desire and supplication silent, a motion of the

lips, and it was all over. The wrong-doing and the

misery were all effaced by death.

The confusion was over. People spoke in whisper-

tones, and stepped with muffled feet. Even these

sounds grew hushed, and the silence of the grave de-

scended over the house. Elsie knelt alone by the side

of the dead. She wept not in useless grief, for she

would not, could not wish that mother back. The








<pb n="369"/>

Saints have some fine ideas of Death; and Elsie had

been taught to think of this visitant, not as the king

of terrors, but as a pitying angel hushing to sleep the

weary; therefore, mournful despair found no place in 

her heart; nay, she rather ejoiced that the troubled

soul was free. The room where lay that silent form

was a sanctuary, where she communed with herself,

her fate, and her God. It had come at last-the fore-

shadowed dread.

It had come at last-her long-desired freedom.

Alas I blood-stained was the hand that oped for her

the gates of Liberty. Murder stood at the entrance

of her new life, invoking vengeance upon her, upon

her father.

But was it murder ? the killing of the ravager of

homes-of the tyrant Danite? Was not her father

justified in killing one who had degraded the wife he

so much loved,-who menaced with infamy his only

child? The world answers, yes. But Elsie's higher

nature whispered to her that crimq cannot efface crime,

blood cannot wipe out blood. The sanguinary creed

taught to her from childhood had failed to familiarize

her soul with eviL Blood affrighted her; yet for her

it had been shed. Upon her and hers it cried out for

justice. She sank beneath this load of sin; it was too

heavy to bear alone. Her soul sought consolation in

prayer. Borne on the pinions of sorrow and desire,  S.

she soared far above human misery, above finite woe, *

and in the presence of the Universal Father,'the God

of love and mercy, she gathered strength-despair, re-

proach and gloom vanished, and peace, sanctified by

love, strengthened by sorrow, took possession of her

being. In her invigorated heart a glorious purpose

CHAPTER LL

ELSIE'S GOOD FORTUNE.

HE death of Silvertung caused a great deal of 

excitement among the leaders. The Lion

of the Latter Days felt shocked and really

grieved at the sudden cutting off of his

zealous apostle. It augured ill for the future. There

came to him echoes of whispers uttered by some of

his people to the effect that Silvertung had reaped his

just reward. Ah ! the slaves were becoming bravo;

the schism was doing its work; it was undermining

the despot's power. The scepter he longed to wield

seemed to be vanishing phantom-like from his grasp.

He ordered his apostles to preach revenge. The Tab-

ernacle and the meeting-houses rang with denunciations

upon the iniquitous Gentiles who shed the blood of the

- aints  Hymns breathing vengeace were sling, but

the people listened apathetically. Perhaps the con-

tinued postponement of the day when the Saints should

rule over the world had dampened their ardor. They

thought it had come when the great Prophet proposfa.&

himself as candidate for the presidency. They were 

sure it had come when civil war desolated the land.

But peace came, and the day of triumph seemed as far

off as ever. At every rumor of trouble or of war

hope revived, only to be disappointed. Therefore it

was not surprising that many had given it up, and that

incendiary speeches failed to make a blaze. Othe~

interests occupied them. Mines fascinated the mefT

the hope of the ballot absorbed the women, and tU:

railroad had exciting interest for all. So Silvertudg

and vengeance were forgotten.

When the Silvertung estate was settled, the wives

found themselves a little better off than they had ever

been. Number three took possession of the house in-

tended for Mary Laseelle, and, not having any living

children, asked to take care of the three left by her,

sister wife. Elsie gladly consented, for a time only;

for the girl was determined to earn an independence.

Mrs. Lucy wished to have her, but Elsie refused

with thanks. Through Brother Menly's instrumental-

ity she obtained a position as governess in the family

of one of the apostates. This step drew upon her the

hatred of her old acquaintances. In fact, the Saints

had looked askant at Elsie ever since the elder's death;

for it was rumored that it was Elsie's father who fired

'the fatal shot.  But Elsie was indifferent to their

praise or condemnation. Her heart throbbed with the

purpose born in the inspiration of death. "To shed

light wheresoe'er she trod," was her motto.

For the first time she felt the holy influences of ,

refined home, where father and mother are one in

heart and purpose ;-a home where education was

* prized, and progress cherished.  Every day Elsie's

mind welcomed some glorious truth. Every day she

ascended a step of the ladder that leads to the moun-

tain-top from which the universe may be seen. Her

spare moments were devoted to her mother's young

family. Mrs. Silvertung No. 3 was a superior woman,

who gladly opened her eyes to the light that Elsie

brought; and soon the young reformer reveled in the 

satisfaction of bringing one deluded soul out of the 

darkness. This conversion, or rather spiritual evolu- 

tion to a higher life, gave Elsie quadruple delight, for . 

it assured to the three children left to her care an 

emancipation from the slavery of Mormonism.

One morning Elsie was summoned from her school-

room, to hear that she was the sole possessor of

$20,000, under the guardianship of two prominent

Gentiles, whose position would assure her protection,

in case any zealous Saint should try to get her money.

When her astonishment was somewhat abated, one of

her guardians placed in her hands two letters; one

was from Stanly, relating his marvelous escape, which

he shall tell in the next chapter, the other was ad-

dressed to Miss Elsie Lascelle, from her father,

Edward Lascelle, alias Jim Tracy. Elsie retired to

her room, and in fear and trembling broke the seal.

It was a long epistle, and Elsie wept much while read-

ing it; but the confidences of father and daughter

are sacred.  We must content ourselves that the

letter informed Elsie that the $20,000 were lawfully

obtained, therefore she could accept the money with-

out scruple. It forgave her mother, and ended with a

'HOW IT WAS THE HERO DID NOT DIE.

From Stanly' Letter.

*      *      *     *      *      *

" ~eIi HEN I think of my escape, it seems in-

credible, and my former assertion is

proved; namely, that it is more difficult

to sink than to swim in Salt Lake. You

remember the fearful storm that raged on the night of

my departure? The waters of the lake were very

rough. Prince became frightened and restive; he

would not move. I looked round to see if my pur-

suers had disappeared. What a sight I The cold chills

run over me when I think of it, There were the two

murderers aiming directly at me. I dodged suddenly

to escape the fire, and whether the horse plunged, or

the waves swept me out of the saddle, I cannot say;

but I found myself floating on the water. I could

hear the horse neigh and plunge, and as well as Icould

tell he gained the shore.

"This was a great misfortune. Still, I did not give

up. I am a pretty good swimmer, and understood the

lake; so I thought I would swim on a mile or two,

then strike out for land and Ogden. The feat, an easy

one at most times, was more difficult than I had im-

agined, on account of thed storm. Still, I hoped to

manage better when the elements calmed down. Every

now and then a flash showed me the men eagerly

watching for me. A lull in the storm allowed me to

hear them talk: 'Well, I guess they are both done

for, the old one and the young one; jolly fun for one

night ' 'I ain't so sure this one is done for. He is

mighty tough. I'll go on to Ogden and you watch

around here. If he goes back to Salt Lake he will

walk right into the lion's jaws.' 'Yes, we needn't

trouble about him, then. But anyhow, I guess he's in

no condition to elope.'

"These words filled me with alarm. Our plans had

been discovered, therefore frustrated. Death stared

at me from every place; and the ' old-ne,' that must

be my father. What fearful thoughts rushed to my

mind. My presentiments, then, were realized. The 

news overpowered me. For a time, it seemed as if

death were as welcome as life. But a man should

never despair; and I soon struck out with all my

might, determined to live. I had drifted away dur-

ing these moments of horror; and I could not tell

which way I was going. My clothes ham   sred my

movements; but I managed to get off my coat: my

arms free, I made more headway. The storm sub-

sided, the clouds rolled away, and with them the in-

- ta·pe darkness. What a comfort it was to see the

stars twinkling to cheer me on I I saw land. That

gave me fresh courage. Without a thought as to what

it was, I struggled on. At last I clambered on shore.

Its rockiness surprised me. I looked around. It was

one dptbe islands. Tired and disappointed, I tried to 

makb- a fire to dry my clothes; but every leaf and

stick"were wet. ''

"It was verj chilly. However, I comforted myself 

with the thought that salt water. never gives cold. I'

walked about to keep myself warm; and thankful

enough I was to see the sun. I dried my clothes apd 

roamed around in search of food; for I was beginning' 

to feel as if a morsel to esa was the one only thing in life. 

* .  .

But, search as I would, I could find nothing fit to eat.

Fortunately, the storm had left fresh water in the

clefts of the rock, else I should have gone crazy with

thirst. And now, what to do. It was useless to

think of going to Ogden. Danger threatened at Salt

Lake City; but the thought of your position nerved

me to return there if possible. At last, it struck me

as a good idefto make for the south-western shore.

Old Jake lived near there; he would give me dry

clothes, and enable me to get back to the city un-

-noticed. Prudence suggested nightfall as the best

time to reach shore, or my condition would awaken

suspicion. So I concluded to wai. What a day it was I

I never wish to see such another. About an hour be-

fore sunset, I jumped into the water. The touch of the

wavesffvived me.. When weary, I rested by floating.

At length, after a time that seemed endless, I reached

the shore, so exhausted that I could scarcely move. It

was with difficulty that I recalled the'direction of

Jake's house. It was still more difficult to get tthre,

so faint was I with fatigue and hunger, my feet bare,>

my clothes dripping wet. The moon was fast dt4sa .

ing when I reached the house and found it demeted.

I don't know any more of what happened that night.

"When I came to myself, I was in a good -overed

wagon, with two men and a woman. .They weftlind

people, and after a good meal I felt'all right  Oae of

the men said that he saw me lying in the road, and

judged, from my condition, that I came out of the

water. 'I thought something was wrong,' he added,

'and that the best thing to do, was to take ye away

from that blessed Zion,-that we are only too thankful

to leave.' Just then -we heard the approach of a

horseman. Not wishing to be seen, I covered myself

with the straw in the bottom of the wagon. The

horseman stopped, and inquired whether they had seen

any one of my description. 'Don't think so, friend,'

said my savior; 'but supposing I had, what of it ?'

The cautiousness of the answer seemed to please the

horseman, whom I recognized as a Zion acquaintance. 

'Well, you seem to be of the right kind; so you may  m

tell him to keep dark for a while. They want him up

at Zion; they are sending all over for him; but a :

friend says, keep dark.' With that he rode away.

The driver looked into the wagon and said: 'You

had better come withbus.'

"I took their advice. Now comes the queer part

of my story. I found some work at a station on the

line; and about a week after my escape I fell in with

a man who called himself Jim Tracy; it certainly was

not his name. Something about him attracted me,

and I told him all my story. It interested him very

much. He said he knew your father, and he asked

many questions about you. He also told me of my

father's cruel death. He seemed to know a great deal;

however, he was very cautious. When he wished me

good bye, he told me not to fear, that everything

would be right. Well, about three weeks after, I re-

ceived a letter from Mr. Quicksell, offering me a good

position in Nevada; but I was not to communicate to

any one in Zion until further notice. He said a great

deal depended upon my silence. Of course, I accepted.

Next I received news of the elder's justly merited

taking off. I am doing well, and shall soon have a

home ready for you. Our union need not be deferred

much longer."

A   CHAPTER    OF OPllIOBL          877

Elsie read over the two letters many times. Should

she leave the city where she had suffered so much, and

be happy with Stanly in a new home, and new sur-

roundings, without a thought of the awful past ? of  4

the resolve that she felt it was her duty, her mission

to fulfill ? No ! selfish happiness is not true happiness.

Elsie determined to act according to her new light.

So she wrote to Stanly, telling him of her $20,000; of

the shadow that darkened her life; of the purpose

that filled her soul. She asked him if he would help

her; for marriage ought not to be an absorption of

one individual by another, but a joint partnership.

Elsie suggested this idea in winning words. She also

enclosed her father's letter.

Her heart throbbed as she mailed the letter. It

throbbed faster yet when she opened the response.

CHAPTER LII.

A OHAPTER OF OPINIONS.

NE evening soon after Elsie found herself

an heiress, a few friends (apostates) as-

sembled to congratulate the young lady

upon her good fortune.    Naturally the

conversation turned upon Mormonism and its prob-

lems; and as the conversers were those who understood

the question practically, their opinions are worth noting.

" So, Miss Elsie, behold ! you are a lady of fortune.

I suppose you contemplate an immediate departure

from Zion ?"

".No, Mr. C-   , I intend to remain. My lot has

been cast among these people, and I consider it my

do some good. Would that I had the power to blot

i- * '  " Yes, it is cosmopolitan, like its mother country.

A distinguished writer asserts that sects are the pro-

ducts of climatic influences. They can be geograph-

ically.classed as the flora and fauna. As a demonstra-

tion o?:this, take this creed. We find that America,

the land of the pine and the palm,-the land of path-

less forests, whose giant 'ties embrace the stars, and

*  of arid deserts where blade of grass never grew,-land

of boundless prairie and cloud-wreathed mountain-

land of hyperbole and utilitarianism-produces an an-

omalous sect, now borne on ideal wings over heavenly

heights, now groveling in the lowest depths-reverenc-

ing truth and worshiping lies-chanting hymns to

-liberty whilst it throws itself under the wheels of t!}

Juggernaut of despotism. A creed embodying t6ec-

c - centricity, the intensity, the vitality, the rapid growth,

the eye to the main chance that charactdrizes the

youngest, yet the most powerful of the nations of the

earth. As all races are represented in the great re-

public of the West, so are all sects in the creed born

of her soil. Our friend just now remarked that Mor-

monism is a jumble; and certainly a glance at its

various tenets gives the idea that its founders took

from each one of the many great religious systems

some salient feature, then, shaking them together,

turned out the heterogeneous mass as a wiMderful plan

"Indeed it is so. One could laugh at it, were it

not for polygamy. That is the foul blot."

"Polygamy is certaihly a foul blot; but it is' not

the worst."·                                  .

"Then what is?"                    .   '- .    '

"The slavery of the human mind by theinfallible :.

potentate who pretends to be specially directed by  -

God. Its blasphemy, forging God's name to its deeds

of blood."

" True! polygamy, unsustained by these lies, would-

soon fall to the ground. As it is, society is righting

itself."                                         '

"Yes; many former ertlhusiasts consider it now a t 

a social experiment, which has failed: Women are -'

recovering from the temporary aberration of mind,

the exaggerated self-sacrifice, which induced them to

uncrown themselves, and yield to man. the spiritual

prerogatives they won at Bethlehem and at Calvary.

And man begins to see that in thus depriving woman

of her influence he sacrifices his moral growth. It is

woman that elevates man. The pagans, the barbarians

of the Dark Ages felt this. They had their Isis, their 

Minerva, their Diana, the savages of the North their

Friga,-while brighter than all shines that most beauti-

ful Ideal, that sweet queen of civilization, the Virgin

Madonna, at whose shrine the mailed barbatian learned

the first lessons of love, purity, and meekness. Mother,

wife and home-devotion, love and peace. Polygamy

blights all this."

"Good ! But there is a reason deeper than these

.wby polygamy must die. Progress, whose course is

irresistible, must uproot it, because the system is,

directly antagonistic to the idea of the century, which

is the equality of the sexes." 

"True; and to illustrate how irresistible is pro- 4.

gress, how it is helped along, even by its greatest '

obstacles, I say that polygamy is doing a work towards 

the equalization of the sexes; because it destroys the

*   dependence of woman upon man. A plural wife has 

. reallyo protector; she is obliged to look out for her- 

self, sek her own amusements, fight her own battles,

ahd oftenr-oblige' to support herself and children.

Thds it makls 'roMan independent in spite of herself.

'It teaches tbeiit.heir own power, it kills their venera-

tion for mian. Again: the Church, for selfish motives, 

has given to women the ballot. For some years yet

rthis concession will make no difference save to increase  i

thi Church power; but slowly women will begin to 

think (as they now are forced to act) for themselves;  '

gradually they will throw off their yoke-the number 

of rebellious will increase. Mormonism will become a  if

sect differing but little from many others. Its horrible *,

features will die out, and, when Utah becomes a State,

society will gain a body of good, active, self-reliant

women, whose influence will be of immense value to 

reform,"                                          ".

"Yes, and polygamy has also prevented many from::

joining this ehqrch, which, under a lamb's fleece, hides a '

wolf's heart; Look at its record I It has scarcely exirted' j

fifty years, yet its victims number many hundred."  '

"Right, Sister; it is a barbarous organization.

How could we ever have joined it ?"

"We did not join this Church. The one we join?;-, 

preached only Reform, and the re-establishment of th *

Covenant. It wanted to renew the golden age of the''.

past. We were educated in adoration of the past.

The heroes we worshiped, the miracles we believed,

the teachings we revered, belonged to the far past.

Was it any wonder, then, that we were dazzled by the

picture of a New Jerusalem; that our ears listened 

enraptured to the charmed words.: Apostles, PropAets,

vective will do no good. Loud talking even, is hut-

ful. The way to combat this barbaric delusion, i's t6

moral tone, inspire them with a love for the beautiful.

Flowers, music, books, tasteful dress, these are the

weapons that will destroy the Mormonism taught in the

Tabernacle. The usurper has overreached himself for

once. In his desire for wealth, he has hastened on the

railroad. Every time I hear the shrill whistle of the

locomotive, I exclaim, 'Harken to the 'death-knell

little school, modestly doing a great work. It is the

herald of many others. And these teachers are the

veritable apostles of Utah."

" Then I will become one of those teachers," cried

Elsie. "To-morrow I will enter the school.    Once

before I thought of it, but now I am determined."

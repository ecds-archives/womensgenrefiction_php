What can compare with the bewitchment of arduous pursuit for uncertain privilege? There is an Orphean power well known to reside in testamentary documents, whereby the insignificant legacy will draw the most imposing fortune to dance attendance upon its possession. But it is doubtful if Waldo Yorke, of Beacon Street, Boston, Massachusetts, would have found himself inspired to a personal investigation of his departed relative's kind intentions concerning himself, but for a certain constitutional sensitiveness to this allurement attending the pursuit of unknown results.</p><pb n="6     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"Send a lawyer, Waldo." His mother had said this over the coffee for which she delicately prescribed the proper Yorke admixture from S&egrave;vres creamer. She spoke with the slightly peremptory accent which certain mothers retain, wither from force of habit or from intrinsic delight in the sound, long after the expectation of filial submission has become a myth of the Golden Age. Mrs. Yorke was a handsome woman, who wore <hi rend="italic">point applicqu&eacute;</hi>. She was lame.</p><p>Her son had reminded her that in sending Waldo Yorke he really was not far from doing the precise, if remarkable, thing of which she spoke.</p><p>"Quite true," said the lady. "I had forgotten. Your having a profession so seldom occurs to one, Waldo. And cousin Don would have been glad to go, now the season is over at the Club. He has nothing else to do."</p><p>"I am somewhat overborne with that calamity myself, mother," the young man had said, coloring slightly. "I don't think we will discuss the thing; I am going to hunt up Uncle Jed's legacy."</p><p>Mrs. Yorke had not discussed the thing. Although not even indulgently talked of as "rising" in his profession, this idle, strong-limbed, restless son of hers had incisive preferences, with which she was familiar, as well as with his somewhat<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     7"/>sturdy methods of executing them. And although they had only each other to be "beholden to" in all the world,--that is to say, in Beacon Street, -- they were accustomed to yield one another the large liberty of assured affection. A summer of separation was to be expected, when one was the lame old mother of a nervous young men Mrs. Yorke had kised her son good-by royally, and here he was.</p><p>Here he was, lazily riding at the laziest hour of the  sleepy noon, -- he and the sensitive hores he had been so fortunate as to find in Bangor for the trip. He had been alone with the pony and his own thoughts, through the magnificent Maine wilderness, for now two long, memorable days. An older traveler than young Yorke would have found them valuable days. He had    chosen the land route, seventy-two miles frem Bangor. He had a certain kind of thirst for solitude, which comes only to the city born and bred; most keenly to the young, and most pasionately to the over-tasked. Waldo Yorke had never be over-tasked in his life. He leaned to the splendor throughwhich he journeyed, enthusiastioally, but criticised Nature, like an amateur, while he drank.</p><p>He had chosen the land route partly, perhaps, in deference to faint associations with wild tales<pb n="8     DOCTOR ZAY."/>of it, told him years ago by that myth of a dead uncle, in course of the only appearance he ever made in Beacon Street,--Uncle Jed, whom his mother, somehow, never urged the child's going to visit, while never distinctly discountenancing it, either. Poor Uncle Jed was a good man, but had never had papa's advantages, my son. But my son had conceived a passing chivalrous fancy for an uncle at a disadvantage, and remembered sitting in his lap, and stroking his grizzled cheek with the soft pink palm of first one little hand, and then the other, and asking him why he hadn't any little boys, and if God left them in heaven, or forgot to send them down. Poor Uncle Jed was a bachelor, as well as a myth.</p><p>So this was the wilderness where the good old myth had lived, loved--did he ever love? His nephew wondered. Lived, loved, died. No: lived, loved, got rich, and died; or lived, got rich, and died, as you choose to put it. What a place to live and die in! Or to get rich in. Or to love in, either, for that matter.</p><p>The young man leaned against the cushions of the covered buggy, which, seemed to arouse as much bewildered effort of the perceptive faculties in the stray natives whom he met as if it had been a covered mill-pond, and indulged in that hazy<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     9"/>reverie which is possible only to ease and youth. What were his visions? What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the thoughts of a distinguished-looking young man, with one foot swinging for very luxury of idleness over thebuggy's edge against the step, the reins thrown across one muscular arm, and both gloved hands clasped behind a rather well-shaped head. Ayoung man with well-born eyes, and well-bred mouth; and he scorns to stoop to vices who carries just such a fashion of the nostril and the chin.</p><p>The route that young Yorke had chosen led him into the unparalleled deserts and glories of the wild Maine coast. Sudden reserves and allurements of horizon succeeded each other. They were finely-contrasted, like the moods of a woman as strong as she is sweet, and as sincere as she is either. Forest and sea vied to win his fancy. At the turning of a rein he plunged into an impenetratble green solitude. He became, perforce, a worshiper in Nature's cathedrals. Arch beyond arch, they lifted stately heads. Density within density, hung shadows in which it seemed no midday light could see to find a target.  Welcome chills came from these shadows and struck upon the feverish cheek. Across them fled dry, unrecognized perfume, clean and fine. Above, the dome of ether quivered with the faint, uncertain motion of hot<pb n="10     DOCTOR ZAY."/>air upon a summer noon. Drops of light fell through, upon the neutral-tinted shade that broke the sienna color of the winding road. As far as eye could see, the forest locked mighty arms before the traveler, as if to hold him to its heart forever.</p><p>Then swiftly at the tripping of a cypress, at the surrender of an oak at the fleeing of a rank of pines, at the shaking of a ghostly beard of moss, behold! The solemn barricade has given way. You have but turned a corner, yet the forest lets you go angrily, desperately, and yields you to sea.</p><p>Now the straight noon sunshine palpitates before, behind, about you. The road weeps, yellow and lonely, past a dreary little hut, a solitary farm. The ruts worn by the daily stage, passed a hour before you, begin to grow distinct in the white heat. Rocks loom, a mass of wealthy outline against unbroken sky, and curved and curious beaches kneel to wet their lonely foreheads in the sea.</p><p>Your cathedral has turned you out-of-doors utterly. Galleries of wonder beckon you on. In regular sculpture starts, half-moulded, from the wild, gray cliffs. Sketches which Nature seems to have begun, but never cared to finish, unfold<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     11"/>before you, vast, imperfectly interpreted, evanescent. Music, sweet from the now unseen birds in the deserted forest, sad from the waves upon the untrodden beaches, pulsates through the vivid air. It seems to the rider that the butterflies keep time to it; that the daisies in the gentlefields are nodding to it. Motionless cattle in the pastures, stray, solitary children on the fences, idle smoke from desolate chimneys, pass him by rhythmically. His thoughts, still busy with the forest, receive from all these things little else than a vague eonsciousness of the presence of life and light.</p><p>Life and light! The words have a familiar and a solemn sound.</p><p>Are they snatches from some forgotten sentiment of Holy Writ? John, perhaps? John, the golden-lipped, happy-hearted young enthusiast? What a poet that fisherman was! No wonder that modem dispute centres battling about the authenticity of the Fourth Gospel. <hi rend="italic">Life andlight!</hi> In all the universe, those only were the two words that could interpret the summer-noon meaning of this virgin State of Maine.</p><p>In all the universe--</p><p>Nonsense!</p><p>Yorke remembered that he was hungry, and<pb n="12     DOCTOR ZAY."/>would have his dinner. In all the universe,--what then? Heaven knows! It was some mad fancy about womanhood, or youth,--love, perhaps, if the truth must out; how a woman sometimes came to a man's life--he had heard of such woman--suddenly, thoroughly, as upon the reserve of the forest had flashed the glory of the sea. Meanwhile, a man must have his dinner; a mater not to be ignored in dealing with ideal wilderness or ideal woman. He pulled the rein smartly over the nervous pony, reflecting, with the hardened cynicism of a bachelor of twenty-eight, that he would like to see the woman who would be Life and Light to him! I think, though, if we stop to look at it, that the young fellow preserved, after all, for his sacred metaphor something of the reverence which is native to all delicate natures; and that in the innermost of all consciousness, which we hide even from ourselves, the words held under covert of a sneer the fugitive of a prayer.</p><p>With the fall from heaven to earth, discovering that he was hungry, the young man cherished a mild suspicion that he had strayed a little out of his way. Surely, the last reduced but hopeful sign-board had explicitly "arisen to explain" that it was six miles and a half to the town of Sherman. If he had traveled six miles and a half he<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     13"/>had traveled ten since then, and of other guide-board, those <hi rend="italic">ignes fatui</hi> in which he confided with the touching faith of youth and inexperience, there were none to be seen. Two, indeed, he hadpassed, valorously guarding a cart-path, but wind, weather, or fate had long since decapitated them. Over against their corpses one patient fellowstood on duty in a whortleberry thicket, for what concrete or abstract purpose no mortal could divine wiih his head, from which all recognizablefeatures were successfully washed away, held rakishly under his arm.  Another, apparently a drunken, disorderly officer, seemed to have goneupon a spree, and tumbled face-down into a brook. But neither of these sources of Maine enlightenment had directed the dense Massachusetts mindto the town of Sherman.</p> <p>Bringing the entire force of the Massachusetts mind now to bear upon the non-appearance of any visible means of dining, a process in which the Maine pony showed a sympathy above all provincialism, the traveler accosted the first native he happened to meet, and something like the following conversation took place:--</p><p><hi rend="italic">Yorke:</hi> "Can you tell me how far it is to Sherman, sir?"</p><p><hi rend="italic">Native:</hi> "Hey?"</p><pb n="14     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p><hi rend="italic">Yorke:</hi> "Would you oblige me by saying how near I am to the town of Sherman?</p><p><hi rend="italic"> Native,</hi> interrogatively: "Sherman?"</p><p><hi rend="italic">Yorke,</hi> decidedly: "Yes; Sherm-an."</p><p>A pause</p><p>"Travelin' fur?"</p><p>"From Bangor to Sherman."</p><p>"Oh!"</p><p>"I fear I have got out of my way.

But Bob,--he don't know a mile from a close-pin."</p><p>A prolonged pause.</p><p>"Is there a hotel in this--this metropolis?" asked Yorke, looking vaguely about the beautiful wilderness.</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>"Is there a tavern in this village?"</p><p>"No, sir."</p>               <p>"Do you ever accommodate hungry travelers with a dinner in your own family?"</p><p>"Wall, no; we never hev.

He reined up, and she called kindly, gesticulating with her lean arms, "If you some acrost a woman ridin' in a little frisky wagin with an amberel atop, just you ask her. <hi rend="italic">She</hi>'ll know!"</p><p>It was one of those coincidences which make, according to one's temperament, either thee poetry or the superstition of life, that young Yorke, in the course of twenty minutes' savage and unsuccessful pursuit of the gentleman that put up, coming sharply to the top of a glaring hill, saw at the foot of it, dimly through the dust, a sight as foreign to the Maine wilderness as a sleigh to Florida<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     17"/>or a barouche to Sahara. It was a pony phaeton. It stood before a gray old farm-house door, and the clean-cut, slender gray mare who drew it was tied to the crumbling fence. It was a basket phaeton, with a movable top of a buff color,--a lady's phaeton, evidently.</p><p>Yorke was as yet too inexperienced a traveler across country to know that in three cases out of five it is from a woman one will get most accurate geographical directions. He might have passed the pony phaeton with scarcely a serious remembrance of the advice be had received, but just before he eached the farm-house the owner of the carriage came suddenly out.</p><p>She came suddenly out and down the grass-grown walk, with the nervous step natural to a person in habitual haste; but a healthy step, even and springing. Yorke noticed as much as this in the instant that he balanced in his mind the advisability of addressing the lady.</p><p>For it was unmistakably, a lady.</p><p>The young man--being a young man--took in with subtle swiftness a sense of her youth, for she was young; of her motions, which were lithe. Of her face his impressions were hazy. It might have been fine, or not. He seldom suffered himself to acquire an opinion of a woman's face at                     <p>2</p><pb n="18     DOCTOR ZAY."/>first sight; he had so often learned to hold such impressions as frauds on his intelligence. Her dress, he thought, was blue, or black, or blue-black, or black-and-blue. What did it matter? She was already escaping him, and with her, apparently, his only mortal hope of dinner. What superhuman power could do for a man even in the Maine wilderness he would not dogmatically decide, but his confidenoe in human assistance was at that faint produced by prospective starvation; and Mr. Nahum Smith, or any other gentleman that put up, he had begun to locate with other interesting and amusing myths with which his education had made him familiar.</p><p>The young lady had untied her horse with the quickness of a practiced driver, had swept into the phaeton, had gathered the reins, and was off. If she had noticed him at all, it was in a busy fashion, with the single quick, abstracted glance usual to strangers in a crowd, In vivid contrast to the Down-East stare. Yorke felt that it was becoming a desperate case  He reined in the Bangor pony.</p><p>"I beg pardon, madam!"</p><p>The basket phaeton, just whirling away, came to a pause unconcernedly.</p> <p>"I beg pardon for the liberty, but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> you direct me to the town of Sherman?"</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     19"/><p>Something in Yorke's accent of desperation <hi rend="italic">was</hi>funny. The young lady's eyes twinkled for an instant. She looked as if she would have laughed if she had dared. But she answered him with grave politeness.</p><p>"It is four miles to Sherman."</p><p>"Thank you." The young man sat, with his hat raised, hesitating. I ought to apologize for troubling a lady. But I have met nothing but dislocated sign-posts and admiring natives for ten miles. One gave me as correct information as another. Is Sherman the nearest place where I can get a dinner?"</p><p>"I think it is," said the young lady. "Yes, I know it is. If you take your fist left below here, you will find it an easy four miles." She spokewith the unconscious ease with which, perhaps, only an American lady could have addressed a stranger met upon an unknown errand on a solitary road; but she gathered her rein as she spoke.</p><p>"I am extremely obliged to you," persisted Yorke. "You said the second left?"</p><p>"I said the first left. I am going to Sherman. If your horse is not too tired to keep distantly in sight, my phaeton will direct  you without further trouble."</p> <pb n="20    DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>She spoke as simply as one gentleman might have spoken to another. Yorke, too profoundly grateful to her to notice this at first, remembered it as the gray mare sped away through the hollow.</p><p>How exquisitely it was done! The Beacon Street gentlemen felt a glow of appreciation of the little scene, viewed purely as a specimen of the religion of good manners. He would have liked his mother to see it. It was the sort of thing she could estimate at its worth.</p><p>"Going to Sherman," what a divine Christian recognition of the fact that he was a stranger, and the Maine wilderness has taken him in! Even that though a man, he might yet be a gentleman, out of his way, misdirected, tired,"--hungry. "If his horse were not to tired,"--what a delicate fashion of comparing the exhausted and now abject-looking Bangor pony with her own sturdy little steed! "Distantly in sight,"--could language more? Faintly, swift, maidenly afterthought to the kindly impulse! Yorke had wrought himself into rather a glow, perhaps, by dint of present gratitude and promised dinner, but that simple little speech certainly seemed to him, as he thought of it, a classic in its way.</p><p>Meanwhile, the "frisky wagin" had tripped along over knoll and hollow, and the bright "am-<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     21"/>berel atop" had turned into the thickly-wooded road and disappeared from view. Waldo Yorke whipped up and hurried on.</p><p>Distantly in sight, indeed! Was there an innocent sarcasm in that womanly thrust? The gray mare could make her eleven miles an hour easily, if put to it. The Bangor pony begged piteously now at six. The basket phaeton flew to Sherman. The buggy struggled after. The mare put her head down, and trotted straight and stiff,--a steady roadster. The buggy followed by the fits and starts, the turns of elation and depression, the jerks of hope and lurches of despair, familiar to drivers of nervous ponies at the end of a steady pull. Distantly in sight! He should do well, indeed, if he kept a mirage of her in sight.</p><p>They had turned now quite away from the coast-line. The scattering farms, the tiny huts with enormous barns attached, the intelligent natives, the heavy stage-track, the dust, the glare, the cliffs, the sea, had vanished. The forest opened its arms again to the travelers, and the world grew green and cool.</p><p>Off the stage-road here, the density seemed deeper, the shadow more abandoned. Through the impressive solitude the gay little phaeton cover danced along; through it the solemn black<pb n="22     DOCTOR ZAY."/>buddy-top lumbered and climbed. The figure of the dainty driver in the phaeton, erect, slender, and blue, sat motionless as a caryatid out of employment. The eyes of the traveler in the buggy vigilantly pursued it; chiefly, it must be admitted, because he wanted his dinner; possibly, in part because he fancied the pose of the caryatid,--any man would.</p><p>The shadow deadened as they rode, but not from the darkening of the day. On either hand the solid serried oaks seemed to step out and press against the narrow drive-way; thickets, whose black hearts relieved the various outlines of wild blackberry,  sumach, elder, and grape, netted themselves more tightly, and grew stiff, looking like bronze; the aspens and pallid birches wooed one another across the narrowing road. Vistas of soft gloom  tretehed on. There was no light now, but flickering needles, fine as those of the pines, and drifting with them, that with difficulty pierced the opaque green heavens of the over-reaching trees. One looked twice in the low tone of the place even to see what the roadside flowers were. Yorke had almost passed unnoticed an apple-tree in full blossom, and it was past the first of June. Nothing could have so vividly presented to him a sense of the painful Maine spring, and <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     23"/>the frozen, laggard life that looked out from behind it upon a gentler world.</p><p>It occurred to him for the first time, as the depth and solitude of the road made themselves fully manifest, to wonder if the young lady felt no hesitation in trusting herself to drive over it alone. Apparently, he had here some society girl, whose whim it was to be unfashionable, and inMaine, at this unusual season. She was a little intoxicated with Nature's grand unconventionality; had no more fear, it seemed, than a butterfly released from a chrysalis.</p><p>He wondered if she did him the credit not to take him for a cut-throat. But a grim glance at the widening distance between the phaeton and the buggy strangled this bit of self-satisfaction at its first breath. Plainly, the case involved not so much a high opinion of the man as a low one of the horse.</p><p>Those delicate lovers, the birch and aspen, and the more ardent ones, the oak and hickory beyond them, were now making themselves obnoxious, aslovers always do to third parties, and swept a fragrant and defiant arch low across the way. Swift in the passing, the buff umbrella went deftlydown. Slow in the following, the buggy-top groaned back.</p><pb n="24     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>The blue caryatid was daintily cut now against the heavy shadow. Fine pencilings of light fell on her: she wore, it might be, a straw hat, whichcaught them; they struck her hair too, and her shoulder. She stirred but once. Then she turned to break some apple-blossoms. She picked the flowers at full speed and standing.</p><p>Yorke, as he watched her with the half-amused attention of a traveler who has nothing better to do than to "follow the duty nearest him," got the jingle of Lucy Gray into his head:--</p>                           <p>"O'er rough and smooth she trips along</p>                   <p>And neer looks behind."</p>And now Yorke put his ease to the Bangor pony, and despairingly relinquished it. The buggy lagged dead at the foot of the hill. The phaeton speeding across the hollow, reached the crossing of the ways, turned a sudden corner, and was gone.</p><p>"And never looked behind" sighed the young man, out of temper with the pony, or the jingle, or what not.</p>                  <p>"And sings a solitary song</p>                        <p>That whistles in the wind."</p><p>When the Bangor pony panted up to the cross-roads, the phaeton had vanished utterly. The caryatid had become a dream, a delusion, a slen-<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     25"/>der and obliging deceiver.  Four solitary roads pierced the forest at four separate green angles. A dull sign-board stood in the square, and the traveler hastened gratefully to it. It bore in faded tints, once red and yellow and inspiring, an advertisement of Hooflands' German Bitters.</p><p>Blue caryatides indeed! In what hues less intellectually respectable was the young woman perhaps portraying him by this time to the summer people at Sherman, a party of gay girls like herself?</p><p>The young man bit his lip somewhat distinctly, for a Bostonian, and stood for a moment irresolute in the heart of the cross-roads, uncertain which of the four narrow wooded ways looked least as if it ended in a cranberry swamp, or a clearing, or other abstractly useful but concretely dinnerless locality.</p><p>Suddenly, his eye caught the soft, irregular outline of some small object lying in the dust, a rod or so down the direct road. He drove up to it. As he approached it grew pink, as if it blushed. It was an apple-blossom.</p><pb n="26"/>II.<p>YORKE'S faith in woman rallied. If the caryatid meant it,--and a caryatid might be capable of just such a picturesque procedure,--it wasvery delicately done. If she did not mean it, at all events he had got scientifically past the cross-roads on his way, and she had got successfully out of it. He picked up the apple-blossom, and droveon. It could not have been ten minutes before his dumb guide brought him abruptly from the forest  almost into the heart of the village.</p><p>The little town of Sherman slept peacefully in the afternoon sun. No one seemed to be astir. No glimmer of a phaeton cover shone across the hot, still street  The caryatid was gone,--where, it really did not occur to the young man to wonder. He and the Bangor pony forgot her with equal rapidity and success, in the leisurely hospitality of the Sherman Hotel.</p>                                     <p>SHERMAN, MAINE, June 5th.</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER,--I hope you promptly received the letter I mailed from Bangor.

Direct your letters, if you please, care Isaiah Butterwell, Esq.</p><p>In Isaiah Butterwell I find a genuine "fine old country gentleman," and Uncle Jed's confidential and devoted friend. He is a man of property, influence, and honor in this place. It is kind in them to take me in. Mrs. Isaiah says she is good of my society. She, by the way, has an eye like a linnet and a tongue like a Jonathan Crook pocket-knife, and a receipt for waffles which in itself has reconciled me to Sherman society for indefinite lengths.</p><p>I seem to be the only member of the family<pb n="28     DOCTOR ZAY."/>besides the united head, It is a huge house, with wings, dead white, and reminds me of a Millerite robed and wondering why he can't fly.

Strain the Beacon Street imagination, if you can, up to the level of waffles for tea! She asked me, too, if I would have feathers or hair, and did I prefer <hi rend="italic">woolen</hi> sheets? The house is perfectly still, and altogether delightful. As I write, a single sound of wheels breaks the deep, sweet country silence. They roll softly up and past my window to the barn; probably Mr. Butterwell has been to the prayer-meeting, a dissipation to which his good wife endeavored to decoy me. Rather if for a prayer-meeting, too. Mr. Isaiah drives a good horse, I perceive.</p><p>Speaking of good horses, I lost my way, coming on, and was piloted through the forest by a caryatid in a basket phaeton. Remind me to tell you about her when I get home.</p><p>To-morrow I drive out about twelve miles along the coast, to see a man who knows another man who has heard of a "widder lady" who stands ready to purchase certain shares of a certain ship which come into poor Uncle Jed's legacy.

Your affectionate son,</p>                                             <p>WALDO YORKE</p><p>Waldo Yorke had started in search of the post-office to mail this letter, when Mrs. Isaiah Butterwell followed her guest to the door, and stood, while he was gathering the reins over the now gayly-recuperated Bangor pony. Mrs. Butterwell was a well-dressed woman, in the Maine sense of the term. She had a homely, independent face, with soft eyes,--not unlike a linnet's, as Yorke had said. She regarded him closely for a moment, and without speaking.</p><p>"What a charming day!" said Yorke, feeling it necesary to be polite even at the expense of originality.</p><p>"I'm too busy to bother with the weather," re-<pb n="30     DOCTOR ZAY."/>pied Mrs. Isaiah, briskly. "Can't spare the time for that Down East."</p>                   <p>"Indeed! That is a frugal sentiment, at all events," Yorke ventured.</p> <p>"There's no sentiment about it," retorted Mrs. Butterwell. "It's sense; as you'd find out if you lived here. If I'd spent myself noticing         weather, I should have been in my grave ten winters ago. Are you fond of young women?"</p><p>The linnet put this startling question with gentle eyes, in which it was impossible to capture a ray of satire or of fun.</p><p>"As I am of the State of Maine,--with reservations," said Yorke guardedly, visions of Sherman "society" presenting themselves at once.</p><p>"Are you fond of an early dinner, then?" pursued Mrs. Butterwell, with the serene air of one who clearly sees the links of her own syllogism.</p> <p>"Passionately, madam."</p><p>"We dine," said the hostess, bowing herself away with a certain dignity, "at half past twelve."</p><p>"I will be at my post," said the guest, smiling, "dead or alive!"</p><p>"I wouldn't say that if I was you," urged Mrs. Isaiah Butterwell, returning to the doorstep, and looking gravely at the young man. "I've always<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     31"/>thought, if I'd been God, I'd have been tempted to take people up that way, just for the sake of it. Talk about his tempting folks! Folks throw a terrible lot of temptation in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way. But there it is. It just shows he isn't made up like other people, after all. How that horse of yours does fuss!"</p><p>The Bangor pony was nervous indeed that morning; highly grained, after the journey, in Mr. Isaiah's generous stable. The buggy sped along the village street with emphasis.</p><p>It is doubtful if the caryatid would have offered her services as guide to its occupant that day, through the beautiful heart of the forest, fourmiles deep.</p><p>Waldo Yorke, as he clattered through that pleasant representative Maine town, where the meeting-house, post-office, and "store" were the important features, and impressed him chiefly as reminiscences of American novels which he had tried to read and failed at the third chapter, amused himself by a rapid acquaintance with the business signs.</p><p>"Good sell, Merchant. "Cole and Wood: Lumber Dealers"  "Dr. A. Lloyd."  "Coffins, cheap for Cash." "Smith and Jones, formerly Jedediah Yorke,"--and so on. He got these<pb n="32     DOCTOR ZAY."/>things into his head as he had the rhyme of Lucy Gray, the day before, with  that idiocy which asserts itself in this exasperating form, and which threatens to prove the human intellect more lawless than the passions or the will. He found himself particularly a victim to the cheerful refrain of "Coffins, cheap for Cash."</p><p>His host overtook him before he had driven far. Mr. Isaiah Butterwell, as Yorke had observed, shared the apparently well-spread Maine appreciation of a good horse. He reined up his heavy, handsome sorrel, and the two men rode abreast for a mil; they chatted, across wheels, of horses, the estate and Uncle Jed, and Maine politics, and the price of lumber, and horses again. The Boston boy listened deferentially to the gray Maine merchant; perceiving in him something of the same rugged dignity that Uncle Jed had borne in Beacon Street. Yorke felt that here was a king in his own country; he regarded the hard-worked man with respect, and pleased himself with drawing his points out, and storing them up, so to speak, with a sense of increasing one's knowledge of "types."</p><p>"I've got to leave you, to collect some interest," said Mr. Butterwell presently. "That' my turn,--the first right. You keep straight on<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     33"/>till you find your man. Drive easy over the bridges  They're plaguey rickety, some of 'em. That pony of yours ain't used to 'em in Bangor. Back to dinner? Hope so. There, now, I wonder if my wife has told you--whoa--told you about--whoa, Zach Chandler!--about--<hi rend="italic">Whoa!</p>"</p><p>"Oh, yes, she told me!" called Yorke politely, as the two horses nervously parted company. He looked, laughing, back to watch the old man,thinking how sacred their dinner hour was to these two lonely people; how large all little events must be in lives like theirs. His heart was full of a gentle feeling, half deference, half compassion Mr. Butterwell's gray hair blew in the wind; he held the reins wound double over his knottedwrist; he sat with left foot forward. Zach Candler was a long-stepping horse. Waldo Yorke, looking over his shoulder, saw and long remembered that he saw these trifling things. Suddenly he felt a thrill in the reins at which his own horse was tugging steadily and sensibly. He turned his head, to see the Bangor pony tremble, tear, and leap; to see the loose yellow boards of a murderously-lid bridge bound up; to see that there was no railing; to perceive a narrow streak of black--water, presumably; and to know that                   <p>3</p><pb n="34     DOCTOR ZAY."/>he was scooped into the overturned buggy-top, and dragged, and torn, and swept away.</p>   <p>The whole thing may have taken three minutes. All that occurred to the young man quite clearly, as he went down, was, "<hi rend="italic">Coffins, cheap for Cash.</hi>"</p><p>Against the blackness of darkness a blur appears; it stirs; it has extension and intension; it throbs and thrills, and with the eternal wonder of creation moving upon chaos, there is light. After all, how easy a matter it was to die! And coffins in Maine are cheap for cash. How could a manhave believed that a process so abnormally dreaded for nearly thirty years could be, in truth, so normal and so deficient in the extreme elements of agony? To be sure, there was one crashing blow; a compression of some endurance within narrow limits; but he had suffered as much from neuralgia, far more from the prospect of death.</p><p>How clearly and distinctly, though slowly, vision returns, in this new condition! There is a handsome old lady in a <hi rend="italic">point appliqu&eacute;</hi> cap. Like the child of Adah, she "goeth lame and lovely." By the way, will one make the acquaintance of a man like Lamb, in the society to which one is now to be introduced? Yes; still the old lady in the lace cap. She is sitting by the library grate, <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     35"/>alone; her crutch has fallen to the floor, a yellow telegraph envelope is on the hearth; she is not weeping, but her face is bowed; she looks veryold; the lines about her mouth are pinched; she has a haggard color. It seems easy to speak to her. How easy! Mother? <hi rend="italic">Mother!</hi> She does not lift her head. <hi rend="italic">Mother!</hi> It is true what we were told, then. The living do not hear. The dead may cry forever. A horrible deafness has fallen upon her. A man would have liked to see her once,--to say good-by, or to have her sit by him a few minutes. Yet it seems there is a woman here. That is a woman's hand which rather hovers over than holds me. How cool it is! How delicate!. . . <hi rend="italic">Ah, no!</hi> Remove your hand! It does not caress; it tears me. <hi rend="italic">Remove your hand!</hi> I am in agony. What in the name of life and death has happened to me in this accursed wilderness? Was there anything in those old-fashioned dogmas after all? Take off your hand, I say! I know I might have been a better man, but I've tried to be clean and honest. I don't say I'm fit for heaven, but I don't deserve <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. You torture me. <hi rend="italic">Remove your hand!</hi> Am I in--</p><p>You are in your own room, sir," said Mrs. Isaiah Butterwell, distinctly.</p><pb n="36     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"Ah!--so I see."</p><p>Yorke tried to lift his head; it fell back heavily and he felt blood start.</p>"Madam, you are very good. I must have been troublesome. I thought I was--dead."</p><p>"I'm sorry for you, Mr. Yorke, but I <hi rend="italic">must say</hi> that I don't approve of your theology," said his hostess, grimly.</p><p>"I dare say. I would not have offended you if-- Ah, how weak I am!"</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"Am I much hurt?"</p><p>"Some, Mr. Yorke."</p><p>"How much? Answer me. I will have the truth. The blood flows--see! When I even think that you may be deceiving me. Am I terribly hurt?"</p><p>"I am afraid so, sir."</p><p>A heavy silence falls.</p><p>"Shall we telegraph for your mother, sir?"</p><p>"My mother is crippled. No."</p><p>"For any sister, or anybody?"</p><p>"I have no sister."</p><p>"Mr. Butterwell will write."</p><p>"Where is the doctor? I should like to see him first. You have called a doctor?"</p><p>"Oh yes, sir."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     37"/> <p>"Where is he?"</p>                  <p>"The doctor left about five minutes ago."</p>  <p>"What does he say?"</p> <p>"Very little."</p><p>"I wish to see the doctor before my mother is written to. Call him back!--if you please . . . Call him back, I say! Why do you hesitate? I may be a dead man in a few haurs. Do as I bid you!"</p><p>The doctor said, Mr. Yorke"--</p><p>"Said what?"</p><p>"Said that--sh, Isaiah!--he was to be the judge when it was best for you to see your physician. If you asked, I was to say that you will have every possible attention, and I was to say that all depends on your obedience."</p><p>"That sounds like a man who understands his business."</p><p>"Oh, indeed, sir, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is true! Our doctor"--</p><p>"Oh, well; very well. Let it go. I must obey, I suppose.  Never mind. Thank you. Move me a little to the left. I cannot stir. I am unaccountably sleepy. Has the fellow drugged me? I think perhaps I may--rest"--</p><p>He did, indeed, fall into sleep, or a stupor that simulated sleep; he woke from it at intervals, thinking confusedly, but without keen alarm, of<pb n="38     DOCTOR ZAY."/>his condition.  The thing which worried him most was the probable character of this Down-East doctor upon whose intelligence he had fallen. "The fellow absolutely holds my life in his hands," he said aloud. It was hard to think what advance of science the practitioner undoubtedly represented. Dreamily, between his lapses into unconsciousness, the injured man recalled a fossil, whom he had seen, on his journey from Bangor, lumbering about in a sulky at one of the minor stage stations; a boy, too, just graduated, practicing on the helpless citizens of Cherrytown,--was it? No, but some of those little places. Then he thought of some representatives of the profession whom he had met in the mountains, and at other removes from the centres of society. He understood perfectly that he was a subject for a surgeon. He understood that he was horribly hurt. He thought of his mother. He thought of his mother's  doctor, whom he had so often teased her about. In one of his wakeful intervals, another source of trouble occurred to him for the first time.  He called to his hostess, and restlessly asked,--</p><p>"I suppose there isn't a hom&oelig;opathist short of Bangor?"</p><p>"Our doctor is hom&oelig;opathy," said Mrs. But-<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     39"/>terwell, instantly on the defensive; "but you need not be uneasy, sir, for a better, kinder"--</p><p>"My mother will be so glad!" interrupted the young man, feebly. He gave a sigh of relief. "She would never have been able to bear it, if I had died under the other treatment. Women feel so strongly about these things. I am glad to know that--for her sake,--poor mother!" He turned again, and slept.</p><p>It was late evening when he roused and spoke again. He found himself in great suffering. He called petulantly, and demanded to be told where that doctor was. Some one answered that the doctor had been in while he slept. The room was darkened. He dimly perceived figures,--Mr. Butterwell in the doorway, and women; two of them. He beckoned to his hostess, and tried to;tell her that he was glad she had obtained assistance, and to beg her to hire all necessary nursing freely; but he was unable to express himself, and sank away again.</p><p>The next time he became conscious, a clock somewhere was striking midnight. He felt the night air, and gratefully turned his mutilated,feverish face over towards it. A sick-lamp was burning low, in the entry, casting a little circle of light upon the old-fashioned, large-patterned oil<pb n="40     DOCTOR ZAY."/>cloth. Only one person in the room, a woman. He asked her for water. She brought it. She had a soft step. Whe he had satisfied his thirst, which he was allowed to do without protest, the woman gave him medicine. He recognized the familiar tumbler and teaspoon of his hom&oelig;pathicallyeducated infancy. He obeyed passively. The woman fed him with the medicine; she did not spill it, nor choke him; when she returned: the teaspoon to the glass, he dimly saw the shape of her hand. He said,--</p> <p>"You are not Mrs. Butterwell."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"You are my nurse?"</p><p>"I take care of you to-night, sir."</p><p>"I--thank you," said Yorke, with a faint touch of his Beacon-Street courtliness; and so fell away again.</p><p>He moved once more at dawn. He was alarmingly feverish. He heard the birds singing, and saw gray light through the slats of the closedgreen blinds. His agony had increased. He still moaned for water, and his mind reverted obstinately to its chief anxiety. He said,--</p><p>"Where <hi rend="italic">is</p> that doctor? I am too sick a manto be neglected. I must see the doctor."</p><p>"The doctor has been here," said the waman who was serving as nurse, "nearly all night."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     41"/> <p>"Ah! I have been unconscious, I know."</p><p>"Yes. But you have been cared for. I hope that you will be able to compose yourself. I trust that you will feel no undue anxiety about yourmedical attendance. Everything shall be done, Mr. Yorke."</p>                            <p>"I like your voice," said the patient, with delirious frankness. "I haven't heard one like it since I left home. I wish I were at home! It isnatural that I should feel some anxiety about this country physician. I want to know the worst. I shall feel better after I have seen him."</p><p>"Perhaps you may," replied the nurse, after a slight hesitation. "I will go and see about it. Sleep if you can. I shall be back directly."</p><p>This quieted him, and he slept once more When he waked it was broadening, brightening, beautiful day. The nurse was standing behind him at the head of the bed, which was pushed out from the wall into the free air. She said:--</p><p>"The doctor is here, Mr. Yorke, and will speak with you in a moment. The bandage on your head is to be changed first."</p><p>"Oh, very well. That is right. I am glad you have come, sir." The patient sighed contentedly. He submitted to the painful operation without further comment or complaint. He felt<pb n="42     DOCTOR ZAY."/>how much he was hurt, and how utterly he was at the mercy of this unseen, unknown being, who stood in the mysterious dawn there, fighting for his fainting life.</p><p>. . . He handled one gently enough; firmly, too,--not a tremor; it did seem a practiced touch.</p><p>The color slowly struck and traversed the young man's ghastly face.</p><p>"Is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the doctor?"</p><p>"Be calm, sir,--yes."</p><p>"Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> the doctor's hand I feel upon my headat this moment?"</p><p>"Be quiet, Mr. Yorke,--it is."</p><p>"But this is a woman's hand!"</p><p>"I cannot help it, sir. I would if I could, just this minute, rather than to disappoint you so."</p><p>The startled color ebbed from the patient's face, dashing it white, leaving it gray. He looked very ill. He repeated faintly,--</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">A woman's hand!</hi>"</p><p>"It is a good-sized hand, sir."</p><p>"I-- Excuse me, madam."</p><p>"It is a strong hand, Mr. Yorke. It does not tremble. Do you see?"</p><p>"I see."</p><p>"It is not a rough hand, I hope. It will not inflict more pain than it must."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     43"/><p>"I know."</p><p>"It will inflict all that it ought. It is not afraid. It has handled serious injuries before. Yours is not the first."</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">What shall I do?</hi>" cried the sick man, with piteous bluntness.</p><p>"I wish we could have avoided this shock and worry," replied the physician.  She still stood, unseen and unsummoned, at the head of his bed. "I beg that you will not disturb yourself. There is another doctor in the village. I can put you in his hands at once, if you desire. Your uneasiness is very natural. I will fasten this bandage first, if you please."</p><p>She finished her work in silence, with deft and gentle fingers.</p><p>"Come round here," said the patient feebly. "I want to look at you."</p><pb n="44"/>III.<p>SHE came at once. She stepped before him at the bedside, and stood there without moving. She let him look at her as long as he would. It was not long. He felt very ill. He regarded her confusedly. He perceived a woman of medium height, with a well-shaped head. He felt the dress and carriage of a lady. His eye fell upon her hands, which were crossed lightly on the edge of the little table where his medicines stood. Sick as he was, he noticed unusual signs of strength in her fingers, which were yet not deficient in delicacy. Yorke had always judged people a good deal by their hands. He repeated his nervous pbrase:--</p><p>"I am in a woman's hands!"</p><p>She spread them out before him with a swift, fine gesture; then made as if she put something unseen at one side from them.</p><p>"Let me send for the man I spoke of. You are irresolute. You are losing strength and time. This is a mistake as well as a misfortune. I can't help being a woman, but I can help your suffering from the fact."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     45"/><p>"No,--not yet. No. Wait a moment. I wish to speak with you. Will you pardon me if I ask--a few questions?"</p><p>"I will pardon anything. But they must be very few. I shall not stand by and see you spend your breath unnecessarily."</p><p>"Are you an educated physician, madam?</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"A beginner?"</p><p>"I have practiced several years."</p><p>"Do you think you understand my case?"</p><p>"I think I do."</p><p>"This old man you speak of,--this other doctor,--what is he?"</p><p>"His patients trust him."</p><p>"Do you think I should trust him?"</p><p>"No, sir."</p><p>"Are you the only hom&oelig;opathist in this region?"</p><p>"There is one at Cherryfield; others at Bangor; none within thirty miles."</p><p>"Can you get consultation?"</p><p>"I have already telegraphed to Bangor for advice: there is an eminent surgeon there; he will come if needed. I know him well."</p><p>"How much am I hurt?"</p><p>"A good deal, sir."</p><pb n="46"/><p>"Where are the injuries?"</p><p>"In the head, the foot, and the right arm."</p><p>"What are they?"</p>   <p>"I do not wish you to talk of them. I do not wish you to talk any more of anything."</p> <p>"Just this,--am I in danger?"</p><p>"I hope not, Mr. Yorke."</p><p>"I see you can tell the truth."</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> telling the truth."</p><p>"I begin to trust you."</p><p>She put her finger on her lip. He stirred heavily, with an ineffectual attempt to writhe himself into another position.</p><p>"I cannot move. I did not know my arm was hurt before--Ah, there!"</p><p>As he spoke, blood sprang. The doctor made towards him a motion remarkable for its union of swiftness with great composure. Her face had astern but perfectly steady light. She aid calmly:</p><p>"Lie still, Mr. Yorke," and with one hand held him down upon the pillow. He perceived then that a bandage had slipped from a deep wound just below the shoulder, and that a severed artery was oozing red and hot. He grew giddy and faint, but managed to keep his wits together to watch and see what the young woman would do. She quickly bared his arm, from which the sleeve was already cut away.</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     47"/> <p>"Mrs. Butterwell," she called quietly, "will  you please bring me some hot water?" </p><p>During the little delay which ensued on this  order--a momentary one, for Mrs. Isaiah Butterwell was one of those housekeepers who would prefer a lukewarm conscience to a lukewarm boiler--the doctor gently unrolled the bandage from the wound, which she then thoroughly sponged and cleansed. The patient thought he heard her say something about "secondary h&aelig;morrhage;" but  the words, if indeed she used them at all, were not addressed to him. The hot water did not stop the blood, which seemed to him to be sucking his soul out.</p><p>"Hold this arm, Mrs. Butterwell," said the young lady--"just so. Keep it in this position till I tell you to let go. Do you understand? There. No, stay. Call Mr. Butterwell. I want two."</p><p>She drew her surgical case from her pocket, and selected an artery forceps. She opened the wound, and instructed Mr. Butterwell how to hold the forceps in position while she ligated the artery. She bandaged the arm, and adjusted it to suit her upon a pillow. She had a firm and fearless touch. Her face betrayed no uneasiness; only the contraction of the brows inseparable from studious attention.</p><pb n="48     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>The patient looked at the physician with glazing eyes.</p><p>"Write to my mother," he said weakly. "Don't say you are not a man. Only say you are not an allopath--and that I have given my case unreservedly to you. Tell her not to worry. Give her my love. Tell her"--</p><p>And with this he fainted quite away.</p><p>This faint was the prelude to a hard pull--Days of alternate syncope and delirium followed. Short intervals of consciousness found him quiet, but alarmingly weak. His early anxiety had ceased to manifest itself. He yielded to the treatment be received without criticism or demur. In fact, he was too ill to do anything else. This condition lasted for more than a week.</p><p>One day he awoke, conscious and calm. It was a sunny day. There seemed to be a faint woody perfume in the room, from some source unknown. A long, narrow block of light lay yellow on the stiff-patterned brown carpet; it was by no means, however, a cheap carpet. There was an expensive red and gold paper on the walls, and marble-topped furniture. There were two picture. One was a framed certificate setting forth the fact of Mr. Butterwell's honored and honorable career as <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     49"/>a Freemason. The other was an engraving of the Sistine Madonna. Yorke had hardly noticed the contents of his room before. He observed these details with the vivid interest of a newly-made invalid, wondering how long he was likely to lie and look at them. As his eye wandered weakly about the room it rested upon the bureau, which stood somewhat behind him. A vase of yellow Austrian glass was on the bureau; it held a spray of apple-blossom.<p><p>While he lay breathing in their delicate outlines like a perfume, and feeling their perfume like a color, the half-opened door pushed gently in, and a woman--a lady--entered with a quick step. She was a young lady; or at least she was under thirty. She stopped on seeing that he was awake, and the two regarded each other. She saw a very haggard-looking young fellow, with a sane eye and a wan smile. He saw a blooming creature. She had her hat on and driving-gloves in her hand. Her face was sensitive with pleasure at the change in the patient. She advanced towards him heartily, holding out her hand. He said,--</p><p>"Are you the doctor?"</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"What is-- excuse me-- but, madam, I don't know your name."                      <p>4</p><pb n="50     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"My name is Lloyd. You are better to-day!"</p><p>"Indefinitely! Wait, please . . . . I have seen you before. Where have I seen you?"</p><p>"Three times a day for a week, without counting the nights," said the young lady, with mischief in her voice. She had a pleasant voice. She spoke a little too quickly, perhaps. She stood beside his bed. She stood erect and strong. Her hair was dark, and she had rather large, dark blue eyes. He thought it was a fine, strong face; he did not know but it might be safe to call it beautiful. She wore a blue flannel dress.</p><p>"I know!" he said suddenly. "You are the caryatid."</p><p><hi rend="italic">What</hi>, sir?"</p><p>"You are the blue caryatid--Never mind. I am not deranged again. Have I been very crazy?"</p><p>"Sometimes," said the lady gravely. Her expression and manner had changed. She sat down beside him and opened her medicine-case, which she laid upon the table. He smiled when he saw the tiny vials. She either did not observe or did not return the smile. Her face had settled into an intent and studious form, like a hardening cast. He thought, She is not beautiful.</p><p>She took out her note-book, and began to ask  him a series of professional questions. She spoke <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     51"/>with the distinct but rapid enunciation which he had noticed before. She wrote down his answers carefully. Many of her questions were more personal than he had expected; he was not used to what Mrs. Butterwell called "doctoring." This young lady required his age, his habits, family history, and other items not immediately connected in the patient's mind with a dislocated ankle.</p><p>"Now your pulse, please," she said, when she had reached the end of her catechism. She took his wrist in a business-like way. The young man experienced a certain embarrassment. The physician gave evidence of none. She laid his hand down again, as if it had been a bottle or a bandage, told him that she was greatly gratified with his marked improvement, prepared his powders, and, drawing the little rubber clasp over her medicine-case, gave him to understand by her motion and manner that she considered the consultation at an end.</p><p>"One powder in six tablespoonfuls of water; one tablespoonful every four hours," she said, rising. "Are you quite able to remember? Or I will speak to Mrs. Butterwell myself as I go out. She will be with you soon, and I have directed that some one shall be within call whenever you<pb n="52     DOCTOR ZAY."/>are left alone. You do not object to being alone somewhat?"</p><p>"I like it."</p><p>"I was sure of it. I prefer you to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> alone as  much as you can bear now. But you will not be neglected. I will see you again at night."</p><p>"I should like to talk with you a little," stammered Yorke, hardly knowing what was the etiquette of this anomalous position. "Cannot you stay longer?"</p> <p>She looked at her watch, hesitated, and sat down again.</p><p>"I can give you a few minutes. I have a busy day before me."</p><p>"Did you write to my mother," began the patient, "and what has she answered?"</p><p>"If you go on improving at this rate, you may read your letters to-morrow, Mr. Yorke."</p><p>"Not to-day?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"You are arbitrary, Miss--Dr. Lloyd."</p><p>She gave him a oool, keen look.</p><p>"That is my business," she said.</p><p>"What has been the matter with me?" persisted the young man. "What are my injuries? I wish to know."</p><p>"A dislocation of the ankle; a severed artery<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     53"/>in the arm; and concussion of the brain,--besides the minor cuts attendant on such an accident as yours. Each of these is doing finely. You have now no cause for alarm. It was a beautiful dislocation!" added the physician, with enthusiasm.</p><p>"Have I been dangerously ill?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Have you had consultation?"</p><p>"By telegraph every day, your worst days; by letter when I have thought you would feel easier to know that I had it"</p><p>"How soon shall I be about again?"</p><p>"I cannot promise you anything at present.</p><p>You are doing remarkably well. But you will have occasion for patience, sir."</p><p>"I must have seemed very rude--or--distrustful of you, at the first."</p><p>"On the contrary, Mr. Yorke, you have shown me every reasonable confidence,--far more than I could have expected under the circumstances. I  have appreciated it."</p><p>That sensitiveness had come into her faoe again; she gave him a direct, full look; and he thought once more that she was a beautiful woman.</p>"Believe," he said earnestly, "that I am grateful to you, madam."</p><pb n="54     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>She smiled indulgently, bowed, and left him. He heard her quick step in the hall, and her voice speaking to Mrs. Butterwell; then he heard her chirrup to her pony, and the cound of wheels. She drove rapidly, and was soon gone.</p><p>The day passed in the faint, sweet, hazy way that only the convalesoent knows. No other creature ever gets behind that glamour. Returning life paces towards one so solemnly that the soul would keep upon its knees, were it not so weak; one dares not pray; one ventures only to see the frolic in the eyes of the advancing power, and dashes into joy as bees into rhythm, or as flowers into color. Waldo Yorke was very happy. He thought of his mother; his heart was full. He looked at the block of yellow light upon the carpet; at the apple-blossoms in the vase; at the patch of June sky that burned beyond that one open window. Life and light, he thought, are here.</p><p>Mrs. Isaiah Butterwell, however, was there too. She was extremely kind. She entertained the young man with a graphic account of his accident and its consequences. Mr. Butterwell himself came in, for a moment, and briefly considered it (although the Bangor horse was killed) a lucky thing.</p><p>"When he brought you home;" observed the<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     55"/>lady, "I said, 'He's dead.' I must say I hoped you were, for I said to my husband, 'He'll be an idiot if he lives.' It always seems to me as if the Creator was thinking he hadn't made enough of 'em, after all, and was watching opportunities to increase the stock. But our doctor's been a match for him this time!" added Mrs. Isaiah, with a snap of her soft eyes.</p><p>"Why,--Sar-ah!" rebuked her husband, gently.</p><p>"Well, she has!" insisted Sarah; "and I don't see the harm. He made <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, too, I suppose, didn't he? I think he ought to be proud of her. I've no doubt he is,--not the least in the world."</p><p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">Sarah</hi>!" repeated Mr. Butterwell. He had the air of being just as much surprised by these little conversational peculiarities in his consort as if he had not wintered and summered them for better and worse for forty years. This amused the invalid. He liked to hear them talk. He was so happy that day that Mrs. Isaiah seemed to him really very witty. He drew her out. She dwelt a good deal upon the doctor. She explained to him her difficulty in concealing the fact of the  physician's sex from him those first few days.</p><p>"I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tell a fib for you, Mr. Yorke, even if you did die. And when you ran on so about<pb n="56     DOCTOR ZAY."/>seeing the doctor, I was hard up. I couldn't say 'she,' and I wouldn't say 'he,' for she wasn't he,' now was she? Once I got stuck in the middle of a sentenoe; and Mr. Butterwell was here, and I said, 'Sh--Isaiah!-- he;' so I cut the word in two, don't you see? Only I spelled it with an extra <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. But I'd rather sacrifice my spellin' than my conscience. And Isaiah asked me afterwards what I sh-shd him up for, when he hadn't opened his mouth. He didn't open it very often while you were sick, Mr. Yorke. But I he spoke about your uncle, and was blue enough. I had to make up my mind to do the talking for two when I married Mr. Butterwell. What time did Doctor Zay say she should look in again, Mr. Yorke?"</p><p>"Doctor Zay?" repeated the young gentleman blankly.</p><p>"Oh, we call her Doctor Zay. You see there were two of them, she and the old man; and, as luck would, they must have the same name. I suppose he was ashamed of his,--Adoniram; I don't blame him. At any rate, there's the sign, 'Dr. A. Lloyd.' And she has some kind of a heathen name herself; I never can pronounce it so she takes to 'Dr. Z. A. Lloyd,' and that's how we come by it. Everybody calls her Doctor Za.<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     57"/>But she spells it with a <hi rend="italic">y</hi> herself. We love the sound of it," added Mrs. Butterwell gently. "So would you, if you'd been a woman Down East, and she the first one, of all you'd read about and needed, you'd ever seen."</p><p>"But I'm  not a woman," interrupted the patient, laughing. "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> can't call her Doctor Zay. The young lady has done admirably by me; I'll admit that. How much I must have troubled her, to come here so often!"</p><p>"I wouldn't waste your feelings, sir," observed Mrs. Butterwell, dryly. "Feelings are too rich cream to be skimmed for nothing. Doctor would have done her duty by you, anyhow; but it's been less of a sacrifice, considering she lives here."</p><p>The subsiding expression of weariness on the sick man's face rose to one of interest. He repeated, "Lives here?" not without something like energy.</p> <p>"Yes, I've had her a year. She was starving at the Sherman Hotel, and I took her in. I used to go to school with some connections of hers, so I felt a kind of responsibility for her. And then I'm always glad of society, as I told you when I took you. I'm social in my nature. I suppose that's why Providence went out of his way to marry me to Mr. Butterwell. If my lot had been<pb n="58     DOCTOR ZAY."/>cast in Portland, or Bangor, I'm afraid I should have been frivolous, as I said to Doctor Zay, the first time I saw her--it was chilblains; I thought I could trust her; I didn't know her then, you see. Do you mean to say you didn't notice her sign? Then, if she'd got sick at the hotel they'd have said she was A WOMAN. I had the cause to consider," added Mrs. Butterwell, solemnly.</p> <p>The physician came again at night, as she had promised. She was later than usual. Yorke listened for her wheels, and got restless. It made him nervous when the country wagons rolled up and rumbled by. He had flushed with the end of the day, and was feverish and miserable. He attended to his sensations anxiously. He wished she would come. It was quite dark when the low wheels of the phaeton came smoothly and suddenly to a stop in the great back yard; he heard the doctor's voice speaking cheerily to her boy. "Handy," she called him. Handy took the horse; a light step passed the corner of the house, and vanished. "She must have gone on to the office door," thought Yorke. He found himself absorbed in a little uneasiness; he wondered if she would take her tea first.</p><p>She did not. She came to him directly. Her thing were off her hair smoothly brushed; she<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     59"/>stood beside him, her pleasant figure, in its house-dress, cut against the light that fell through the open door. She began at once: "There are patients in the office,--I am late; I was detained by a troublesome case. I can give you five minutes now, or come back when they are gone. Let me see!" She went out and brought the lamp, scrutinized his face closely, sat down, and felt his pulse; she did not count it, but quickly laid his hand aside.</p><p>"Please come by and by," urged the young man. Already he felt unaccountably better. "I can wait."  She hesitated a moment, then said, "Very well," and left him. She was gone half an hour.</p><p>"Have you had your supper?" asked Yorke, when she came back.</p><p>"Oh, my supper is used to waiting," said Doctor Zay, cheerfully. "You have waited quite long enough, sir. Now, if you please, to business."</p><p>The note-book, the pencil, the medicine-case, and the somewhat stolid, studious look presented themselves at once. Yorke felt half amused, half annoyed. He wanted to be talked to, as if she had been like other women. He thought it would do him more good than the aconite pellets which she prepared so confidingly. He was just enough<pb n="60     DOCTOR ZAY."/>better to begin to be homesick. He asked her if he might try to walk to-morrow. She promptly replied in the negative.</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> walk next week," urged the patient, setting a touch of his natural imperiousness against her own. She gave him one of her composed looks.</p><p>"You will walk, Mr. Yorke, when I allow you," she said, courteously enough.  She looked so graceful and gentle and womanly, sitting there beside him, that all the man in him rebelled at her authority. Their eyes met, and clashed.</p><p>"When will that be?" he insisted, with a creditable effort at submission.</p><p>"A dislocated ankle is not to be used in ten days," replied the doctor quietly. "It is going to take time."</p><p>"How much time?"</p><p>"That depends partly on yourself, partly on me, a little on"--</p><p>"Providence?" interrupted Yorke.</p><p>"Not at all. God made the ankle, you dislocated it, I set it; nature must heal it."</p><p>"Mrs. Butterwell might have said that."</p><p>"Is it possible," said the young lady, with a change of manner, "that I am growing to talk like Mrs. Butterwell?"</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     61"/><p>This was the first personal accent which Yorke had caught in the doctor's voice. Thinking, perhaps, to pursue a faint advantage, which he vaguely felt would be of interest to him when he grew stronger and had nothing else to do but study this young woman, he proceeded irrelevantly:--</p><p>"I did not know that you stayed here, till to-day. It has been fortunate for me. It will be more fortunate still, if you are going to keep me on this bed all summer. Our hostess has been talking of you. She gave you such a pretty name! I've forgotten exactly what it was."</p><p>"We will move you to the lounge to-morrow," replied the doctor, rising. Yorke made no answer. He felt as if he were too sick a man to be snubbed. He found it more natural to think that his overthrown strength ought to have appealed to her chivalry, than to question if he had presumed upon the advantage which it gave him. In the subdued light of the sick-room all the values of his face were deepened; he looked whiter for its setting of black hair, and his eyes darker for the pallor through which they burned. But the doctor was not an artist. She observed, and said to herself, "That is a <hi rend="italic">cinchona</hi> look."</p><p>She moved the night-lamp, gave a few orders,<pb n="62     DOCTOR ZAY."/>herself adjusted his window and blinds, and, stepping lightly, left him. She did not go out-of-doors, but crossed the hall, and disappeared in her own part of the house. He heard, soon after, what he now knew to be the office-bell. It rang four or five times; and, he heard the distant feet of patients on the graveled walk that led to her door. After this there was silence, and he thought, "They have let her alone to rest now." It had not occurred to him before that she could be tired, He was restless, and did not sleep easily, and waked often.  Once, far on in the night he thought it must have been, a noise in the back yard roused him. It was Handy rolling out the basket phaeton. Yorke heard whispers and hushed footfalls, and then the brisk trot of the gray pony. There was a lantern on the phaeton, which went flashing by his window, and crossed his wall with bright bars like those of a golden prison. He wished the blinds were open. He thought, "Now they have called that poor girl out again!" He pictured the desolate Maine roads. A vision of the forest presented itself to him: the great throat of blackness; the outline of near things, wet leaves, twigs, fern-clumps, and fallen logs; patches of moss and lichens, green and grey; and the light from the lonely carriage<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     63"/>streaming out; above it the solitary figure of the caryatid, courageous and erect. He hoped the boy went with her. He listened some time to hear her return, but she did not come.</p><p>When he awoke again it was about seven o'clock. He was faint, and while he was ringing for his beef-tea, the phaeton came into the yard.</p><p>"Put up the pony, Handy," he heard her say; "she is tired out. Give me Old Oak, to-day."</p><p>Yorke listened, feeling the strength of a new sensation. Was it possible that this young woman had practice enough to keep two horses? He knew nothing of the natural history of doctresses. He had thought of them chiefly as a species of higher nurse,--poor women, who wore unbecoming clothes, took the horse-cars, and probably dropped their "<hi rend="italic">g</hi>'s," or said, "Is that so?"</p><p>It was later than usual, that morning, when Doctor Zay came round to him. It was another of those sentient, vivid June days, and the block of light on the brown carpet seemed to throb as she crossed it. The apple-blossoms on the bureau had begun to droop. She herself looked pale.</p><p>"You are tired " began the patient impulsively.</p><p>"I have been up all night," said the doctor shortly. She sat down with the indefinable air<pb n="64     DOCTOR ZAY."/>which holds all personalities at arms-length, and went at once to work. She examined the wounded arm, she bathed and bandaged the injured foot; she had him moved to the lounge, with Mr. Butterwell's asistance. She was incommunicative as a beautiful and obedient machine. Yorke longed to ask what was the matter with her, but he did not dare. He felt sorry to see her look so worn; but he perceived that she did not require his sympathy. She looked more delicate for her weariness, which seemed to be subtly at odds with her professional manner. He would have liked to ask her a great many things, but her abstraction forbade him. He contented himself with the pathological ground upon which alone it was praticable to meet this exceptional young woman, and renewed his entreaties to be allowed to use his foot.</p><p>"You do not trust me," she said suddenly, laying down the sponge with which she had been bathing his arm.</p><p>"You wrong me, Doctor Lloyd. I think I have proved that I <hi rend="italic">do</hi>."</p><p>"That is true. You have," she said, softening. Trust me a while longer, then. No. Stay. Put your foot down, if you want to. Gently--slowly--but put it down."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     65"/><p>He did so. A low outcry escaped him; he grew very pale.</p><p>"Now put it back," said the doctor grimly. But with that she melted like frost, and shone; she hovered over him; all the tenderness of the healer suffused her reticent face.</p><p>"I am sorry to let you hurt yourself, but you will feel better; you will obey me now. Is the pain still so sharp? Give me the foot." As if it had been her property, she took the aching ankle in her warm, strong, and delicate hands, and for a few moments rubbed it gently and gravely; the pain subsided under her touch.</p><p>"What am I going to do?" cried Yorke, despairingly.</p><p>"You are going to do admirably, Mr. Yorke, on invention for a while, on courage by and by. Your crutches will be here to-morrow night."</p><p>Waldo Yorke looked at the young lady with a kind of loyal helplessness. He felt so subdued by his anomalous position that, had she said, "I have sent to Bangor for your work-basket," or, "to Omaha for your wife," he would scaroely have experienced surprise. He repeated, "My crutches?" in a vague, submissive tone.</p><p>"I sent to Bangor for a pair of Whittemore crutches three days ago," replied the dootor quietly                    <p>5</p><pb n="66     DOCTOR ZAY."/> "I should not want you to use them before to-morrow. The stage will bring them at five o'clock. If I should be out, do not meddle with them. No, on the whole, I had them addressed to myself. I wish to be present when you try them. One powder dry on the tongue, if you please, every four hours. Good-morning."</p><p>"Don't go, please," pleaded the young man; it is so lonely to be sick."</p><p>An amused expression settled between her fine,  level brows. She made no reply. He realized that he had said an absurd thing. He remembered into  how many sick-rooms she must bring her bloom and bounteousness, and for the first time in his fortunate life he understood how corrosive is the need of the sick for the well. He remembered that he was but one of--how many? Dependent and complaining creatures, draining upon the life of a strong and busy woman. He let her go in silence. Her turned his face over towards the back of the lounge; it was a black hair-cloth lounge. "I must look as if I were stretched on a bier, here," thought the young man  irritably. All his youth and vigor revolted from the tedious convalescence, which it was clear this fatally wise young woman foresaw, but was too shrewd to discuss with him. He remembered,<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     67"/>with a kind of awe, some invalid friends of his mother's. One lay on a bed in Chestnut Street for fifteen years. He recalled a man he met in the Tyrol once, who broke his knee-pan in a gymnasium,--was crippled for life. Yorke had always found him a trifle tiresome. He wished he had been kinder to the fellow, who, he remembered, had rather a lonely look. Yorke was receiving that enlargement and enlightenment of the imagination which it is the privilege of endurance alone, of all forms of human assimilation, to bestow upon us. Experience may almost be called a faculty of the soul.</p><p>He was interesting himself to the best of his brave ability in this commendable train of thought, when something white fluttered softly between his heroically dismal face and the pall of smooth hair-cloth to which he had limited his horizon. It was a letter, and was followed by another, and another, --his mother's letters. The big, weak, tender fellow caught them, like a lover, to his lips--they had taken him so suddenly--before he became aware that they fell from a delicately-gloved hand suspended between him and Mrs. Butterwell's striped wall. He turned, as the doctor was hurrying away, quickly enough--for he was growing stronger every hour--to snatch from her face a<pb n="68     DOCTOR ZAY."/>kind of maternal gentleness, a beautiful look. She was brooding over him with this little pleasure; he felt how glad she was to give it. But instantly an equally beautiful merriment darted over the upper part of the doctor's face, deepening ray within ray through the blue circles of her eyes, like the spark in the aureola of ripples where a shell has struck the sea.</p><p>"Another fit of the sulks to-day, if you dare!" she said, and, evanescent as an uncaptured fancy, she was gone.</p><pb n="69"/>IV.<p>WALDO YORKE was right in foreseeing for himself a tedious recovery. Had he at that time known the full extent of the shock he had undergone, that beautiful submission to the inevitable which he flattered himself he was cultivating to an extent that might almost be called feminine, and assuredly was super-masculine, would have received an important check. To his perplexed inquiries about certain annoying symptoms in the head and spine, his medical adviser returned that finely-constituted reply which is the historic solace and resource of the profession,--that he had received a nervous strain. This is a phrase which stands with a few others (notably among them "the tissues," "the mucous membrane," and "debility"), that science keeps on hand as a drop-curtain between herself and a confiding if expectant laity.</p><p>The young man got upon his crutches in the course of the week, but kept his room. He discovered the measure of his feebleness by the measure of his effort. He wrote cheerfully to Boston aboat both. In fact, he found himself more cheer-<pb n="70     DOCTOR ZAY."/>ful than one would have expected to be, under his really unusual circumstances. He wrote that Mr. Butterwell read to him, and asked for more books. He deprecated distinctly a modest maternal plan for proposing to the eminent Dr. Fullkoffer to travel from Boston to Sherman to consult with the local physician. He assured his mother that he had every reason to be satisfied with his treatment. He still, from motives of consideration, neglected to reply to her minute inquiries as to the nature of the practitioner.</p><p>"My mother wants to know whether he is 'high' or 'low.' What does she mean?" he asked. "And are you a gentleman or a quack? And does he 'alternate,'--what's <hi rend="italic">that?</hi> And does he use attenuations,'--do you?--and something--I forget what--about what she calls 'triturations' It seems to be a very important point. I was not to omit to answer it. Then there was a treatise on--I think she called them 'aggravations.' Don't go just yet, Doctor Zay--I beg your pardon! I get so used to it with Mrs. Butterwell."</p><p>"Oh, never mind," she said, with her gentler manner; it was one of her easy days, and she had leisure to be kind.</p><p>"I wish you would tell me," pleaded Yorke<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     71"/>"if you <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> mind, how you came to have such an uncommon supply of initials. I've never even heard your name."</p><p>"Atalanta," said the doctor, looking up pleasantly from the powder-paper she was folding with mathematical precision. He always liked to see her fold powders; it brought all the little delicate motions of her firm hands into play.</p><p>"Ah, the apple-blossom!" said Yorke impulsively. The powder-paper remained for an instant motionless in Doctor's Zay's hand; she turned her head slightly in the attitude of attention towards the hair-cloth sofa. He thought, "She meant to do it." Her eyes were bent. He thought for a moment he could see the mischief beneath the lids, and that she would ripple into frolic over his daring speech, like any other young lady. Nothing of the sort happened. The doctor's countenance presented a strictly scientific basis. "She dropped it by accident," said Yorke.</p><p>He contented himself with observing that it was an unusual name.</p><p>"I had a mother who liked the name," proceeded the doctor, leaning back in her chair, and looking over his head out of the window into the young June day. "When I was a baby she had this fancy for romantic names. She called me<pb n="72     DOCTOR ZAY."/>Zaidee, to begin with. Then she happened on this. She always said it was cruelty to infants to impose names on them about which they were never consulted, and I should have my choice of either. I dropped the first, till I came here to practice. Then I had to make some compromise with fate as regarded Dr. Adoniram. There was something absurd in seeing 'Atalanta' on a Down East doctor's shingle,--I have known women do such things in that way! I had a classmate who took out her diploma in the name of <hi rend="italic">Cubbie</hi> Smith, M. D.; and there was one who was let loose upon a defenseless public as Dr. <hi rend="italic">Teasie</hi> Trial. So I had reoourse to the discarded initial. My patients have made a pretty use of it. I rather like it, myself."</p><p>She gave that ominous snap to the elastic on the well-worn green morocco medicine-case which had become philosophically associated in the invalid's mind with the cessation of a pleasure. She was going. He hurried to say,--</p><p>"Do you object to telling me how you came to settle in this village? There are so many things I should like to ask. I never knew a lady physician before. The whole thing interests me. So it will my mother; she is familiar with such subjects. I believe she once consulted a doctress her-<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     73"/>self. I shall tell her about you when I get a little better; when it is too late to worry."</p><p>"I will give you any facts about professional women that may interest you, certainly," replied the doctor, rising, "when I have time."</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">never</hi> have time!" cried the patient.</p><p>"Have I neglected you, Mr. Yorke?" she asked, coloring slightly; her color became her. She wore a black dress that day, of almost extravagantly fine cashmere; she was always well dressed. There was a carmine ribbon around her high, close collar of immaculate linen. The fastidious sick man wondered where this Down East doctress had her origin.</p><p>"You have asked me all sorts of personal questions," he went on, with his masculine insistence. "You know all about <hi rend="italic">me</hi>."</p><p>"It is my business," said the doctor, coldly, "to know all about you."</p><p>"In other words, it is none of mine to feel the faintest human curiosity in a scientific fact like yourself. You are candid, Doctor Lloyd."</p><p>"And you are nervous, Mr. Yorke. Good-morning. I will send Mrs. Butterwell to read to you."</p><p>He held her to her promise, however; and the next time she came he returned to the subject. It<pb n="74     DOCTOR ZAY."/>was her mood to be tolerant of him that afternoon; indeed, she was tolerant of everything. She had just brought a patient triumphantly through a mortal attack of erysipelas: she had been a good deal worn by the case for some time; now her cruel care had slipped radiantly from her young shoulders. He had never heard her talk so naturally, so much like other women. It seemed to him at the moment as if she were really communicative. Afterwards, he remembered how little she had said; and began to analyze the fine reserve upon which all her ease had been poised, like the pendulum of a golden clock upon its axis. She told him that she had been in active practice for four years; that she was originally a Bangor girl; that she came to Sherman for a complexity of reasons which might not interest him. She paused there, as if there were nothing more to be said.</p><p>"But where did you get your medical education?" asked Yorke. "I don't even know where such things are to be had."</p><p>"At New York, Zirich, and Vienna."</p><p>"But why did you select this wilderness to bury yourself in?" he repeated, his surprise over-coming his civility. "You who had seen--Is it possible you have been abroad?"</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     75"/><p>She laughed outright at this, but did not otherwise comment upon it. A fine, good-natured scorn hovered over and seemed to be about to light upon her. He perceived at what a disadvantage he was showing himself; he might as well have said point-blank, "I thought you a crude, rural agitator." He felt his cheeks burn with the quick fever of illness, while she went on indulgently to say,--</p><p>"I used to come here summers, once. I knew Mrs. Butterwell and some people here. I must make my blunders somewhere. And then I had learned how terrible is the need of a woman by women, in country towns. One does not forget such things, who ever understands them. There is refinement and suffering and waste of delicate life enough in these desolate places to fill a circle in the Inferno. You do not know!" she said, with rare impetuousness. "No one knows, Mr. Yorke, but the woman healer."</p><p>"What led you to see it? How came you to want to see it?" he asked, reverently. "How came you to make such a sacrifice of yourself?--such a young, bright life as yours! I cannot understand it."</p><p>She did not answer him at once; and when he raised his eyes he perceived that her own swam<pb n="76     DOCTOR ZAY."/>with sudden tears. She held them back royally, commanded hersef, and answered in a very low voice:--</p><p>"It was owing to--my mother. She had a painful illness. There were only we two. I took care of her through it all. She spent that last summer here in Sherman,--it was cool here. She suffered so from the hot weather! My mother was greatly comforted, during a part of her illness, by the services of a woman doctor in Boston. There was one when we were in Paris, too, who helped her. I said, When she is gone, I will do as much for some one else's mother."</p><p>Waldo Yorke was lying with his hands clasped behind his head, his thin face upturned towards her while she spoke. He did not say anything; but his sense of sympathy with this lonely woman vibrated through him to the last sick nerve. He had, for a moment, that vague consciousness of gaining an unexpected hold upon an unknown privilege, which is one of the keenest allurements and bitterest delusions of life. He dared not speak, lest he should startle her,--lest he should touch the rainbow in a bubble. She saw his hand tremble; her manner changed at once.</p><p>"And so I became a doctor," she said, with superficial cheerfulness. "Is there anything more you wanted to know?"</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     77"/><p>"I want to know everything," said Yorke, in an undertone. She ignored this little slip, as she would a rise in his pulse after dinner, or a faint turn on a hot day.</p><p>"If I knew what kind of information would interest you,"--she continued good-naturedly, "but I have had a very simple history. It is like that of many others in my profession. I really have nothing to tell. It came to me the more easily because I always had a taste for science; I found that out in my Sophomore year. And I inherited it besides."</p><p>"Sophomore?" repeated Yorke vaguely.</p><p>"I was a Vassar girl," said the doctor quietly.</p><p>"I have seen educated women before, though you might n't think it," returned Yorke, with humility. "My mother has them at the house, sometimes. I never saw one like you. I never noticed them very much."</p><p>"You must have been too preoccupied,--a young man in your arduous profession, Mr. Yorke. I can readily understand that you would have little leisure to study feminine types."</p><p>"It is unfair to be sarcastic with a patient, Doctor Lloyd! I was going to say it was unmanly. I have never been busy in my life. You know it as well as I do."</p><pb n="78     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>She scintillated for an intant with that charming merriment she had, but made no reply.</p><p>"Instead of being successful, I have been rich," he said bitterly. "If I had had to work for a living, I might have been worth something. There is nothing in life so fatal as to be fortunate."</p><p>"Ah," she said indifferently, "do you think so?"</p><p>"Indeed I do."</p><p>"Have you had that stinging pain in the right side of the head, Mr. Yorke?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And the dizziness you complained of?"</p><p>"A good deal. How many years did you study, Doctor Lloyd? Did you never shrink,--never to give it up?"</p><p>"It was hard sometimes in the foreign lecture-rooms, among the men. They were very courteous to me. I never had anything to complain of. But they could not make it easy. I never saw a woman rudely treated but once; that was her fault. Then the dissecting-room was a trial to me, at first. It would have been easier if my mother had been living; if I could have gone home and talked to her. I was only twenty-one. But courage, like muscle, grows by exercise. No I never wanted to turn back."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     79"/><p>"How many years did you study?"</p><p>Three years are necessary to a diploma from any reputable school. The fourth I spent abroad; But of course one always studies. That is one of the advantages of the Maine wilderness. If I had settled down among people I knew in a town, there would have been too many minor demands. It is never even a professional necessity, down here, to get into one's best clothes; and there's been but one wedding reception since I've been here. I went to that on my way to a scarlet-fever patient. I couldn't come afterwards, with the risk. I did waste a pair of gloves, but I went in my woolen dress, the one I meant to sacrifice to that case. I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> miss the concerts," she added; but hastily collected herself, with the air of a woman who had been drawn to the verge of a grave moral imprudence.</p><p>"Were you ever in Boston,--to stay, I mean?" asked Yorke.</p><p>"Oh, yes."</p><p>"I wish I had known it! I suppose it is unpardonable to ask where you were?"</p><p>"Oh," she said pleasantly, "I used to stay with different people: at the Shirleys' sometimes, and the Waynes'. I saw more of New York in my gay days; we had more relatives there, and I <pb n="80     DOCTOR ZAY."/>liked it better than Boston. I used to be at the Garratts', when I was a child. They were very kind to me, I remember, when I cried because I was homesick; they never noticed me at the time, but always gave me orange marmalade for lunch-eor after it. When I got home I used to feel unappreciated, because tears and marmalade did not retain the relation of cause and effect."</p><p>"Is it possible," cried Yorke, "that you are the little girl from somewhere who used to come over to our house with Susy Garratt, once in a while, to blow soap-bubbles? You had two long braids of black hair, and blew bigger bubbles than I did. I hated you."</p><p>"Very likely," said the doctor, laughing as she rose. "I don't remember it. I haven't been to the Garratts' for years. Or anywhere else, for that matter."</p><p>"You have had better things to do than to blow our soap-bubbles."</p><p>She nodded gravely.</p><p>"How many times have you walked across the room to-day, Mr. Yorke?"</p><p>"Oh, wait a minute. Don't go yet."</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">How many times, I ask</hi>, have you walked about the room?"</p><p>"Oh, ten, I believe,--yes, ten."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     81"/><p>"I hope to get you out-of-doors next week. Are you suffering from restlessness? Do you feel that rebellion you spoke of at the tediousness ofthe case? I wish I could hasten your convalescence."</p><p>"I don't," said Yorke bluntly, "though I am rebellious enough."</p><p>She swept upon him the full fine rebuke of her professional look. He returned it with a certain defiance. She was a woman. She should not thrust him aside like this.</p><p>"I believe I shall give you Nux," observed the physician, after a silence which the patient had felt was fraught with a significance he could hardly believe she failed to perceive or share. He flushed painfully.</p><p>"Doctor Lloyd," he demanded, "did you ever have a man for a patient before?"</p><p>"Oh, yes," quietly. "I am treating a Mr. Bailey now,--the erysipelas case I spoke of. His wife is a patient of mine; and Bob, the boy, and all the babies. They live about four miles out, beside the Black Forest."</p><p>"Do you often have us?" persisted Yorke.</p><p>"I do not desire it,--no. It will sometimes happen. Most of my patients are women and children. That is as I prefer it."</p>                  <p>6</p><pb n="82     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>She was sweepig away. She had almost a society manner, like any other young lady. She spoke haughtily. She was evidently displeased. He had never seen her look so handsome. But he dashed on:--</p><p>"Did you ever treat a young man,--a fellow like me?"</p><p>"Certainly not."</p><p>"I never should have known but you had them every day,--never."</p><p>"And why should you?" she answered coolly. She left him without another word. He listened for her to call Handy; for the nervous steps of the pony; for the decreasing sound of the phaeton wheels, which had become so familiar and vital an event in the invalid's dull day. He knew that he had made himself successfully wretched until he should see her once more. He knew that he had followed to the verge of folly a pathological, and therefore delusive, track in that region which lay marked upon the map of his nature as "unexplored." He knew that he should lie and think of it, regret it, curse it, set his teeth against it, and do it again.</p><p>"I must get well," said the young man aloud; as if that result awaited only the expressed intention on his part, and fate, like woman, needed<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     83"/>nothing but the proper masculine handling. He got over on his crutches to the tall bureau, and looked into the old-fashioned gilt-framed glass. He saw a fierce-looking fellow, all black and white, --a thundercloud in the eyes, symptoms of earthquake about the jaw, the fragility of mortal illness in the sunken cheeks. What kind of a man was that to command a woman's respect? He must be on a level in her mind with, say, a case of measles. What a pity he could not have had the whooping-cough, and done with it!</p><p>It occurred to him that he would go out-of-doors. It struck him just then that he should go into a decline if he housed himself here like an old tabby any longer. He hunted up his hat, and rolled Mrs. Butterwell's somewhat accentuated red and black striped afghan anyhow about him, and hobbled to the front door. The day was damp and cheerless. It did not rain, but would have done so if it had dared. Yorke looked at the clouds grimly. "They are probably ordered by their physician not to go out," he thought. He got down upon the graveled walk, and stumped along towards the gate. He had never felt more guilty since, at the conscientious age of eleven, he kissed Susy Garratt without asking. As he stood there he caught sight suddenly of the dootor's phaeton.<pb n="84     DOCTOR ZAY."/>She was turning a distant corner, over by the post-office. He maintained his ground sullenly, at least he would not run from her. She did not see him, he was sure; she was driving very fast. He watched her till she was out of sight, and then returned at once to the house. Mrs. Butterwell, at the rear kitchen window, was making lemon pies,--a conscientious, not to say religious, process. No one observed him. As he came up the walk he caught a glimpse of the doctor's sign, and wondered, with, the idle curiosity of illness, what her part of the house might be like. He felt himself extremely faint, after his exertion, and sank exhausted on the hair-cloth sofa, beneath the blazing but generous afghan. He looked at the marble-topped bureau, the Madonna and the framed certificate, the red and gold striped walls, the brown carpet, where the block of sunshine was conspicuously absent. The clock was striking ten. He tried to read. Sparks of fire darted before his  eye, and his ears rang. There was no mail-stage till four o'clock. Doctor Zay might not make her evening call before eight or nine.</p><p>"How <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> men ridicule or neglect sick women?" thought Waldo Yorke.</p><p>The day dragged piteously enough. He felt unusually ill. He asked Mrs. Butterwell to stay <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     85"/>till she dilated before his eyes, and her head swelled and flashed fire like a jack-o'-lantern. He let her go, to call her back because her vacant chair undertook to rise and hop after her as she went. She read till he entreated her as an act of charity to stop, and talked till he begged her in self-defense to read.</p><p>"I'm worried to death about Doctor," observed Mrs. Butterwell, by way of saying something cheerful. It was the sick man's habit to discourage his hostess in gossiping about the young lady; perversely, to-day, he let her run on; he had already that prevailing sense of having broken the ten commandments, which made the absence of an eleventh seem a philosophical lapse on the part of the Giver.</p><p>"She will be worked half out of her wits," proceeded Mrs. Butterwell, with that exasperating serenity, which ignorance of one another's mental processes gives to the most perceptive of us at times. "East Sherman has the soarlet fever It's something about drains. There's no society in East Sherman; they're a miserable lot. Doctor will be up and down day and night, now, you'll see. She has no more consideration for herself than a seraphim. She'll <hi rend="italic">be</hi> one, if she don't mind. The poorer they are, the more no<pb n="86     DOCTOR ZAY."/>body else goes near 'em, the more they get of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. I've seen her go on like a lover to creatures you or I wouldn't touch with our winter gloves on--hold 'em in her arms--dirty babies; and once there was a woman at the poor-house--but there! I won't go into that. You wouldn't sleep a wink tonight. She has such a spirit! You'd expect it if she wasn't smart. When a woman ain't good for anything else she falls back on her spirit! You don't look for it when she's got bigger fish to fry. But there! There's more <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> to our doctor than to the rest of us, just as there's more brains. Seems to me as if there was love enough invested in her for half the world to live on the interest, and never know they hadn't touched the principal.  If she didn't give so much, she'd be rich on her own account before now."</p><p>"Give so much what,-- love?" asked Yorke, turning with the look and motion of momentarily arrested suffering.</p><p>Practice," said Mrs. Isaiah severely. "She will do it, for all anybody, when folks ain't able to pay. Why, Mr. Yorke, if Doctor got all that's owin' her she'd do a five-thousand-dollar practice every year of her life; as it is, she don't fall short of three. She's sent for all over the county."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.    87"/><p>"Five thousand dollars!" echoed the sick man faintly. "That girl!" He had never earned five hundred in his life.</p><p>"And that, I'd have you understand," pursued "that girl's" adorer, "is only because she shuts herself up down here with us, bless her! If she lived in New York, I've no doubt it would be TWENTY-FIVE,--not the least in the world. What are you laughing at, Mr. Yorke? There is a woman out West that makes twenty."</p><p>"I don't dispute that it might be seventy," groaned Yorke.</p><p>"Not that there's the remotest need of it," proceeded Mrs. Butterwell loftily. "Doctor is quite independent of her practice."</p><p>"I never had heard of that!" exclaimed Yorke savagely.</p><p>"Well, she is, all the same. Her father was one of the rich men in Bangor,--a doctor himself; she used to be round his laboratories, and so on, with him, when she was little. He died when she was fifteen. This girl is the only one left, and has it all. You don't suppose Providence didn't know what he was about when he planned out <hi rend="italic">her</hi> life! He sets too much by her. He never'd let her go skinning round in medical schools, do your own washing and gesticulate skeletons or go out nursing, to make a few dollars."</p><pb n="88     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"It is a remarkable case," murmured Yorke. "And I must have been a remarkable donkey."</p><p>"Oh, I wouldn't dispute that, sir," replied Mrs. Isaiah gently.</p><p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">Sar</hi>ah!" objected Mr. Butterwell, whose prudent gray head appeared at the half-open door in season to receive the full force of this characteristic reply.</p><p>"Well, I wouldn't. I never argue with sick folks. You want to know what she does it for, Mr. Yorke? I see you do. Well, I'll tell you. Don't you know there are women that can't get through this valley without men folks, in some shape or 'nother? If there ain't one round, they're as miserable as a peacock deprived of society that appreciates spread-feathers. You know the kind I mean: if it ain't a husband, it's a flirtation; if she can't flirt, she adores her minister. I always said I didn't blame 'em, ministers and doctors and all those privileges, for walkin' right on over women's necks. It isn't in human nature to take the trouble to step off the thing that's under foot. Now, then! There are women that love <hi rend="italic">women</hi>, Mr. Yorke, care for 'em, grieve over 'em, worry about 'em, feel a fellow feeling and a kind of duty to 'em, and never forget they're one of 'em, misery and all,--and nonsense too, may be, if they<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     89"/>hadn't better bread to set; and they lift up their strong arms far above our heads, sir, like statues I've read of that lift up temples, and carry our burdens for love of us, God bless 'em!--and I wouldn't think much of him if he didn't!"</p><p>"Why, Sarah, Sarah!" said Mr. Butterwell. The sick man answered nothing. He tossed upon the hair-cloth sofa, and looked so uncommonly black that Mrs. Butterwell, acting upon an exceptionally vivid movement of the imagination, went to make him a blanc-mange. It was the whitest, not to say the most amiable, thing she could think of. She feared the patient was not improving, and experienced far more concern for Doctor Zay's professional venture in the matter than if it had been her own.</p><p>It was half past nine that evening before the doctor got, upon her rounds, to Mrs. Butterwell's spare chamber. The patient watched her dreamily, as she crossed the room through that mysterious half-light, in which he was so used to seeing her that he always thought of her in beautiful hazy outlines, standing between himself and the lamp upon the entry floor.</p><p>"How are the fever patients?" he began, with a stupid idea of deferring personal consultation.</p><pb n="90     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"I have changed my dress," said Doctor Zay,--"every article. There is nothing to fear."</p><p>"I never <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>" cried Yorke. She paid no attention to his thoughts, but sat down and abruptly took his hand to count the pulse. He was in high fever.</p><p>"It is just as I expected," she said shortly. "You will discontinue the other remedy, and take these powders dry on the tongue, every two hours."</p><p>She brought the light to prepare the medicine. Her face, bent over the green morocco medicine-case, was stern. She did not talk to him. She rose, took up the light, and left the remedy and the room in silence.</p><p>"Come back, please, Doctor!" called the culprit, faintly. She stood, the lamp in her hand, looking over her shoulder. It was a warm night, and she had on a cambric dress, of one of the "brunette colors;" he did not know what to call it.</p><p>"I am afraid I did a wrong thing to-day," he began meekly. "I went"--</p><p>"It is unnecessary to talk about it, Mr. Yorke. I saw you."</p><p>"What don't you see!"</p><p>"Very little, I hope, which it is my business to see."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     91"/>He had thought she would say more, but perceived that she had no intention of discussing the matter with him; he keenly felt this dignified rebuke.</p><p>"I don't suppose I did quite right," he admitted hastily, "but I am not versed in medical ethics. I did not realize, till I felt so much worse, how wrong it was by you."</p><p>"It was not honorable. But the real wrong is to yourself. We will not talk of it, if you please. I must go. I have had nothing to eat since twelve o'clock."</p><p>He saw how tired she looked, and his heart smote him. He smothered an ineffectual groan. He felt that she was very angry with him, and that he deserved it. He would have pleaded with her. Unreasonably, he felt as if his suffering ought to appeal to her pity. Where was the woman in her that Mrs. Isaiah prated of? Was there no weak point where his personality could struggle through and meet her own, man against woman, on level ground? What an overthrow was his! He called impetuously:--</p><p>"Doctor Zay!"</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>"One moment"--</p><p>"I have no moments for you, at present, Mr.<pb n="92     DOCTOR ZAY."/>Yorke." Her peremptoriness was the more incisive for being punctiliously polite. "It would be perfectly just if I were to refuse to keep your case another day. You have disobeyed and distrusted me. You would have no right, after what I have done for you, sir, to complain, if I turned you over to old Doctor Adoniram to-morrow morning, Good-night." And the woman of science left him, without a relenting word. It struck him forcibly, perhaps for the first time, that these exceptional women had an unfortunate power of looking beyond that gentle pressure of the individual, which, like the <hi rend="italic">masque</hi> veils that their sex wore, heightened the complexion, if it did not brighten the eyesight. Obviously, her interest in her professional reputation overpowered her interest in her patient. He accepted his fate and his fever. This was easier to do, as he was quite ill for several days.</p><pb n="93"/>V.<p>SHE took care of him conscientiously and skillfully. On his worst day, she even melted and brooded in that gracious, womanly way of hers that he watched for; but as soon as he began to get better again he felt that she distanced him.</p><p>"You are harder than Heaven, Doctor," he said. "You cannot forgive."</p><p>"Forgive what?" She looked up; she was bandaging his ankle. "Oh, that disobedience of yours? Honestly, I have been so hard-worked, I had almost forgotten it."</p><p>"Then what is the matter, Doctor Zay?"</p><p>She glittered upon him for an instant with her professional look. It was as if she held out a golden sceptre to measure the width at which she would keep him. There was no invitation in her eye. He did not press his question. When the consultation was over she told him that she should not be in again till the next morning. "You no longer need two calls a day, Mr. Yorke. I will be here as usual, after office hours, before I start off, and will see you safely out upon<pb n="94     DOCTOR ZAY."/>the piazza. I wish you to keep out, now, from one to three hours a day. I will superintend the periment, to begin with. But you are perfectly able to dispense with this frequent attendance."</p><p>Was she thinking of her--bill, perhaps? The young man had really forgotten, till that moment that any embarrassing basis of this sort awaited himself and this lady.</p><p>"Oh, indeed, I don't think I am well enough, at all," he hastily said. "I--really--I have such troublesome sensations towards evening. I beg you will continue to come as you have, Doctor Lloyd."</p><p>That amused look flitted for a moment over her bowed forehead; he could see it in the little movements about the temples. She said,--</p><p>"It is impossible for me to call where I am not positively needed, just now. You do not realize how driven I am. You will find one daily call quite sufficient for your case. We will hope to dipense with that, before long." </p><p>She was as bad as her word, and he did not see her for twenty-four hours.</p><p>When she came again, she looked at him and frowned. He was clearly worse.</p><p>"I have found out now what my mother meant by 'aggravations,'" said the patient. "This must be one."</p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     95"/><p>She did not smile, as he had expected. Neither did she express the sympathy which he felt that the physician's heart ought to keep on tap, like cider, and gush to order, at least upon a reasonably interesting invalid like himself. She leaned back in her chair with a look of annoyance, drumming lightly upon the table, with that nervous protest of the fingertips, which is a more natural expression of irritation among men than women. As she sat there, looking steadily at him, it occurred to him that she was about to say something of novelty and importance. A certain swift illumination of her thoughtful eyes struck him, and fell, like a ray of intercepted light. It was somehow made apparent to him, also, perhaps from the fact that she refrained from saying what she purposed, that it would not have been a matter of pleasurable interest to himself.</p><p>"I will get you out-of-doors, now," she observed, rising. She had never made him so short a call. He protested that he was too ill to go to-day; and, in fact, he had no heart or health for it. He was full of aches and ails; those, especially-in the spine, were not of light importance; he was thoroughly dejected.</p><p>She paid no attention whatever to his opinions, helped him out upon the piazza, overlooking<pb n="96     DOCTOR ZAY."/> the process carefully; when she had him located to her mind, in the proper hygienic relations to wind, wet, sun, and shade, she gathered her driving-gloves, as if to go. "You have not changed the medicine, Doctor," he said, with difficult carelessness.</p><p>"I do not propose to."</p> <p>"Excuse me. I thought perhaps you had forgotten it."</p><p>"A physician cannot always give a patient the remedy he wants, you will understand; only the one he needs. I expect to find you better, when I come to-morrow."</p><p>It was hardly possible, he thought, to be mistaken in attributing a significance to these words. Yet so ineffably fine are the intonations by which souls become articulate for each other, and so exceptional was the acoustic position of these two, that the young man experienced a modest and taunting  doubt whether he might rate himself even of value enough to his physician to receive a clearly personal rebuff.</p><p>There exists, and there must exist, between woman and man, an exquisite chromatic scale of relations, variable from the sublimest passions which glorify earth to the most futile movements of the fanoy; from the profound and eternal sac-<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     97"/>rifices to the momentary deification of self; from divine oneness, past conscious separation, all the way down to little intellectual curiosities, and the contented reverences of slight and beautiful approach. Somewhere in this wide resource of harmony, thought Waldo Yorke, we <hi rend="italic">must</hi> belong. Then where?</p><p>It was apt, he remembered, to be the woman whom nature or fate, God or at least man (the same thing, doubtless, to her), had relegated to the minor note. It occurred to him that in this case he seemed to have struck it himself. He did not seek to detain her. They parted in silence, and she went to her day's work. Handy was at the gate with the gray pony. Handy always wore hats that were too big for him, and coats that never by any mistake were large enough. The doctor went down the long front walk, drawing on her gauntleted gloves. She had the decisive step which only women of business acquire to whom each moment represents dollars, responsibilities, or projects. Yet he liked to see that she had not lost the grace of movement due to her eminently womanly form. She had preserved the curves of femineity. He had never even seen her put her hand upon her hip, with that masculine angle of the elbow, the first evidence of a            <p>7</p><pb n="98     DOCTOR ZAY."/>mysterious process of natural selection, which goes on in women thrust by fate or choice to the front and the brunt of life; and the last little peculiarity to leave them if, by choice or fate, they suffer a military recall to the civil status. She saluted him lightly with her free hand, as she gathered the long blue reins into her left, and, turning once, shot over her shoulder a sudden smile. She had, when she felt like it, a lovely smile. He found himself ridiculously better for it.  He leaned back in the easy-chair where she had imprisoned him, and watched her drive away. The gray pony exhibited professional responsibility in every clean step that morning, and the consciousness of having made a timely diagnosis in each satisfied movement of her delicate ears. The doctor had on her linen dress and sack, and her figure absorbed the July morning light. Her color was fine. She was the eidolon of glorious health. Every free motion of her happy head and body was superb. She seemed to radiate health, as if she had too much for her own use, and to spare for half the pining world. She had the mysterious odic force of the healer, which is above science, and beyond experience, and behind theory, and which we call magnetism or vitality, tact or inspiration, according to our assimilating power<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     99"/>in its presence, and our -reverence for its mission.</p><p>It seemed to the nervously-strained patient on the piazza that he received a slowly-lessening strength from the doctor's departing figure, as he received warmth from the sun, at that moment threatened by a cloud. It seemed to him a cruel thing that she should not permit him to see her for twenty-four hours more.</p><p>It cannot be said that the young man did not chafe under his unprecedented consciousness of dependence. He did. It had struck him yesterday that he was in danger of making a fool of himself. He had devoted the day to this inspiring discovery, and to those select resolves and broad aspirations by which the Columbus in the soul is moved. His present relapse, not to say collapse, was the humiliating result. As he sat there, patient and weak in the strong summer morning, thinking these things sadly over, he recognized the fact that he was still too sick a man to be wise. The grave urgencies of illness intercepted him. He was caught between the fires of a higher and lower species of self-defense. All that a man hath, particularly his good sense, will he give for his life.</p><p>"Let me get well, first; I will be prudent afterwards," thought Yorke.</p><pb n="100     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>He waited to see her return at noon. He found himself strengthened--such is the hygienic influence of possesing an object in life--and calmed, as the morning wore away. It was a warm moring; would have been hot, outside of Maine. The soft, sudorific glow upon the small of the acacia-trees in the front yard; the opaque color of the dust in the dry, still street; the contented cluck of a brood of yellow chickens, that made futile attempts at acquaintance with him, around the shaded corner of the house; the faint purr of unknown domestic mysteries in Mrs. Isaiah's distant kitchen; and then the sky, of whom intense blueness he was conscious, as if he had been a star gone out in it and become a part of the burning day,--these things emphasized the dreamy struggle after strength, in which he seemed to be alternately the victor and the vanquished, and to fight for high costs, and cover large arenas, and to live a long time in the hours of a short July morning. Well people will not understand.</p><p>Mr. Butterwell came out and sat with him a while; he tipped his chair back, and rocked on its hind legs, not having felt at liberty to be individual before since his guest was hurt. He talked of his horse, of Uncle Jed and the estate, of the<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     101"/>doctor, of her horses, of Handy, of the lumber trade, and Sherman politics.</p><p>"I hope you find it comfortable to be sick, Mr. Yorke," he added hospitably. " I hope you don't mind it, bein' on Sarah's hands. Why, she <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> it. The worse you were, the more she'd enjoy it. Sarah is a very uncommon woman. She and I used to argey one spell about profession. Sarah is a professor. Seems at first she couldn't sit down to it that I shouldn't profess alongside of he. But she gave it up after a while. Women are curious creatures about what they <hi rend="italic">call</hi> religion</hi>. It looks as if nature gave 'em their meetin's and hymn-tunes much as she give men a store or a counting-room. They want places to go to,--that's what they want. They ain't like us, Mr. Yorke. There's a monstrous difference. Why, there's the doctor! She's a good girl, Doctor Zay is, if she is cute. There isn't a horse in town, without it's mine, can make the miles that pony can. Look there! The creetur wants her dinner. See how she holds her?  No blinders nor check-rein on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> horses. She drives 'em  by lovin' 'em. There's <hi rend="italic">woman clear through that girl's brains</hi>. You should see her in January. There ain't three men in Sherman I'd trust to drive that mare is *uary without a good life insurance before they<pb n="102     DOCTOR ZAY."/>set out. Now, Mr. Yorke, may be you don't feel as I do, but to my mind there's no prettier sight under heaven than a brave girl and a fine horse that understand each other. I guess I'll speak to the little doctor."</p><p>This was a long speech for Mr. Butterwell, who clearly took advantage of what he thought the first well-bred opportunity to relieve himself of his unwonted conversational responsibility. He was fond of Mr. Yorke, but he adored the doctor, who never wasted good English herself, and had cured the big sorrel of rheumatism. Yorke watched the two standing in the bright, unshaded yard. Mr. Butterwell patted the pony, and it seemed, although she did not touch him, as if the doctor patted the old man. There was a beautiful affectionateness about her,--Yorke had either never noticed or never seen it before,--a certain free, feminine impulse, which it is hard to describe, unless we say that it showed itself chiefly in the motions of her delicate chin. She nodded pleasantly to her patient as she came by, but did not stop.</p><p>Presently the dinner-bell rang, and she came through the long hall behind him, and out upon the piazza. He saw then that she had changed her "scarlet-fever dress" for a fresh cambric, before coming near him. She had a vine whose name<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     103"/>he did not know, in her hand. She dropped it lightly over his shoulder; it floated down, and fell slowly; it was a delicate thing. She said,--</p><p>"Do you know too much about the spontaneous movements of plants? I have some books that you may like, when you are strong enough,--one of Darwin's especially. It is a subject that interests me greatly. I found this sensitive thing stepping straight over the shrubs and logs for a certain birch-tree it fancied, to climb there; it went as if it were frightened, or starved,--like a creature. It made me feel as if it had a nervous system, and that the lack is in us, not in it; we have not the eyes fine enough to find its ganglia, that is all"</p><p>"It seems to shrink from my touch, like a woman," said Yorke.</p><p>"It was so delicate, I thought you would like it," observed the doctor. " But come! I must send you back to bed. I will have your dinner brought in. You have been here twenty minutes too long." He went, peaceably enough. He felt ridiculously, vaguely, pitifully happy.</p><pb n="104"/>VI.EAST SHERMAN, as Mrs. Butterwell had not untruthfully observed, was a place lacking in "society." The people were miserably poor, and proportionally ignorant,--foreigners, largely: French and Irish lumbermen, and householders of the lesser sort, who raised cabbages, aspired to potatoes, and supported a theory, if not their families,--the theory being that they were farmers.</p><p>There are advantages in remoteness, solitude, and unlimited opportunity to appreciate nature, but advanced sanitary conditions are not, even in the State of Maine, necessarily among them. East Sherman raged with scarlet fever and diphtheria through that long July, and Doctor Zay had her expressive hands full. She was busy day and night. The exhausting rides of the country physician extended themselves through the neighboring towns, to disheartening lengths. Old Oak received the gray pony now regularly every day. The office bell rang to the verge of confusion. Handy, plunged in gloom, rolled out the phaeton at midnight, or waited vainly, deep through the<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     105"/>late summer twilights, for the "blessedest, best sound" of low wheels returning down the lonely road. Handy had one spot in the back yard, by the wood-pile, where he stood to exercise what might be called his mind upon the medical and moral subjects connected with his calling. He dug his foot--the right one always, and he took off his shoe for the purpose- spirally into the sawdust, a process not widely understood for its tendency to develop thought, and retired deeper than usual into his hats. He had two. The felt one was the bigger; he wore it altogether during the prevalence of the epidemic. Handy regarded the scarlet fever as a serious infliction, chiefly on horses, not to mention indirectly persons by occupation devoted to equine interests. He made unsuccessful attempts to explain this scientific theory to the doctor; but found her the slave of established medical prejudices, ot predisposing one to accept popular discoveries. When Handy was especially aggrieved, he alluded to his injury as "an Ananias 'n' Sapphiry shame." No one had ever traced the etymological derivation of this figure. One evening, as the clock was striking eight, Handy, having reached that depth of spiral action on the sawdust heap which expressed resignation, not as yet hope, expectation, or disappointment,<pb n="106     DOCTOR ZAY."/>and still as far from the pessimistic as it was from the optimistic view of life, found himself, like many a better and wiser soul that in facing duty wrests content from the teeth of despair, suddenly plunged into undreamed-of (but plainly deserved) delight.</p><p>The doctor was coming home.</p><p>"Some of 'em's better," observed Handy, wriggling out of the sawdust, and into his shoe, an artistic attitude which joggled his hat an inch or so lower than usual over his nose. "Or some of 'em's dead. Somebody's cured. Or somebody's killed. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't care which. Well, Doctor?"</p><p>"Don't water her for thirty-five minutes," said the doctor, throwing the reins over the dasher. "She's too warm."</p>     <p>"Gointerwanteragin?" asked Handy, in one agonized breath.</p><p>"Not to-night. Put her up. Have you fed Old Oak? Very well. That's all."</p><p>"Bobailey was after you 'safternoon. The Baileybabyswuss. 'Relse it's better. I forget. It's one or t'other. It always <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one or t'other," added Handy in an aggrieved tone. "Haintgoterseeitaginaveyer?",</p><p>The doctor did not answer Handy. If she had been a man, one would have said she strode by<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     107"/>him into the house. As it was, she had a long nervous, absorbed step, that Handy knew very well. He and the gray pony looked at each other with a confidential air through the twilight of the deserted back yard. "It's dead," said Handy, "ain't it?" He stroked the pony's chin. The horse returned the boy's gaze with soft, tired eyes, and seemed to nod.</p><p>"I thought so," said Handy. "You needn't tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> you ain't glad of it. Got your supper an hour sooner. Accommodatinbabywarntit?"</p><p>He leaned his face against the pony's, and whistled, as he led her to her stall, a polka made popular in Maine by the Sherman Brass Band. The horse and the boy went gayly into the barn together, cheek to cheek, as if they both belonged there. Suddenly Handy appeared in the barn door, and made a dive (chiefly over the flower beds) after the doctor's retreating figure. "Oh, I say, Doctor! I forgot! Hewantsyer, mostpartiklertoo. I've got too much to do to keep rememberin' <hi rend="italic">him</hi>," said Handy, with a look of disgust.</p><p>"What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the matter, Handy?" The doctor stopped, not without a touch of annoyance.</p><p>"Why, the fellar in the house. He's wuss,<pb n="108     DOCTOR ZAY."/>too. They're all wuss to-day," cried Handy, with professional glee. "It's one of our days. It's pretty much all wussness. We've got our hands full, I tell yer, younmenthehosses."</p><p>"But I went to see Mr. Yorke this morning," said Doctor Zay, rather to herself than to Handy. She pushed off her hat, and passed her hand over her forehead wearily. There was an irritable, almost a womanish accent in her voice; as if she would have said, "What <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> I do?" or, possibly, would have cried a little, if she had not been ashamed to. But only Handy heard her, and the gray pony, neighing through the barn door for her supper. Both of them discriminated finely, up to a certain point, in the doctor's tones; but she had passed that point.</p>                    <p>"Can't help that," said Handy; "yervegotergo. He said so."</p><p>She bathed, and changed her dress, and took her supper, before she obeyed Mr. Yorke's order; but she obeyed it. He was on the lounge in his room, in the familiar position, and the lamp was in the entry; she came through the half-light, towards him, against the Rembrandt-like background. He watched her in silence.</p><p>"Well?" she said, stopping before him. She made no movement to sit down. </p><pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     109"/><p>"Why, Doctor, you're cross!" said the young man, with an indefinably masculine touch in his tone; half frolic, half tenderness, as if be sported with her retreat, and put it aside as something not important to the case, or even as a thing which it might be in his power to overcome, if he chose. "Handy said you were worse, and needed me," replied the doctor, gravely. Plainly, she was not a woman to be meshed by these little nets.</p><p>"I did not tell Handy I was worse. But I do need you."</p><p>"So do many other people. If there are no new symptoms, Mr. Yorke"--</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">Symptoms!</hi>" breathed the patient, all but inaudibly. "There are new symptoms every day."</p><p>She made a nonchalant little gesture with one hand.</p><p>"If that is all,"--there was a very fine emphasis, too light to bear italics, too clear to pass unnoticed, upon the "that,"--"you will excuse me, to-night. I am - tired."</p><p>"Bring the light, please," said Yorke, with a change of manner. "No, sit down. I can do it myself. Take the easy-chair. No, take the lounge. I can sit up a few minutes perfectly well. I won't keep you more than a few minutes. Please! Why not? Where's the harm? How tired--how tired you are!"</p><pb n="110     DOCTOR ZAY."/>He had hobbled over, and brought the lamp: it was a little lantern, that he had made to swing upon his arm,--one of the contrivances of convalescence, the offspring of necessity, like all the great inventions of history; it had a Japanese paper shade. He stood leaning upon his crutches, looking down. She had silently taken the empty chair.</p><p>Doctor Zay had borne her epidemic superbly Her bloom had subsided a little, it is true, but only enough to increase the delicacy rather than detract from the vigor of her strong face. He had all along perceived in her a person practically supported by what we are accustomed to call, with the most imperfect apprehension of the phrase, scientific passion.</p><p>Against the strain of exhausted sympathy she had set the muscle of intellectual conquest. It could not be denied that in a certain sense the doctor enjoyed her terrible work. She gave out of herself, as if she possessed the life everlasting before her time. She had bread to eat that knew not of. He could not think of her as sinking, dejected, in need, ahungered. Her splendid health was like a god to her. She leaned against her own physical strength, as another woman might lean upon a man's. She had the repose of<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     111"/>her full mental activity. She had her dangerous and sacred feminine nerve under magnificent training. It was her servant, not her tyrant; her wealth, not her poverty; the source of her power, not the exponent of her weakness. She moved on her straight and narrow way between life and death, where one hysteric moment would be fatal, with a glorious poise. The young man acknowledged from the bottom of his heart that she was a balanced and beautiful creature. He had read of such women. He had never seen one. It was not without a thrill of reverence, amounting almost to awe, that he perceived, when he swung his fantastic little lantern full in her face, that she was undergoing some intense emotion, which, in almost any woman that he knew, would have weakened itself in vehement vocal expression.</p><p>"I had a letter from my mother," he began, "and I thought--it was about you--I had told her at last--and it was such a pleasant letter. I meant to read it to you. She sends a long message to you, I really am not such a brute as I seem. I thought perhaps it would amuse you. Doctor Zay, I had no more idea you were so overworked than I had that you were"-- He broke<pb n="112"/>"I never <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> yo look so!" he murmured, with rebellious, almost affectionate anxiety. "It's not easy when you've done so much for him, for a man to look on, like a woman, this way. Isn't there anything I can do? If you would stay a while, I could read to you. We will send for Mrs. Butterwell, if you would rather. I could do some. thing, I know I could! Just let me try."</p><p>"You cannot help me," she said, gently enough. Nobody can. I have lost a patient."</p><p>Yorke was on the point of crying, "Is that all?" but saved himself in time, and only said,--</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p>"The little Bailey baby. It was doing so well,--out of danger. The mother took it over to a neighbor's. You cannot conceive the ignorance and recklessness that we have to manage. She took the child out, like an express bundle, rolled in her shawl. Coming home, it got wet in that shower. I had ceased to visit there every day; they did not send at once,--I suppose every doctor makes these excuses for himself; what would become of as, if we couldn't?--but when I got there, I could not do anything. The little thing died at half past seven."</p><p>She sat looking straight befor her at the Japanese lantern. Yorke felt that the personality of<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     113"/>the red and purple paper men on it came as near her at that moment as his. He could not think of anything to say which would not present the edge of an intrusion upon an experience so far without the pale of his own. The young man's imagination was well stocked with comfortable material for the lesser sympathies. If she had lost a steamer to Liverpool, or a ticket for a Christmas oratorio, or a picture bidden for in the last great art craze, he could have comforted her. She had lost only a miserable child out of a beggarly home. What could he say?</p><p>"I don't believe every baby in Sherman is worth your looking like that!" he cried, with an impulse whose only virtue lay in its honesty. He really perceived that something more than scientific pride was hurt in Doctor Zay. He felt, with a kind of senseless triumph, which he put aside to analyze by and by, that he had found the woman in the doctor.</p><p>"It was a dear little thing," she said, softly, "and fond of me. I had always taken care of it, ever since it was born. It was just beginning to talk. It wasn't a big, noisy baby, like the rest of the family. It is terrible that a child should die,--terrible! It ought never to happen. There is no excuse for it. I can never be reconciled to it!"</p>           <p>8</p><pb n="114     DOCTOR ZAY."/>She rose impetuously, and left him without another word. The patient looked after her. She had forgotten him, He and the paper men regarded each other. It was not for them to help her in her trouble. She went across the entry, and on into her own rooms, and he heard the door shut. Only one patient rang the office bell that night. He was glad she was left to herself. Mr. and Mrs. Butterwell came in. They too, were much moved by the doctor's grief. They all sat together in the sick-room, and mourned about that baby as if it had been one of the family.</p><p>"It's always just so," said Mrs. Butterwell, wiping her eye. "She hasn't lost but two patients since she eame to Sherman,--except old Father Foxy, that nobody counts; for the Lord himself couldn't have saved <hi rend="italic">him</hi>,--eighty-seven, and drunk since he was seventeen. The Sherman Temperance Lodge used him for a warning in good and regular standing, till he got to be about fifty, he kept such excellent health; and sixty, then they fought shy of him; and seventy, but didn't die and when he came to be eighty they gave him up as a bad argument. But there! It <hi rend="italic">kills</hi> Doctor Zay to lose a patient. I never saw anybody mind anything so. She acts as if she'd murdered 'em. You'll see! She'll be all but down sick over<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     115"/>this. She'd better take it as a blessin'. I would. Those Baileys have got seven now, and poor as Job's Monday dinners. I tell you, Providence knows what he's about, if folks don't. He will drown the extra kittens, when he can. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> say he ought to be thanked to mercy for it. But we never do. We up and blame him, the more fools we!"</p><p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">Sar</hi>-ah!" said Mr. Butterwell, placidly.</p><p>Upon the sill of the open window, during the unwonted domestic excitement of that summer evening, a felt hat with a boy under it had sympathetically and prudently reposed. Nobody minded Handy. He looked in and out unnoticed, with wide-apart, dumb eyes, like the pony. Sometimes Yorke wondered dimly if anybody had fed and watered him; but even that was an intellectual effort disproportionate to the proposition. It was a long time since the doctor had lost a patient. Handy regarded it as an epoch in human history. He felt that the event reflected importance upon himself, who might be said to have had a share in the glory of the circumstance. He felt above the company of the pony and Old Oak that night; and though the bosom of the family, as expressed by the window-sill, was a little hard, there is a compensatory pleasure in finding one's social level.<pb n="116     DOCTOR ZAY."/>Handy remained there, after Mr. and Mrs. Butterwell had gone. It seemed to him that this lame gentleman encroached somewhat upon his (Handy's) rights in exhibiting so much interest in that dead baby. That was a professional matter mainly between himself and the doctor.</p><p>Mr. Yorke, left alone, after a few moments' thought, bent his head upon the top of his crutch, sitting quite still. The red and purple light of the Japanese gentlemen on the little lantern, flashed and defined his profile. Handy vaguely resented its expression. The old felt hat slipped softly from the window-sill, and betook itself confidently to the doctor's side of the house. The office door was open to the warm night. Handy peeked. He peeked without a qualm. He regarded it as one of his privileges to follow the doctor's private career. Who had as good a right?</p><p>Doctor Zay was sitting by her office table. A half-open drawer showed surgical instruments. Rows of vials exhibited mysteries of white pellets and powders. Medical books lay open underneath her hat and gloves, which she had tossed down on coming in. But Handy regarded these points with the apathy of familiarity. The environment did not interest this scientific child, Dootor Zay who drove the fastest horse in Sherman, who al-<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     117"/> ways knew by an awful omniscience whether you missed a pailful or shook the oat-measure; Doctor Zay, who had got old Doctor Adoniram's practice half away from him; <hi rend="italic">Handy's</hi> Doctor Zay, was bent and bowed over her office tabe, her face crushed into her resolute hands, as if she had been stricken down by a power that no man could see.</p><p>If Handy's education had progressed a little farther he would have called this a phenomenon. As it was, he could only say,--</p><p>"It's a thunderin' Ananias 'n' Sapphiry shame. Nothin' but a Bailey baby!"</p><p>It occurred to Handy, as he walked sadly away, over the heavy wet heads of the dover-tops, beak to the sawdust heap by the wood-pile, that perhaps he had peeped as far for that one night as the perquisites of his calling allowed.</p><p>"Two of 'em," reflected Handy. "Heads down, like unlucky coppers. One on his crutch. T'other on her learnin.' Bobailey 'n' all his tribe ain't wuth it."</p><p>Handy was confusedly jealous of something. He imagined it was Bob Bailey.</p><p>The doctor was called out that night to see a poor girl, three miles away. Handy accompanied her. As they drove through the chilly dawn alone<pb n="118     DOCTOR ZAY."/>together, Handys emotions waxed mighty within him.</p><p>"Doctor?" he said, in a pleasant confidential way.</p><p>"Well, Handy?"</p><p>"Is Mr. Yorke wuss?"</p><p>"Why, no, Handy."</p><p>"Ain't wrong in his head or nothin,' is he?"</p><p>"Oh, no, Handy."</p><p>"Well. I didn't know. While you was takin' on so about the Baileybaby, he flopped over on them Bangor crutches, and says he, 'Poor girl!' He says it out loud. I heern him. Now, you know, you <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> a girl; you 're a <hi rend="italic">doctor</hi>. I thought may be he was a mite loony, and we'd ought to look after him. Do you keep any medicine for loons, Doctor?"</p><p>She made her call, as usual, the next morning; a very short one. Yorke had hoped he knew not what, he knew not why, from it; she left him only his powders and his disappointment. It was impossible to draw her within telescopic sweep of a personality. She had seemed near to him in that outburst of grief, last night, as if some kindly or friendly impulse in her reached out its hands to him; precisely by the width of that impulse was she now removed. He had his day's orders from<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     119"/>his doctor; nothing more. She looked, as Mrs. Butterwell had prophesied, really ill. He thought of her; he thought of her till he was ashamed to think how long it was since he had thought of anything else. The terrible leisure of invalidism gaped, a gulf, and filled itself with her. If he could have arisen like a man, and bridged it, or like a hero, and leaped into it, she would never, he said to himself doggedly, have this exquisite advantage over him. He lay there like a woman, reduced from activity to endurance, from resolve to patience, while she amassed her importance to him,--how idly!--like gold that she gave herself no trouble to count.</p><p>He was surprised that night at receiving a second visit; but his momentary gratification quickly spent itself. Her errand was to inform him that she should not come again.</p><p>"I do not understand you, Doctor Lloyd," said the young man, with an effort at composure; his breath shortened, and he felt dizzy and faint.</p><p>"Oh, I mean, if you are able, won't you come to the office?" she answered wearily. "I am preoccupied, and begin wrong end foremost. I do not mean to neglect you. But I really think you able to get around to my door. The air and exercise will be beneficial to you. There is no reason<pb n="120     DOCTOR ZAY."/>for my coming to you so often. You can take the morning hour, from eight to nine, or the one at noon, as you prefer."</p><p>She gave that slight and fine emphasis of hers to the word "reason."</p><p>"This means that I am not to see you--here--any longer?"</p><p>"Not unless it is necessary."</p><p>"Suppose I find it necessary, Doctor Lloyd?"</p><p>"I must be the judge of that, Mr. Yorke."</p><p>"Very well," said Yorke, after a moment's thought, "I will come to your office to-morrow."</p><p>He went. He stumped around on the Bangor crutches over the piazza to the office door, which set forth the legend "Z. A. Lloyd, M. D.," in modest little letters of gray and gold. The reception-room was partly full. Five or six women sat there, and a child or two; one man, a lumberman, who said Puella said she wanted more powders for that crookedness in her mind. Another man came, while Yorke waited, with what he called an "order" for an immediate call on his wife. Doctor Zay nodded to Yorke pleasantly when she came out, but did not speak. He perceived that he was to bide his turn, like any other patient. The doctor said, "Next?" as if they had been children at school. She was abstracted and pale. She had<pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     121"/>that look of application which failed of being beautiful. The reception-room was rather pleasant It was clear that the young lady furnished her own part of the house. Yorke took in an idle, luxurious sense of familiar photographs and even a high art carpet. There were flowers all over the room, and a table covered with books and periodicals for the patients. Some of the women were reading. He took up yesterday's Boston Advertiser, and hid his amusement, if not his embarrassment behind it.</p><p>Presently he realized that they had all gone. Doctor Zay stood waiting for him, gravely. He followed her into the office; a tiny room, hardly more than a generous closet. She shut the door, and motioned him to a chair. She took her own at the desk where the vials were. Her ledger and note-book, and one or two volumes of Materia Medica, were lying about. The office, he saw at once, was lined from floor to ceiling with book-cases, all full. The doctor waited a moment, as if for him to begin his daily report. He did not. She raised her eyes quickly to his face, and that sensitive change he liked so much crossed her own. Then, for the first time, he saw signs of embarrassment in her. She colored a little, and he smiled<pb n="122     DOCTOR ZAY."/>"Really, Doctor," he said, " do you think this is an improvement?"</p><p>She hesitated before she answered: "Really, I--don't know."</p><p>"Keeping me here among all those ladies,--the only fellow, except Puella's. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> didn't stay by me long. I think, for my own part, it was much better in my room."</p><p>"Perhaps it was," she admitted, "but"--</p><p>"But you don't want to come any longer?"</p><p>"Frankly, Mr. Yorke, no."</p><p>"Then you sha'n't. I won't be more disagreeable than I must. I will come to the office, as you wish. But why cannot I have a separate hour, after the women are gone? It seems to me it would be quite as pleasant, and much less "--he, too hesitated before adding, "noticeable."</p><p>"I hardly know," said Doctor Zay, knitting her brows. "There are no precedents, exactly." He had never seen her irresolute before. She looked fatigued and annoyed. "There are new questions constantly arising," she went on, " for a woman inmy position. One ceases to be an individual. One acts for the whole,--for the sex, for a cause, for a future. We are not quite free, like other people, in little perplexities. It is what Paul said about no man's living to himself. We pay a price <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     123"/>for our privilege. I suppose everything in this world renders its cost, but nothing so heavily, nothing so relentlessly, as an unusual purpose in a woman. Nothing is more expensive than sustained usefulness,--or what one tries to make such. I hate to think of petty things!" she added, with some fire.</p><p>"Then don't!" urged the young man. "I cannot see the need of it, in a case like yours. You are an antidote to pettiness. You eat it out, like a swift and beautiful vitriol. You would make us all ashamed of it. It cannot exist where you are. I felt that in you the first time I saw you. And pretense,--I had got so tired of pretense. You went on your way so simply. You were so <hi rend="italic">thorough</hi>. I said, There is a trained woman. She is honest all through. She has the modesty of knowledge. I thought all this while you were tying that artery, before I fainted. What a faint that was!"</p><p>"You overestimate me, Mr. Yorke," said the doctor, rather distantly. And yet he was sure that he had not displeased her.</p><p>"I have sometimes wondered," he went on, with an awkward courage, "what you thought of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, the first time you saw me. I dare say you couldn't remember. I don't presume, believe me, that it was of so much importance."</p><pb n="124     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"Oh, yes, I remember perfectly," said Doctor Zay, laughing. "I thought, Concussion and dislocation! Possibly a fine compound fracture. I have never had a compound fracture. I've always wanted one."</p><p>"And I have always thought, always maintained, that the scientific temperament is the hardest among civilized types. 'He broke himself against that flint,' I heard said once of a sensitive man, in a miserable instance,--it happened to be a marriage, but that doesn't affect the point. One comes upon such a nature as against the glacial period: it solidifies against you; it never bends nor shatters"--</p><p>"Nor melts?" she asked, smiling (he could see) out of pure mischief.</p><p>"In the course of ages, I suppose. Too late to be of practical service. One freezes in the process."</p><p>"The best thing that could happen!" she said quickly.</p><p>A white light darted over the young man's face, and passed. He was a remarkably fine-looking fellow in these swift pallors. He shook himself, as if to shake his weakness off.</p> <p>"Come, Doctor,"  he said, lightly enough. "Tell me! Was that all you thought when I  fell into your remorseless hands?"</p> <pb n="DOCTOR ZAY.     125"/><p>"No," she said gravely and gently. "I thought--His mother would not know him."</p><p>"Was I so hideous?"</p><p>"Yes, you were badly mangled."</p><p>"Well, I am even with you. That first time you touched me, I thought I was in hell."</p><p>"Yes, sir; you made the fact quite evident, particularly when I set the ankle."</p><p>"And now," he said, leaning his head back in the office chair, and dreamily regarding her across the little distance that separated them,--"now I am in"--</p>                                       <p>The doctor looked at her watch, and moved back her chair.</p><p>"I have spent fifteen minutes on you!" she said, in a tone of vexation too genuine to be mistaken by the blindest feeling for a freak of feminine coyness. "So long out of this short morning! And I have thirty-two calls to make before supper. Continue the remedy that you have, till to-morrow. Then call on me again,--here. Come at noon; the office will not be so full, then. You may be a little late, if you like. You may come to me twice a week, now, for an office call. If you need extra attention,-- but I do not think you will,--I will call on you, as formerly. You must excuse me now."</p><pb n="126     DOCTOR ZAY."/><p>"Twice a <hi rend="italic">week!</hi>" cried the patient. She made him no answer, rag her bell for Handy, and putting on her feathered hat, walked rapidly away.</p><p>Yorke sat in the office a few minutes where she had left him; he looked confusedly about. It seemed to him that he was taking her up in new and unknown conditions, like the second volume of a novel. He turned the leaves with a dull uneasiness. Something in him urged, "Throw the book down!" He searched his soul for power to arise and do so. He found there only a great compulsion, as silent and as terrible as the thread in the hand of Lachesis, which he knew would bind him down to read on to the end.</p>           <pb n="127"/>VII.HE did not go at noon. It occurred to him inthe morning that he was well enough to wait tillthe evening office. He dreamed away his day onthe piazza, watching her as she went and came;lost in admiration of his own self-restraint, and ina nebulous impression that it was time to takematters into a more strictly masculine control.She did not come home till eight o'clock. TheJuly twilight was already deepening down,Handy came up from the depths of the sawdustheap and retired from public life with Old Oak;the doctor went to her supper; and Yorke gotaround into the reception-room, and waited forher in the dusk. No other patients were there.Roses were in the room somewhere,- he couldnot see them. The folds of the long muslin cur-tains drifted in the warm wind. The rows ofbooks in the office, seen through the open door,looked fuller for the darkness. Beyond them, an.other door led into the doctor's private parlor. Hehad heard Mrs. Butterwell say that her lodger hadthree rooms below (" two and a half," Mrs. But-<pb n="128"/>128             DOCTOB ZAY. terwell called them), and one up-stairs.  Thisother door was half open, swinging idly on its hinges in the perfumed air. He sat and watchedit till she came in. It did not open; it would notshut.She did not see him at first, and he admired the fine unconsciousness of her movements as she crossed the rooms. She lighted her German stu-dent lamp on the office table, and, pulling a for-midable professional book towards her, without a.moment's irresolution, plunged into its contentswith the headlong dash which only an absorbingintellectual passion gives. She leaned her head,upon her hand, with her controlled profile towardshim, while she read. He contrasted this little actcruelly with his invalid reveries.A woman who say8, "My life is too full to haveneed of you," will be met by the historic masou-line privilege of reply, "You take the trouble to' mention it. I reserve the benefit of the doubt.Doctor Zay took the trouble to mention nothing.The young man had seen for himself what all thelittle feminine protest in the world could neverhave made patent to his imagination: a womanabsorbed in her business, to whom a man must bethe accident, not the substance, of thought.He rose at once, and made her aware of hi<pb n="129"/>DOCTOR ZATs             19preence. She expressed the slight superfieialsurprise of a preoccupied person, whose life bringsher in constant contact with the unexpected. Shemet him very cordially. He vaguely felt that sheapproved of him for staying away half a day longerthan was necessary. He limped over to the offiechair. She shut the door, and he surrendered him-self to the brief medical consultation. She found itnecessary to examine the injured foot, upon whichshe laid for a moment her vital, healing touch,( You would get on much faster if this foot couldbe properly treated every day, Mr. Yorke. Thereis not a masage rubber short of Bangor. Youneed one now. You have reached the stage whereI should recommend it decidedly. I am sorry."Yorke made no .reply; he dared not, he was sosure that he should say something unetpeeted tohimself and annoying to her; and she brought theconsultation to an end. As he went away shetold him that she desired him to ride the next day.His ankle, she thought, would bear the motion,-one of the last experiments before walking, - andhe would have a driver, of course. She gave theorder lightly, the means by which it was to beobeyed not being the physician's concern."I should like it,4- all things," said Yorlk, im-pilivy, " if I ma.

He did not try to talk much.. 'He absorbedher idly, as he did returning life and the throbbingday. He had never been beside her for so longbefore.

But when they drove over that bridge whence the Bangor pony had plunged to his last account, the young maigrew respectfully grave.

Yorke observed with admiration his praoeticed step upon the slippery logs which floated,chained, over the deep, black pool.Doctor Zay drove to the foot of the hill, andstopped. She would leave him in the shade, shesaid, and walk up to her patient's; it was but astep. Yorke made no protest. He had long sincelearned that it was hopeless to argue with his phy*sician. He sat and rested in the green coolness,till she returned.She was gone about twenty minutes, and cameout abstracted and stern. She did not speak atfirst, or take the reins, but sat still, with a twitohing of all the delicate facial muscles which inother women would have meant a shower of tearsor a tornado of anger." Well ?" asked Yorke, conscious how imbecilethe monosyllable sounded, but not daring to addanother."She has just told me who it is that is toblame I" said the physician in a low, surchargedvoice.Yorke uttered a sympathetic Bjaculation, as hermeaning flashed upon him.

Alas! what -could have so betrayed to him the gulf betweenher dedicated life and his own ?"I have tried for some time to learn," said the doctor, with unwonted agitation.

It camefrom the mill-pond, whose dam frowned over theirheads. The thin cascade of the falls drooped likelace against the wall of stone. The trees gatheredclose about the water, and Yorke looked up to thesky, as out of a well. He could see nothing else.The cry died in a gurgling sound. Yorke sprang,putting the woman by; he forgot her." Mr. Yorke, stay just where you are!

She was already out of his sight, byhind the saw-mill The next instant, as he droverlashing the pony, he saw her run swiftly out uponthe chained logs above the dam. He closed hi^eye. She poised herself like a chamois. He sawher sink upon her knees, -had she slipped ? Hisbreath came fast and feeble. The road darkenedbefore him, and the forest whirled.        -"( Am I going to do such a lady-like thing as t' faint ? " thought the sick man. He fixed his eyesfiercely upon the blue reins, -they seemed to retmain knotted in his fingers; he had a vision        |the flying road, of the sudden sun, of dashing dowupon a group of men, of seeing figures dart, o ry answering to cry; and his next precise impres|sion was that he had been sitting in the bottom aotat phaeton, with his head on the cushions, longer'than he supposed. He was alone, by the barn shqespoke of. All the men were gone. He gathered         Ihis soul together, and drove back as he had come.A cluster of men hung on the bank above thedam. A motionless figure lay on the ground inthe centre of the group. For in instant Yorkecould see nothing distinctly. " Turn him over I" rang out a clear, sweet, imperious voice. "No, not so.

The trickle of the fall fell cheer-fully over the dam." Tompkins, you here I" came the word of cornmmand, in that calm, refined voice. " Work at hisfeet, as I bade you. Keep the arms, Jenley.

Forty. Forty-one-two -three. Forty-four minutes.A low, awed whisper began to rustle through the group. Some of the men dropped on their knees. One ran towards the house.

The longforest, with its procession of pine outlines, cut thehorizon. The heavy mists of the Maine eveningrose from the little river and the mill-ponds. Thisfog caught fire, and the village seemed to staggerin it.

The l1of life in this poor place, its denial, its desolatenescame to his consciousness with the vividness andtremorselessness of personal fate.

There were flowers, too. The lampshad green and yellow globes. There were manypillows in the room, of odd shapes, and all sorts ofhospitable things to sit on; an open fire-place,filled now with ferns: yet nothing seemed to be areproduction of a fashionable craze.

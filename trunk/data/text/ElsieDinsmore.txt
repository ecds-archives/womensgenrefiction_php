<pb n="7 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>Chapter first.I never saw an eye so bright,And yet so soft as hers;It sometimes swam in liquid light,And sometimes swam in tears;It seemed a beauty set apartFor softness and for sighs."-MRS.WELBY<p>The school-room at Roselands was a very pleasant apartment; the ceiling, it is true, was somewhat lower than in the more modern portion of the building, for the wing in which it was situated dated back to the old-fashioned days prior to the Revolution, while the larger part of the mansion had not stood more than twenty or thirty years; but the effect was relieved by windows reaching from floor to ceiling, and opening on a veranda which overlooked a lovely flower-garden, beyond which were fields and woods and hills. The view from the veranda was very beautiful, and the room itself looked most inviting, with its neat matting, its windows draped with snow-white muslin, its comfortable chairs, and pretty rosewood desks.</p><p>Within this pleasant apartment sat Miss Day* [proofreader comment replace misprint v with y?] with<pb n="8 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>her pupils, six in number. She was giving a lesson to Enna, the youngest, the spoiled darling of the family*[proofreader comment replace incomplete letter f], the pet and plaything of both father and mother*[proofreader comment replace incomplete letter m]. It was always a trying task to both teacher and scholar, for Enna was very wilful, and her teacher's patience by no means inexhaustible.</p><p>"There !" exclaimed Miss Day, shutting the book and giving it an impatient toss on to the desk; " go, for I might as well try to teach old Bruno. I presume he would learn about as fast."</p><p>And Enna walked away with a pout on her pretty face, muttering that she would " tell mamma."</p><p>"Young ladies and gentlemen," said Miss Day, looking at her watch, "I shall leave you to your studies for an hour; at the end of which time I shall return to hear your recitations, when those who have attended properly to their duties will be permitted to ride out with me to visit the fair."</p><p>"Oh! that will be jolly! " exclaimed Arthur, a bright-eyed, mischief-loving boy of ten.</p><p>" Hush !" said Miss Day sternly; " let me hear no more such exclamations; and remember that you will not go unless your lessons are thoroughly learned. Louise and Lora," addressing two young girls of the respective ages of twelve and fourteen, " that French exercise must be perfect, and your English lessons as well. Elsie," to a little girl of eight, sitting alone at a desk near one of the windows, and bending over a slate with an appearance of great industry, "every figure of that example must be correct, your geography<pb n="9 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>lesson recited perfectly, and a page in your copy-book written without a blot."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am," said the child meekly, raising a pair of large soft eyes of the darkest hazel for an instant to her teacher's face, and then dropping them again upon her slate.</p><p>"And see that none of you leave the room until I*[proofreader comment incomplete I appears in original] return," continued the governess. "Walter, if you miss one word of that spelling, you will have to stay at home and learn it over." </p><p>"Unless mamma interferes, as she will be pretty sure to do," muttered Arthur, as the door closed on Miss Day, and her retreating footsteps were heard passing down the hall.</p><p>For about ten minutes after her departure, all was quiet in the school-room, each seemingly completely absorbed in study. But at the end of that time Arthur sprang up, and, flinging his book across the room, exclaimed, "There! I know my lesson; and if I didn't, I shouldn't study another bit for old Day, nor Night either."</p><p>"Do be quiet, Arthur," said his sister Louise; "I can't*[proofreader comment c not completely formed in original] study in such a racket."</p><p>Arthur stole on tiptoe across the room, and coming up behind Elsie, tickled the back of her neck with a feather.</p><p>She started, saying in a pleading tone, "Please, Arthur, don't."</p><p>"It pleases me to do," he said, repeating the experiment.</p><pb n="10 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>Elsie changed her position, saying in the same gentle, persuasive tone, "O Arthur! <hi rend="italic">please</hi> let me alone, or I never shall be able to do this example."</p><p>" What! all this time on one example! you ought to be ashamed. Why, I could have done it half a dozen times over."</p><p>"I have been over and over it," replied the little girl in a tone of despondency, "and still there are two figures that will not come right."</p><p>" How do you know they are not right, little puss?" shaking her curls as he spoke.</p><p>" Oh! please, Arthur, don't pull my hair. I have the answer--that's the way, I know."</p><p>"Well then, why don't you just set the figures down? I would."</p><p>" Oh! no, indeed; that would not be honest."</p><p>"Pooh! nonsense! nobody would be the wiser, nor the poorer."</p><p>"No, but it would be just like telling a lie. But I can never get it right while you are bothering me so," said Elsie, laying her slate aside in despair. Then taking out her geography, she began studying most diligently. But Arthur continued his persecutions--tickling her, pulling her hair, twitching the book out of her hand, and talking almost incessantly, making remarks, and asking questions; till at last Elsie said, as if just ready to cry, "Indeed, Arthur, if you don't let me alone, I shall never be able to get my lessons."</p><p>"Go away*[proofreader comment replace misprint v with y?] then    take your*[proofreader comment replace misprint v with y?] book out on the ve-<pb n="11 ELSIE DINSMORE/>randa, and learn your lessons there," said Louise. "I'll call you when Miss Day comes."</p><p>"Oh! no, Louise, I cannot do that, because it would be disobedience," replied Elsie, taking out her writing materials*[proofreader comment replace misprint n with m?].</p><p>Arthur stood over her criticising every letter she made, and finally jogged her elbow in such a way as to cause her to drop all the ink in her pen upon the paper, making quite a large blot.</p><p>"Oh!" cried the little girl, bursting into tears, "now I shall lose my ride, for Miss Day will not let me go; and I was so anxious to see all those beautiful flowers."</p><p>Arthur, who was really not very vicious, felt some compunctions when he saw the mischief he had done. "Never mind, Elsie," said he, "I can fix it yet. Just let me tear out this page, and you can begin again on the next, and I'll not bother you. I'll make these two figures come right too," he added, taking up her slate.</p><p>"Thank you, Arthur," said the little girl, smiling through her tears; " you are very kind, but it would not*[proofreader comment misprint n corrected?] be honest to do either, and I had rather stay at home*[proofreader comment misprint h corrected?] than be deceitful."</p><p>"Very well, miss," said he, tossing his head, and walking away, "since you won't let me help you*[proofreader comment replace misprint v with y?], it is all your own fault if you have to stay at home.[proofreader comment replace misprint c with h?]"</p><p>"Elsie," exclaimed Louise, "I have no patience with you! such ridiculous scruples as you are alwaysB*<pb n="12 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>raising. I shall not pity you one bit, if you are obliged to stay at home."</p><p>Elsie made no reply, but, brushing away a tear, bent over her writing, taking great pains with ever*[proofreader comment y missing] letter, though saying sadly to herself all the time, "It's of no use, for that great ugly blot will spoil it all."</p><p>She finished her page, and, excepting the unfortunate blot, it all looked very neat indeed, showing plainly that it had been written with great care. She then took up her slate and patiently went over and over every figure of the troublesome example, trying to discover where her mistake had been. But much time had been lost through Arthur's teasing, and her mind was so disturbed by the accident to her writing that she tried in vain to fix it upon the business in hand; and before the two troublesome figures had been made right, the hour was past and Miss Day returned*[proofreader comment r misprint]. </p><p>"Oh!" thought Elsie, "if she will only hear the others first, I may be able to get this and the geography ready yet; and perhaps, if Arthur will be generous enough to tell her about the blot, she may excuse*[proofreader comment correct e misprint?] me for it." </p><p>But it was a vain hope. Miss Day had no sooner seated herself at her desk, than she called, "Elsie, come here and say that lesson; and bring your copy-book and slate, that I may examine your work."</p><p>Elsie tremblingly obeyed.</p><p>The lesson, though a difficult one, was very tolera<pb n="13 ELSIE DINSMORE."/> bly recited; for Elsie, knowing Arthur's propensity for teasing, had studied it in her own room before school hours. But Miss Day handed back the book with a frown, saying, " I told you the recitation must be perfect, and it was not."</p><p>She was always more severe with Elsie than with any other of her pupils.  The reason the reader will probably be able to divine ere long.</p><p>"There are two incorrect figures in this example," said she, laying down the slate, after glancing over its contents. Then taking up the copy-book, she exclaimed, "Careless, disobedient child! did I not caution you to be careful not to blot your book? There will be no ride for you this morning. You have failed in everything. Go to your seat. Make that example right, and do the next; learn your geography lesson over, and write another page in your copy-book; and mind, if there is a blot on it, you will get no dinner."</p><p>Weeping and sobbing, Elsie took up her books and obeyed.</p><p>During this scene Arthur stood at his desk pretending to study, but glancing every now and then at Elsie, with a conscience evidently ill at ease. She cast an imploring glance at him, as she returned to her seat; but he turned away his head, muttering, "It's all her own fault, for she wouldn't let me help her."</p><p>As he looked up again, he caught his sister Lora's eyes fixed on him with an expression of scorn andB* 2<p><pb n="14 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>contempt. He colored violently, and dropped his upon his book.</p><p>"Miss Day," said Lora, indignantly, " I see Arthur does not mean to speak, and as I cannot bear to see such injustice, I must tell you that it is all his fault that Elsie has failed in her lessons; for she tried her very best, but he teased her incessantly, and also jogged her elbow and made her spill the ink on her book; and to her credit she was too honorable to tear out the leaf from her copybook, or to let him make her example right; both which he very generously proposed doing after causing all the mischief."</p><p>" Is this so, Arthur," asked Miss Day, angrily.</p><p>The boy hung his head, but made no reply.</p><p>"Very well, then," said Miss Day, "you too must stay at home."</p><p>"Surely," said Lora, in surprise, "you will not keep Elsie, since I have shown you that she was not to*[proofreader comment correct misprint t] blame."</p><p>"Miss Lora," replied her teacher haughtily, "I wish you to understand that I am not to be dictated to by my pupils."</p><p>Lora bit her lip, but said nothing, and Miss Day went on hearing the lessons without further remark</p><p>In the mean time the little Elsie sat at her desk, striving to conquer the feelings of anger and indignation that were swelling in her breast; for Elsie, though she possessed much of "the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit," was not yet perfect, and often had a fierce contest with her naturally quick temper. Yet<pb n="15 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>it was seldom, very seldom that word or tone or look betrayed the existence of such feelings; and it was a common remark in the family that Elsie had no spirit.</p><p>The recitations were scarcely finished when the door opened and a lady entered dressed for a ride.</p><p>"Not through yet, Miss Day?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes, madam, we are just done," replied the teacher, closing the French grammar and handing it to Louise.</p><p>"Well, I hope your pupils have all done their duty this morning, and are ready to accompany us to the fair," said Mrs. Dinsmore. "But what is the matter with Elsie?"</p><p>"She has failed in all her exercises, and therefore has been told that she must remain at home," replied Miss Day with heightened color and in a tone of anger; "and as Miss Lora tells me that Master Arthur was partly the cause, I have forbidden him also to accompany us."</p><p>"Excuse me, Miss Day, for correcting you," said Lora, a little indignantly; " but I did not say <hi rend="italic">partly</hi>,for I am sure it was <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> his fault."</p><p>"Hush, hush, Lora," said her mother, a little impatiently; "how can you be sure of any such thing? Miss Day, I must beg of you to excuse Arthur this once, for I have quite set my heart on taking him along.' He is fond of mischief, I know, but he is only a child, and you must not be too hard upon him."</p><p>"Very well, madam," replied the governess stiffly<pb n="16 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>"you have of course the best right to control your own children."</p><p>Mrs. Dinsmore turned to leave the room.</p><p>"Mamma," asked Lora, "is not Elsie to be allowed to go too?"</p><p>"Elsie is not my child, and I have nothing to say about it. Miss Day, who knows all the circumstances, is much better able than I to judge whether or no*[proofreader comment t appears to be missing on not]she is deserving of punishment," replied Mrs. Dinsmore, sailing out of the room.</p><p>"You will let her go, Miss Day?" said Lora, inquiringly.</p><p>"Miss Lora," replied Miss Day, angrily, "I have already told you I was not to be dictated to. I have said Elsie must remain at home, and I shall not break my word."</p><p>"Such injustice!" muttered Lora, turning away.</p><p>"Lora," said Louise, impatiently, "why need you concern yourself with Elsie's affairs? for my part, I have no pity for her, so full as she is of nonsensical scruples."</p><p>Miss Day crossed the room to where Elsie was sitting leaning her head upon the desk, struggling hard to keep down the feelings of anger and indignation aroused by the unjust treatment she had received.</p><p>"Did I not order you to learn that lesson over?" said the governess, "and why are you sitting here idling?"</p><p>Elsie dared not speak lest her anger should show<pb n="17 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>itself in words; so she merely raised her head, and hastily brushing away her tears, opened the book. But Miss Day, who was irritated by Mrs. Dinsmore's interference, and also by the consciousness that she was acting unjustly, seemed determined to vent her displeasure upon her innocent victim.</p><p>"Why do you not speak?" she exclaimed, seizing Elsie by the arm and shaking her violently. "Answer me this instant. Why have you been idling all the morning?"</p><p>"I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>," replied the child hastily, stung to the quick by her unjust violence. 'I have tried hard to do my duty, and you are punishing me when I don't deserve it at all."</p><p>"How dare you? there! take that for your impertinence," said Miss Day, giving her a box on the ear.</p><p>Elsie was about to make a still more angry reply, but she restrained herself, and turning to her book, tried to study, though the hot, blinding tears came so thick and fast that she could not see a letter.</p><p>"De carriage am waiting, ladies, an' missus in a hurry," said a servant, opening the door; and Miss Day hastily quitted the room, followed by Louise and Lora; and Elsie was left alone.</p><p>She laid down the geography, and opening her desk, she took out a small pocket Bible, which bore the marks of frequent use. She turned over the leaves as though seeking for some particular passage at length she found it, and wiping away the blindingpb n="18 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>tears, she read these words in a low, murmuring tone:</p><p>"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps."</p><p>"Oh! I have not done it. I did not take it patiently. I am afraid I am not following in His steps," she cried, bursting into an agony of tears and sobs.</p><p>"My dear little girl, what is the matter?" asked a kind voice, and a soft hand was gently laid on her shoulder.</p><p>The child looked up hastily. "0 Miss Allison!" she said, "is it you? I thought I was quite alone."</p><p>"And so you were, my dear, until this moment," replied the lady, drawing up a chair, and sitting down close beside her. "I was on the veranda, and hearing sobs, came in to see if I could be of any assistance. You look very much distressed; will you not tell me the cause of your sorrow?"</p><p>Elsie answered only by a fresh burst of tears.</p><p>"They have all gone to the fair and left you at home alone; perhaps to learn a lesson you have failed in reciting?" said the lady, inquiringly.</p><p>"Yes.*[proofreader comment replace period with a comma?] ma'am," said the child; "but that is not the<pb n="19 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>worst;" and her tears fell faster, as she laid the little Bible on the desk, and pointed with her finger to the words she had been reading. "Oh!" she sobbed, "I--I did not do it; I did not bear it patiently. I was treated unjustly, and punished when I was not to blame, and I grew angry. Oh! I'm afraid I shall never be like Jesus! never, never."</p><p>The child's distress seemed very great, and Miss Allison was extremely surprised. She was a visitor who had been in the house only a few days, and, herself a devoted Christian, had been greatly pained by the utter disregard of the family in which she was sojourning for the teachings of God's word. Rose Allison was from the North, and Mr. Dinsmore, the proprietor of Roselands, was an old friend of her father, to whom he had been paying a visit, and finding Rose in delicate health, he had prevailed upon her parents to allow her to spend the winter months with his family in the more congenial clime of their Southern home.</p><p>"My poor child," she said, passing her arm around the little one's waist, "my poor little Elsie! that is your name is it not?"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am; Elsie Dinsmore," replied the little girl.</p><p>"Well, Elsie, let me read you another verse from his*[proofreader comment should this be this?] blessed book. Here it is: 'The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sin.' And here again: 'If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father. Jesus Christ the righteous.' Dear Elsie,<pb n="20 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>'if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.'"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am," said the child; "I have asked Him to forgive me, and I know He has; but I am so sorry, oh! <hi rend="italic">so</hi> sorry that I have grieved and displeased Him; for, 0 Miss Allison! I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love Jesus, and want to be like Him always."</p><p>"Yes, dear child, we must grieve for our sins when we remember that they helped to slay the Lord. But I am very, very glad to learn that you love Jesus, and are striving to do His will. I love Him, too, and we will love one another; for you know He says, 'By this shall men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another,'" said Miss Allison, stroking the little girl's hair, and kissing her tenderly.</p><p>"Will you love me? Oh! how glad I am," exclaimed the child joyfully; "I have nobody to love me but poor old mammy."</p><p>"And who is mammy?" asked the lady.</p><p>"My dear old nurse, who has always taken care of me. Have you not seen her, ma'am?"</p><p>"Perhaps I may. I have seen a number of nice old colored women about here since I came. But, Elsie, will you tell me who taught you about Jesus, and how long you have loved Him?"</p><p>"Ever since I can remember," replied the little girl earnestly; "and it was dear old mammy who first told me how He suffered and died on the cross for us." Her eyes filled with tears and her voice quivered with emotion. "She used to talk to me about it just as<pb n="21 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>soon as I could understand anything," she continued; "and then she would tell me that my own dear mamma loved Jesus, and had gone to be with Him in heaven; and how, when she was dying, she put me--a little, wee baby, I was then not quite a week old--into her arms, and said, 'Mammy, take my dear little baby and love her, and take care of her just as you did of me; and O mammy! be sure that you teach her to love God.' Would you like to see my mamma, Miss Allison?"</p><p>And as she spoke she drew from her bosom a miniature set in gold and diamonds, which she wore suspended by a gold chain around her neck, and put it in Rose's hand.</p><p>It was the likeness of a young and blooming girl, not more than fifteen or sixteen years of age. She was very beautiful, with a sweet, gentle, winning countenance, the same soft hazel eyes and golden brown curls that the little Elsie possessed; the same regular features, pure complexion, and sweet smile.</p><p>Miss Allison gazed at it a moment in silent admiration; then turning from it to the child with a puzzled expression, she said, "But, Elsie, I do not understand; are you not sister to Enna and the rest? and is not Mrs. Dinsmore own mother to them all?"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am, to all of them, but not to me nor my papa. Their brother Horace is my papa, and so they are all my aunts and uncles."</p><p>"Indeed," said the lady, musingly; "I thought you<pb n="22 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>looked very unlike the rest. And your papa is away, is he not, Elsie?"</p><p>"Yes, ma'am; he is in Europe. He has been away almost ever since I was born, and I have never seen him. Oh! how I do wish he would come home! How I long to see him! Do you think he would love me, Miss Allison? Do you think he would take me on his knee and pet me, as grandpa does Enna?"</p><p>"I should think he would, dear; I don't know how he could help loving his own dear little girl," said the lady, again kissing the little rosy cheek. "But now," she added, rising, "I must go away and let you learn your lesson."</p><p>Then taking up the little Bible, and turning over the leaves, she asked, "Would you like to come to my room sometimes in the mornings and evenings, and read this book with me, Elsie?"</p><p>"Oh! yes, ma'am, dearly!" exclaimed the child, her eyes sparkling with pleasure.</p><p>"Come then this evening, if you like; and now good-bye for the present."  And pressing another kiss on the child's cheek, she left her and went back to her own room, where she found her friend Adelaide Dinsmore, a young lady near her own age, and the eldest daughter of the family. Adelaide was seated on a sofa, busily employed with some fancy work.</p><p>"You see I am making myself quite at home," she said, looking up as Rose entered. "I cannot imagine where you have been all this time."</p><p>"Can you not? In the school-room, talking with<pb n="23 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>little Elsie. Do you know, Adelaide, I thought she was your sister; but she tells me not."</p><p>"No, she is Horace's child. I supposed you knew; but if you do not, I may just as well tell you the whole story. Horace was a very wild boy, petted and spoiled, and always used to having his own way; and when he was about seventeen--quite a forward youth he was too--he must needs go to New Orleans to spend some months with a schoolmate; and there he met, and fell desperately in love with, a very beautiful girl a year or two younger than himself, an orphan and very wealthy. Fearing that objections would be made on the score of their youth, etc., etc., he persuaded her to consent to a private marriage, and they had been man and wife for some months before either her friends or his suspected it.</p><p>"Well, when it came at last to papa's ears, he was very angry, both on account of their extreme youth, and because, as Elsie Grayson's father had made all his money by trade, he did not consider her quite my brother's equal; so he called Horace home and sent him North to college. Then he studied law, and since that he has been travelling in foreign lands. But to return to his wife; it seems that her guardian was quite as much opposed to the match as papa; and the poor girl was made to believe that she should never see her husband again. All their letters were intercepted, and finally she was told that he was dead so, as Aunt Chloe says, 'she grew thin and pale, and weak and melancholy,' and while the little Elsie was<pb n="24 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>yet not quite a week old, she died. We never saw her; she died in her guardian's house, and there the little Elsie stayed in charge of Aunt Chloe, who was an*[proofreader comment correct misprinted an?] old servant in the family, and had nursed her mother before her, and of the housekeeper, Mrs. Murray, a pious old Scotch woman, until about four years ago, when her guardian's death broke up the family and then they came to us. Horace never comes home, and does not seem to care for his child, for he never mentions her in his letters, except when it is necessary in the way of business."</p><p>"She is a dear little thing," said Rose. "I am sure he could not help loving her, if he could only see her."</p><p>"Oh! yes, she is well enough, and I often feel sorry for the lonely little thing, but the truth is, I believe we are a little jealous of her; she is so extremely beautiful, and heiress to such an immense fortune. Mamma often frets, and says that one of these days she will quite eclipse her younger daughters."</p><p>"But then," said Rose, " she is almost as near; her own grand-daughter."</p><p>"No, she is not so very near," replied Adelaide, for Horace is not mamma's son. He was seven or eight years old when she married papa, and I think she was never particularly fond of him."</p><p>"Ah! yes," thought Rose, " that explains it. Poor little Elsie  No wonder you pine for your father's love, and grieve over the loss of the mother you never knew."</p><p>"She is an odd child," said Adelaide; "I don't<pb n="25 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>understand her; she is so meek and patient she will fairly let you trample upon her. It provokes papa. He says she is no Dinsmore, or she would know how to stand up for her own rights; and yet she has a temper, I know, for once in a great while it shows itself for an instant--only an instant though, and at very long intervals--and then she grieves over it for days, as though she had committed some great crime; while the rest of us think nothing of getting angry half a dozen times in a day. And then she is forever poring over that little Bible of hers; what she sees so attractive in it I'm sure I cannot tell, for I must say I find it the dullest of dull books."</p><p>"Do you?" said Rose; "how strange! I had rather give up all other books than that one. 'Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart.' 'How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!'"</p><p>"Do you <hi rend="italic">really</hi> love it so, Rose?" asked Adelaide, lifting her eyes to her friend's face with an expression of astonishment; "do tell me why?"</p><p>"For its exceeding great and precious promises, Adelaide; for its holy teachings; for its offers of peace and pardon and eternal life. I am a sinner, Adelaide, lost, ruined, helpless, hopeless, and the Bible brings me the glad news of salvation offered as a free, unmerited gift; it tells me that Jesus died to save sinners--just such sinners as I. I find that I have a heart deceitful above all things and desperately<pb n="26 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>wicked, and the blessed Bible tells me how that heart can be renewed, and where I can obtain that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. I find myself utterly unable to keep God's holy law, and it tells me of One who has kept it for me. I find that I deserve the wrath and curse of a justly offended God, and it tells me of Him who was made a curse for me. I find that all my righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and it offers me the beautiful, spotless robe of Christ's perfect righteousness. Yes, it tells me that God can be just, and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus."</p><p>Rose spoke these words with deep emotion, then suddenly clasping her hands and raising her eyes, she exclaimed, "'Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!'"</p><p>For a moment there was silence. Then Adelaide spoke:</p><p>"Rose," said she, "you talk as if you were a great sinner; but I don't believe it; it is only your humility that makes you think so. Why, what have you ever done? Had you been a thief, a murderer, or guilty of any other great crime, I could see the propriety of your using such language with regard to yourself; but for a refined, intelligent, amiable young lady, excuse me for saying it, dear Rose, but such language seems to me simply absurd."</p><p>"'Man looketh upon the outward appearance, but the Lord pondereth the heart,'" said Rose, gently. "No, dear Adelaide, you are mistaken; for I can<pb n="27 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>truly say 'mine iniquities have gone over my head as a cloud, and my transgressions as a thick cloud.' Every duty has been stained with sin, every motive impure, every thought unholy. From my earliest existence, God has required the undivided love of my whole heart, soul, strength, and mind; and so far from yielding it, I lived at enmity with Him, and rebellion against His government, until within the last two years. For seventeen years He has showered blessings upon me, giving me life, health, strength, friends, and all that was necessary for my happiness; and for fifteen of those years I returned Him nothing but ingratitude and rebellion. For fifteen years I rejected His offers of pardon and reconciliation, turned my back upon the Saviour of sinners, and resisted all the strivings of God's Holy Spirit, and will you say that I am not a great sinner?"  Her voice quivered, and her eyes were full of tears.</p><p>"Dear Rose," said Adelaide, putting her arm around her friend and kissing her cheek affectionately, "don't think of these things; religion is too gloomy for one so young as you."</p><p>"Gloomy, dear Adelaide!" replied Rose, returning the embrace; "I never knew what true happiness was until I found Jesus. My sins often make me sad, but religion, never.<p><p>"'Oft I walk beneath the cloud,Dark as midnight's gloomy shroud;But when fear is at the height,Jesus comes, and all is light.'</p><pb n="28"/>Chapter Second.<p>"Thy Injuries would teach patience to blaspheme,Yet still thou art a dove."-BEAUMONT's <hi rend="italic">Double Marriage.</hi></p><p>"When forced to part from those we love,Though sure to meet to-morrow;We yet a kind of anguish proveAnd feel a touch of sorrow.But oh! what words can paint the fearsWhen from these friends we sever,Perhaps to part for months--for years--Perhaps to part forever."--ANON.</p><p>WHEN Miss Allison had gone, and Elsie found herself once more quite alone, she rose from her chair, and kneeling down with the open Bible before her, she poured out her story of sins and sorrows, in simple, child-like words, into the ear of the dear Saviour  whom she loved so well; confessing that when she had done well and suffered for it, she had not taken it patiently, and earnestly pleading that she might be made like unto the meek and lowly Jesus. Low sobs burst from her burdened heart, and the tears of penitence fell upon the pages of the holy book.        But when she rose from her knees, her load of sin and sorrow was all gone, and her heart made light and happy with a sweet sense of peace and pardon. Once again, as often before, the little Elsie was made to ex-<pb n="29 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>perience the blessedness of "the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered."</p><p>She now set to work diligently at her studies, and ere the party returned was quite prepared to meet Miss Day, having attended faithfully to all she had required of her. The lesson was recited without the smallest mistake, every figure of the examples worked out correctly, and the page of the copy-book neatly and carefully written.</p><p>Miss Day had been in a very captious mood all day, and seemed really provoked that Elsie had not given her the smallest excuse for fault-finding. Handing the book back to her, she said, very coldly, "I see you can do your duties well enough when you choose."</p><p>Elsie felt keenly the injustice of the remark, and longed to say that she had tried quite as earnestly in the morning; but she resolutely crushed down the indignant feeling, and calling to mind the rash words that had cost her so many repentant tears, she replied meekly, "I am sorry I did not succeed better this morning, Miss Day, though I did really try; and I am still more sorry for the saucy answer I gave you; and I ask your pardon for it."</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be sorry," replied Miss Day, severely, "and I hope you are; for it was a very impertinent speech indeed, and deserving of a much more severe punishment than you received. Now go, and never let me hear any thing of the kind from you again."</p><pb n="30 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>Poor little Elsie's eyes filled with tears at these ungracious words accompanied by a still more ungracious manner; but she turned away without a word, and placing her books and slate carefully in her desk, left the room.</p><p>Rose Allison was sitting alone in her room that evening, thinking of her far-distant home, when hearing a gentle rap at her door, she rose and opened it to find Elsie standing there with her little Bible in her hand.</p><p>"Come in, darling," she said, stooping to give the little one a kiss; "I am very glad to see you."</p><p>"I may stay with you for half an hour, Miss Allison, if you like," said the child, seating herself on the low ottoman pointed out by Rose, "and then mammy is coming to put me to bed."</p><p>"It will be a very pleasant half-hour to both of us, I hope," replied Rose, opening her Bible.</p><p>They read a chapter together--Rose now and then pausing to make a few explanations--and then kneeling down, she offered up a prayer for the teachings of the Spirit, and for God's blessing on themselves and all their dear ones.</p><p>"Dear little Elsie," she said, folding the child in her arms, when they had risen from their knees, " how I love you already, and how very glad I am to find that there is one in this house beside myself who loves Jesus, and loves to study His word, and to call upon His name."</p><p>"Yes, dear Miss Allison; and there is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than<pb n="31 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>one, for mammy loves Him too, very dearly," replied the little girl, earnestly.</p><p>"Does she, darling? then I must love her too, for I cannot help loving all who love my Saviour."</p><p>Then Rose sat down, and drawing the little girl to a seat on her knee, they talked sweetly together of the race they were running, and the prize they hopea *[proofreader comment hope appears misspelled]to obtain at the end of it; of the battle they were fighting, and the invisible foes with whom they were called to struggle--the armor that had been provided, and of Him who had promised to be the Captain of their salvation, and to bring them off more than conquerors. They were pilgrims in the same straight and narrow way, and it was very pleasant thus to walk a little while together. "Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him."</p><p>"That is mammy coming for me," said Elsie, as a low knock was heard at the door.</p><p>"Come in," said Rose, and the door opened, and a very nice colored woman of middle age, looking beautifully neat in her snow-white apron and turban, entered with a low courtesy, asking, "Is my little missus ready for bed now?"</p><p>"Yes," said Elsie, jumping off Rose's lap; "but<pb n="32 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>come here, mammy; I want to introduce you to Miss Allison."</p><p>"How do you do, Aunt Chloe? I am very glad to know you, since Elsie tells me you are a servant of the same blessed Master whom I love and try to serve," said Rose, putting her small white hand cordially into Chloe's dusky one.</p><p>"'Deed I hope I is, missus," replied Chloe, pressing it fervently in both of hers. "I'se only a poor ole black sinner, but de good Lord Jesus, He loves me jes de same as if I was white; an' I love Him an' all His chillen with all my heart."</p><p>"Yes, Aunt Chloe," said Rose, "He is our peace, and hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; so that we are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone."</p><p>"Yes, missus, dat's it for sure; ole Chloe knows dat's in de Bible; an' if we be built on dat bressed corner-stone, we's safe ebery one; I'se heard it many's de time, an' it fills dis ole heart with joy an' peace in believing," she exclaimed, raising her tearful eyes and clasping her hands. "But good night, missus; I must put my chile to bed," she added, taking Elsie's hand.</p><p>"Good night, Aunt Chloe; come in again," said Rose. "And good night to you too, dear little Elsie," folding the little girl again in her arms.</p><pb n="33 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>'Ain't dat a bressed young lady, darlin'?" exclaimed Chloe, earnestly, as she began the business of preparing her young charge for bed.</p><p>"0 mammy, I love her so much! she's so good and kind," replied the child, "and she loves Jesus, and loves to talk about Him."</p><p>"She reminds me of your dear mamma, Miss Elsie, but she's not so handsome," replied the nurse, with a tear in her eye; "ole Chloe tinks dere's nebber any lady so beautiful as her dear young missus was."</p><p>Elsie drew out the miniature and kissed it, murmuring, "Dear, darling mamma," then put it back in her bosom again, for she always wore it day and night. She was standing in her white night-dress, the tiny white feet just peeping from under it, while Chloe brushed back her curls and put on her night-cap.</p><p>"Dere now, darlin', you's ready for bed," she exclaimed, giving the child a hug and a kiss.</p><p>"No, mammy, not quite," replied the little girl, and gliding away to the side of the bed, she knelt down and offered up her evening prayer. Then coming back to the toilet table, she opened her little Bible saying, "Now, mammy, I will read you a chapter while you are getting ready for bed."</p><p>The room was large and airy, and Aunt Chloe, who was never willing to leave her nursling, but watched over her night and day with the most devoted affection, slept in a cot bed in one corner.</p><p>"Tank you, my dear young missus, you's berry<pb n="34 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>good," said she, beginning the preparations for the night by taking off her turban and replacing it by a thick night-cap.</p><p>When the chapter was finished Elsie got into bed, saying, "Now, mammy, you may put out the light as soon as you please; and be sure to call me early in the morning, for I have a lesson to learn before breakfast."</p><p>"That I will, darlin'," replied the old woman, spreading the cover carefully over her. "Good night, my pet, your ole mammy hopes her chile will have pleasant dreams."</p><p>Rose Allison was a early riser, and as the breakfast hour at Roselands was eight o'clock, she always had an hour or two for reading before it was time to join the family circle. She had asked Elsie to come to her at half-past seven, and punctually at the hour the little girl's gentle rap was heard at her door.</p><p>"Come in," said Rose, and Elsie entered, looking as bright and fresh and rosy as the morning. She had her little Bible under her arm, and a bouquet of fresh flowers in her hand. "Good morning, dear Miss Allison," she said, dropping a graceful courtesy as she presented it. "I have come to read, and I have just been out to gather these for you, because I know you love flowers."</p><p>"Thank you, darling, they are very lovely," said Rose, accepting the gift and bestowing a caress upon the giver. "You are quite punctual," she added, "and now we can have our half hour together before breakfast."</p><pb n="35 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>The time was spent profitably and pleasantly, and passed so quickly that both were surprised when the breakfast bell rang.</p><p>Miss Allison spent the whole fall and winter at Roselands; and it was very seldom during all that time that she and Elsie failed to have their morning and evening reading and prayer together. Rose was often made to wonder at the depth of the little girl's piety and the knowledge of divine things she possessed. But Elsie had had the best of teaching. Chloe, though entirely uneducated, was a simple-minded, earnest Christian, and with a heart full of love to Jesus, had, as we have seen, early endeavored to lead the little one to Him; and Mrs. Murray-the housekeeper whom Adelaide had mentioned, and who had assisted Chloe in the care of the child from the time of her birth until a few months before Rose's coming, when she had suddenly been summoned home to Scotland--had proved a very faithful friend. She was an intelligent woman and devotedly pious, and had carefully instructed this lonely little one, for whom she felt almost a parent's affection, and her efforts to bring her to a saving knowledge of Christ had been signally owned and blessed of God; and in answer to her earnest prayers, the Holy Spirit had vouchsafed His teachings, without which all human instruction must ever be in vain. And young as Elsie was, she had already a very lovely and well-developed Christian character. Though not a remarkably precocious child in other respects, she seemed to have very clearc<pb n="36 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>and correct views on almost every subject connected with her duty to God and her neighbor; was very truthful, both in word and deed, very strict in her observance of the Sabbath--though the rest of the family were by no means particular in that respect--very diligent in her studies, respectful to superiors, and kind to inferiors and equals; and she was gentle, sweet tempered, patient, and forgiving to a remarkable degree. Rose became strongly attached to her, and the little girl fully returned her affection.</p><p>Elsie was very sensitive and affectionate, and felt keenly the want of sympathy and love, for which, at the time of Rose's coming, she had no one to look to but poor old Chloe, who loved her with all her heart.</p><p>It is true, Adelaide sometimes treated her almost affectionately, and Lora, who had a very strong sense of justice, occasionally interfered and took her part when she was very unjustly accused, but no one seemed really to care for her, and she often felt sad and lonely. Mr. Dinsmore, though her own grandfather, treated her with entire neglect, seemed to have not the slightest affection for her, and usually spoke of her as "old Grayson's grandchild." Mrs. Dinsmore really disliked her, because she looked upon her as the child of a stepson for whom she had never felt any affection, and also as the future rival of her own children; while the governess and the younger members of the family, following the example of their elders, treated her with neglect, and occasionally even with abuse. Miss Day, knowing that she was<pb n="37 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>in no danger of incurring the displeasure of her superiors by so doing, vented upon her all the spite she dared not show to her other pupils; and continually she was made to give up her toys and pleasures to Enna, and even sometimes to Arthur and Walter. It often cost her a struggle, and had she possessed less of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, her life had been wretched indeed.</p><p>But in spite of all her trials and vexations, little Elsie was the happiest person in the family; for she had in her heart that peace which the world can neither give nor take away; that joy which the Saviour gives to His own, and no man taketh from them. She constantly carried all her sorrows and troubles to Him, and the coldness and neglect of others seemed but to drive her nearer to that Heavenly Friend, until she felt that while possessed of His love, she could not be unhappy, though treated with scorn and abuse by all the world.</p>*<p>"The good are better made by ill,</p><p>As odors crushed are sweeter still;</p><p>And even so it seemed to be with little Elsie; her trials seemed to have only the effect of purifying and making more lovely her naturally amiable character.</p><p>Elsie talked much and thought more of her absent and unknown father, and longed with an intensity of desire for his return home. It was her dream, by day and by night, that he had come, that he had taken her to his heart, calling her "his own darling child02<pb n="38 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>his precious little Elsie;" for such were the loving epithets she often heard lavished upon Enna, and which she longed to hear addressed to herself. But from month to month, and year to year, that longed for return had been delayed until the little heart had grown sick with hope deferred, and was often weary with its almost hopeless waiting. But to return.</p><p>"Elsie," said Adelaide, as Miss Allison and the little girl entered the breakfast-room on the morning after Elsie's disappointment, "the fair is not over yet, and Miss Allison and I are going to ride out there this afternoon; so, if you are a good girl in school, you may go with us."</p><p>"Oh! thank you, dear Aunt Adelaide," exclaimed the little girl, clapping her hands with delight; "how kind you are! and I shall be so glad."</p><p>Miss Day frowned, and looked as if she wanted to reprove her for her noisy demonstrations of delight, but, standing somewhat in awe of Adelaide, said nothing.</p><p>But Elsie suddenly relapsed into silence, for at that moment Mrs. Dinsmore entered the room, and it was seldom that she could utter a word in her presence without being reproved and told that "children should be seen and not heard," though her own were allowed to talk as much as they pleased.</p><p>Miss Day seemed cross, Mrs. Dinsmore was moody and taciturn, complaining of headache, and Mr. Dinsmore occupied with the morning paper; and so the meal passed off in almost unbroken silence. Elsie<pb n="39 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>was glad when it was over, and hastening to the school-room, she began her tasks without waiting for the arrival of the regular hour for study.</p><p>She had the room entirely to herself, and had been busily engaged for half an hour in working out her examples, when the opening of the door caused her to look up, and, to her dismay, Arthur entered. He did not, however, as she feared, begin his customary course of teasing and tormenting, but seated himself at his desk, leaning his head upon his hand in an attitude of dejection.</p><p>Elsie wondered what ailed him, his conduct was so unusual, and she could not help every now and then. sending an inquiring glance toward him, and at length she asked, "What is the matter, Arthur?"</p><p>"Nothing much," said he, gruffly, turning his back to her.</p><p>Thus repulsed, she said no more, but gave her undivided attention to her employment; and so diligent was she, that Miss Day had no excuse whatever for fault-finding this morning. Her tasks were all completed within the required time, and she enjoyed her promised ride with her aunt and Miss Allison, and her visit to the fair, very much indeed.</p><p>It was still early when they returned; and finding that she had nearly an hour to dispose of before tea-time, Elsie thought she would finish a drawing which she had left in her desk in the school-room. While searching for it and her pencil, she heard Lora's and Arthur's voices on the veranda.</p><pb n="40 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>She did not notice what they were saying, until her own name struck her ear.</p><p>"Elsie is the only person," Lora was saying, "who can, and probably will, help you; for she has plenty of money, and she is so kind and generous; but, if I were you, I should be ashamed to ask her, after the way you have acted toward her."</p><p>"I wish I hadn't teased her so yesterday," replied Arthur, disconsolately, "but it's such fun, I can't help it sometimes."</p><p>"Well, I know I wouldn't ask a favor of anybody I had treated so," said Lora, walking away.</p><p>Elsie sat still a few moments, working at her drawing and wondering all the time what it was Arthur wanted, and thinking how glad she would be of an opportunity of returning him good for evil. She did not like, though, to seek his confidence, but presently hearing him heave a deep sigh, she rose and went out on the veranda.</p><p>He was leaning on the railing in an attitude of dejection, his head bent down and his eyes fixed on the floor. She went up to him, and laying her hand softly on his shoulder, said, in the sweet, gentle tones natural to her, "What ails you, Arthur? Can I do anything for you? I will be very glad if I can?"</p><p>"No--yes--" he answered hesitatingly; "I wouldn't like to ask you after--after--"</p><p>"Oh! never mind," said Elsie, quickly, "I do not care anything about that now. I had the ride today, and that was better still, because I went with<pb n="41 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>Aunt Adelaide and Miss Allison. Tell me what you want."</p><p>Thus encouraged, Arthur replied, " I saw a beautiful little ship yesterday when I was in the city; it was only five dollars, and I've set my heart on having it, but my pocket money's all gone, and papa won't give me a cent until next month's allowance is due and by that time the ship will be gone, for it's such a beauty somebody'll be sure to buy it."</p><p>"Won't your mamma buy it for you?" asked Elsie.</p><p>"No, she says she hasn't the money to spare just now. You know it's near the end of the month, and they've all spent their allowance except Louise, and she says she'll not lend her money to such a spend-thrift as I am."</p><p>Elsie drew out her purse, and seemed just about to put it into his hand; but, apparently changing her mind, she hesitated a moment, and then returning it to her pocket, said, with a half smile, "I don't know, Arthur; five dollars is a good deal for a little girl like me to lay out at once. I must think about it a little."</p><p>"I don't ask you to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> it," he replied scornfully, "I'll pay it back in two weeks."</p><p>"Well, I will see by to-morrow morning," she said, darting away, while he sent an angry glance after her, muttering the word " stingy " between his teeth.</p><p>Elsie ran down to the kitchen, asking of one and another of the servants as she passed, "Where's Pompey?" The last time she put the question to<pb n="42 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>Phoebe, the cook, but was answered by Pompey himself. "Here am Pomp, Miss Elsie; what does little missy want wid dis chile?"</p><p>"Are you going to the city to-night, Pompey?"</p><p>"Yes, Miss Elsie, I'se got some arrants to do for missus an' de family in ginral, an' I ben gwine start in 'bout ten minutes. Little missy wants sumpin, eh?"</p><p>Elsie motioned to him to come close to her, and then putting her purse into his hands, she told him in a whisper of Arthur's wish, and directed him to purchase the coveted toy, and bring it to her, if possible, without letting any one else know anything about it. And keep half a dollar for yourself, Pompey, to pay you for your trouble," she added in conclusion.</p><p>"Tank you, little missy," he replied, with a broad grin of satisfaction; "dat be berry good pay, and Pomp am de man to do dis business up for you 'bout right."</p><p>The tea-bell rang, and Elsie hastened away to answer the summons. She looked across the table at Arthur with a pleasant smile on her countenance, but he averted his eyes with an angry scowl; and with a slight sigh she turned away her head, and did not look at him again during the meal.</p><p>Pompey executed his commission faithfully; and when Elsie returned to her own room, after her evening hour with Miss Rose, Chloe pointed out the little ship standing on the mantel.</p><p>"Oh! it's a little beauty," cried Elsie, clapping<pb n="43 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>her hands and dancing up and down with delight "how Arthur will be pleased! Now, mammy, can you take it to the school-room, and put it on Master Arthur's desk, without anybody seeing you?"</p><p>"Ole Chloe'll try, darlin'," she said, taking it in herhands.</p><p>"Oh! wait one moment," exclaimed Elsie; and taking a card, she wrote on it, "A present to Arthur, from his niece Elsie." Then laying it on the deck of the little vessel, "There, mammy," she said, "I think that will do; but please look out first to see whether any one is in the hall."</p><p>"Coast all clear, darlin'," replied Chloe, after a careful survey; "all de chillens am in bed before dis time I spec." And taking a candle in one hand and the little ship in the other, she started for the school-room. She soon returned with a broad grin of satisfaction on her black face, saying, "All right, darlin', I put him on Massa Arthur's desk, an' nobody de wiser."</p><p>So Elsie went to bed very happy in the thought of the pleasure Arthur would have in receiving her present.</p><p>She was hurrying down to the breakfast-room the next morning, a little in advance of Miss Rose, who had stopped to speak to Adelaide, when Arthur came running up behind her, having just come in by a side door from the garden, and seizing her round the waist,  he said, "Thank you, Elsie; you're a real good girl! She sails beautifully. I've been trying her on theO*<pb n="44 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>pond. But it mustn't be a <hi rend="italic">present</hi>; you must let me pay you back when I get my allowance."</p><p>"Oh! no, Arthur, that would spoil it all," she answered quickly; "you are entirely welcome, and you know my allowance is so large that half the time I have more money than I know how to spend."</p><p>"I should like to see the time when that would be the case with me," said he, laughing. Then in a lower tone, "Elsie, I'm sorry I teased you so. I'll not do it again soon."</p><p>Elsie answered him with a grateful look, as she stepped past him and quietly took her place at the table.</p><p>Arthur kept his word, and for many weeks entirely refrained from teasing Elsie, and while freed from that annoyance she was always able to have her tasks thoroughly prepared; and though her governess was often unreasonable and exacting, and there was scarcely a day in which she was not called upon to yield her own wishes or pleasures, or in some way to inconvenience herself to please Walter or Enna, or occasionally the older members of the family, yet it was an unusually happy winter to her, for Rose Allison's love and uniform kindness shed sunshine on her path. She had learned to yield readily to others, and when fretted or saddened by unjust or unkind treatment, a few moments alone with her precious Bible and her loved Saviour made all right again, and she would come from those sweet communings looking as serenely happy as if she had never known an annoy-<pb n="45 ELSIE D1NSMORE."/>ance. She was a wonder to all the family. Her grandfather would sometimes look at her as, without a frown or a pout, she would give up her own wishes to Enna, and shaking his head, say, "She's no Dinsmore, or she would know how to stand up for her own rights better than that. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't like such tame-spirited people. She's not Horace's child: it never was an easy matter to impose upon or conquer him. He was a boy of spirit."</p><p>"What a strange child Elsie is!" Adelaide remarked to her friend one day. " I am often surprised to see how sweetly she gives up to all of us; really she has a lovely temper. I quite envy her; it was always hard for me to give up my own way."</p><p>"I do not believe it was easy for her at first," said Rose. "I think her sweet disposition is the fruit of a work of grace in her heart. It is the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which God alone can bestow."</p><p>"I wish I had it, then," said Adelaide, sighing.</p><p>"You have only to go to the right source to obtain it, dear Adelaide," replied her friend, gently.</p><p>"And yet," said Adelaide, "I must say I sometimes think that, as papa says, there is something mean-spirited and cowardly in always giving up to other people."</p><p>"It would indeed be cowardly and wrong to give up <hi rend="italic">principle</hi>," replied Rose, "but surely it is noble and generous to give up our own wishes to another where no principle is involved."</p>ce 2<pb n="46 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>"Certainly, you are right," said Adelaide, musingly." And now I recollect that, readily as Elsie gives up her own wishes to others on ordinary occasions, I have never known her to sacrifice principle; but, on the contrary, she has several times made mamma excessively angry by refusing to romp and play with Enna on the Sabbath, or to deceive papa when questioned with regard to some of Arthur's misdeeds; yet she has often borne the blame of his faults, when she might have escaped by telling of him. Elsie is certainly very different from any of the rest of us, and if it is piety that makes her what she is, I think piety is a very lovely thing."</p><p>Elsie's mornings were spent in the school-room; in the afternoon she walked, or rode out, sometimes in company with her young uncles and aunts, and sometimes alone, a negro boy following at a respectful distance, as a protector. In the evening there was almost always company in the parlor, and she found it pleasanter to sit beside the bright wood-fire in her own room, with her fond old nurse for a companion, than to stay there, or with the younger ones in the sitting-room or nursery. If she had no lesson to learn, she usually read aloud to Chloe, as she sat knitting by the fire, and the Bible was the book generally preferred by both; and then when she grew weary of reading, she would often take a stool, and sitting down close to Chloe, put her head in her lap, saying, "Now, mammy, tell me about mamma."</p><p>And then for the hundredth time or more the old<pb n="47 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>woman would go over the story of the life and death of her "dear young missus," as she always called her; telling of her beauty, her goodness, and of her sorrows and sufferings during the last year of her short life.</p><p>It was a story which never lost its charm for Elsie a story which the one never wearied of telling, nor the other of hearing. Elsie would sit listening, with her mother's miniature in her hand, gazing at it with tearful eyes, then press it to her lips, murmuring, "My own mamma; poor, dear mamma." And when Chloe had finished that story she would usually say "Now, mammy, tell me all about papa."</p><p>But upon this subject Chloe had very little information to give. She knew him only as a gay, handsome young stranger, whom she had seen occasionally during a few months, and who had stolen all the sunshine from her beloved young mistress's life, and left her to die alone; yet she did not blame him when speaking to his child, for the young wife had told her that he had not forsaken her of his own free choice; and though she could not quite banish from her own mind the idea that he had not been altogether innocent in the matter, she breathed no hint of it to Elsie; for Chloe was a sensible woman, and knew that to lead the little one to think ill of her only remaining parent would but tend to make her unhappy.</p><p>Sometimes Elsie would ask very earnestly, "Do you think papa loves Jesus, mammy?" And Chloe would reply with a doubtful shake of the head,<pb n="48 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>"Dunno, darlin'; but ole Chloe prays for him ebery day."</p><p>"And so do I," Elsie would answer; "dear, dear papa, how I wish he would come home!"</p><p>And so the winter glided away, and spring came, and Miss Allison must soon return home. It was now the last day of March, and her departure had been fixed for the second of April. For a number of weeks Elsie had been engaged, during all her spare moments, in knitting a purse for Rose, wishing to give her something which was the work of her own hands, knowing that as such it would be more prized by her friend than a costlier gift. She had just returned from her afternoon ride, and taking out her work she sat down to finish it. She was in her own room, with no companion but Chloe, who sat beside her knitting as usual</p><p>Elsie worked on silently for some time, then suddenly holding up her purse, she exclaimed, "See, mammy, it is all done but putting on the tassel! Isn't it pretty? and won't dear Miss Allison be pleased with it?"</p><p>It really was very pretty indeed, of crimson and gold, and beautifully knit, and Chloe, looking at it with admiring eyes, said, "I spec she will, darlin'. I tink it's berry handsome."</p><p>At this moment Enna opened the door and came in.</p><p>Elsie hastily attempted to conceal the purse by thrusting it into her pocket, but it was too late, for<pb n="49 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>Enna had seen it, and running toward her cried out, "Now, Elsie, just give that to me!"</p><p>"No, Enna," replied Elsie, mildly; "I cannot let you have it, because it is for Miss Rose."</p><p>"I will have it," exclaimed the child, resolutely, "and if you don't give it to me at once I shall just go and tell mamma."</p><p>"I will let you take it in your hand a few moment to look at it, if you will be careful not to soil it, Enna," said Elsie, in the same gentle tone; "and if you wish, I will get some more silk and beads, and make you one just like it; but I cannot give you this, because I would not have time to make another for Miss Rose."</p><p>"No, I shall just have that one; and I shall have it to keep," said Enna, attempting to snatch it out of Elsie's hand.</p><p>But Elsie held it up out of her reach, and after trying several times in vain to get it, Enna left the room, crying and screaming with passion.</p><p>Chloe locked the door, saying, "Great pity, darlin', we forgot to do dat 'fore Miss Enna came. I'se 'fraid she gwine bring missus for make you gib um up."</p><p>Elsie sat down to her work again, but she was very pale, and the little hands trembled with agitation, and her soft eyes were full of tears.</p><p>Chloe's fears were but too well founded; for the next moment hasty steps were heard in the passage, and the handle of the door was laid hold of with no very gentle grasp; and then, as it refused to yield to<pb n="50 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>her touch, Mrs. Dinsmore's voice was heard in an angry tone giving the command, "Open this door instantly."</p><p>Chloe looked at her young mistress.</p><p>"You will have to," said Elsie, tearfully, slipping her work into her pocket again, and lifting up her heart in prayer for patience and meekness, for she wel*[proofreader comment well appears to be misspelled] knew she would have need of both.</p><p>Mrs. Dinsmore entered, leading the sobbing Enna by the hand; her face was flushed with passion, and addressing Elsie in tones of violent anger, she asked, "What is the meaning of all this, you good-for-nothing hussey? Why are you always tormenting this poor child? Where is that paltry trifle that all this fuss is about? let me see it this instant."</p><p>Elsie drew the purse from her pocket, saying in tearful, trembling tones, "It is a purse I was making for Miss Rose, ma'am; and I offered to make another just like it for Enna; but I cannot give her this one, because there would not be time to make another before Miss Rose goes away."</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">can</hi> not give it to her, indeed? You <hi rend="italic">will not</hi>,you mean; but I say you <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>; and I'll see if I'm not mistress in my own house. Give it to the child this instant; I'll not have her crying her eyes out that you may be humored in all your whims. There are plenty of handsomer ones to be had in the city, and if you are too mean to make her a present of it, I'll buy you another to-morrow."</p><p>"But that would not be my work, and this is,"<pb n="51 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>replied Elsie, still retaining the purse, loath to let it go.</p><p>"Nonsense! what difference will that make to Miss Rose?" said Mrs. Dinsmore; and snatching it out of her hand, she gave it to Enna, saying, "There, my pet, you shall have it. Elsie is a naughty, mean, stingy girl, but she sha'n't plague you while your mamma's about."</p><p>Enna cast a look of triumph at Elsie, and ran off with her prize, followed by her mother, while poor Elsie hid her face in Chloe's lap, and cried bitterly.</p><p>It required all Chloe's religion to keep down her anger and indignation at this unjust and cruel treatment of her darling, and for a few moments she allowed her to sob and cry without a word, only soothing her with mute caresses, not daring to trust her voice, lest her anger should find vent in words. But at length, when her feelings had grown somewhat calmer, she said soothingly, "Nebber mind it, my poor darlin' chile. Just go to de city and buy de prettiest purse you can find, for Miss Rose."</p><p>But Elsie shook her head sadly. "I wanted it to be my own work," she sobbed, "and now there is no time."</p><p>"Oh! I'll tell you what, my pet," exclaimed Chloe suddenly, "dere's de purse you was aknittin' for your papa, an' dey wouldn't send it for you; you can get dat done for de lady, and knit another for your papa, 'fore he comes home."</p><p>Elsie raised her head with a look of relief, but her<pb n="52 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>face clouded again, as she replied, "But it is not quite done, and I haven't the beads to finish it with, and Miss Rose goes day after to-morrow."</p><p>"Nebber mind dat, darlin'," said Chloe, jumping up; "Pomp he been gwine to de city dis berry afternoon, an' we'll tell him to buy de beads, an' den you can get de purse finished 'fore to-morrow night, an de lady don' go till de next day, an' so it gwine all come right yet."</p><p>"Oh! yes, that will do; dear old mammy, I'm so glad you thought of it," said Elsie, joyfully. And rising she went to her bureau, and unlocking a drawer, took from it a bead purse of blue and gold, quite as handsome as the one of which she had been so ruthlessly despoiled, and rolling it up in a piece of paper, she handed it to Chloe, saying, "There, mammy, please give it to Pomp, and tell him to match the beads and the silk exactly."</p><p>Chloe hastened in search of Pomp, but when she found him, he insisted that he should not have time to attend to Miss Elsie's commission and do his other errands; and Chloe, knowing that he, in common with a11 the other servants, was very fond of the little girl, felt *[proofreader comment f on felt missing] satisfied that it was not merely an excuse, and therefore did not urge her request. She stood a moment in great perplexity, then suddenly exclaimed,"I'll go myself. Miss Elsie will spare me, an' I'll go right long wid you, Pomp."</p><p>Chloe was entirely Elsie's servant, having no other business than to wait upon her and take care of her<pb n="53 ELSIE DINSMORE "/>clothing and her room; and the little girl, of course readily gave her permission to accompany Pomp and do the errand.</p><p>But it was quite late ere Chloe returned, and the little girl spent the evening alone in her own room. She was sadly disappointed that she could not even have her hour with Miss Rose, who was detained in the parlor with company whom she could not leave, and so the evening seemed very long and wore away very slowly.</p><p>But at last Chloe came, and in answer to her eager inquiries *[proofreader comment first letter of inquiries missing] displayed her purchases with great satisfaction, saying, " Yes, darlin', I'se got de berry 'tings you wanted."</p><p>"Oh yes," said Elsie, examining them with delight; "they are just right; and now I can finish it in a couple of hours."</p><p>"Time to get ready for bed now, ain't it, pet?" asked Chloe; but before the little girl had time to answer, a servant knocked at the door, and handed in a note for her. It was from Miss Allison, and, hastily tearing it open, she read:</p><p>"DEAR ELSIE--I am very sorry that we cannot have our reading together this evening; but be sure, darling, to come to me early in the morning; it will be our last opportunity, for, dear child, I have another disappointment for you. I had not expected to leave before day after to-morrow, but I have learned this evening that the vessel sails a day sooner than I had<pb n="54 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>supposed, and therefore I shall be obliged to start on my journey to-morrow.</p><p>"Your friend,          ROSE."</p><p>Elsie dropped the note on the floor and burst into tears.</p><p>"What de matter, darlin? " asked Chloe, anxiously.</p><p>"Oh! Miss Rose, dear, <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> Miss Rose is going to-morrow," she sobbed. Then hastily drying her eyes, she said: "But I have no time for crying. I must sit up and finish the purse to-night, because there will not be time to-morrow."</p><p>It was long past her usual hour for retiring when at last her task, or rather her labor of love, was completed. Yet she was up betimes, and at the usual hour her gentle rap was heard at Miss Allison's door.</p><p>Rose clasped her in her arms and kissed her tenderly.</p><p>"O Miss Rose! <hi rend="italic">dear, dear</hi> Miss Rose, what shall I do without you?" sobbed the little girl. "I shall have nobody to love me now but mammy."</p><p>"You have another and a better Friend, dear Elsie, who has said, 'I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,'" whispered Rose, with another tender caress.</p><p>"Yes," said Elsie, wiping away her tears; and He is your friend, too; and don't you think, Miss Rose, He will bring us together again some day?"</p><p>"I hope so indeed, darling. We must keep very close to Him, dear Elsie; we must often commune<pb n="55 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>with Him in secret; often study His word, and try always to do His will. Ah! dear child, if we can only have the assurance that that dear Friend is with us--that we have His presence and His love, we shall be supremely happy, though separated from all earthly friends. I know, dear little one, that you have peculiar trials, and that you often feel the want of sympathy and love; but you may always find them in Jesus. And now we will have our reading and prayer as usual."</p><p>She took the little girl in her lap, and opening the Bible, read aloud the fourteenth chapter of John, a part of that touching farewell of our Saviour to His sorrowing disciples; and then they knelt to pray. Elsie was only a listener, for her little heart was too full to allow her to be anything more.</p><p>"My poor darling!" Rose said, again taking her in her arms, "we will hope to meet again before very long. Who knows but your papa may come home, and some day bring you to see me. It seems not unlikely, as he is so fond of travelling."</p><p>Elsie looked up, smiling through her tears, "Oh! how delightful that would be," she said. "But it seems as though my papa would never come," she added, with a deep-drawn sigh.</p><p>"Well, darling, we can hope," Rose answered cheerfully. "And, dear child, though we must be separated in body for a time, we can still meet in spirit at the mercy-seat. Shall we not do so at this hour every morning?"</p><pb n="56 ELSIE DINSMORE. "/><p>Elsie gave a joyful assent.</p><p>"And I shall write to you, darling," Rose said; "I will write on my journey, if I can, so that you will get the letter in a week from the time I leave; and then you must write to me; will you?"</p><p>"If you won't care for the mistakes, Miss Rose. But you know I am a very little girl, and I wouldn't like to let Miss Day read my letter to you, to correct it. But I shall be so very glad to get yours. I never had a letter in my life."</p><p>"I sha'n't care for mistakes at all, dear; and no one shall see your letters but myself," said Rose, kissing her. "I should be as sorry as you to have Miss Day look at them."</p><p>Elsie drew out the purse and put it in her friend's hand, saying, "It is all my own work, dear Miss Rose; I thought you would value it more for that."</p><p>"And indeed I shall, darling," replied Rose, with tears of pleasure in her eyes. "It is beautiful in itself, but I shall value it ten times more because it is your gift, and the work of your own dear little hands *[proofreader comment hands misprint]."</p><p>But the breakfast-bell now summoned them to join the rest of the family, and, in a few moments after they left the table, the carriage which was to take Rose to the city was at the door. Rose had endeared herself to all, old and young, and they were loath to part with her. One after another bade her an affectionate farewell. Elsie was the last. Rose pressed her tenderly to her bosom, and kissed her<pb n="57 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>again and again, saying, in a voice half choked with grief, "God bless and keep you, my poor little darling; my dear, dear little Elsie!"</p><p>Elsie could not speak; and the moment the carriage had rolled away with her friend, she went to her own room, and locking herself in, cried long and bitterly. She had learned to love Rose very dearly, and to lean upon her very much; and now the parting from her, with no certainty of ever meeting her again in this world, was the severest trial the poor child had ever known.</p><pb n="58"/>Chapter Third"The morning blush was lighted up by hope--The hope of meeting him"Miss LANDON."Unkindness, do thy office; poor heart, break."<p>A WEEK had now passed away since Miss Allison's departure, and Elsie, to whom it had been a sad and lonely one, was beginning to look eagerly for her first letter.</p><p>"It is just a week to-day since Rose left," remarked Adelaide at the breakfast table, "and I think we ought to hear from her soon. She promised to write on her journey. Ah! here comes Pomp with the letters now," she added, as the servant man entered the room bearing in his hand the bag in which he always brought the letters of the family from the office in the neighboring city, whither he was sent every morning.</p><p>"Pomp, you are late this morning," said Mrs. Dinsmore.</p><p>"Yes, missus," replied the negro, scratching his head, "de horses am berry lazy; spec dey's got de spring fever."</p><p>"Do make haste, papa, and see if there is not one from Rose," said Adelaide coaxingly, as her father<pb n="59 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>took the bag, and very deliberately adjusted his spectacles before opening it.</p><p>"Have patience, young lady," said he. "Yes, here is a letter for you, and one for Elsie," tossing them across the table as he spoke.</p><p>Elsie eagerly seized hers and ran away to her own room to read it. It was a feast to her, this first letter, and from such a dear friend too. It gave her almost as much pleasure for the moment as Miss Rose's presence could have afforded.</p><p>She had just finished its perusal and was beginning it again, when she heard Adelaide's voice calling her by name, and the next moment she entered the room, saying, "Well, Elsie, I suppose you have read your letter; and now I have another piece of news for you. Can you guess what it is?" she asked, looking at her with a strange smile.</p><p>"Oh! no, Aunt Adelaide; please tell me. Is dear Miss Rose coming back?"</p><p>"Oh! nonsense; what a guess!" said Adelaide. "No, stranger than that. My brother Horace-your papa--has actually sailed for America, and is coming directly home."</p><p>Elsie sprang up, her cheeks flushed, and her little heart beating wildly.</p><p>"0 Aunt Adelaide!" she cried, "is it really true? is he coming? and will he be here soon?"</p><p>"He has really started at last; but how soon he will be here I don't know," replied her aunt, turning to leave the room. "I have told you all I know about it."</p><pb n="60 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>Elsie clasped her hands together, and sank down upon a sofa, Miss Rose's letter, prized so highly a moment before, lying unheeded at her feet; for her thoughts were far away, following that unknown parent as he crossed the ocean; trying to imagine how he would look, how he would speak, what would be his feelings toward her.</p><p>"Oh!" she asked, with a beating heart, "<hi rend="italic">will</hi> he<hi rend="italic">love</p> me ? My own papa! will he let me love him? will he take me in his arms and call me his own darling child?"</p><p>But who could answer the anxious inquiry? She must just wait until the slow wheels of time should bring the much longed-for, yet sometimes half-dreaded arrival.</p><p>Elsie's lessons were but indifferently recited that morning, and Miss Day frowned, and said in a tone of severity that it did not agree with her to receive letters; and that, unless she wished her papa to be much displeased with her on his expected arrival, she must do a great deal better than that.</p><p>She had touched the right chord then; for Elsie, intensely anxious to please that unknown father, and, if possible, gain his approbation and affection, gave her whole mind to her studies with such a determined purpose that the governess could find no more cause for complaint.</p><p>But while the child is looking forward to the expected meeting with such longing affection for him, how *[proofreader comment first letter of how misprinted] is it with the father?</p><pb n="61 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>Horace Dinsmore was, like his father, an upright, moral man, who paid an outward respect to the forms of religion, but cared nothing for the vital power of godliness; trusted entirely to his morality, and looked upon Christians as hypocrites and deceivers. He had been told that his little Elsie was one of these, and though he would not have acknowledged it even to himself, it had prejudiced him against her. Then, too, in common with all the Dinsmores, he had a great deal of family pride; and, though old Mr. Grayson had been a man of sterling worth, intelligent, honest, and pious, and had died very wealthy, yet because he was known to have begun life as a poor boy, the whole family were accustomed to speak as though Horace had stooped very much in marrying his heiress.</p><p>And Horace himself had come to look upon his early marriage as a piece of boyish folly, of which he was rather ashamed; and so constantly had Mr. Dinsmore spoken in his letters of Elsie as "old Grayson's grandchild," that he had got into the habit of looking upon her as a kind of disgrace to him; especially as she had always been described to him as a disagreeable, troublesome child.</p><p>He had loved his wife with all the warmth of his passionate nature, and had mourned bitterly over her untimely death; but years of study and travel and worldly pleasures had almost banished her image from his mind, and he seldom thought of her except in connection with the child for whom he felt a secret dislike.</p><pb n="62 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>Scarcely anything but the expected arrival was now spoken or thought of at Roselands, and Elsie was not the only one to whom old Time seemed to move with an unusually laggard pace.</p><p>But at length a letter came telling them that they might look upon it as being but one day in advance of its writer; and now all was bustle and preparation.</p><p>"0 mammy, mammy!" exclaimed Elsie, jumping up and down, and clapping her hands for joy, as she came in from her afternoon ride, "just think papa, dear papa will be here to-morrow morning."</p><p>She seemed wild with delight; but suddenly sobered down, and a look of care stole over the little face, as the torturing question recurred to her mind,"<hi rend="italic">Will he love me?</hi>"</p><p>She stood quite still, with her eyes fixed thoughtfully, and almost sadly, upon the floor, while Chloe took off her riding dress and cap and smoothed her hair. As she finished arranging her dress she clasped the little form in her arms, and pressed a fond kiss on the fair brow, thinking to herself that it was the sweetest and loveliest little face she had ever looked upon.</p><p>Just at that moment an unusual bustle was heard in the house.</p><p>Elsie started, changed color, and stood listening with a throbbing heart.</p><p>Presently little feet were heard running rapidly down the hall, and Walter, throwing open the door,<pb n="63 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>called out, "Elsie, he's come!" and catching her hand, hurried her along to the parlor door.</p><p>"Stop, stop, Walter," she gasped as they reached it; and she leaned against the wall, her heart throbbing so wildly she could scarcely breathe.</p><p>"What is the matter?" said he; "are you ill? come along;" and pushing the door open, he rushed in, dragging her after him.</p><p>So over-wrought were the child's feelings that she nearly fainted; everything in the room seemed to be turning round, and for an instant she scarcely knew where she was.</p><p>But a strange voice asked, "And who is this?" and looking up as her grandfather pronounced her name, she saw a stranger standing before her-very handsome, and very youthful-looking in spite of a heavy dark beard and mustache--who exclaimed hastily, "What! this great girl <hi rend="italic">my</hi> child? really it is enough to make a man feel old."</p><p>Then taking her hand, he stooped and coldly kissed her lips.</p><p>She was trembling violently, and the very depth of her feelings kept her silent and still: her hand lay still in his, cold and clammy.</p><p>He held it an instant, at the same time gazing searchingly into her face; then dropped it, saying in a tone of displeasure, "I am not an ogre, that you need be so afraid of me; but there, you may go; I will not keep you in terror any longer."</p><p>She rushed away to her own room, and there throw-<pb n="64 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>ing herself upon the bed wept long and wildly. Itwas the disappointment of a lifelong hope.  Since her earliest recollection she had looked and longed for this hour; and it seemed as though the little heart would break with its weight of bitter anguish.</p><p>She was all alone, for Chloe had gone down to the kitchen to talk over the arrival, not doubting that her darling was supremely happy in the possession of her long looked-for parent.</p><p>And so the little girl lay there with her crushed and bleeding heart, sobbing, mourning, weeping as though she would weep her very life away, without an earthly friend to speak one word of comfort.</p><p>"0 papa, papa!" she sobbed, "my own papa, you do not love me; me, your own little girl. Oh! my heart will break. 0 mamma, mamma! if I could only go to you; for there is no one here to love me, and I am so lonely, oh! <hi rend="italic">so</hi> lonely and desolate."</p><p>And thus Chloe found her, when she came in an hour later, weeping and sobbing out such broken exclamations of grief and anguish.</p><p>She was much surprised, but comprehending at once how her child was suffering, she raised her up in her strong arms, and laying the little head lovingly against her bosom, she smoothed the tangled hair, kissed the tear-swollen eyes, and bathed the throbbing temples, saying, "My precions *[proofreader comment precious misspelled] pet, my darlin' chile, your ole mammy loves you better dan life; an' did my darlin' forget de almighty Friend dat says, 'I have loved thee with an everlasting love,' an' 'I will never<pb n="65 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>leave thee, nor forsake thee.'

You's all de world to your ole mammy, darlin'; an' you know we must all wait de Lord's time."</p><p>"Then ask Him to help me to be patient," she said, in a weary tone. "And 0 mammy!" she added, with a burst of bitter tears, "ask Him to make my father love me."</p><p>"I will, darlin', I will," sobbed Chloe, pressing the little form closer to her heart; "an' don't you go for to be discouraged right away; for I'se sure Massa Horace must love you 'fore long."</p><p>The tea-bell rang, and the family gathered about the table; but one chair remained unoccupied.</p><p>"Where is Miss Elsie?" asked Adelaide of one of the servants.</p><p>"Dunno, missus," was the reply.</p><p>"Well, then, go and see," said Adelaide; "perhaps she did not hear the bell."</p><p>The servant returned in a moment, saying that Miss Elsie had a bad headache and did not want any supper.</p><p>Mr. Horace Dinsmore paused in the conversation<pb n="66 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>he was carrying on with his father, to listen to the servant's announcement. "I hope she is not a sickly child," said he, addressing Adelaide; "is she subject to such attacks?"</p><p>"Not very," replied his sister, drily, for she had seen the meeting, and felt really sorry for Elsie's evident disappointment; "I imagine crying has brought this on."</p><p>He colored violently, and said in a tone of great displeasure, "Truly, the return of a parent <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a cause for grief; yet I hardly expected my presence to be quite so distressing to my only child. I had no idea that she had already learned to dislike me so thoroughly."</p><p>"She doesn't," said Adelaide, "she has been looking and longing for your return ever since I have known her."</p><p>"Then she has certainly been disappointed in me; her grief is not at all complimentary, explain it as you will."</p><p>Adelaide made no reply, for she saw that he was determined to put an unfavorable construction upon Elsie's conduct, and feared that any defence she could offer would only increase his displeasure.</p><p>It was a weary, aching head the little girl laid upon her pillow that night, and the little heart was sad and sore; yet she was not altogether comfortless, for she had turned in her sorrow to Him who has said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not," and she had the sweet assurance of <hi rend="italic">His</hi> love and favor.</p><pb n="67 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>It was with a trembling heart, hoping yet fearing, longing and yet dreading to see her father, that Elsie descended to the breakfast-room the next morning. She glanced timidly around, but he was not there.</p><p>"Where is papa, Aunt Adelaide?" she asked.</p><p>"He is not coming down to breakfast, as he feels quite fatigued with his journey," replied her aunt "so you will not see him this morning, and perhaps not at all to-day, for there will be a good deal of company here this afternoon and evening."</p><p>Elsie sighed, and looked sadly disappointed. She found it very difficult to attend to her lessons that morning, and every time the door opened she started and looked up, half hoping it might be her papa.</p><p>But he did not come; and when the dinner hour arrived, the children were told that they were to dine in the nursery, on account of the large number of guests to be entertained in the dining-room.  The company remained until bedtime, and she was not called down to the parlor; and so she saw nothing of her father that day.</p><p>But the next morning Chloe told her the children were to breakfast with the family, as all the visitors had left excepting one or two gentlemen. So Elsie went down to the breakfast-room, where, to her surprise, she found her papa sitting alone, reading the morning paper.</p><p>He looked up as she entered.</p><p>"Good morning, papa," she said, in half-trembling tones.</p>D<pb n="68 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>He started a little--for it was the first time he had ever been addressed by that title, and it sounded strange to his ears--gave her a glance of mingled curiosity and interest, half held out his hand, but drawing it back again, simply said, "Good morning, Elsie," and returned to his paper.</p><p>Elsie stood irresolutely in the middle of the floor wanting, yet not daring to go to him.</p><p>But just at that instant the door opened, and Enna, looking rosy and happy, came running in, and rushing up to her brother, climbed upon his knee, and put her arms around his neck, saying, "Good morning, brother Horace. I want a kiss."</p><p>"You shall have it, little pet," said he, throwing down his paper.</p><p>Then, kissing her several times and hugging her in his arms, he said, "<hi rend="italic">You</hi> are not afraid of me, are you? nor sorry that I have come home?"</p><p>"No, indeed," said Enna.</p><p>He glanced at Elsie as she stood looking at them, her large soft eyes full of tears. She could not help feeling that Enna had her place, and was receiving the caresses that should have been lavished upon herself.</p><p>"Jealous," thought her father; "I cannot bear jealous people;" and he gave her a look of displeasure that cut her to the heart, and she turned quickly away and left the room to hide the tears she could no longer keep back.</p><p>"I am envious," she thought, "jealous of Enna.<pb n="69 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>Oh! how wicked!" And she prayed silently, "Dear Saviour, help me! take away these sinful feelings."</p><p>Young as she was, she was learning to have some control over her feelings, and in a few moments she had so far recovered her composure as to be able to return to the breakfast-room and take her place at the table, where the rest were already seated, her sweet little face sad indeed and bearing the traces of tears, but quite calm and peaceful.</p><p>Her father took no further notice of her, and she did not dare trust herself to look at him. The servants filled her plate, and she ate in silence, feeling it a great relief that all were too busily engaged in talking and eating to pay any attention to her. She scarcely raised her eyes from her plate, and did not know how often a strange gentleman, who sat nearly opposite, fixed his upon her.</p><p>As she left the room at the conclusion of the meal, he asked, while following her with his eyes, "Is that one of your sisters, Dinsmore?"</p><p>"No," said he, coloring slightly; "she is my daughter."</p><p>"Ah, indeed!" said his friend. "I remember to have heard that you had a child, but had forgotten it. Well, you have no reason to be ashamed of her: she is lovely, perfectly lovely! has the sweetest little face I ever saw."</p><p>"Will you ride, Travilla?"  asked  Mr. Dinsmore hastily, as though anxious to change the subject.</p>D2<pb n="70 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>"I don't care if I do," was the reply; and they went out together.</p><p>Some hours later in the day Elsie was at the piano in the music-room practising, when a sudden feeling that some one was in the room caused her to turn and look behind her.</p><p>Mr. Travilla was standing there.</p><p>"Excuse me," said he, bowing politely, "but I heard the sound of the instrument, and, being very fond of music, I ventured to walk in."</p><p>Elsie was very modest, and rather timid too, but also very polite; so she said, "No excuse is necessary; but will you not take a seat, sir? though I fear my music will not afford you any pleasure, for you know I am only a little girl, and cannot play very well yet."</p><p>"Thank you," said he, taking a seat by her side. "And now will you do me the favor to repeat the song I heard you singing a few moments since?"</p><p>Elsie immediately complied, though her cheeks burned, and her voice trembled at first from embarrassment; but it grew stronger as she proceeded, and in the last verse was quite steady and full.  She had a very fine voice for a child of her age; its sweetness was remarkable both in singing and speaking; and she had also a good deal of musical talent which had been well cultivated, for she had had good teachers, and had practised with great patience and perseverance. Her music was simple, as suited<pb n="71 ELSIE DINMSORE."/>her years, but her performance of it was very good indeed.</p><p>Mr. Travilla thanked her very heartily, and complimented her singing; then asked for another and another song, another and another piece, chatting with her about each, until they grew quite familiar, and Elsie lost all feeling of embarrassment.</p><p>"Elsie, I think, is your name, is it not?" he asked after a little.</p><p>"Yes, sir," said she, 'Elsie Dinsmore."</p><p>"And you are the daughter of my friend, Mr. Horace Dinsmore ?"</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"Your papa has been absent a long time, and I suppose you must have quite forgotten him."</p><p>"No, sir, not <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi>, for I never had seen him."</p><p>"Indeed!" said he, in a tone of surprise; " then, since he is an entire stranger to you, I suppose you cannot have much affection for him?"</p><p>Elsie raised her large, dark eyes to his face, with an expression of astonishment.  "Not love papa,my own dear papa, who has no child but me? Oh! sir, how could you think that?"</p><p>"Ah! I see I was mistaken," said he, smiling; "I thought you could hardly care for him at all: but do you think that he loves you?"</p><p>Elsie dropped her face into her hands, and burst into an agony of tears.</p><p>The young gentleman looked extremely vexed with himself.</p><pb n="72 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>"My poor little girl, my poor, dear little girl," he said, stroking her hair, "forgive me.  I am very, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> sorry for my thoughtless question. Do be comforted, my poor child, for whether your papa loves you now or not, I am quite sure he soon will."</p><p>Elsie dried her tears, rose, and closed the instrument. He assisted her, and then asked if she would not take a little walk with him in the garden. She complied, and, feeling really very sorry for the wound he had so thoughtlessly inflicted, as well as interested in his little companion, he exerted all his powers to entertain her--talked with her about the plants and flowers, described those he had seen in foreign lands, and related incidents of travel, usually choosing those in which her father had borne a part, because he perceived that they were doubly interesting to her.</p><p>Elsie, having been thrown very much upon her own resources for amusement, and having a natural love for books, and constant access to her grandfather's well-stocked library, had read many more, and with much more thought, than most children of her age, so that Mr. Travilla found her a not uninteresting companion, and was often surprised at the intelligence shown by her questions and replies.</p><p>When the dinner-bell rang he led her in, and seated her by himself, and never was any lady more carefully waited upon than little Elsie at this meal. Two or three other gentlemen guests were present, giving their attention to the older ladies of the com<pb n="73 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>pany, and thus Mr. Travilla seemed to feel quite at liberty to devote himself entirely to her, attending to all her wants, talking with her, and making her talk.</p><p>Elsie now and then stole a glance at Mrs. Dinsmore, fearing her displeasure; but to her great relief, the lady seemed too much occupied to notice her. Once she looked timidly at her father, and her eyes met his. He was looking at her with an expression half curious, half amused. She was at a loss to understand the look, but, satisfied that there was no displeasure in it, her heart grew light, and her cheeks flushed with happiness.</p><p>"Really, Dinsmore," said Mr. Travilla, as they stood together near one of the windows of the drawing-room soon after dinner, "your little girl is remarkably intelligent, as well as remarkably pretty; and I have discovered that she has quite a good deal of musical talent."</p><p>"Indeed! I think it is quite a pity that she does not belong to you, Travilla, instead of me, since you seem to appreciate her so much more highly," replied the father, laughing.</p><p>"I wish she did," said his friend. "But seriously, Dinsmore, you ought to love that child, for she certainly loves you devotedly."</p><p>He looked surprised. "How do you know ?" he asked.</p><p>"It was evident enough from what I saw and heard this morning. Dinsmore, she would value a caress from you more than the richest jewel."</p><pb n="74 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>"Doubtful," replied Horace, hastily quitting the room, for Elsie had come out on to the portico in her riding suit, and Jim, her usual attendant, was bringing up her horse.</p><p>"Are you going to ride, Elsie?" asked her father, coming up to her.</p><p>"Yes, papa," she said, raising her eyes to his face. He lifted her in his arms and placed her on the horse, saying to the servant as he did so, "Now, Jim, you must take good care of my little girl."</p><p>Tears of happiness rose in Elsie's eyes as she turned her horse's head and rode down the avenue. " He called me <hi rend="italic">his</hi> little girl," she murmured to herself, "and bade Jim take good care of me. Oh! he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> love me soon, as good, kind Mr. Travilla said he would."</p><p>Her father was still standing on the portico, looking after her.</p><p>"How well she sits her horse!" remarked Travilla, who had stepped out and stood close by his side.</p><p>"Yes, I think she does," was the reply, in an absent tone. He was thinking of a time, some eight or nine years before, when he had assisted another Elsie to mount her horse, and had ridden for hours at her side.</p><p>All the afternoon memories of the past came crowding thickly on his mind, and an emotion of tenderness began to spring up in his heart toward the child of her who had once been so dear to him; and as he saw the little girl ride up to the house on her return,<pb n="75 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>he again went out, and lifting her from her horse asked kindly, "Had 'you a pleasant ride, my dear?"</p><p>"Oh! yes, papa, very pleasant," she said, looking up at him with a face beaming with delight. He stooped and kissed her, saying, "I think I shall ride with you one of these days; should you like it?"</p><p>"Oh! so very, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much, papa," she answered, eagerly.</p><p>He smiled at her earnestness, and she hastened away to her room to change her dress and tell Chloe of her happiness.</p><p>Alas! it was but a transient gleam of sunshine that darted across her path, to be lost again almost instantly behind the gathering clouds.</p><p>More company came, so that the drawing-room was quite full in the evening; and, though Elsie was there,her father seemed too much occupied with the guests to give her even a glance. She sat alone and unnoticed in a corner, her eyes following him wherever he moved, and her ear strained to catch every tone of his voice; until Mr. Travilla, disengaging himself from a group of ladies and gentlemen on the opposite side of the room, came up to her, and taking her by the hand, led her to a pleasant-looking elderly lady, who sat at a centre-table examining some choice engravings which Mr. Dinsmore had brought with him from Europe.</p><p>"Mother," said Mr. Travilla, "this is my little friend Elsie."</p><pb n="76 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>"Ah!" said she, giving the little girl a kiss, " I am glad to see you, my dear."</p><p>Mr. Travilla set a chair for her close to his mother and then sat down on her other side, and taking up the engravings one after another, he explained them to her in a most entertaining manner, generally having some anecdote to tell in connection with each.</p><p>Elsie was so much amused and delighted with what he was saying that she at last quite forgot her father, and did not notice where he was.</p><p>Suddenly Mr. Travilla laid down the engraving he had in his hand, saying, "Come, Miss Elsie, I want my mother to hear you play and sing; will you not do me the favor to repeat that song I admired so much this morning?"</p><p>"Oh! Mr. Travilla! " exclaimed the little girl, blushing and trembling, "I could not play nor sing before so many people. Please excuse me."</p><p>"Elsie," said her father's voice just at her side, "go <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, and do as the gentleman requests."</p><p>His tone was very stern, and as she lifted her eyes to his face, she saw that his look was still more so and tremblingly and tearfully she rose to obey.</p><p>"Stay," said Mr. Travilla kindly, pitying her distress, "I withdraw my request."</p><p>"But I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> withdraw my command," said her father in the same stern tone; "go at once, Elsie, and do as I bid you."</p><p>She obeyed instantly, struggling hard to overcome her emotion.</p><pb n="77 ELSIE DINSMORE."/><p>Mr. Travilla, scolding himself inwardly all the time for having brought her into such trouble, selected her music, and placing it before her as she took her seat at the instrument, whispered encouragingly, " Now, Miss Elsie, only have confidence in yourself; that is all that is necessary to your success."</p><p>But Elsie was not only embarrassed, but her heart was well-nigh broken by her father's sternness, and the tears <hi rend="italic">would</hi> fill her eyes so that she could see neither notes nor words. She attempted to play the prelude, but blundered sadly, her embarrassment increasing every moment.</p><p>"Never mind," said Mr. Travilla, " never mind the prelude, but just begin the song."</p><p>She made the attempt, but fairly broke down, and burst into tears before she had got through the first verse. Her father had come up behind her, and was standing there, looking much mortified.</p><p>"Elsie," he said, leaning down and speaking in a low, stern tone, close to her ear, " I am ashamed of you; go to your room and to your bed immediately."</p><p>With a heart almost bursting with grief and mortification she obeyed him, and her pillow was wet with many bitter tears ere the weary eyes closed in slumber.</p><p>When she came down the next morning she learned to her great grief that Mr. Travilla and his mother had returned to their own home; she was very sorry she had not been permitted to say good-bye to her friend, and for several days she felt very sad andD* 2<pb n="78 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>lonely, for all her father's coldness of manner had returned, and he scarcely ever spoke to her; while the younger members of the family ridiculed her for her failure in attempting to play for company; and Miss Day, who seemed unusually cross and exacting, often taunted her with it also.</p><p>These were sad, dark days for the little girl; she tried most earnestly to attend to all her duties, but so depressed were her spirits, so troubled was her mind, that she failed repeatedly in her lessons, and so was in continual disgrace with Miss Day, who threatened more than once to tell her papa.</p><p>It was a threat which Elsie dreaded extremely to have put in execution, and Miss Day, seeing that it distressed her, used it the more frequently, and thus kept the poor child in constant terror.</p><p>How to gain her father's love was the constant subject of her thoughts, and she tried in many ways to win his affection. She always yielded a ready and cheerful obedience to his commands, and strove to anticipate and fulfil all his wishes. But he seldom noticed her, unless to give a command or administer a rebuke, while he lavished many a caress upon his little sister, Enna. Often Elsie would watch him fondling her, until, unable any longer to control her feelings, she would rush away to her own room to weep and mourn in secret, and pray that her father might some day learn to love her. She never complained even to poor old Aunt Chloe, but the anxious nurse watched all these things with the jealous eye<pb n="79 ELSIE DINSMORE."/>of affection; she saw that her child--as she delighted to call her--was very unhappy, and was growing pale and melancholy; and her heart ached for her, and many were the tears she shed in secret over the sorrows of her nursling.<p>"Don't 'pear so sorrowful, darlin'," she sometimes said to her; " try to be merry, like Miss Enna, and run and jump on Massa Horace's knee, and den I tink he will like you better."</p><p>"O mammy! I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi>," Elsie would say; "I don't dare to do it."</p><p>And Chloe would sigh and shake her head sorrowfully.</p><pb n="80"/>Qil'aptcr $fourtl).With more capacity for love than earthRestows on most of mortal mould and birth.""What are our hopes?Like garlands, on afflictions forehead worn,Kissed In the morning, and at evening torn."DAVENPORT'S Aing JoXin and fMotildaSucH had been the state of affairs for about a week,when one morning Elsie and her father met at thebreakfast-room door."Good morning, papa," she said timidly." Good morning, Elsie," he replied in an unusuallypleasant tone.Then taking her by the hand, he led her in andseated her beside himself at the table.Elsie's cheek glowed and her eyes sparkled withpleasure.There were several guests present, and she waitedpatiently while they and the older members of thefamily were being helped.      At lengtth it was herturn."Elsie, will you have some meat?" asked sxrgrandfather." No," said her father, answering for her; " once tday is as often as a child of her age ought to eat<pb n="81"/>tLSLFR DIArN ORi,.              1meat; she may have it at dinner, but never for break.east nor teaThe elder Mr. Dinsmore laughed, saying, "Really,Horace, I had no idea you were so notionate. I al-ways allowed you to eat whatever you pleased, and Inever saw that it hurt you. But of course you mustmanage your own child in your own way.""If you please, papa, I had rather have scme ofthose hot cakes," said Elsie, timidly, as her father laida slice of bread upon her plate." No," said he decidedly; "I don't approve of hotbread for children; you must eat the cold." Thentc a servant who was setting down a cup of coffeebeside the little girl's plate, " Take that away, Pomp,and bring Miss Elsie a tumbler of milk. Or wouldyou prefer water, Elsie ?"" Milk, if you please, papa," she replied with a lit-tle sigh; for she was cxtremely fond of coffee, and itwas something of a trial to give it up.Her father put a spoonful of stewed fruit upon herplate, and as Pompey set down a tumbler of richmilk beside it, said, " Now you have your breakfastbefore you, Elsie. Children in England are not al-lowed to eat butter until they arc ten or eleven yearsof age, and I think it an excellent plan, to make themgrow up rosy and healthy. I have neglected my lit-tle girl too long, but I intend to begin to take goodcare of her now," he added with a smile, and layinghis hand for an instant upon her head.The slight caress and the few kind words were quito<pb n="82"/>82             LLSIE DlINSMORE.enough to reconcile Elsie to the rather meagre fare,and she ate it with a happy heart. But the meagrefare became a constant thing, while the caresses andkind words were not; and though she submittedwithout a murmur, she could not help sometimeslooking with longing eyes at the coffee and hot but-tered rolls, of which she was very fond. But she triedto be contented, saying to herself, " Papa knows best,and I ought to be satisfied with whatever he givesme.""Isn't it delightful to have your papa at home,Elsie?" Mr. Dinsmore one morning overheard Ar-thur saying to his little girl in a mocking tone. " It'svery pleasant to live on bread and water, isn't it, eh ?"" I don't live on bread and water," Elsie replied, alittle indignantly. "Papa always allows me to haveas much good, rich milk, and cream, and fruit as Iwant, or I can have eggs, or cheese, or honey, or any-thing else, except meat, and hot cakes, and butter, andcoffee; and who wouldn't rather do without suchthings all their lives than not have a papa to lovethem   And besides, you know, Arthur, that I canhave all the meat I want at dinner."" Pooh I that's nothing; and I wouldn't give muchfor all the love you get from him," said Arthur, scorn.fully.There was something like a sob from Elsie; and asher father rose and went to the window, he just caaghta glimpse of her white dress disappearing down thegarden walk.<pb n="83"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               83What do you mean, sir, by teasing Elsie in thatmanner I" he exclaimed angrily to Arthur, who stillstood where the little girl had left him, leaning againstone of the pillars of the portico." I only wanted to have a little fun," returned theboy doggedly."Well, sir, I don't approve of such fun, and youwill please to let the child alone in future," repliedhis brother as he returned to his newspaper again.But somehow the paper had lost its interest. Heseemed constantly to hear that little sob, and to seea little face all wet with tears of wounded feeling.Just then the school-bell rang, and suddenly throw-ing down his paper, he took a card from his pocket,wrote a few words upon it, and calling a servant, said,"Take this to Miss Day."Elsie was seated at her desk, beginning her morn-ing's work, when the servant entered and handed thecard to the governess.Miss Day glanced at it and said:" Elsie, your father wants you. You may go."EIsie rose in some trepidation and left the room,wondering what her papa could want with her." Where is papa, Fanny ? " she asked of the servant."In de drawin'-room, Miss Elsie," was the reply;and she hastened to seek him there.He held out his hand as she entered, saying with ssmile, "Come here, daughter."It was the first time he had called her that, and itsent a thrill of joy to her heart.<pb n="84"/>84             ELSIE Di'SMORE.She sprang to his side, and, taking her hand in oneof his, and laying the other gently on her head, andbending it back a little, he looked keenly into herface. It was bright enough now, yet the traces oftears were very evident."You have been crying," he said, in a slightly re-proving tone. " I am afraid you do a great deal moreof that than is good for you. It is a very babyishhabit, and you must try to break yourself of it."The little face flushed painfully, and the eyes filledagain." There," he said, stroking her hair, " don't beginit again. I am going to drive over to Ion, whereyour friend Mr. Travilla lives, to spend the day; wouldmy little daughter like to go with me ?""Oh I so very much, papa !" she answered eagerly."There are no little folks there," he said smiling,"nobody to see but Mr. Travilla and his mother. ButI see you want to go; so run and ask Aunt Chloe toget you ready. Tell her I want you nicely dressed, andthe carriage will be at the door in half an hour."Elsie bounded away to do his bidding, her faceradiant with happiness; and at the specified timecame down again, looking so very lovely that herfather gazed at her with proud delight, and could notrefrain from giving her a kiss as he lifted her up toplace her in the carriage.Then seating himself beside her, he took her handin his; and, closing the door with the other, bade thecoachman drive on.<pb n="85"/>ELSIR DIVSMOnE.             85"I suppose you bave never been to ion, Elsie ?"ho said, inquiringly." No, sir; but I have heard Aunt Adelaide say shethought it a very pretty place," replied the little girl." So it is-almost as pretty as Roseland's," said herfather. " Travilla and I have known each other fromboyhood, and I spent many a happy day at Ion, anawe had many a boyish frolic together, before I everthought of you."lie smiled, and patted her check as he spoke.Elsie's eyes sparkled. "0 papa!" she said ca.gerly, "won't you tell me about those times? Itseems so strange that you were ever a little boy andI was nowhere."He laughed. Then said, musingly, "It seems buta very little while to me, Elsie, since I was no olderthan you are now."He heaved a sigh, and relapsed into silence.Elsie wished very much that he would grant herrequest, but did not dare to disturb him by speakinga word; and they rode on quietly for some time, untila squirrel darting up a tree caught her eye, and sheuttered an exclamation. "0 papa! did you see thatsquirrel ? look at him now, perched up on that branch.There, we have passed the tree, and now he is out ofsight."This reminded Mr. Dinsmore of a day h3 had spentm those woods hunting squirrels, when quite a boy,and he gave Elsie an animated account of it. Oneof the incidents of the day had been the accidental<pb n="86"/>86             ELSIE DINSMORE.discharge of the fowling-piece of one of his youngcompanions, close at Horace Dinsmorc's side, miss-ing him by but a hair's breadth."I felt faint and sick when I knew how near Ihad been to death," he said, as he finished his nar-rative.Elsie had been listening with breathless interest"Dear papa," she murmured, laying her little cheelagainst his hand, "how good God was to spare you:life ! If you had been killed I could never have hadyou for my papa.""Perhaps you might have had a much better one,Elsie," he said gravely."Oh I no, papa, I wouldn't want any other," shereplied earnestly, pressing his hand to her lips."Ah! here we are," exclaimed her father, as atthat instant the carriage turned into a broad avenue,up which they drove quite rapidly, and the next mo-ment they had stopped, the coachman had throwropen the carriage door, and Mr. Dinsmore, springingout, lifted his little girl in his arms and set her downon the steps of the veranda"Ahl Dinsmore, how do you do      Glad to seeyou, and my little friend Elsie too. Why this isreally kind," cried Mr. Travilla, in his cheerful, heartyway, as, hurrying out to welcome them, he shook Mr.Dinsmore cordially by the hand, and kissed Elsie'scheek." Walk in, walk in," he continued, leading the wayinto the house, "my mother will be delighted to set<pb n="87"/>ELSIE DIN.SMORE.                87you both; Miss Elsie especially, for she seems to havetaken a very great fancy to her."If Mrs. Travil!a's greeting was less boisterous, itcertainly was not lacking in cordiality, and shemade Elsie feel at home at once; taking off herbonnet, smoothing her hair, and kissing her affec-tionately.The gentlemen soon went out together, and Elsiespent the morning in Mrs. Travilla's room, chattingwith her and assisting her with some coarse garmentsshe was making for her servants.Mrs. Travilla was an earnest Christian, and the ladyand the little girl were not long in discovering the tiewhich' existed between them.Mrs. Travilla, being also a woman of great discernment, and having known Horace Dinsmore nearly allhis life, had conceived a very correct idea of the trialsand difficulties of Elsie's situation, and without al.luding to them at all, gave her some most excellentadvice, which the little girl received very thank-fully.They were still chatting together when Mr. Travillacame in, saying, "Come, Elsie, I want to take you outto see my garden, hot-house, etc. We will just havetime before dinner. Will you go along, mother ""No; I have some little matters to attend to be-fore dinner, and will leave you to do the honors," re-plied the lady; and taking the little girl's hand heled her out." Where is papa?" asked Elsie<pb n="88"/>88              ELSIE D.LSM1];K."Oh ! he's in the library, looking ovec some newbooks," replied Mr. Travilla. " He always cared morefor books than anything else. But what do youthink of my flowers ?""Oh! they are lovely! What avariety you have.what a splendid cape-jessamine that is! and there isa variety of cactus I never saw before ! Oh ! you havea great many more, and handsomer, I think, than wehave at Roselands," exclaimed Elsie, as she passedadmiringly from one to another.MSr. Travilla was much pleased with the admirationshe expressed, for he was very fond of his flowers,and took great pride in showing them.But they were soon called into dinner, where Elsiewas seated by her father."I hope this little girl has not given you anytrouble, Mrs. Travilla," said he, looking gravely ather."Oh I no," the lady hastened to say, " I have en-joyed her company very much indeed, and hope youwill bring her to see me again very soon."After dinner, as the day was very warm, they ad-journed to the veranda, which was the coolest placeto be found; it being on the shady side of the house,and also protected by thick trees, underneath which abeautiful fountain was playing.But the conversation was upon some suoject whichdid not interest Elsie, and she presently stole awayto the library, and seating herself in a corner of thesofa, was soon lost to everything around her in the<pb n="89"/>ELSIE DLVSMOREE.              89intense interest with which she was reading a bookshe had taken from the table." Ah! that is what you are about, Miss Elsie I abookworm, just like your father, I sec. I had beenwondering what had become of you for the last twonours," exclaimed Mr. Travilla's pleasant voice; andsitting down beside her, he took the book from herhand, and putting it behind him, said, " Put it awaynow; you will have time enough to finish it, and Iwant you to talk to me.""Oh! please let me have it," she pleaded. " I shallnot have much time, for papa will soon be calling nmto go home."" No, no, he is not to take you away; I have madoa bargain with him to let me keep you," said Mr.Travilla, very gravely. " We both think that there arechildren enough at Rosclands without you; and soyour papa has given you to me; and you are to bemy little girl, and call me papa in future."Elsie gazed earnestly in his face for an instant, say-ing in a half-frightened tone, "You are only joking,Mr. Travilla."" Not a bit of it," said he; " can't you see that I'mn earnest ?"His tone and look were both so serious that for aninstant Elsie believed he meant all that he was saying,and springing to her feet with a little cry of alarm, shehastily withdrew her hand which he had taken, andrushing out to the veranda, where her father stillbat conversing with Mrs. Travilia, she flung herself<pb n="90"/>90             ELSIE DIMbsORE.into his arms, and clinging to him, hid her face onhis breast, sobbing, "0 papa, dear papa! don't giveme away; please don't-I will be so good-I win doeverything you bid me-I-""Why, Elsie, what does all this mean " exclaimedMr. Dinsmore in great surprise and perplexity; whileMr. Travilla stood in the doorway looking halfamused, half sorry for what he had done."0 papa!" sobbed the little girl, still clinging tohim as though fearing she should be torn from hisarms, "Mr. Travilla says you have given me to him.O papa! don't give me away."' Pooh I nonsense, Elsie! I am ashamed of you Ihow can you be so very silly as to believe for onemoment anything so perfectly absurd as that 1 shouldthink of giving you away ? Why I would as soon thinkof parting with my eyes."Elsie raised her head and gazed searchingly intohis face; then with a deep-drawn sigh of relief, drop-ped it again, saying, "Oh! I am so glad."' Really, Miss Elsie," said Travila, coming up andpatting her on the shoulder, "I can't say that I feelmuch complimented; and, indeed, I don't see whyyou need have been so very much distressed at theorospect before you; for I must say I have vanityenough to imagine that I should make the better-orat least the more indulgent-father of the two. Comenow, wouldn't you be willing to try me for a month,if your papa will give consent "Elsie shook her head.<pb n="91"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              91"I will let you have your own way in everything,"urged Travilla, coaxingly, "and I know that is morethan he does.""I don't want my own way, Mr. Travilla; I knowit wouldn't always be a good way," replied Elsie,decidedly.Her father laughed and passed his hand caressinglyover her curls."I thought you liked me, little Elsie," said Tra-villa, in a tone of disappointment."So I do, Mr. Travilla; I like you very much," shereplied."Well, don't you think I would make a goodfather ?"" I am sure you would be very kind, and that I shouldiove you very much; but not so much as I love myown papa: because, you know, you are not my papa,and never can be, even if he should give me to you."Mr. Dinsmore laughed heartily, saying, "I thinkyou may as well give it up, Travilla; it seems I'll haveto keep her whether or no, for she clings to me likeleech."" Well, Elsie, you will at least come to the pianoand play a little for me, will you not " asked Tra,villa, smiling.But Elsie still clung to her father, seeming loath toleave him, until he said, in his grave, decided way,"Go, Elsie; go at once, and do as you are requested."Then she rose instantly to obey.Travilla looked somewhat vexed. "1 wish," he<pb n="92"/>92             ELSIE DINSMORE.afterward remarked to his mother, "that Dinsmorewas not quite so ready to second my requests withhis commands. I want Elsie's compliance to be voluntary; else I think it worth very little."Elsie played and sang until they were called totea; after which she sat quietly by her father's side,istening to the conversation of her elders until thecarriage was announced."Well, my daughter," said Mr. Dinsmore, whenthey were fairly upon their way to Rosclands, " haveyou had a pleasant day ?"" Oh! very pleasant, papa, excepting-" She paus-ed, looking a little embarrassed."Well, excepting what ?" he asked, smiling down ather."Excepting when Mr. Travilla frightened me so,papa," she replied, moving closer to his side, blush-ing and casting down her eyes." And you do love your own papa best, and don'twant to exchange him for another " he said inquiring-ly, as he passed his arm affectionately around her waist." Oh! no, dear papa, not for anybody ese in all theworld," she said earnestly.He made no repty in words, but, looking highlygratified, bent down and kissed her cheek.He did not speak again during their ride, but whenthe carriage stopped he lifted her out, and settingher gently down, bade her a kind good-nigLi., sayingit was time for mammy to put her to bed.She ran lightly up-stairs, and springing into Lei<pb n="93"/>ELSIE DIYSJORE.             93nurse's arms, exclaimed, "0 nainmy, mammy! what apleasant, pleasant day I have had ? Papa has beenio kind, and so were Mr. Travilla and his mother."" I'se berry glad, darlin', an' I hope you gwine habmany more such days," replied Chloe, embracing herfondly and then proceeding to talke off her bonnet-and prepare her for bed, while Elsie gave her a minute account of all the occurrences of the day, notomitting the fright Mr. Travilla had given her, andhow happily her fears had been relieved." You look berry happy, my darlin' pet," said Chloe,clasping her nursling again in her arms when her taskwas finished." Yes, mammy, I am happy, oh I so happy, becauseI do believe that papa is beginning to love me a little,and I hope that perhaps, after a while, he will loveme very much."The tears gathered in her eyes as she spoke.The next afternoon, as Elsie was returning from herwalk, she met her father." Elsie," said he, in a reproving tone, " I have for.bidden you to walk out alone; are you disobeying"No, papa," she replied meekly, raiEing her eyesto his face, " I was not alone until about five minutesago, when Aunt Adelaide and Louise left me. Theysaid it did not matter, as I was so near home; andthey were going to make a call, and did not want mealong.""Very well," he said, taking hold of her hand and<pb n="94"/>94             ELSIE DINS1rOREmaking her walk by his side. "  ow far have youbeen ?"" We went down the river bank to the big spring,papa. I believe it is a little more than a mile thatway; but when we came home, we made it shorter bycoming across some of the fields and through themeadow.""Through the meadow?" said Mr. Dinsmore;"don't you go there again Elsie, unless I give you ex-press permission."" Why, papa " she asked, looking up at him insome surprise." Because I forbid it," he replied sternly; "that isquite enough for you to know; all you have to do isto obey, and you need never ask me why, when Igive.you an order."Elsie's eyes filled, and a big tear rolled quicklydown her cheek." I did not mean to be naughty, papa," she said,struggling to keep down a sob, " and I will try neverto ask why again.""There is another thing," said he.  "You cryquite too easily; it is entirely too babyish for a girlof your age; you must quit it."" I will try, papa," said the little girl, wiping hereyes, and making a great effort to control her feelings.They had entered the avenue while this conversa-tion was going on, and were now drawing near thehouse; and just at this moment a little girl aboutElsie's age came running to meet them, exclaiming,<pb n="95"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              950 Elsie! I'm glad you've come at last. We've beeshere a whole hour-mamma, and Herbert, and I-andI've been looking for you all this time."A" How do you do, Miss Lucy Carrington ? I seeyou can talk as fast as ever," said Mr. Dinsmore,laughing, and holding out his band.Lucy took it, saying, with a litle pout, " To be sure,Mr. Dinsmore, it isn't more than two or three weekssince you were at our house, and I wouldn't forget howto talk in that time." Then looking at Elsie, she wenton, " We've come to stay a week; won't we have afine time ?" and, catching her friend round the waist,she gave her a hearty squeeze."I hope so," said Elsie, returning the embrace."I am glad you have come.""Is your papa here, Miss Lucy " asked -Mr.Dinsmore."Yes, sir; but he's going home again to-night,and then he'll come back for us next week"" I must go in and speak to him," said Mr. Dinsmore. "Elsie, do you entertain Lucy.""Yes, sir, I will," said Elsie.  "Come with meto my room, won't you, Lucy "" Yes; but won't you speak to mamma first ? andHerbert too; you are such a favorite with both ofthem; and they still are in the dressing-room, formamma is not very well, and was quite fatigued withher ride."Lucy led the way to her mamma's room, as shespoke, Elsie following.<pb n="96"/>96             ELSIE DINSMORE."Ah 1 Elsie dear, how do you do?      I'm  de-lighted to see you," said Mrs. Carrington, risingfrom the sofa as they entered.Then, drawing the little girl closer to her, shepassed her arm affectionately around her waist, andkissed her several times."I suppose you are very happy now that yourpapa has come home at last?" she said, lookingsearchingly into Elsie's face. " I remember you usedto be looking forward so to his return; constantlytalking of it and longing for it."Poor Elsie, conscious that her father's presencehad not brought with it the happiness she hadantici,,ated, and yet unwilling either to acknowledgethat fact or tell an untruth, was at a loss what tosay..But she was relieved from the necessity of replyingby Herbert, Lucy's twin brother, a pale, sickly-look-ing boy, who had for several years been a suffererfiom hip complaint."O Elsie!" he exclaimed, catching hold of herhand and squeezing it between both of his, "I'mever so glad to see you again.""Yes," said Mrs. Carrington, "Herbert alwayssays nobody can tell him such beautiful stories asElsie; and nobody but his mother and his oldmammy was half so kind to run and wait on himwhen he was laid on his back for so many weeks.He missed you very much when we went home, andoften wished he was at Roselands again."<pb n="97"/>IFSIE DINSMORE.              97"How   is your hip now, Herbert " asked Elsie,looking pityingly at the boy's pale face."     Oh  a great deal better, thank you.  I can takequite long walks sometimes now, though I still limp,and cannot run and leap like other boys."They chatted a few moments longer, and then Elsiewent to her room to have her hat taken off, and ierhair made smooth before the tea-bell should ring.The two little girls were seated together at thetable, Elsie's papa being on her other side."How nice these muffins are ! Don't you like themElsie? " asked Lucy, as she helped hersclf to a thir'lor fourth."Yes, very much," said Elsie, cheerfully."Then what are you eating that cold bread for and you haven't got any butter either. Pompcy, whydon't you hand Miss Elsie the butter ""No, Lucy, I mustn't bave it.   Papa does notallow me to eat hot cakes nor butter," said Elsie,m the same cheerful tone in which she had spokenbefore.Lucy opened her eyes very wide, and drew in herbreath." Well !" she exclaimed, " I guess if my papa s'.louldtry that on me, I'd make such a fuss he'd haec to letme eat just whatever I wanted.""Elsie knows better than to do tlat," said Mr.Dinsmore, who had overheard the conversatio n; " shewould only get sent away from the table and punished for her naughtiness."<pb n="98"/>98             ELSIE DINSMfORE."I wouldn't do it anyhow, papa," said Elsie, raising her eyes beseechingly to his face."No, daughter, I don't believe you would," he replied in an unusually kind tone, and Elsie's face flush-ed with pleasure.Several days passed away very pleasantly, Lucysharing Elsie's studies in the mornings, while Herbertremained with his mamma; and then in the after-noon all walking or riding out together, unless theweather was too warm, when they spent the after-noon playing in the veranda, on the shady side of thehouse, and took their ride or walk after the sun wasdown.Arthur and Walter paid but little attention to IIer-bert, as his lameness prevented him from sharing inthe active sports which they preferred; for they hadnever been taught to yield their wishes to others, andwere consequently extremely selfish and overbearing;but Elsie was very kind, and did all in her power tointerest and amuse him.One afternoon they all walked out together, at-tended by Jim; but Arthur and Walter, unwilling toaccommodate their pace to Herbert's slow movements,were soon far in advance, Jim following close at theirheels."They're quite out of sight," said Herbert presently, " an(' Im very tired. Let's sit down on thisbank, girls: I want to try my new bow, and you mayrun and pick up my arrows for me ?"" Thank you, sir." said Lucy, laughing;" Elsie may<pb n="99"/>ELStE DINSMORS.               99do it if she likes, but as for me, I mean to take a nap;this nice, soft grass will make an elegant couch;" andthrowing herself down, she soon was, or pretendedto be, in a sound slumber; while Herbert, seating him-self with his back against a tree, amused himself withshooting his arrows here and there, Elsie running forthem and bringing them to him, until she was quiteheated and out of breath."Now I must rest a little, Herbert," she said atlength, sitting down beside him. "Shall I tell you astory ?""Oh I yes, do; I like your stories, and I don't mindleaving off shooting till you're done," said he, layingdown his bow.Elsie's story lasted about ten minutes, and whenshe had finished, Herbert took up his bow again, say-ing, " I guess you're rested now, Elsie," and sent anarrow over into the meadow."There just see how far I sent that I do run andbring it to me, Elsie," he cried, " and let me see if Ican't hit that tree next time; I've but just missed it.""I'm tired, Herbert, but I'll run and bring it toyou this once," replied Elsie, forgetting entirely herfather's prohibition; "but then you must try to waituntil Jim comes back before you shoot any more."So saying, she darted away, and came back in amoment with the arrow in her hand. But a suddenrecollection had come over her just as she left themeadow, and throwing down the arrow at the boy'sfeet, she exclaimed in an agitated tone- " 0 Herbert 1U<pb n="100"/>100           ELSIE DilNSMORR.     -I must go home just as quickly as I can; I had fot.gotten-oh ! how could I forget oh I what will papasay !""Why, what's the matter?" asked Herbert inalarm."Never mind," said Elsie, sobbing. "There arethe boys coming; they will take care of you, and Imust go home. Good-bye."And she ran quickly up the road, Herbert following her retreating form with wondering eyes.Elsie sped onward, crying bitterly as she went." Where is papa " she inquired of a servant whomshe met in the avenue." Dunno Miss Elsie, but I reckon Massa Horace amm de house, kase his horse am in de stable."Elsie hardly waited for the answer, but hurryinginto the house, went from room to room, looking andlsking in vain for her father. He was not in theirawing-room, nor the library, nor his own apart-mlents. She had just come out of these, and meet-ing a chamber-maid in the hall, she exclaimed, " 0Fanny I where is papa ? can't you tell me ? for I mustsee him.""Here I am, Elsie; what ao you want with me 1"called out her father's voice from the veranda, whereshe had neglected to look."What do you want ?" he repeated, as his little girlappeared before him with her flushed and tearful face.Elsie moved slowly toward him, with a timid airand downcast eyes.<pb n="101"/>ELSIE DINSMfORE.            101"I wanted to tell you something, papa," she said ina low, tremulous tone." Well, I am listening," said he, taking hold of herhand and drawing her to his side. " What is it areyou sick or hurt ?""No, papa, not either; but-but, 0 papa! I havebeen a very naughty girl," she exclaimed, burstinginto tears, and sobbing violently. " I disobeyed you,papa. I-I have been in the meadow.""Is it possible ! Would you dare to do so whenI so positively forbid it only the other day ?" he saidin his sternest tone, while a dark frown gathered onhis brow. "Elsie, I shall have to punish you.""I did not intend to disobey you, papa," shesobbed; "I quite forgot that you had forbiddep meto go there." ,"That is no excuse, no excuse at all," said he,severely; "you must remember my commands; and ifyour memory is so poor I shall find means tiStrengthen it."He paused a moment, still looking sternly at thelittle, trembling, sobbing girl at his side; then asked,"What were you doing in the meadow ? tell me thewhole story, that I may understand just how severelyI ought to punish you."Elsie gave him all the particulars; and when, upomquestioning her closely, he perceived how entirelyvoluntary her confession had been, his tone and man.ner became less stern, and he said quite mildly,"U Vel   Elsie, I shall not be very severe with you2<pb n="102"/>'102           ELSIE DINSMORE.this time, as you seem to be very penitent, and havemade so full and frank a confession; but beware howyou disobey me again, for you will .not escape soeasily another time; and remember I will not takeforgetfulness as any excuse. Go now to Aunt Chloe,and tell her from me that she is to put you immcdiately to bed.""It is only the middle of the afternoon, papa,'said Elsie, deprecatingly."If it were much earlier, Elsie, it would make nodifference; you must go at once to your bed, andstay there until to-morrow morning.""What will Lucy and Herbert think when theycome in and can't find me, papa " she said, weepingafresh."You should have thought of that before you dis-obeyed me," he answered very gravely. " If you arehungry," he added, "you may ask Chloe to get youa slice of bread or a cracker for your supper, but youcan have nothing else."Elsie lingered, looking timidly up into his face asthough wanting to say something, but afraid to ven-ture."Speak, Elsie, if you have anything more to say,"he said encouragingly." Dear papa, I am so sorry I have been so naughty,"bhe murmured, leaning her head against the arm ofhis chair, while the tears rolled fast down her cheeks;"won't you please forgive me, papa it seems to meI can't go to sleep to-night if you are angry with me."<pb n="103"/>ELSIE DINSHOR.              I103He seemed quite touched by her penitence. "Yes,Elsie," he said, "I do forgive you. I am not at allangry with you now, and you may go to sleep inpeace. Good night, my little daughter," and he bentdown and pressed his lips to her brow.Elsie held up her face for another, and he kissedher lips." Good night, dear papa," she said, "I hope I shallnever be such a naughty girl again." And she wentto her room, made almost happy by that kiss of for-giveness.Elsie was up quite early the next morning and hadlearned all her lessons before breakfast. As she camedown the stairs she saw, through the open door, herpapa standing with some of the men-servants, appar-ently gazing at some object lying on the ground.She ran out and stood on the steps of the portico,ooking at them and wondering what they were doing.Presently her father turned round, and seeing herneld out his hand, calling, "Come here, Elsie."She sprang quickly down the steps, and running tohim, put her hand in his, saying, "Good morning,papa""Good morning, daughter," said he, " I have some-thing to show you."And leading her forward a few paces, he pointedto a large rattlesnake lying there."0 papa 1" she cried, starting back and clingingto him."It will not hurt you now," he said: "it is dead<pb n="104"/>104           ELSIE DINSMORE.the men killed it this morning in the meadow. Doyou see now why I forbid you to go there "' O papa!" she murmured, in a low tone of deepFeeling, !aying her cheek affectionately against hisband, "I might have lost my life by my disobedi-ence. How good God was to take care of me! Oh !I hope I shall never be so naughty again.""I hope not," said he gravely, but not unkindly;"and I hope that you will always, after this, believethat your father has some good reason for his com-mands, even although he may not choose to explainit to you."" Yes, papa, I think I will," she answered, humbly.The breakfast-bell had rung, and he now led her inand seated her at the table.Lucy Canington looked curiously at her, and soontook an opportunity to whisper, "Where were youlast night, Elsie 8 I couldn't find you, and your papawouldn't say what had become of you, though I amquite sure he knew."" I'll tell you after breakfast," replied Elsie, blush-ing deeply.Lucy waited rather impatiently until all had risenfrom the table, and then, putting her arm roundElsie's waist, she drew her out on to the veranda,saying, "Now, Elsie, tell me; you know you prom-ised.""I was in bed," replied Elsie, dropping her eyes,while the color mounted to her very hair."In bedl before five o'clock!" exclaimed Lucy,<pb n="105"/>ELSIE DINSMIORe            105ir, a tone of astonishment. "Why, what was thatfor ?"" Papa sent me," replied Elsie, with an effort. "1bad been naughty, and disobeyed him.""'Why, how strange! Do tell me what youhad done!" exclaimed Lucy, with a face full ofcuriosity."Papa had forbidden me to go into the meadow,and I forgot all about it, and ran in there to get Her-bert's arrow for him," replied Elsie, looking verymuch ashamed." Was that all why, my papa wouldn't have pun-ished me for that," said Lucy. "lie might havescolded me a little if I had done it on purpose,but if I had told him I had forgotten, he would onlyhave said, ' You must remember better next time."'"Papa says that forgetfulness is no excuse; that Iam to remember his commands, and if I forget, hewill have to punish me, to wake me remember betternext time," said Elsie."He must be very strict indeed; I'm glad he isnot my papa," replied Lucy, in a tone of great satis.faction."Come, little girls, make baste and get ready; weare to start in half an hour," said Adelaide Dinsmore,calling to them from the hall door.The whole family, old and young, including visitors,were on that day to go on a picnic up the river,taking their dinner along, and spending the day inthe woods. Thev had been planning this excursion<pb n="106"/>106            ELSIE DmNSROR9.for several days, and the children especially hadbeen looking forward to it with a great deal ofpleasure."Am I to go, Aunt Adelaide did papa say so "asked Elsie anxiously, as she and Lucy hastened toobey the summons."I presume you are to go of course, Elsie; wehave been discussing the matter for the last threedays, always taking it for granted that you were tomake one of the party, and he has never said youshould not," replied Adelaide, good-naturedly; "somake haste, or you will be too late. But here comesyour papa now," she added, as the library dooropened, and Mr. Dinsmore stepped out into the hallwhere they were standing."Horace, Elsie is to go of course ""I do not see the of course, Adelaide," said hedrily. "No; Elsie is not to go; she must stay at'ome and attend to her lessons as usual."A look of keen disappointment came over Elsie'sface, but she turned away without a word and wentup-stairs; while Lucy, casting a look of wrathful in.dignation at Mr. Dinsmore, ran after her, and follow-ing her into her room, she put her arm round herneck, saying, "Never mind, Elsie; it's too bad, andI wouldn't bear it. I'd go in spite of him.""No, no, Lucy, I must obey my father; God savyso; and besides, I couldn't do that if I wanted to, forpapa is stronger than I am, and would punish meseverely if I were to attempt such a thing," replied<pb n="107"/>ELSIE DJISNIORE.            107Elsic hastily, brushing away a tear that would comeinto her eye.' Then I'd coax him," said Lucy. " Come, I'll gowith you, and we will both try."" No," replied Elsie, with a hopeless shake of thehead, " I have found out already that my papa neverbreaks his word; and nothing could induce him tolet me go, now that he has once said I should not.But you will have to leave me, Lucy, or you will betoo late.""Good-bye, then," said Lucy, turning to go; "butI think it is a great shame, and I sha'n't half enjoymyself without you.""Well now, Horace, I think you might let thechild go," was Adelaide's somewhat indignant re-joinder to her brother, as the two little girls disap-peared; "I can't conceive what reason you can havefor keeping her at home, and she looks so terriblyiisappointed. Indeed, Horace, I am sometimes halfinclined to think you take pleasure in thwarting thatchild.""You had better call me a tyrant at once, Ade-laide," said he angrily, and turning very red; "but Imust beg to be permitted to manage my own childin my own way; and I cannot see that I am underany obligation to give my reasons either to you orto any one else.""Well, if you did not intend to let her go,I think you might have said so at first, and notleft the poor child to build her hopes upon it, onlyg*<pb n="108"/>108             ELSIE DINlSMORE.to be disappointed.  I must say I think it wascruel.""Until this morning, Adelaide," he replied, "Idid intend to let her go, for I expected to go myself;but I find I shall not be able to do so, as I must meeta gentleman on business; and as I know that acci-dents frequently occur to such pleasure parties, Idon't feel willing to let Elsie go, unless I could be theremyself to take care of her. Whether you believe itor not, it is really regard for my child's safety, and nolcruelty, that leads me to refuse her this gratification.""You are full of notions about that child, Hor-ace," said Adelaide, a little impatiently.   " I'msure some of the rest of us could take care of her.""No; in case of accident you would all haveenough to do to take care of yourselves, and I shallnot think-of trusting Elsie in the company, since Icannot be there myself," he answered decidedly;and Adelaide, seeing he was not to be moved fromhis determination, gave up the attempt, and left theroom to prepare for her ride.It was a great disappointment to Elsie, and for afew moments her heart rose up in rebellion againsther father. She tried to put away the feeling, but itwould come back; for she could not imagine anyreason for his refusal to let her go, excepting thedisobedience of the day before, and it seemed hardand unjust to punish her twice for the same fault,especially as he would have known nothing about itbut for hei own frank and voluntary confession.<pb n="109"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              109it was a great pity she had not heard the reaaonshe gave her Aunt Adelaide, for then she wouldhave been quite submissive and content.  It is in-deed true that she ought to have been as it was;but our little Elsie, though sincerely desirous tV doright, was not yet perfect, and had already strangelyforgotten the lesson of the morning.She watched from the veranda the departure ofthe pleasure-seekers, all apparently in the gayestspirits. She was surprised to see that her father wasnot with them, and it half reconciled her to stayingat home, although she hardly expected to see muchof him; but there was something pleasant in thethought that he wanted her at home because he wasto be there himself; it looked as though he reallyhad some affection for her, and even a selfish lovewas better than none. I do not mean that thesewere Elsie's thoughts; no, she never would havedreamed of calling her father selfish; but the unde-fined feeling was there, as she watched him hand theladies into the carriage, and then turn and reenterthe house as they drove off.But Miss Day's bell rang, and Elsie gathered upher books and hastened to the school-room. Herpatience and endurance were sorely tried that morning,for Miss Day was in an exceedingly bad humor, beinggreatly mortified and also highly indignant that shehad not been invited to make one of the picnicparty; and Elsie had never found her more unreason-able and difficult to nlease and her incessant fault-I* 2<pb n="110"/>10            ELSIE DINSMORE.finding and scolding were almost more than the littlegirl could bear in addition to her own sad disappoint-ment. But at last the morning, which had seldomseemed so long, was over, and Elsie dismissed fromthe school-room for the day.At dinner, instead of the usual large party, therewere only her father and the gentleman with whomhe was transacting business, Miss Day, and herself.The gentleman was not one of those who care tonotice children, but continued to discuss business andpolitics with Mr. Dinsmore, without seeming to be intne least aware of the presence of the little girl, whosat in perfect silence, eating whatever her father sawfit to put upon her plate; and Elsie was very glad in-deed when at length Miss Day rose to leave the table,and her papa told her she might go too.He called her back though, before she had goneacross the room, to say that he had intended to ridewith her that afternoon, but found he should not beable to do so, and she must take Jim for a protector,as he did not wish her either to miss her ride or togo entirely alone.He spoke very khLdiy, and Elsie thought with re-morse of the rebellious feelings of the morning, and,had she been alone with her father, would certainlyhave confessed them, expressing her sorrow and askingforgiveness; but she could not do so before a thirdperson,' more especially a stranger; and merely say-ing, " Yes, papa, I will," she turned away and left the,oom. Jim was bringing up her horse as she passed<pb n="111"/>crugt    M7Siu'RE.

What they had bought for the pic-nic looked so good, but you know I didn't get anyof it."The picnic party returned just before tea-time, andLucy Carrington rushed into Elsie's room eager totell her what a delightful day they had had. Shegave a very glowing account of their sports and enter-ainment, interrupting herself every now and then tolament over Elsie's absence, assuring her again andagain that it had been the only drawback upon her ownpleasure, and that she thought that Elsie's papa wasvery unkind indeed to refuse her permission to go.And as Elsie listened the morning's feelings of vexa-tion and disappointment returned in full force; andthough she said nothing, she allowed her friend tUaccuse her father of cruelty and injustice withoutoffering any remonstrance.In the midst of their talk the tea-bell rang, aLd<pb n="112"/>112           ELSIE DIySraP?.they hurried down to take their places at the table,where Lucy went on with her narrative, though in arather subdued tone, Elsie now and then asking aquestion, until Air. Dinsmore turned to his daughter,saying, in his stern way, "Be quiet Elsie; you aretalking entirely too much for a child of your age;don't let me hear you speak again until you have leftthe table."Elsie's face flushed, and her eyes fell, under therebuke; and during the rest of the meal not a soundescaped her lips." Come, Elsie, let us go into the garden and finishour talk," said Lucy, putting her arm affectionatelyaround her friend's waist as they left the table;" your papa can't hear ug there, and we'll have a goodtime.""Papa only stopped us because we were talkingtoo much at the table," said Elsie, apologetically;" I'm sure he is willing you should tell me all aboutwhat a nice time you all had. But, Lucy," she added,lowering her voice, " please don't say again that youthink papa was unkind to keep me at home today. I'm sure he knows best, and I ought not tonave listened to a word of that kind about him.""Oh! well, never mind, I won't talk so any more,"said Lucy good-naturedly, as they skipped down thewalk together; "but I do think he's cross, and Iwish you were my sister, that you might have mykind, good papa for yours too," she added, drawingher arm more closely about her friend's waist.<pb n="113"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.            113"Thank you, Lucy," said Elsie, with a little sigh.u I would like to be your sister, but indeed I wouldnot like to give up my own dear papa, for I love him,oh ! so much."" Why, how funny, when he's so cross to you!"exclaimed Lucy, laughing.Elsie put her hand over her friend's mouth, andLucy pushed it away, saying, "Excuse me; I forgotbut I'll try not to say it again."While the little girls were enjoying their talk inthe garden, a servant with a small bundle in her handcame out on the veranda, where Mr. Horace Dins-more was sitting smoking a cigar, and, casting an in-quiring glance around, asked if he knew where MissElsie was ?"What do you want with her 8 " he asked."Only to give her dis bundle, massa, dat Pompjus brought from de city."" Give it to me," he said, extending his hand to re-ceive it.A few moments afterward Elsie and her friend re-turned to the house, and meeting Pomp, she askedhim if he had brought her candy.He replied that he had got some that was verynice indeed, and he thought that Fanny had carriedit to her; and seeing Fanny near, he called to herto know what she had done with it." Why, Pomp, Massa Horace he told me to give itto him," said the girl.Elsie turned away with a very disappointed look.<pb n="114"/>114           ELSIE DINSMORE." You'll go and ask him for it, won't you I" askedLucy, who was anxious to enjoy a share of the candyas well as to see Elsie gratified."No," said Elsie, sighing, " I had rather do with-but it."Lucy coaxed for a little while, but finding it im-possible to persuade Elsie to approach ier father oithe subject, finally volunteered to do the errand her-self.Elsie readily consented, and Lucy, trembling a littlein spite of her boast that she was not afraid of him,walked out on to the veranda where Mr. Dinsmorewas still sitting, and putting on an air of great con-fidence, said:" Mr. Dinsmore, will you please to give me Elsie'scandy t she wants it."" Did Elsie send you t" he asked in a cold, gravetone." Yes, sir," replied Lucy, somewhat frightened."Then, if you please, Miss Lucy, you may tellElsie to come directly to me."Lucy ran back to her friend, and Elsie received themessage in some trepidation, but as no choice wasnow left her, she went immediately to her father." Did you want me, papa? " she asked timidly." Yes, Elsie; I wish to know why you send anotherperson to me for what you want, instead of comingyourself. It displeases me very much, and you mayrest assured that you will never get anything thatyou ask for in that way."<pb n="115"/>ELSIE DDTSMORE.             115Elsie hung her head in silence."Are you going to answer me? " he asked, in hlssevere tone. "WIhy did you send Lucy instead ofcoming yourself ?"" I was afraid, papa," she whispered, almost underher breath." Afraid I afraid of what " he asked, with mcrcas-ing displeasure." Of you, papa," she replied, m a tone so low thathe could scarcely catch the words, although'he bentdown his ear to receive her reply." If I were a drunken brute, in the habit of knockmg you about, beating and abusing you, there mightbe some reason for your fear, Elsie," he said, coloringwith anger; " but as it is, I see no excuse for it at all,and I am both hurt and displeased by it.""I am very sorry, papa; I won't do so again," shesaid, tremblingly.There was a moment's pause, and then she asked ina timid, hesitating way, " Papa, may I have my candy,if yvu please?""No, you may not," he said decidedly; " and un-derstand and remember that I positively forbid youeither to buy or eat anything of the kind again with-out my express permission."Elsie's eyes filled, and she had a hard struggle tokeep down a rising sob as she turned away and wentslowly back to the place where she had left herfriend."Have you got it ?" asked Lucy, eagerly.<pb n="116"/>It6            ELSIE DI.SM JIOE.Elsie shook her head."What a shame 1" exclaimed Lucy, indignantiy;he's just as cross as he can be. IIe's a tyrant, sohe is I just a hateful old tyrant, and I wouldn't carea cent for him, if I were you, Elsie. I'm glad he isnot my father, so I am."" I'm afraid he doesn't love me much," sighed Elsiein low, tearful tones, " for he hardly ever lets me haveanything, or go anywhere that I want to.""Well, never mind, 1'll send and buy a good lotto-morrow, and we'll have a regular feast," said Lucy,soothingly, as she passed her arm around her friend'swaist and drew her down to a seat on the porticostep." Thank you, Lucy, you can buy for yourself if youlike, but not for me, for papa has forbidden me to eatanything of the sort."" Oh I of course we'll not let him know anythingabout it," said Lucy.But Elsie shook her head sadly, saying with a littlesigh, " No, Lucy, you are very kind, but I cannot dis-obey papa, even if he should never know it, becausethat would be disobeying God, and He would knowt.""Dear me, how particular you are!" exclaimedLucy a little pettishly."Elsie," said Mr. Dinsmore, speaking from thedoor, " what are you doing there ? Did I not forbidyou to be oat in the evening air I""T did not know you meant the doorstep, papa.<pb n="117"/>ELSIE DlSMOORE.            11I thought I was only not to go down into the gar.den," replied the little girl, rising to go in." I see you intend to make as near an approach todisobedience as you dare," said her father. " Go immediately to your room, and tell mammy to put youto bed."Elsie silently obeyed, and Lucy, casting an indig-nant glance at Mr. Dinsmore, was about to followher, when he said, "I wish her to go alone, if youplease, Miss Lucy;" and with a frown and a pout thelittle girl walked into the drawing-room and seatedherself on the sofa beside her mamma.Mr. Dinsmore walked out on to the portico, andstood there watching the moon which was just risingover the treetops." Horace," said Arthur, emerging from the shadowof a tree near by and approaching his brother, " Elsiethinks you're a tyrant. She says you never let herhave anything, nor go anywhere, and you're alwayspunishing her. She and Lucy have had a fine timeout here talking over your bad treatment of her, andplanning to have some candy in spite of you."" Arthur, I do not believe that Elsie would delib-erately plan to disobey me; and whatever faults shemay have, I am very sure she is above the meannessof telling tales," replied Mr. Dinsmore, in a tone ofseverity, as he turned and went into the house, whileArthur, looking sadly crestfallen, crept away out ofsight.When Elsie reached her room, she found that<pb n="118"/>118            ELSIE DINSMORE.Chloe was not there; for, not expecting that her serv-ices would be required at so early an hour, she had gonedown to the kitchen to have a little chat with herfellow-servants. Elsie rang for her, and then walkingto the window, stood looking down into the gardenin an attitude of thoughtfulness and dejection. Shewas mentally taking a review of the manner in whichshe had spent the day, as was her custom before re-tiring. The retrospect had seldom been so painful tothe little girl. She had a very tender conscience, andit told her now that she had more than once duringthe day indulged in wrong feelings toward her father;that she had also allowed another to speak disrespect-fully of him, giving by her silence a tacit approval ofthe sentiments uttered, and, more than that, hadspoken complainingly of him herself."Oh I" she murmured half aloud as she coveredher face with her hands, and the tears trickledthrough her fingers, "how soon I have forgotten thelesson papa taught me this morning, and my promiseto trust him without knowing his reasons. I don'tdeserve that he should love me or.be kind and indul-gent, when I am so rebellious.""What's de matter, darlin' ?" asked Chloe's voicein pitiful tones, as she took her nursling in her armsand laid her little head against her bosom, passing herhand caressingly over the soft bright curls; " your olemammy can't bear to see her pet cryin' like dat.""0 mammy, mammy l I've been such a wickedgirl to day! Oh! I'm afraid I shall never be good,<pb n="119"/>ELSIE DINSlrORE.              119never be like Jesus. I'm afraid He is angry with me,for I have disobeyed him to-day," sobbed the child." Darlin'," said Chloe, earnestly, "didn't you readto your ole mammy dis very morning dese bressedwords: ' If any man sin, we have an advocate with theFather, Jesus Christ the righteous,' an' de other:' Ifwe confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgiveus our sins.'  Go to de dear, bressed Lord Jesus,darlin', an' ax Him to forgive you, an' I knows He will.""Yes, He will," replied the little girl, raising herhead and dashing away her tears, "He will forgivemy sins, and take away my wicked heart, and giveme right thoughts and feelings. How glad I am youremembered those sweet texts, you dear old mammy,"she added, twining her arms lovingly around hernurse's neck.  And then she delivered her papa'smessage, and Chloe began at once to prepare her forbed.Elsie's tears had ceased to flow, but they were stilltrembling in her eyes, and the little face wore a verysad and troubled expression as she stood patientlypassive in her nurse's hands. Chloe had soon finishedher labors, and then the little girl opened her Bible,and, as usual, read a few verses aloud, though hervoice trembled, and once or twice a tear fell on thepage; then closing the book she stole away to the sideof the bed and knelt down.She was a good while on her knees, and severaltimes, as the sound of a low sob fell upon Chloe's ear,she sighed and murmured to herself, " Poor darlin' I<pb n="120"/>120            ELSI' DINSMORE.dear, bressed lamb, your ole mammy don't like tohear dat."Then as the child rose from her kneeling postureshe went to her, and taking her in her arms, foldedher in a fond embrace, calling her by the most tenderand endearing epithets, and telling that her old mam-my loved her better than life-better than anythingin the wide world.Elsie flung her arms around her nurse's neck, andlaid her head upon her bosom, saying, "Yes, mydear old mammy, I know you love me, and I loveyou too. But put me in bed now, or papa will bedispleased.""What makes you so onrestless, darlin' t" askedChloe, half an hour afterward; "can't you go tosleep no how ""0 mammy! if I could only see papa just forone moment to tell him something. Do you thinkhe would come to me?" sighed the little girL"Please, mammy, go down and see if he is busy.Don't say a word if he is; but if not, ask him to cometo me for just one minute."Chloe left the room immediately, but returned thenext moment, saying, "I jes looked into de parlor,darlin', an' Mass Horace he mighty busy playin' chesawid Miss Lucy's mamma, an' I didn't say nffin' tohim. Jes you go sleep, my pet, an' tell Mass Horaceall 'bout it in de mornin'."Elsie sighed deeply, and turning over on her pillow,cried herself to sleep.<pb n="121"/>ELSIE DIVSSMGE.             121Ch'oe was just putting the finishing touches to the/ittle girl's dress the next morning. when Lucy Car.rington rapped at the door."Good morning, Elsie," she said; "I was in ahurry to come to you, because it is my last day, youknow. Wasn't it too bad of your father to send youoff to bed so early last night "" No, Lucy; papa has a right to send me to becwhenever he pleases; and besides, I was naughty anddeserved to bi punished; and it was not much morethan half an hour earlier than my usual bedtime.""You naughty!" exclaimed Lucy, opening heteyes very wide. "Mamma often says she wishes 1was half as good."Elsie sighed, but made no answer. Her thoughtsseemed far away. She was thinking of what she hadbeen so anxious, the night before, to say to her father,and trying to gain courage to do it this morning."If I could only get close to him when nobody wasby, and he would look and speak kindly to me, Icould do it then," she murmured to herself." Come, Aunt Chloe, aren't you done? I want tohave a run in the garden before breakfast,".said Lucy,somewhat impatiently, as Chloe tied and untied Elsie'ssash several times."Well, Miss Lucy, I'se done now," she answeredPassing her hand once more over her nursling's curls"but Mass Horace he mighty pertickler 'bout MissElsie.""Yes," R-aid Elsie, "papa wants me always to look<pb n="122"/>2 -2          ELSIE DIdSMORAvery nice aLn  neat; and when I go down in themorning he just gives me one glance from head tofoot, and if anything is wrong he is sure to see it andsend me back immediately to have it made right.Now, mammy, please give me my hat and let ub go.""You's got plenty ob time, chillens; de bell won'tgo for to ring dis hour," remarked the old nurse,tying on Elsie's hat."My chile looks sweet an' fresh as a moss rosebud dismornin'," she added, talking to herself, as she watchedthe two little girls tripping down-stairs hand in hand.They skipped up and down the avenue severaltimes, and ran all round the garden before it wastime to go in. Then Elsie went up to Chloe to haveher hair made smooth again. She was just descendingfor the second time to the hall, where she had left Lucy,when they saw a carriage drive up to the front door."There's papa I" cried Lucy, joyfully, as it stoppedmnd a gentleman sprang out and came up the stepstnto the portico; and in an instant she was in hisarms, receiving such kisses and caresses as Elsie hadvainly longed for all her life.Lucy had several brothers, but was an oi;iydaughter, and a very great pet, especially with herfather.Elsie watched them with a wistful look and astrange aching at her heart.But presently Mr. Carrington set Lucv down, andturning to her, gave her a shake of the hand, and thena kiss. saying, " Hew do you do this morning, my<pb n="123"/>ELSIE DIITSMOR.             123dear I I'm afraid you are hardly glad to see me, aaI come to take Lucy away, for I suppose you havebeen having fine times together.""Yes, sir, indeed we have; and I hope you will lether come again."" Oh I yes, certainly; but the visits must not be all onone side. I shall talk to your papa about it, and per-haps persuade him to let us take you along thisafternoon to spend a week at Ashlands."" Oh I how delightful !" cried Lucy, clapping herhands. " Elsie, do you think he will let you go ?""I don't know, I'm afraid not," replied the littlegirl, doubtfully."You must coax him, as I do my papa," saidLucy.But at this Elsie only shook her head, and just'hen the breakfast-bell rang.Mr. Dinsmore was already 'n the breakfast-room,and Elsie, going up to him, said, "Good morning,Papa.""Good morning, Elsie," he replied; but his tonews so cold that even if no one else had been by, shecould not have said another word.He had not intended to be influenced by the infor-mation Arthur had so maliciously given him thenight before; yet unconsciously he was, and his man-ner to his little daughter was many degrees colderthan it had been for some time.After breakfast Lucy reminded Elsie of a promiseshe had made to show her some beautiful shells whichIf     o<pb n="124"/>124            ELSIE ~DYSIORE.her father had collected in his travels, and Elsie leathe way to the cabinet, a small room opening into theibrary, and filled with curiosities.They had gone in alone, but were soon followed byArthur, Walter, and Enna.Almost everything in the room belonged to Mr.Horace Din-more; and Elsie, knowing that many ofthe articles were rare and costly, and that he wasvery careful of them, begged Enna and the boys togo out, lest they should accidentally do some mis,chief."I won't," replied Arthur. " I've just as good aright to be here as you."As he spoke he gave her a push, which almostknocked her over, and in catching at a table to saveherself from falling, she threw down a beautiful vaseof rare old china, which Mr. Dinsmore prized veryhighly. It fell with a loud crash, and lay scatteredin fragments at their feet." There, see what you've done !" exclaimed Arthur,as the little group stood aghast at the mischief.It happened that Mr. Dinsmore was just then mthe library, and the noise soon brought him upon thescene of action."Who did this ?" he asked, in a wrathful tone,looking from one to the other."Elsie," said Arthur; "she threw it down anuoroke it."" Troublesome, careless child I I would not havetaken a hundred dollars for that vase," he exclaimed.<pb n="125"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             I25Go to your room I go this instant, and stay thereuntil I send for you; and remember, if you evercome in here again without permission I shall punishyou"He opened the door as he spoke, and Elsie flew$cross the hall, up the stairs, and into her own room'without once pausing or looking back."Now go out, every one of you, and don't come i,here again; this is no place for children," said Mr.Dinsmore, turning the others into the hall, and shut.ting and locking the door upon them."You ought to be ashamed, Arthur Dinsmore,"exclaimed Lucy indignantly; "it was all your ownfault, and Elsie was not to blame at all, and youknow it.""I didn't touch the old vase, and I'm not goingto take the blame of it either, I can tell you, miss,"replied Arthur, moving off, followed by Walter andEnna, while Lucy walked to the other end of the hall,and stood looking out of the window, debating inher own mind whether she had sufficient courage toface Mr. Dinsmore, and make him understand wherethe blame of the accident ought to lie.At length she seemed to have solved the question;for turning about and moving noiselessly down thepassage to the library door, she gave a timid littletap, which was immediately answered by Mr. Dinsmore's voice saying, "Come in."Lucy opened the door and walked in, closing itafter her.<pb n="126"/>126            ELSIE   INSMORE.Mr. Dinsmore sat at a table writing, and he lookedup with an expression of mingled surprise and impa-tience." What do you want, Miss Lucy " he said; " speakquickly, for I am very busy."" I just wanted to tell you, sir," replied Lucy, speak-ing up quite boldly, "that Elsie was not at all toblame about the vase; for it was Arthur who pushedher and made her fall against the table, and that wasthe way the vase came to fall and break.""What made him push her ?" he asked."Just because Elsie asked him, and Walter, andEnna to go out, for fear they might do some mis-chief."Mr. Dinsmore's pen was suspended over the paperfor a moment, while he sat thinking with a somewhatclouded brow; but presently turning to the little girl,he said quite pleasantly, "Very well, Miss Lucy, 1am much obliged to you for your information, for Ishould be very sorry to punish Elsie unjustly. Andnow will you do me the favor to go to her and tellner that her papa says she need not stay in her roomany longer ?""Yes, sir, I will," replied Lucy, her face sparklingwith delight as she hurried off with great alacrity todo his bidding.She found Elsie in her room crying violently, andthrowing her arms around her neck, she deliveredMr. Dinsmore's message, concluding with, "So now,Elsie, you see you needn't cry, nor feel sorry any<pb n="127"/>LSIE DIYSMORE.            127more; but just dry your eyes and let us go down intothe garden and have a good time."Elsie was very thankful to Lucy, and very gladthat her papa now knew that she was not to blame;but she was still sorry for his loss, and his words hadwounded her too deeply to be immediately forgotten;indeed it was some time before the sore spot theyhad made in her heart was entirely healed. But shetried to forget it all and enter heartily into the sportAproposed by Lucy.The Carringtons were not to leave until the after.noon, and the little girls spent nearly the whole morn-ing in the garden, coming into the drawing-room afew moments before the dinner-bell rang.Mrs. Carrington sat on a sofa engaged with somefancy work, while Herbert, who had not felt wellenough to join the other children, had stretched him-self out beside her, putting his head in her lap.Mr. Carrington and Mr. Horace Dinsmore were con-versing near by.Lucy ran up to her papa and seated herself uponhis knee with her arm around his neck; while Elsiestopped a moment to speak to Herbert, and thentimidly approaching her father, with her eyes uponthe floor, said in a low, half-frightened tone, thatreached no ear but his, "I am very sorry about therase, papa."He took her hand, and drawing her close to hinmpushed back the hair from her forehead with. hisother hand, and bending down to her, said almost in<pb n="128"/>128           ELSIE DINSMORE. a whisper, "Never mind, daughter, we will forgeiall about it.  I am  sorry I spoke so harshly toyou, since Lucy tells me you were not so much toblame."Elsie's face fushed with pleasure, and she lookedup gratefully; but before she had time to reply, Mrs.Carrington said, "Elsie, we want to take you homewith us to spend a week; will you go ?""I should like to, very much, indeed, ma'am, ifpapa will let me," replied the little girl, looking wist-fully up into his face." Well, Mr. Dinsmore, what do you say I I hopeyou can have no objection," said Mrs. Carrington,looking inquiringly at him; while her husband added,"Oh! yes, Dinsmore, you must let her go by allmeans; you can certainly spare her for a week, andit need be no interruption to her lessons, as she canihare with Lucy in the instructions of our governess,who is really a superior teacher."Mr. Dinsmore was looking very grave, and Elsieknew from the expression of his countenance whathis answer would be, before he spoke.  He hadnoticed the indignant glance Lucy had once or twicebestowed upon him, and remembering Arthur's reportof the conversation between the two little girls thenight before, had decided in his own mind that theless Elsie saw of Lucy the better."I thank you both for your kind attention to mylittle girl," he replied courteously, "but while fullyappreciating your kindness in extending the invita-<pb n="129"/>ELSIE DIVSMORE.              12tion, I must beg leave to decline it, as I am satisfiedthat home is the best place for her at present.""Ah   no, I suppose we ought hardly to have ex-pected you to spare her so soon after your return,,said Mrs. Carrington; "but really, I am very sorry tobe refused, for Elsie is such a good child that I amalways delighted to have Lucy and Herbert with her.""Perhaps you think better of her than she de-serves, Mrs. Carringtoni. I find that Elsie is sometimes naughty and in need of correction, as well asother children, and therefore I think it best to keepher as much as possible under my own eye," repliedMr. Dinsmore, looking very gravely at his little daugh-ter as he spoke.Elsie's face flushed painfully, and she had hard workto keep from bursting into tears. It was a great re-lief to her that just at that moment the dinner-belrang, and there was a general movement in the diree.tion of the dining-room. Her look was touchingly'nimble as her father led her in and seated her at thetable.She was thinking, " Papa says I am naughty some-times, but oh! how very naughty he would think meif he knew all the wicked feelings I had yesterday."As soon as they had risen from the table, Mrs. Carrington bade Lucy go up to her maid to have her bon-net put on, as the carriage was already at the door.Elsie would have gone with her, but her father hadtaken her hand again, and he held it fast.She looked up inquiringly into his face.<pb n="130"/>130            ELSIE DINSMORIS."Stay here," he said. "Lucy will be down againm a moment."And Elsie stood quietly at his side until Lucy re.turned.But even then her father did not relinquish hishold of her hand, and all the talking the little girlscould do must be done close at his side.Yet, as he was engaged in earnest conversationwith Mr. Carrington, and did not seem to be listenmg to them, Lucy ventured to whisper to Elsie,"I think it's real mean of him; he might let yougo.""No," replied Elsie, in the same low tone, " I'msure papa knows best; and besides, I have beennaughty, and don't deserve to go, though I shouldlike to, dearly."" Well, good-bye," said Lucy, giving her a kiss.It was not until Mr. Carrington's carriage was fairlyon its way down the avenue, that Mr. Dinsmore drop-ped his little girl's hand; and then he said, "I wantyou in the library, Elsie; come to me in half anhour.""Yes, papa, I will," she replied, looking a littlefrightened.u You need not be afraid,' he said, in a tone ofispleasure; "I am not going to hurt you."Elsie blushed and hung her head, but made no re.ply, and he turned away and left her. She could nothelp wondering what he wanted with her, and thouglshe tried not to feel afraid, it was impossible to keep<pb n="131"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             131from trembling a little as she knocked at the librarydoor.Her father's voice said, "Come in," and enteringshe found him alone, seated at a table covered withpapers and writing materials, while beside the accountoook in which he was writing lay a pile of money,in bank notes, and gold and silver."Here, Elsie," he said, laying down his pen, "Iwant to give you your month's allowance. Yourgrandfather has paid it to you heretofore, but of course,now that I am at home, I attend to everything thatconcerns you. You have been receiving eight dol-lars-I shall give you ten;" and he counted out themoney and laid it before her as he spoke; "but 1shall require a strict account of all that you spend.I want you to learn to keep accounts, for if you live,you will some day have a great deal of money to takecare of; and here is a blank book that I have propared, so that you can do so very easily. Every timethat you lay out or give away any money, you mustset it down here as soon as you come home; be par-ticular about that, lest you should forget something,because you must bring your book to me at the endof every month, and let me see how much vou havespent, and what is the balance in hand; and if yonare not able to make it come out square, and tell mewhat you have done with every penny, you will loseeither the whole or a part of your allowance for thenext month, according to the extent of your dellu-quency. Do you understand ?"<pb n="132"/>132            ELSIE DINSMORE."Yes, sir."" Very well. Let Ire see now how much you cantemember of your last month's expenditure. Taketlhw book and set down everything you can thinkElsie had a good memory, and was able to remem-ber how she had spent almost every cent during thetime specified; and she set down one item after an-other, and %hen added up the column without anymistake."That was very well done," said her father approvingly. And then running over the items half aloud,"Candy, half a dollar; remember, Elsie, there is tobe no more money disposed of in that way; not asa matter of economy, by any means, but because Iconsider it very injurious. I am very anxious that youshould grow up strong and healthy. I would not foranything have you a miserable dyspeptic."Then suddenly closing the book and handing it toher, he said inquiringly, " You were very anxious togo to Ashlands ?""I would have liked to go, papa, if you had been- illing," she replied meekly."I am afraid Lucy is not a suitable companion foryou, Elsie. I think she puts bad notions into yourhead," he said very gravely.Elsie flushed and trembled, and was just openingher lips to make her confession, when the door open-ed and her grandfather entered.  She could notspeak before him, and so remained silent.<pb n="133"/>ELSIE DINSMOS.              133"Does she not sometimes say naughty things toVou?" asked her father, speaking so low that hergrandfather could not have heard."Yes, sir," replied the little girl, almost under herbreath."I thought so," said he, "and therefore I shallkeep you apart as entirely as possible; and I hopethere will be no murmuring on your part.""No, papa, you know best," she answered, veryhumbly.Then putting the money into her hands, he dis-missed her. When she had gone out he sat for amoment in deep thought. Elsie's list of articlesbought with her last month's allowance consistedalmost entirely of gifts for others, generally the ser-vants.  There were some beads and sewing-silk formaking a purse, and a few drawing materials; butwith the exception of the candy, she had boughtnothing else for herself. This was what her fatherwas thinking of.She is a dear, unselfish, generous little thing," hesaid to himself. " However, I may be mistaken; Imust not allow myself to judge from only one month.She seems submissive too,"-he had overheard whatpassed between her and Lucy at parting-" but per-haps that was for effect; she probably suspected Icould hear her-and she thinks me a tyrant, andobeys from fear, not love."And this thought drove away all the tender feelingthat had been creeping into his heart; and when heP 2<pb n="134"/>134            ELSIE DINSMOREnext met his little daughter, his manner was as coldand distant as ever, and Elsie found it impossible toapproach him  with sufficient freedom  to tell himv-hat was in her heart.<pb n="135"/>lapter    itftb.a Man Is unjust, but God is just; and finally justiceTrlnmphs."-LoNGfELLOW'S Kvangeln."How disappointment tracksThe steps of hope I  "-MISS LANDON.ONE afternoon, the next week after the Carring-tons had left, the younger members of the family,Arthur, Elsie, Walter, and Enna, were setting out totake a walk, when Elsie, seeing a gold chain depend-tng from the pocket of Arthur's jacket, exclaimed:"0   Arthur! how    could  you   take grandpa'swatch ?  Do put it away, for you will be almost sureto injure it.""Hold your tongue, Elsie; I'll do as I please,"was the polite rejoinder."But, Arthur, you know that grandpa wouldnever let you take it. I have often heard him saythat it was very valuable, for it was seldom that sogood a one could be had at any price; and I knowthat he paid a great deal for it.""Well, if he prizes it so, he needn't have left itlying on his table; and so I'll just teach him alesson; it's about time he learnt to be careful."<pb n="136"/>136           ELSIE DINSAMORE."0 Arthur! do put it away," pleaded Elsie;' if anything should happen to it, what will grandpasay ? I know he will be very angry, and ask us allwho did it; and you know I cannot tell a lie, and ifhe asks me if it was you, I cannot say no.""Yes, I'll trust you for telling tales," replied,,Arthur, sneeringly; "but if you do, I'll pay you for it."He ran down the avenue as he spoke, Walter andEmma following, and Elsie slowly bringing up therear, looking the picture of distress, for she knewnot what to do, seeing that Arthur would not listento her remonstrances, and, as often happened, allthe older members of the family were out, and thusthere was no authority that could be appealed to intime to prevent the mischief which she had everyreason to fear would be done. Once she thought ofturning back, that she might escape the necessity ofbeing a witness in the case; but, remembering thather father told her she must walk with the othersthat afternoon, and also that, as she had already seenthe watch in Arthur's possession, her testimonywould be sufficient to convict him even if she saw nomore, she gave up the idea; and hurried on with thefaint hope that she might be able to induce Arthurto refrain from indulging in such sports as would belikely to endanger the watch; or else to give it intoher charge. At any other time she would havetrembled at the thought of touching it; but now shefelt so sure it would be safer with her than with<pb n="137"/>ELSIE DINSMORB.              137nim, that she would gladly have taken the respon-sibility.The walk was far from being a pleasure that after-noon; the boys ran so fast that it quite put her outof breath to keep up with them; and then every littlewhile Arthur would cut some caper that made hertremble for the watch; answering her entreaties thathe would either give it into her care or walk along4uletly, with sneers and taunts, and declarations ofhis determination to do just exactly as he pleased,and not be ruled by her.But at length, while he was in the act of climbinga tree, the watch dropped from his pocket and fellto the ground, striking with considerable force.Elsie uttered a scream, and Arthur, now thoroughlyfrightened himself, jumped down and picked it up.The crystal was broken, the back dented, and howmuch the works were injured they could not tell;but it had ceased to run."0 Arthur! see what you've done!" exclaimedWalter."What will papa say?" said Enna; while Elsiestood pale and trembling, not speaking a word."You hush!" exclaimed Arthur fiercely.   "I'lltell you what, if any of you dare to te'l of me, I'llmake you sorry for it to the last day of your life,Do you hear ?"The westion was addressed to Elsie in a tone aKdefiance."Arthur," said she, "grandpa will know that<pb n="138"/>138            ELSng DINS8ORE.somebody did it, and surely you would not wish aninnocent person to be punished for your fault.""I don't care who gets punished, so that papa doesnot find out that I did it," said he furiously; " andif you dare to tell of me, I'll pay you for it.""I shall say nothing, unless it becomes necessaryto save the innocent, or I am forced to speak; butm that case I shall tell the truth," replied Elsie,firmly.Arthur doubled up his fist, and made a plunge atner as if he meant to knock her down; but Elsiesprang behind the tree, and then ran so fleetly towardthe house that he was not able to overtake her untilhis passion had had time to cool.When they reached the house, Arthur replaced thewatch on his father's table, whence he had taken it,and then they all awaited his return with what couragethey might."I say, Wally," said Arthur, drawing his littlebrother aside and speaking in a low tone, having firstsent a cautious glance around to assure himself thatno one else was within hearing, " I say, what wouldyou give me for that new riding whip of mine ""0 Arthur! anything I've got," exclaimed thelittle boy eagerly. "But you wouldn't give it up, Iknow, and you're only trying to tease me.""No, indeed, Wal; I mean to give it to you ifyou'll only be a good fellow and do as I tdl you."" What " he asked, with intense interest." Tell papa that Jim broke the watch."<pb n="139"/>ELSIE DINSbMORE.             139"But he didn't," replied the child, opening hiseyes wide with astonishment."Well, what of that, you little goose ?" exclaimedArthur impatiently; "papa doesn't know that."" But Jim will get punished," said Walter; " and 1don't want to tell such a big story either.""Very well, sir, then you'll not get the whip; andbesides, if you don't do as I wish, I'm certain you'llsee a ghost one of these nights; for there's one comesto see me sometimes, and I'll send him right off toyou.""Oh! don't, Arthur, don't; I'd die of fright," criedthe little boy, who was very timid, glancing nervouslyaround, as if he expected the ghost to appear imme-diatelv."I tell you I will, though, if you don't do as I say;he'll come this very night and carry you off, andnever bring you back.""0 Arthur! don't let him come, and I'll say any.thing you want me to," cried the little fellow in greatterror."That's a good boy; I knew you would," saidArthur, smiling triumphantly. And turning awayfrom Walter, he next sought out Enna, and tried histhreats and persuasions upon her with even bettersuccess.Elsie had gone directly to her own room, whereshe sat trembling every time a footstep approachedher door, lest it should be a messenger from hergrandfather. No one came, however and at last thes*-   **                 *         :<pb n="140"/>140            ELSIZ DINSMORE.tea-bell rang, and on going d)Wm she found to herrelief that her grandfather and his wife had not yetreturned."You look pale, Elsie," said her father, giving hera scrutinizing glance as she took her seat by his side."Are you well ""Yes, papa, quite well," she replied.He looked at her again a little anxiously, but saidno more; and as soon as the meal was concluded,Elsie hastened away to her own room again.It was still early in the evening when Mr. and Mrs.Dinsmore returned-for once, bringing no companywith them; and he had not been many minutes inthe house ere he took up his watch, and of courseinstantly discovered the injury it had sustained.His suspicions at onze fell upon Arthur, whosecharacter for mischief was well established; and burn-ing with rage, watch in hand, he repaired to thetrawing-room, which he entered, asking, in tonestremulous with passion, " Where is Arthur ? Youngrascal ! this is some of his work," he added, holdingap the injured article."My dear, how can you say so     have you anyproof ' asked his wife, deprecatingly adding in hersoftest tones, "my poor boy seems to get the blameof everything that goes wrong.""He gets no more than he deserves," replied herhusband angrily.

" I will sift this matter to the bottom, andchild or servant, the guilty one shall suffer for it,"exclaimed the old gentleman, pacing angrily up anddown the room. "Arthur," said he sternly, as theboy made his appearance, looking somewhat pale andalarmed, "how dared you meddle with my watch?""I didn't, sir; I never touched it," he repliedboldly, yet avoiding his father's eye as he uttered thedeliberate falsehood."There, my dear, I told you so," exclaimed hismother, triumphantly."I don't believe you," said his father; " and if youare guilty, as I strongly suspect, you had better con-fess it at once, before I find it out in some otherfray."" I didn't do it, sir. It was Jim, and I can proveit by Walter and Enna; we all saw it fall from hispocket when he was up in a tree; and he cried likeanything when he found it was broken, and said hedidn't mean to do it any harm; he was only going towear it a little while, and then put it back all safe;but now master would be dreadfully angry, and havehim flogged.""That I will, if it is true," exclaimed the old gen.,leman, passionately; "he shall be well whippet and*2<pb n="142"/>14d            ELSIt  DISySSORS.sent out to work on the plantation. I'll keep no suchmeddlers about my house."He looked at Enna.   "What do you know ofthis?" he asked."It is true, papa, I saw him do it," she repliedwith a slight blush, and sending an uneasy glancearound the room."Did you see it, too, Walter ?" asked his father."Yes, sir," replied the little fellow, in a low, re-luctant tone; 'but please, papa, don't punish him.I'm sure he didn't mean to break it.""Hold your tongue! he shall be punished as hedeserves," cried the old gentleman, furiously. " Heresir," turning to the overseer, and pointing to Jim,take the fellow out, and give him such a flogging ashe Will remember."Elsie was sitting in her own room, trying to learnlesson for the next day, but finding great difficultyin fixing her thoughts upon it, when she was startledby the sudden entrance of Aunt Chloe, who, with her;pron to her eyes, was sobbing violently." 0 mammy, mammy! what's the matter ? has any-thing happened to you ?" inquired the little girl, in atone of great alarm, starting to her feet, and droppingher book in her haste and fright."Why," sobbed Chloe, " Jim he's been an' gone an'broke ole master's watch, an' he's gwine be whipped,an' ole Aunt Phcebe she's cryin' fit to break her oleheart 'bout her boy, kase-"Fsjie waited to hear no more, but darting out into<pb n="143"/>ELSIE DDlM7 oRE.            143the hall, and encountering her father on his way tohis room, she rushed up to him, pale and agitated,and seizing his hand, looked up eagerly into his face,exclaiming with a burst of tears and sobs, "0 papa,papa! don't, oh! don't let them whip poor Jim."Mr. Dinsmore's countenance was very grave, almostdistressed."I am sorry it is necessary, daughter,'! he said,"but Jim has done very wrong, and deserves hispunishment, and I cannot interfere.""Oh ! no, papa, he did not, indeed he did not breakthe watch. I know he didn't, for I was by and sawit all.""Is it possible? " said he, in a tone of surprise;"then tell me who did do it. It could not havebeen you, Elsie 8" and be looked searchingly into herface." Oh! no, papa, I would never have dared to touchit. But please don't make me tell tales; but I knowit wasn't Jim. Oh ! do stop them quickly, before theybegin to whip him.""Aunt Chloe," said Mr. Dinsmore, " go down tomy father and tell him it is my request that thepunishment should be delayed a few moments until 1come down."Then taking Elsie's hand, he led her into her roomagain, and seating himself, drew her to his side, say-ing, with grave decision, "Now, my daughter, ifyou want to save Jim, it will be necessarv for vou toteU all you know about this affair."<pb n="144"/>144           ELSIE DINSMORE"I don't like to tell tales, papa," pleaded the littlegirl; "I think it so very mean.

Elsie, I think you wouldbe doing very wickedly to allow an innocent personto suffer when you can prevent it; and besides, I willadd the weight of my authority, and say you must do itit once; and you well know, my daughter, that therecan be no question as to the duty of obedience toyour father."He paused, gazing earnestly down into the littletearful, downcast, blushing face at his side." Have I not said enough to convince you of youlduty?" he asked."Yes, papa; I will tell you all about it," sheanswered in a tremulous tone.<pb n="145"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               14Her story was told with evident reluctance, but ina simple, straightforward manner, that attested itstruthfulness.Mr. Dinsmore listened in silence, but with an ex-pression of indignation on.his handsome features*and the moment she had finished he rose, and againtaking her hand, led her from the room, saying, as ha'did so:"You must repeat this story to your grandfather."" 0 papa! must I    Won't you tell him ? pleasedon't make me do it," she pleaded tremblingly, andhanging back."My daughter, you must," he replied, so sternlythat she dared not make any further resistance, butquietly submitted to be led into her grandfather'spresence.He was still in the drawing-room, walking aboutm a disturbed and angry manner, and now and thencasting a suspicious glance upon Arthur, who sat paleand trembling in a corner, looking the picture of guiltand misery; for he had heard Chloe deliver hisbrother's message, and feared that exposure awaitedhim.Walter had stolen away to cry over Jim's punish-ment, and wish that he. had had the courage to tellthe truth at first; but saying to himself that it wastoo late now, his father wouldn't believe him, and hewould make it up to Jim somehow, even if it took allnis pocket-money for a month.None of the other members of the family had left<pb n="146"/>146            ELSIE DINSMORE.the room, and all wore an anxious, expectant look, aaMr. Dinsmore entered, leading Elsie by the hand."I have brought you another witness, sir," he said,"for it seems Elsie was present when the mischiefwas done.""Ah!" exclaimed the old gentleman, "then Imay hope to get at the truth.

" Don't be afraid to speakout and tell all you know, daughter, for I will protectyou," he said, pressing the little trembling hand in his,and at the same time giving Arthur a meaning rook. " Yes, yes, speak out, childi speak out at once; noone shall hurt you for telling the truth," exclaimedher grandfather, impatiently."' I TZ, grandpa," she said, trembling and weeping,'      .V J Pease don't be very angry with Arthur; if you<pb n="147"/>MLRLE  DINi.MORE.           147will forgive him this time, I think he will never meddie any more; -and I am quite sure he did not meanto break it.""So it was you, after all, you young rascal ! I knewit from the first!" cried the old gentleman, stridingacross the room, seizing the boy by the shoulder anashaking him roughly." But go on, Elsie, let us have the whole story," headded, turning to her again, but still keeping his holdupon Arthur. " You young dog! " he added, whenshe had finished. " Yes, I'll forgive you when you'vehad a good, sound flogging, and a week's solitary con-finement on bread and water, but not before."So saying, he was about to lead him from the room,when Elsie suddenly sprang forward, and with claspedhands, and flushed eager face, she pleaded earnestly,beseechingly, "O  grandpa! don't whip him, don'tpunish him! He will never be so naughty again.vWill you, Arthur  - Let me pay for the watch,grandpa; and don't punish him. I would so like todo it.""It isn't the moneyed value of the watch I carefor, child," replied the old gentleman, contemptu-ously; "and besides, where would you get so muchmoney 8""I am rich, grandpa, am I not 8 Didn't my mam-tna leave me a great deal of money!" asked the littlegirl, casting down her eyes and blushing painfully."No, Elsie," said her father very gravely, as he.ook her hand and led her back to the side of his<pb n="148"/>148            ZLSIE DINSMOPR.chair again, "you have nothing but what I choose togive you, until you come of age, which will not befor a great many years yet.""But you'will give me the money to pay for thewatch, papa, won't you ?" she asked, pleadingly."No, I certainly shall not, for I think Arthu.should be left to suffer the penalty of his own mis.deeds," he replied in a very decided tone; " and, be-sides," he added, " your grandfather has already toldyou that it is not the pecuniary loss he cares for."" No; but I will teach this young rascal to let myproperty alone," said the elder gentleman with almostfierce determination,'as he tightened his grasp uponthe boy's arm and dragged him from the room.Arthur cast a look of hatred and defiance at Elsieas he went out, that made her grow pale with fearand tremble so that she could scarcely stand.Her father saw both the look and its effect. anddrawing the little trembler closer to him, he- put hisarm around her, and stroking her hair, said in a low,soothing tone: " Don't be frightened, daughter; I willprotect you."She answered him with a grateful look and a longsigh of relief, and he was just about to take her onhis knee when visitors were announced, and, changinghis mind, he dismissed her to her room, and she sawno more of him that evening." Oh  if they only hadn't come just now," thoughtthe sorely disappointed child, as she went out with slow,reluctant steps. "I'm sure they wouldn't, ' they had<pb n="149"/>ELSIE DINSMORA              149only known. Pm sure, quite sure papa was going totake me on his knee, and they prevented him. Oh !will he ever think of doing it again? Dear, dearpapa, if you could only know how I long to sitthere!" But Mrs. Dinsmore, who had hastily re-tired on the exit of Arthur and his father from thedrawing-room, was now sailing majestically down thehall, on her return thither; and Elsie, catching sightof her, and being naturally anxious to avoid a meet-ing just then, at once quickened her pace very consid-erably, almost running up the stairs to her own room,where she found old Aunt Phoebe, Jim's mother, wait-ing to speak with her.The poor old creature was overflowing with grati-tude, and her fervent outpouring of thanks and bless-ings almost made Elsie forget her disappointment forthe- time.Then Jim came to the door, asking to see Miss Elsie,and poured out his thanks' amid many sobs and tears;for the poor fellow had been terribly frightened-in-deed, so astounded by the unexpected charge, that hehad not had a word to say in his own defence, beyondan earnest.and reiterated assertion of his entire inno-sence; to which, however, his angry master had paidno attention.But at length Phoebe remembered that she hadsome baking to do, and calling on Jim to come rightalong and split up some dry wood to heat her oven,she went down to the kitchen followed by her son,and Elsie-was left alone with her nurse.<pb n="150"/>150            ELSIE DrISMORS.Chloe sat silently knittmg, and the little girl, withher head leaning upon her hand and her eyes fixedthoughtfully upon the floor, wasrehearsing again andagain in her own mind all that had just passed be-tween her papa and herself; dwelling with lingeringdelight upon everything approaching to a caress, everykind word, every soothing tone of his voice; and thenpicturing to herself all that he might have done andsaid if those unwelcome visitors had not come in andput an end to the interview; and half hoping that he.would send for her when they had gone, she watchedthe clock and listened intently for every sound.But her bedtime came and she dared not stay upany longer; for his orders had been peremptory thatshe should always retire precisely at that hour,unless she had his express permission to remain uplonger.She lay awake for some time, thinking of his un-wonted kindness, and indulging fond hopes for thefature, and then fell asleep to dream that she was onher father's knee, and felt his arms folded lovinglyabout her, and his kisses warm upon her cheek.Her heart beat quickly as she entered the breakfast-room the next morning.The family were just taking their places at thetable, and her half-eager, half-timid "Good morning,papa," was answered by a grave, absent "Good morn-ing, Elsie,"-and turning to his father and enteringinto a conversation with him on some business mat-ter, he took no further notice of his little daughter,<pb n="151"/>ELSIE DINstORIS              151excepting to see that her plate was well supplied withsuch articles of food as he allowed her to eat.Elsie was sadly disappointed, and lingered aboutthe room in the vain hope of obtaining a smile orcaress; but presently her father went out, saying tothe elder Mr. Dinsmore that he was going to rideover to Ion, and would probably not return beforenight; then, with a sigh, the little girl went back toher own room to prepare her morning lessons.Elsie was now happily free from Arthur's persecu-tions for a time; for even after his release, he was toomuch afraid of his brother, openly to offer her anyvery serious annoyance, though he plotted revenge insecret; yet the little girl's situation was far from com-fortable, and her patience often severely tried, forMrs. Dinsmore was excessively angry with her on'Arthur's account, and whenever her father was notpresent, treated her in the most unkind manner; andfrom the same cause the rest of the family, with theexception of her grandpa and Aunt Adelaide, wereunusually cold and distant; while her father, althoughcareful to see that all her wants were attended to, sel-dom took any further notice of her; unless to reprove*her for some childish fault which, however trifling,never escaped.his eye."You seem," said Adelaide to him one day, as hesent Elsie from the room for some very slight fault," to expect that child to be a great deal more perfectthan any grown person I ever saw, and to understandall about the rules of etiquette."<pb n="152"/>152            ELSIE DMISMORE." If you please, Adelaide," said he haughtily, " should like to be allowed to manage my own child asI see proper, without any interference from others."Excuse me," replied his sister; " I had no inten-tion of interfering; but really, Horace, I do thinkyou have no idea how eagle-eyed you are for faults iuher, nor how very stern is the tone in which you always reprove her. I have known Elsie a great deallonger than you have, and I feel very certain that agentle reproof would do her quite as much good, andnot wound her half so much.""Enough, Adelaide !" exclaimed her brother, impatiently. " If I were ten years younger than your-self, instead of that much older, there might be somepropriety in your advising and directing me thus; asit is, I must say I consider it simply impertinent."And he left the room with an angry stride, whileAdelaide looked after him with the thought, "I amglad you have no authority over me."All that Adelaide had said was true; yet Elsienever complained, never blamed her father, even inher heart; but, in her deep humility, thought it wasall because she was " so very naughty or careless;"and she was continually making resolutions to be"oh! so careful always to do just right, and pleasedear papa, so that some day he might learn to loveher."But, alas! that hope was daily growing fainter andfainter; his cold and distant manner to her and hisoften repeated reproofs had so increased her natural-- ><pb n="153"/>sm     DINSMORE.             1 153timidity and sensitiveness that she was now very con-strained in her approaches to him, and seldom ventured to move or speak in his presence; and he wouldnot see that this timidity and embarrassment were thenatural results of his treatment, but attributed it allto want of affection. He saw that she feared him,and to that feeling alone he gave credit for her uniform obedience to his commands, while he had naconception of the intense, but now almost despairinglove for him that burned in that little heart, and madethe young life one longing, earnest desire and effortto gain his affection.<pb n="154"/>(baptetr   Oitq.Yea, though I wait through the valley of the shadow of death, I willfear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfortme."--lffalr xxii. 4."'Tis but the cruel artifice of fate,Thus to refine and vary on our woes,To raise us from despair and give us hopes,Only to plunge us in the gulf again,And make us doubly wretched."-TRAP'S A5ram/As.IT was Sabbath morning, and Elsie, ready dressedfor church, stood in the portico waiting for her fatherto come down and lift her into the carriage, in whichAdelaide, Louisa, and Enna were already seated.The coachman was in his seat, and the horses, apair of young and fiery steeds purchased by Mr. Dins-more only a few days before, were impatiently stamp-ing and tossing their heads, requiring quite aun exertionof strength to hold them in."I don't exactly like the actions of those horses,Ajax," remarked Mr. Dinsmore, as he came out put-ting on his gloves; "I did not intend to have thenput in harness to-day.

She hadbuilt her house upon the rock, and knew   that itwould stand. Her destiny was in her HeavenlyFather's hands, and she was content to leave it there.Even death had no terrors to-the simple, unquestion-ing faith of the little child who had put her trust inJesus.But they were not to perish thus; for at thatmoment a powerful negro, who was walking alongthe road, hearing an unusual sound, turned about,caught sight of the vehicle coming toward him atsuch a rapid rate, and instantly comprehending theperil of the travellers, planted himself in the middleof the road, and, at the risk of life and limb, caughtthe horses by the bridle-the sudden and unexpectedtheck throwing them upon their haunches, and bring-mg the carriage to an instant stand-still."Thank God, we are saved!     That fellow shallbe well rewarded for his brave deed," exclaimed Mr.Dinsmore, throwing open the carriage door.Then leaping to the ground, he lifted Elsie outset her down, and gave his hand to his sisters oneafter the other.They were almost at the entrance of the avenue,and all preferred to walk the short distance to thehouse rather than again trust themselves to thetorses.<pb n="158"/>158            ELSIE DINSMORJMr. Dinsmore lingered a moment to speak to theman who had done them such good service, and togive some directions to the coachman; and thentaking the hand of his little girl, who had been wait-ing for him, he walked slowly on, neither of themspeaking a word until they reached the house, whenhe stooped and kissed her cheek, asking very kindlyif she had recovered from her fright."Yes, papa," she answered in a quiet tone." I knew that God would take care of us.   Oh Iwasn't He good to keep us all from being killed ?""Yes," he said, very gravely. "Go now and letmammy get you ready for dinner."As Elsie was sitting alone in her room that after-noon she was surprised by a visit from Lora; it beingvery seldom that the elder girls cared to enter herapartment.Lora looked a little pale, and more grave andthoughtful than Elsie had ever seen her. For a whileshe sat in silence, then suddenly burst out, "Oh,Elsie ! I can't help thinking all the time, what if wehad been killed ! where would we all be now ? wherewould I have been ? I believe you would have gonestraight to heaven, Elsie; but I-oh! I should havebeen with the rich man the minister read about thismorning, lifting up my eyes in torment."And Lora covered her face with her hands andshuddered.Presently she went on again.   "I was terri-bly frightened, and so were the rest-all but you,<pb n="159"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             159Elsie; tell me, do--what kept you from    beingafraid ?""I was thinking," said Elsie gently, turning overthe leaves of her little Bible as she spoke, " of thissweet verse: 'Yea, though I walk through the valleyof the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thouart with me;' and oh, Lora it made me so happy tothink that Jesus was there with me, and that if I werekilled, I should only fall asleep, to wake up again inHis arms; then how could T be afraid ""     Ah! I would give anything to feel as you do,"said Lora, sighing. "But tell me, Elsie, did you notfeel afraid for the rest of us  I'm sure you mustknow that we are not Christians; we don't even pre-tend to be."Elsie blushed and looked down."It all passed so quickly, you knew, Lora, almostin a moment," she said, "so that I oe--ly had time tothink of papa and myself; and I have prayed somuch for him that I felt quite sure God wouldspare him until he should be prepared to die. Itwas very selfish, I know," she added with deephumility; "but it was only for a moment, and Ican't tell you how thankful I was for all our sparedlives.""Don't look so as if you had done something verywicked, Elsie," replied Lora, sighing again. "I'msure we have given you little enough reason to carewhatever becomes of us; but oh!

Is not that encouraging ! And listento what God says here in this verse: 'Ye shall seekme, and find me, when ye shall search for me withall your heart.' So you see, dear Lora, if you willonly seek the Lord with your whole heart, you maybe sure, quite sure of finding him.""Yes," said Lora, "but you have not answered myquestion: how am I to seek ? that is, what means amI to use to get rid of my sins, and get a new heart .how make myself pleasing in the sight of God ? whatmust I do to be saved ?"" That is the very question the jailor put to Paul,and he answered, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,and thou shalt be saved,'" replied Elsie, quicklyturning to the chapter and pointing out the text withber finger, that Lora might see that she had quotedit correctly. "And in answer to your other question,How shall I get rid of my sins ?' see here: ' In thatday there shall be a fountain opened to the house ofDavid and to'the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin andfor uncleanness.' That is in Zechariah; ther Johntells us what that fountain is when he says, 'Theblood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all<pb n="161"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              I61sin ; and again, 'Tinto Him that loved us, and washedas from our sins in his own blood.'""Yes, Elsie, but what must I do?" asked Lora,tagerly."Do, Lora ? only believe," replied Elsie, in the sameearnest tone. "Jesus has done and suffered all that isnecessary; and now. we have nothing at all to do butto go to Him and be washed in that fountain; believeHim when he says, 'I give unto them eternal life;'just accept the gift, and trust and love Him; that isthe whole of it, and it is so simple that even such alittle girl as I can understand it.""But surely, Elsie, I can, I must do something.""Yes, God tells us to repent; and He says, 'Giveme thine heart;' you can do that; you can loveJesus; at least He will enable you to, if you ask Him,and He will teach you to be sorry for your sins; theBible says, 'He is exalted to give repentance andremission of sins;' and if you ask him he will givethem to you. It is true we cannot do anything goodof ourselves; without the help of the Holy Spirit wecan do nothing right, because we are so very wicked;but then we can always get that help if we ask for iiJesus said, 'Your Heavenly Father is more willing togive H's Holy Spirit to them that ask him, thanparents are to give good gifts unto their children.'Oh, Lora ! don't be afraid to ask for it; don't be afraidto come to Jesus, for He says,' Him that comethunto me, I will in no wise cast out;' and Heis sucha precioas Saviour, so kind and loving.

I63to his face and answered, "I am   very well, thankyou, papa."                                ,But after all, this occurrence produced but littlechange in Elsie's condition; her father treated her alittle more affectionately for a day or two, and thengradually returned to his ordinary stern, cold manner;indeed, before the week was out, she was again in saddisgrace.She was walking alone in the garden one afternoon,when her attention was attracted by aslight flutteringnoise which seemed to proceed from an arbor near by,and on hastily turning in to ascertain the cause, shefound a tiny and beautiful humming-bird confined undera glass vase-, in its struggles to escape it was flutteringand beating against the walls of its prison, thus pro-ducing the, sound the little girl had heard in passing.-Elsie was very tender-hearted, and could never seeany living creature in distress without feeling a strongdesire to relieve its sufferings. She knew that Arthurwas in the habit of torturing every little insect andbird that came in his way, and had often drawn hispersecutions upon herself by interfering in behalf ofthe poor victims; and now the thought instantlyflashed upon her that this was some of his work,and that he would return ere long to carry out histruel purposes. Then at once arose the desire to re-.ease the little prisoner and save it further suffering,and without waiting to reflect a moment she raisedthe glass, and the bird was gone.Then she began to think with a little tremor, hovj~~~~~~~A.,<pb n="164"/>164            ELSIE DI'NSORS.angry Arthur would be; but it was too late to thinkof that now, and after all, she did rot stand in verygreat dread of the consequences, especially as she feltnearly sure of her father's approval of what she haddone, having several times heard him reprove Arthurfor his cruel practices.Not caring to meet Arthur then, however, she hast-ily retreated to the house, where she seated herself inthe veranda with a book. It was a very warm after-noon, and that, being on the east side of the houseand well protected by trees, shrubbery, and vines, wasas cool a spot as could be found on the place.Arthur, Walter, and Enna sat on the floor playingjack-stones-a favorite game with them-and Louisewas stretched full length on a settee, buried in thelatest novel. "Hush ! " she said, as Walter gave a sudden shoutat a successful toss Enna had just made; " can't youwe quiet? Mamma is taking her afternoon nap, andyou will disturb her; and, besides, I cannot read insuch a noise."Elsie wondered why Arthur did not go to see afterhis bird, but soon forgot all about it in the interestwith which she was poring over the story of theK Swiss Family Robinson."The jack-stone players were just finishing theirgame when they were all startled by the suddenappearance of Mr. Horace Dinsmore upon the scene,asking in a tone of great wrath who had been downin the garden and liberated the humming-bird he had<pb n="165"/>ELSIE DINSMORE               165been at such pains to catch, because it was one of arare species, and he was anxious to add it to his col--ection of curiosities.Elsie was terribly frightened, and would have beenglad at that moment to sink through the floor; shedropped her book in her lap, and clasping her handsover her beating heart, grew pale and red by turns,while she seemed choking with the vain effort tospeak and acknowledge herself the culprit, as con.science told her she ought.But her father was not looking at her; his eye waafixed on Arthur."I presume it was you, sir," he said very angrily,"and if so, you may prepare yourself for either a flog-ging or a return to your prison, for one or the otherI am determined you shall have.""I didn't do it, any such thing," replied the boy,fercely."Of course you will deny it," said his brother,'but we all know that your word is good for noth-ing," ."Papa," said a trembling little voice, " Arthur didnot do it; it was I."You,"exclaimed her father, in a tone of mingledanger and astonishment, as he turned his flashing eyeupon her, " you, Elsie! can it be possible that this isyour doing ?"Elsie's book fell on the floor, and covering her facewith both hands, she burst into sobs and tears."Come here to me this instant," he said, seatingG2<pb n="166"/>I66            ELSIE DINSMORe.himself on the settee, from which Louise had risen onhis entrance. "Come here and tell me what youmean by'meddling with my affairs in this way.""Please, papa, please don't be so very angry withme," sobbed the little girl, as she rose and came forwardin obedience to his command; " I didn't know it wasyour bird, and I didn't mean to be naughty.""No, you never mean to be naughty, according toyour own account," he said; "your badness is all acci-dent; but nevertheless, I find you a very troublesome,mischievous child: it was only the other day youbroke a valuable vase" (he forgot in his anger howlittle she had really been to blame for that), "andnow you have caused me the loss of a rare specimenwhich I had spent a great deal of time and effort inprocuring. Really, Elsie, I am sorely tempted to ad.minister a very severe punishment."Elsie caught at the arm of the settee for sup-port." Tell me what you did it for; was it pure love ofmischief ?" asked her father, sternly, taking hold ofher arm and holding her up by it..   "No, papa," she answered almost under her breath."I was sorry for the little bird. I thought Arthurhad put it there to torture it, and so I let it go. I'did not mean to do wrong, papa, indeed I did not,"and the tears fell faster and faster." Indeed," said he, " you had n, business to med-dle with it, let who would have put it thera. Whichhand did it "<pb n="167"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               167"This one, papa," sobbed the child, indicating herright hand.He took it in his and held it a moment, while thelittle girl stood tremblingly awaiting what was to comenext. He looked at the downcast, tearful face, thebosom heaving with sobs, and then at the little trem-bling hand he held, so soft, and white, and tender,and the sternness of his countenance relaxed some-what; it seemed next to impossible to inflict painupon anything so tender and helpless; and for a mo-ment he was half inclined to kiss and forgive her.But no, he had been very much irritated at his loss,and the remembrance of it again aroused his anger,and well-nigh extinguished the little spark of loveand compassion that had burned for a moment in hisheart. She should be punished, though he would notinflict physical pain."See, Elsie," laughed Louise, maliciously, " he isfeeling in his pocket for his knife. I suspect he in-tends to cut your hand off."-Elsie started, and the tearful eyes were raised toher father's face with a look half of terrified entreaty,half of confidence that such could not be his inten-tion." Hush, Louise !" exclaimed her brother, sternly;"you know you are not speaking truly, and that Iwould as soon think of cutting off my own hand asmy child's. You should never speak anything buttruth, especially to children.""I think it is well enough to frighten them a little<pb n="168"/>I68             ELSIE DIATSMOKsometimes, and I thought that was what you weregoing to do," .replied Louise, looking somewhat mor-tified at the rebuke."No," said her brother, "that is a very bad plan,and one which I shall never adopt. Elsie will learnin time, if she does not know it now, that I neverutter a threat which I do not intend to carry out, andnever break my word."He had drawn a handkerchief from his pocketwhile speaking."I shall tie this hand up, Elsie," he said, pro-ceeding to do so; "those who do not use theirhands aright must be deprived of the use of them.There! let me see if that will keep it out of mis-chief. I shall tie you up hand and foot before long,if you continue such mischievous pranks. Now goto your room, and stay there until tea-time."Elsie felt deeply, bitterly disgraced and humiliatedas she turned to obey; and it needed not Arthur'striumphant chuckle nor the smirk of satisfactionon Enna's face to add to the keen suffering of herwounded spirit: this slight punishment was more toher than a severe chastisement would have been tomany another child; for the very knowledge of herfather's displeasure was enough at any time to causegreat pain to her sensitive spirit and gentle, lovingheart.Walter, who was far more tender-hearted thaneither his brother or sister, felt touched by the sightof her distress, and ran after her to say, "Never<pb n="169"/>ELSIE DITSMORE.             169mind, Elsie; I am ever so sorry for you, and I don'tthink you were the'least bit naughty."She thanked him with a grateful look, and a faintattempt to smile through her tears, and then hurriedon to her room, where she seated herself in a chairby the window, and laying her arms upon the sill,rested her head upon them, and while the bitter tearsfell fast from her eyes she murmured half aloud,"Oh! why am I always so naughty? always doingsomething to displease my dear papa ? how I wish Icould be good, and make him love me ! I am afraidhe never will if I vex him so often."Then an earnest, importunate prayer for help to doright,, and wisdom to understand how to gain herfather's love, went up fiom the almost despairinglittle heart to Him whose ear is ever open unto thecry of his suffering children. And thus betweenweeping, mourning, and praying, an hour passedslowly away, and the tea-bell rang.Elsie started up, but sat down again, feeling thatshe would much rather do without her supper than-show her tear-swollen eyes and tied-up hand at thetable.But she was not to be left to her choice in thematter, for presently there came a messenger bring-ing a peremptory command from her father " to comedown immediately to her supper.""Did you not hear the bell ?" he asked, in hissternest tone, as she tremblingly took her seat at hisside.<pb n="170"/>17/            ELSIE DINSMORE."Yes, sir," she answered, in a low tremulous tone"Very well, then; remember that you are alwaysto come down the moment the bell rings, unless youare directed otherwise, or are sick; and the nexttime you are so late, I shall send you away withoutyour meal.""I don't want any supper, papa," she said, humbly."Hush," he replied, severely; "i I will have nopouting nor sulking; you must just eat your supperand behave yourself. Stop this crying at once," headded, in an undertone, as he spread some preserveson a piece of bread and laid it on her plate, "or I,hall take you away from the table; and if I do, yovwill be very sorry."He watched her a moment while she made a vio-lent effort to choke back her tears." What is your hand- tied- up for, Elsie " askedher grandfather; " have you been hurt ?"Elsie's face flushed painfully, but she made noreply."You must speak when you are spoken to," saidher father; "answer your grandfather's question atonce.""Papa tied it up, because I was naughty," repliedthe little girl, vainly striving to suppress a sob.Her father made a movement as if about to leadher from the table."0 papa ! don't," she cried, in terror; "I will begood."Let me have no more crying, then," said he<pb n="171"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             I71this is shameful behavior for a girl eight years old,it would be bad enough in a child of Enna's age."He took out his handkerchief and wiped her eyes.U Now," said he, " begin to eat your supper at once,and don't let me have to reprove you again.Elsie tried to obey, but it seemed very difficult,ideed almost impossible, while she knew that herfather was watching her closely, and felt that every-body else was looking at her and thinking, " What anaughty little girl you are!""Oh!" thought -the poor child, " if papa wouldonly quit looking at me, and the rest would forget allabout me and eat their suppers, may be I could keepfrom crying."  Then she sent up a silent prayer for.help, struggled hard to keep back the tears and sobsthat were almost suffocating her, and taking up herslice of bread, tried to eat.She was very thankful to her Aunt Adelaide foraddressing a question to her papa just at that mo-ment, thus taking his attention from her, and thenadroitly setting them all to talking until the little girlhad had time to recover her composure, at least in ameasure."May I go to my room now, papa?" asked thetimid little voice as they rose from the table."No," he said, taking her hand and leading herout to the veranda, where he settled himself in aieasy chair, and lighted a cigar."Bring me that book that lies yonder on the set-tWe," he comm4nd4ed<pb n="172"/>172     '      ELSIE DINSMORA.She brought it."-Now," said he, " bring that stool and set you-self down here close at my knee, and let me see ifI can keep you out of mischief for an hour or two.""May I get a book to read, papa?" she askedtimidly."No," said he shortly. ,, You may just do whatbid you, and nothing more nor less."She sat down as he directed, with her face turnedtoward him, and tried to amuse herself with her owu.thoughts, and watching the expression of his countenance as he read on and on, turning leaf after leaf,too much interested in his book to take any furthernotice of her." How handsome my papa is " thought the littlegirl, gazing with affectionate admiration into hisface. And then she sighed and tears trembled inher eyes again. She admired her father, and lovedhim, " oh! so dearly," as she often whispered to her-self, but would she ever meet with anything like areturn of her fond affection I There was at achingvoid in her heart which nothing else could fill: mustit always be thus? was her craving for affection neverto be satisfied ?  "0 papaI my own papa, will younever love me?" mourned the sad-little heart. "Ah!if I could only be good always, perhaps he would;but I am so often naughty;-whenever he begins tobe kind I am sure to do something to vex him, andthen it is all over. Oh-! I wish I could be good! I willtry very, very hard. Aih! if I might climb on his<pb n="173"/>ELSIE DlINSMORE.           I73knee now, and lay my head on his breast, and putmy arms round his neck, and tell him how sorry Iam that I have been naughty, and made him lose hisbird; and how much-oh! how much I love him!But I know I never could tell him that-I don't knowhow to express it; no words could, I am sure. And ifhe would forgive me, and kiss me, and call me hisdear little daughter. Oh! will he ever call me that Or if I might only stand beside him and lay my- headon his shoulder, and he would put his arm around me,it would make me so happy."An exclamation from Enna caused Elsie to turnher head, and suddenly springing to her feet, she ex-claimed in a eager, excited way, "Papa, there is acarriage coming up the avenue-it must be visitors:please, please, papa, let me go to my room.""Why ." he asked coolly, looking up from hisbook, " why do you wish to go ?""Because I don't want to see them, papa," shesaid, hanging her head and blushing deeply; " I don'twant them to see me.""You are not usually afraid of visitors," he repliedin the same cool tone."But they will see that my hand is tied up, andthey will ask what is the matter. 0 papa! do, pleasedo let me go quickly, before they get here," shepleaded in an agony of shame and haste."No," said he, " I shall not let you go, if it wereonly to punish you for getting off the seat where Ibid you stay, without permission. You will have toG* 2<pb n="174"/>174            ELSIE DINSMORA.learn that i am to be obeyed at all times, and underall circumstances. Sit down, and don't dare to moveagain until I give you leave."Elsie sat down without another word, but twobitter, scalding tears rolled quickly down her burningcheeks."You needn't cry, Elsie," said her father; " t isonly an old gentleman who comes to see your grand-father on business, and who, as he never noticeschildren, will not be at all likely to ask any questions.I hope you will learn some day, Elsie, to save yourtears until there is really some occasion for them."The old gentleman had alighted while Mr. Dins-more was speaking; Elsie saw that he was alone, andthe relief was so great that for once she scarcelyheeded her father's rebuke.Another half-hour passed, and Mr. Dinsmore stillsat reading, taking no notice of Elsie, who, afraid tospeak or move, was growing very weary and sleepy.She longed to lay her head on her father's knee, butdared not venture to take such a liberty; but atlength she was so completely overpowered by sleepao to do so unconsciously.Th   sound of his voice pronouncing her namearoused her."You are tired and sleepy," said he; " if you wouldlike to go to bed you may do so.""Thank you, papa," she replied, rising to her feet." Well," he said, seeing her hesitate, " speak, if youhave anything to say."<pb n="175"/>kLSIE DINSMORE.            175"I am very sorry I was naughty, papa. Will youplease forgive me?"  The words were spoken verylow, and almost with a sob." Will you try not to meddle in future, and not tocry at the table, nor pout and sulk when you arepunished ?" he asked in a cold, grave tone."Yes, sir, I will try to be a good girl always," saidthe humble little voice."Then I will forgive you," he replied, taking thehandkerchief off her hand.Still Elsie lingered. She felt as if she could notgo without some little token of forgiveness and love,some slight caress.He looked at her with an impatient "Well?"Then, in answer to her mute request, " No," he said,"I will not kiss you to-night; you have been entirelytoo naughty. Go to your room at once."Aunt Chloe was absolutely frightened by the vio-lence of her child's grief, as she rushed into the roomand flung herself into her arms weeping and sobbingmost vehemently."What's de matter, darlin' ?" she asked in greatalarm."0 mammy, mammy!" sobbed the child, "papawouldn't kiss me! he said I was too naughty. 0mammy ! will he ever love me now "<pb n="176"/>ff l ptir it    bent1)."The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on."SnAKsPREAIE, Rlic/ard III."A blossom full of promise is life's joy,That never comes to fruit.

The regular time for this hadoccurred once since Mr. Horace Dinsmore's return,when she, of course, handed Elsie's to him.It was very satisfactory, for Elsie was a most dili-gent scholar, carrying her religious principles intothat as well as everything else; and disposed as Misspay was to find fault with her, she could seldom     seeany excuse for so doing, in either her conduct or re-citations.Mr. Dinsmore glanced over the report and handedit back, saying, "It is all very good; very satisfactoryindeed. I am glad to see that she is industrious andwell behaved, for I wish her to grow up an intelligentand amiable woman."<pb n="177"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              177Elsie, who was standing near, heard the words, andthey sent a glow of pleasure to her cheek. Shelooked up eagerly; but her father turned and walkedaway without taking any notice of her, and the glowof happiness faded, and the soft eyes filled with tearsof wounded feeling.It was now time for a second report; but alas! thepast month had been a most unfortunate one for thelittle girl: the weather was very warm, and she hadfelt languid and weak, and so much were her thoughtsoccupied with the longing desire to gain her father'slove, so depressed were her spirits by her constantfailure to do so, that she often found it impossible togive her mind to her lessons.Arthur, too, during much of the time before andsince the week of his imprisonment, had been morethan usually annoying, shaking her chair and joggingher elbow so frequently when she was writing, thather copy-book presented by no means as good an ap-pearance as usual; and never had Miss Day made outso poor a report for her. She carried it with muchsecret satisfaction to the little girl's father, and en-tered a long complaint of the child's idleness andinattention."Send her to me," he said, angrily. "She willfind me in my own room."Miss Day had left Elsie in the school-room puttingher desk in order after the day's work, and she foundher still there on her return."Elsie," said she, with a malicious smile, " your<pb n="178"/>t78            ELSIE DINSMOPZE.father wishes to see you immediately, He Ia in hisroom."The child turned red and pale by turns, adt trem,bled so violently that for a moment she wsa quiteunable to move; for she guessed from Miss Day'scountenance what was probably in store for her."I advise you to go at once," said that lady. "?'ono dot A the longer you wait the worse it will he foryou."At the same moment Mr. Dinsmore's voice washeard calling in a stern, angry tone, "Elsie!"Making a violent effort to control her feelings, ahestarted up and hastened to obey.The door of his room stood open, and she walkelin, asking in a trembling voice, "Did you call me,papa ?"" Yes," said he, " I did. Come here to me."He was sitting with the copy-book and report inhis hand, and there was much severity in both toneand look as he addressed her.She obeyed instantly, but trembling violently, andwith a face pale as death, and eyes filled with tears.She lifted them pleadingly to his face; and, touchedby her evident terror and distress, he said in a tonesomewhat less stern, "Can you tell me, Elsie, how ithappens that your teacher brings me so bad a reportof your conduct and lessons during the past month IShe says you have been very idle; and the reporttells the same story; and this copy-book presents ashameful appearance."<pb n="179"/>ELSIE DINSHORE.             179The child answered only by tears and sobs.They seemed to irritate him." Elsie," he said, sternly, " when I ask a question,I require an answer, and that instantly.""0 papa I" she answered, pleadingly, "I couldn'tstudy. I'm very sorry-I'll try to do better-onlydon't be very angry with me, dear papa."" I am angry with you; very angry, indeed," saidhe in the same severe tone, " and very strongly in-clined to punish you.   You couldn't study, eh.What reason can you assign, pray ?  Were you notwell.""I don't know, sir," sobbed the little girl."You don't know ?  Very well, then, I think youcould not be very ill without knowing it, and so youseem to have no excuse at all to offer ?  However, Iwill not inflict any punishment upon you this time,as you seem to be really sorry, and have promised todo better; but beware how you let me see such a re-port as this, or hear such complaints of idlenessagain, unless you wish to be severely punished; and Iwarn you that unless your next copy-book presents abetter appearance than this, I certainly shall punishyou." There are a number of pages here that look quitewell," he continued, turning over the leaves; " thatshows what you can do, if you choose, now there iian old saying, ' A bird that can sing, and won't sing,must be made to sing.'

And<pb n="180"/>I80            ELSIE DINSMORE.throwing himself back in his easy chair, he took up anewspaper and began to lead.Yet Elsie lingered: her heart so yearned for oneword or look of sympathy sad love; she so longedto throw herself into his firms and tell him howdearly, how very dearly she loved him; she did sohunger and thirst for one fond caress-ah! howcould she go away without it now, when for the veryfirst time she found herself alone with him in his ownroom, where she had never ventured before, butwhere she had often been in her brightest dreams.And so she lingered, trembling, hoping, fearing;but presently he looked up with a cold "Why doyou stand there  I gave you permission to go; goat once."  And with a sinking heart she turnedaway and sought the solitude of her own room, thereto weep, and mourn, and pray that she might oneday possess the love she so pined for, and bitterly toreproach herself for having by the failures of thepast month put it farther from her.And soon a thought came to her which addedgreatly to her distresss.  If Arthur continued hispersecutions, how could she make the next copy;book more presentable ? and in case it were not, herfather had said positively that he would punish ner;and oh I how could she bear punishment from him,when a word or look of displeasure almost broke herneart ?Miss Day seldom remained in the school-roomduring the whole of the writing hour, and some-<pb n="181"/>ELSIE DINS.IORE.             18Itimes the older girls were also absent, so taat Arthurbad ample opportunity to indulge his mischievouspropensities; for Elsie was above the meanness oftelling tales, and had she not been, Arthur was sogreat a favorite with his mother that she would havebrought a great deal of trouble upon herself by sedoing.She therefore saw no escape from the dreadeapunishment, unless she could persuade the perverseboy to cease his annoyances; and of that there waslittle hope.But she carried her trouble to her Heavenly Father,and asked Him to help her.  She was still on herknees, pouring out her sobs and prayers, when someone knocked at the door.She rose and opened it to find her Aunt Adelaidestanding there."Elsie," she said, "I am writing to Miss Rose;save you any word to send ? You may write a littlenote, if you choose, and I will enclose it in my letter.But what is the matter, child ?" she suddenly ex-claimed, kindly taking the little girl's hand inhers.With many tears and sobs Elsie told her the wholestory, not omitting her papa's threat, and her fearthat she could not, on account of Arthur's persecu-tions, avoid incurring the punishment.Adelaide's sympathies were enlisted, and she drewthe sobbing child to her side, saying, as she presseda kiss on her cheek, " Never mind, Elsie, I will take<pb n="182"/>182            LSIE DINSMORA.my book or needle-work to the school-room everyday, and sit there during the writing hour. But whydon't you tell your papa about it? "" Because I don't like to tell tales, Aunt Adelaideand it would make your mamma so angry with me;and besides, I can't tell papa anything."" Ah, I understand! and no wonder; he isstrangely stern to the poor child. I mean to givehim a good talking to," murmured Adelaide, moreas if thinking aloud than talking to Elsie.Then kissing the little girl again, she rose hastilyand left the room, with the intention of seeking hetbrother; but he had gone out; and when he returnedhe brought several gentlemen with him, and she hadno opportunity until the desire to interfere in thematter had passed from her mind." And it shall came to pass, that before they call,I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I willhear."  The promise had been fulfilled to Elsie, andhelp had been sent her in her trouble.WVhen her Aunt Adelaide left her, Elsie-firstcarefully locking the door to guard against a surprisevisit from Enna-went to her bureau, and unlocking adrawer, took out a purse she was knitting for her father,to replace the one she had given to Miss Allison.She had commenced it before his return, andhaving spent upon it nearly every spare momentsince, when she could feel secure from intrusion, shenow had it nearly complete_  Ah! many a silenttear had fallen as she worked, and many a sigh over<pb n="183"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             183disappointed hopes had been woven into its brightmeshes of gold and blue.But now she had been much comforted and en-couraged by her aunt's sympathy and kind promiseof assistance, and, though there were still traces oftears upon it, the little face looked quite bright andcheerful again as she settled herself in her little sew-ing-chair, and began her work.The small white fingers moved right briskly, thebright shining needles glancing in and out, while thethoughts, quite as busy, ran on something in thisfashion: " Ah!

It is only onemonth, and then June will be over, and Miss Day isgoing North to spend July and August, and may beSeptember, and so we shall have a long holiday.Surely I can stand it one month more; it will soonbe over, though it does seem a long time, and be-sides, this month we are not to stndv so many hours,because it is so warm ; and there's to be no school onSaturdays; none to-morrow, so that 1 can finish this.Ah! I wonder if papa will be pleased?" and shesighed deeply. "I'm afraid it will be a long, Ioni time<pb n="184"/>184            ELSIE DIZSMORE.before he will be pleased with me again. I have dis-pleased him twice this week-first about the bird,and now this bad report, and that shameful copy-book. But oh ! I will try so hard next month, anddear Aunt Adelaide will keep Arthur from troublingme, and I'm determined my copy-book shall lookneat, and not have a single blot in it." I wonder how I shall spend the vacation? Lastsummer I had such a delightful visit at Ashlands;and then they were here all the rest of the time. Itwas then poor Herbert had such a dreadful time withhis hip. Ah ! how thankful I ought to be that I amnot lame, and have always been so healthy. But I'mafraid papa won't let me go there this summer, norask them to visit me, because he said he thoughtLucy was not a suitable companion for me. I wasvery naughty when she was here, and I've beennaughty a great many times since. Oh ! dear, shall Inever, never learn to be good? It seems to me I amnaughty now much oftener than I used to be beforepapa came home. I'm afraid he will soon begin topunish me severely, as he threatened to-day. I won.der what he means ? "A crimson tide suddenly swept over the fair faceand neck, and dropping her work, she covered herface with her hands.  " Oh! he couldn't, couldnmean that! how could I ever bear it! and yet if it would make me really good, I think I wouldn't mindthe pain-but the shame and disgrace! oh ! it wouldbreak my heart. I could never hold up my head<pb n="185"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             185again! Oh! can he mean that  But I must just try tobe so very good that I will never deserve punishment,and then it will make no difference to me what hemeans."   And with this consolatory reflection shetook up her work again." Mammy, is papa in his room ?" asked Elsie, thenext afternoon, as she put the finishing touches toher work."No, darlin', Marster Horace he rode out wid dostrange gentlemen more than an hour ago."Elsie laid her needles away in her work-basket, andopening her writing-desk, selected a bit of note-paper,on which she wrote in her very bLt hand, " A pre-sent for my dear papa, from   hui little daughterElsie !"  This she carefully pinned to the purse, andthen carried it to her papa's room, intending to leaveit on his toilet-table.Fearing that he might possibly have returned, sheknocked gently at the door, but receiving no answer,opened it, and went in; but she had not gone morethan halfway across the room when she heard hisvoice behind her, asking, in a tone of mingled surpriseand displeasure, " What are you doing here in myroom, in my absence, Elsie 3 "She started, and turned round, pale and trembling,and lifting her eyes pleadingly to his face, silentlyplaced the purse in his hand.He looked first at it, and then at her."I made it for you, dear papa," she said, in a low,tremulous tone; " do please take it."<pb n="186"/>186           ELSIE DINSMORE."It is really very pretty," he said, examining it;"is it possible it is your work ? I had no idea youhad so much taste and skill. Thank you, daughter'I shall take it, and use it with a great deal of pleasure."He took her hand as he spoke, and sitting downlifted her to his knee, saying, " Elsie, my child, whydo you always seem so afraid of me ? I don't like it."With a sudden impulse she threw her arms roundhis neck, and pressed her lips to his cheek; thendropping her head on his breast, she sobbed, " papa! dear papa, I do love you so very dearly I willyou not love me? O papa! love me a little.   Iknow I've been naughty very often, but I will try tobe good."Then for the first time he folded her m his armsand kissed her tenderly, saying, in a moved tone,"I do love you, my darling, my own little daughter."Oh! the words were sweeter to Elsie's ear than themost delicious music! her joy was too great forwords, for anything but tears."Why do you cry so, my darling ?" he asked,soothingly, stroking her hair, and kissing her againand again." 0 papa! because I am so happy, so very happy,"she sobbed." Do you indeed care so very much for my lovea "he asked; " then, my daughter, you must not trembleand turn pale whenever I speak to you, as though Iwere a crVel tyrant."<pb n="187"/>ELSIE DINSfORE.             187"0 papa! I cannot help it, when you look andspeak so sternly. I love you so dearly I cannot bearto have you angry with me; but I am not afraid cdyou now.""That is right," he said, caressing her again."But there is the tea-bell," he added, setting herdown. " Go into the dressing-room there, and batheyour eyes, and then come to me."She hastened to do his bidding, and then takingher hand he led her down and seated her in herusual place by his side.There were visitors, and all his conversation wasaddressed to them and the older members of thefamily, but he now and then bestowed a kind lookupon his little girl, and attended carefully to all tierwants; and Elsie was very happy.Everything now went on very pleasantly with ourlittle friend for some days; she did not see a greatdeal of her father, as he was frequently away fromhome for a day or two, and, when he returned, gener-ally brought a number of visitors with him; butwhenever he did notice her it was very kindly, andshe was gradually overcoming her fear of him, andconstantly hoping that the time would soon comewhen he would have more leisure to bestow uponher. She was happy now, and with a mind at ease,was able to learn her lessons well; and as her AuntAdelaide faithfully kept her promise, and thus freeaher from Arthur's annoyances, she was enabled to dojustice to her writing. She took great pains, and<pb n="188"/>e88           ELSIE DINSMORP.her copybook showed a marked improvement in herpenmanship, and its pages had not yet been defacedby a single blot, so that she was looking forward withpleasing anticipations to the time when her reportshould again be presented to her father.But, alas! one unfortunate morning it happenedthat Miss Day was in a very bad humor indeed-peevish, fretful, irritable, and unreasonable to thelast degree; and as usual, Elsie was the principal suf-ferer from her ill-humor.  She found fault witheverything the little girl did; scolded her, shook her,refused to explain the manner of working out a verydifficult example, or to permit her to apply to any oneelse for assistance, and then punished her because itwas done wrong; and when the child could no longerkeep back her tears, called her a baby for crying, anda dunce for not understanding her arithmetic better.All this Elsie bore meekly and patiently, not an-swering a word; but her meekness seemed only toprovoke the governess the more; and finally, whenElsie came to recite her last lesson, she took pains toput her questions in the most perplexing form, andscarcely allowing the child an instant to begin herreply, answered them herself, and then, throwing downthe book, scolded her vehemently for her bad lessor,and marked it in her report as a complete failure.Poor Elsie could bear no more, but bursting intatears and sobs, said, " Miss Day, I did know my les.son, every word of it, if you had asked the questionsas usual, or had given me time to answer."<pb n="189"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               189"I say that you did not know it; that it was acomplete failure," replied Miss Day, angrily; "an you shall just sit down and learn it, every wordover.""I do know it, if you would hear me right," saidElsie, indignantly, "and it is very unjust in you tomark it a failure."" Impudence !" exclaimed Miss Day, furiously"how dare you contradict me ? I shall take you toyour father."And seizing her by the arm, she dragged her acroathe room, and opening the door, pushed her into thepassage." Oh! don't, Miss Dav," pleaded the little girl, turn-ing toward her, pale and tearful, " don't tell papa.""I will! so just walk along with you," was theangry rejoinder, as she pushed her before her to Mr.Dinsmore's door. It stood open, and he sat at hisdesk, writing."What is the matter " he asked, looking up asthey appeared before the door." Elsie has been very impertinent, sir," said MissDay; " she not only accused me of injustice, but con.tradicted me flatly."" Is it possible I " said he, frowning angrily. " Comehere to me, Elsie, and tell me, is it true that youcontradicted your teacher ""Yes, papa," sobbed the child."Very well, then, I shall certainly punish you, for[ will never allow anything of the kind."<pb n="190"/>190            ELSL ' DINSMORE.As he spoke he picked up a small ruler that laybefore him, at the same time taking Elsie's hand asthough he meant to use it on her."0 papa!" she cried, in a tone of agonized en-treaty.But he laid it down again, saying, "No, I shallpunish you by depriving you of your play this after-noon, and giving you only bread and water for yourarnner. Sit down there," he added, pointing to astool. Then, with a wave of his hand to the gov-erness, "I think she will not be guilty of the likeagain, Miss Day."The governess left the room, and Elsie sat down onher stool, crying and sobbing violently, while herfather went on with his writing."Elsie," he said, presently, "cease that noise; Ihave had quite enough of it."She struggled to suppress her sobs, but it was al.mnnst impossible, and she felt it a great relief when amoment later the dinner-bell rang, and her father leftthe room.In a few moments a servant came in, carrying on asmall waiter a tumbler of water, and a plate with aslice of bread on it."Dis am drefful poor fare, Miss Elsie," he said,setting it down beside her, "but Massa Horace hesay it all you can hab; but if you say so, dis chiletell ole Phoebe to send up somethin' better fore MassaHorace gits through his dinner.""Oh! no, thank you, Pompey; you're very kind,<pb n="191"/>ELSIE DINSSIORE             191but I would not disobey, nor deceive papa," repliedthe little girl, earnestly; " and I am not at all hungry."He lingered a moment, seeming loath to leave herto dine upon such fare." You had better go now, Pompey," she said gently;"I am afraid you will be wanted."He turned and left the room muttering somethingabout " disagreeable, good-for-nothing Miss Day !"Elsie felt no disposition to eat; and when her fa.ther returned, half an hour afterward, the bread andwater were still untouched."What is the meaning of this?" he asked in astern, angry tone; " why have you not eaten what Isent you ?"" I am not hungry, papa," she said, humbly."Don't tell me that," he replied, " it is nothing butstubbornness; and I shall not allow you to show sucha temper. Take up that bread this moment, and eatit. You shall eat every crumb of the bread, and drinkevery drop of the water."She obeyed him instantly, breaking off a bit ofbread and putting it in her mouth, while he stoodwatching her with an air of stern, cold determination;but when she attempted to swallow, it seemed utterlyimpossible." I cannot, papa," she said, " it chokes me."" You must," he replied; " I am going to be obeyed. Take a drink of water, and that will wash itdown."It was a hard task, but seeing that there was n.<pb n="192"/>'92            ELSIE DINSOIrE.escape, she struggled to obey, and at length everycrumb of bread and drop of water had disappeared." Now, Elsie," said her father, in a tone of greatseverity, "never dare to show me such a temper asthis again; you will not escape so easily next time;remember I am to be obeyed always; and when Isend you anything to eat, you are to eat it."It had not been temper at all, and his unjust se-verity almost broke her heart; but she could not sayone word in her. own defence.He looked at her a moment as she sat there trem-bling and weeping, then saying, "I forbid you toleave this. room without my permission; don't venture to disobey me, Elsie; sit where you are until Ireturn," he turned to go."Papa," she asked, pleadingly, "may I have mybooks, to learn my lessons for to-morrow ? "" Certainly," he said, " I will send a servant withliem.""And my Bible too, please, papa.""Yes, yes,': he answered impatiently, as he wentout and shut tha door.Jim was just bringing up Elsie's horse, as Mr.Dinsmore passed through the hall, and he stepped outto order it back to the stable, saying that Miss Elsiewas not going to ride." What is the trouble with Elsie ?" asked his sis-ter Adelaide, as he returned to the drawing-room andseated himself beside her."She has been impertinent to her governess, and 1<pb n="193"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              193have confined her to my room for the rest of the day,"he replied rather shortly." Are you sure, Horace, that Elsie was so much toblame " asked his sister, speaking in a tone too lowto reach any ear but his. "I am certain, from whatLora tells me, that Miss Day is often cruelly unjustto her; more so than to any other of her pupils."He looked at her with a good deal of surprise."Are you not mistaken ?" he asked."No! it is a positive fact that she does at timesreally abuse her."" Indeed! I shall certainly not allow that," he said,coloring with anger."But in this instance, Adelaide," he added, thought-fully, " I think you must be mistaken; for Elsie ac-knowledged that she had been impertinent. I didnot condemn her unheard, stern and severe as youthink me.""If she was, Horace, believe me it must havebeen only after great provocation, and her acknowl-edgment of it is no proof at all, to my mind; forElsie is so humble, she would think she must havebeen guilty of impertinence if Miss Day accused heiof it."" Surely not, Adelaide; she is by no means want-ing in sense," he replied, in a tone of incredulity, notunmixed with annoyance.Then he sat thinking a moment, half inclined togo to his child and inquire more particularly into thecircumstances, but soon relinquished the idea, saying<pb n="194"/>194            ELSIE DIYSMORE.to himself, " No; if she does not choose to be frankwith me, and say what she can in her own defence,she deserves to suffer; and besides, she showed suchstubbornness about eating that bread."He was very proud, and did not like to acknowl-edge even to himself that he had punished his childunjustly-much less to her; and it was not until nealtea-time that he returned to his room, entering sosoftly that Elsie did not hear him.She was sitting just where he had left her, bend-ing over her Bible, an expression of sadness and deephumility on the sweet little face, so young and fairand innocent. She did not seem aware of his pres-ence until he was close beside her, when, looking upwith a start, she said in a voice full of tears, "Dearpapa, I am very sorry for all my naughtiness; willyou please forgive me "" Yes," he said, " certainly I win, if you are reallysorry;" and stooping, he kissed her coldly, saying," Now go to your room, and let Chloe dress you foxtea."She rose at once, gathered up her books, and wentout.The little heart was very sad; for her father's man-ner was so cold she feared he would never love hexagain. And she was particularly distressed by thebad mark given her for recitation that day, becauseshe knew the time was now drawing very near whenecr report must be handed in to her papa; and thedelight with which she had hitherto looked forward<pb n="195"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             195to receiving his well-merited approbation, was nowchanged to fear, and dread of his displeasure; yetshe knew she had not deserved the bad mark, andagain and again she determined that she would tellher father all about it; but his manner had now be-*ome so cold and stern that she could not summon upcourage to do so, but put it off from day to day, untilt was too late.:  .

School hadclosed, and all but Elsie had already left the room;but she was carefully arranging the books, -writingand drawing materials, etc., in her desk, for she wasvery neat and orderly in her habits.When she had quite finished her work she took upher report-book, and glanced over it.    As her eyerested for an instant upon the one bad mark, shesighed a little, and murmured to herself, "I am    sesorry: I wish papa knew how little I really deservecit.  I don't know why I never can get the courage totell himr  "Then laying it aside, she opened her copybook andturned over the leaves with unalloyed pleasure, fornot one of its pages was defaced by a single blot,and from beginning to end it gave evidence of painrstaking carefulness and decided improvenment.<pb n="197"/>ELSIE DINTMORE.             197" Ah! surely this will please dear papa!" she ex-claimed, half aloud. "How good Aunt Adelaide wasto sit here with me!"Then putting it carefully m its place, she closedand locked the desk, and carrying the key to herroom, laid it on the mantel, where she was in thehabit of keeping it.Now it so happened that afternoon that Arthur,who had made himself sick by over-indulgence insweetmeats, and had in consequence been loungingabout the house doing nothing for the last day ortwo, remained at home while all the rest of the familywere out, walking, riding, or visiting.He was not usually very fond of reading, but whilelying on the lounge in the nursery, very much inwant of some amusement, it suddenly occurred tonim that he would like to look at a book he hadseen Elsie reading that morning.To be sure the book belonged to her, and she wasnot there to be consulted as to her willingness tolend it; but that made no difference to Arthur, whohad very little respect for the rights of property, ex-cepting where his own were concerned.Elsie, he knew, was out, and Chloe in the kitchen;so feeling certain there would be no one to interferewith him, he went directly to. the little girl's room tolook for the book. He soon found it lying on themantel; but the desk-key lay right beside it, and ashe caught sight of that he gave a half scream of de-light, for he guessed at once to what lock it belonged,H <pb n="198"/>(98            ELSIE DlINSMOREand felt that he now could accomplish the revenge hehad plotted ever since the affair of the watch.He put out his hand to take it, but drew it backagain, and stood for a moment balancing in his mindthe chances of detection.He could deface Elsie's copybook, but Adelaidecould testify to the little girl's carefulness, and theneatness of her work up to that very day, for she hadbeen in the school-room that morning during thewriting hour. But then Adelaide had just left homoto pay a visit to a friend living at some distance, andwould not return for several weeks, so there was littledanger from that quarter.  Miss Day, to be sureknew the appearance of Elsie's book quite as well,but there was still less danger of her interference,and he was pretty certain no one else knew.So he decided to run the risk, and laying downthe book he took the key, went to the door, lookedCarefully up and down the hall to make sure of notbeing seen by any of the servants, and having satiasfled himself on that point, hurried to the school-room,unlocked Elsie's desk, took out her copybook, anddipping a pen in the ink, proceeded deliberately toblot nearly every page in it; on some he made alarge blot, on others a small one, and on some two o0three; and also scribbled between the lines and oithe margin, so as completely to deface poor Elsie'awork.But to do Arthur justice, though he knew his brather would be pretty sure to be very angry with<pb n="199"/>ELSIS DINSMORE.             19gElsie, he did not know of the threatened punish-ment. He stopped once or twice as he thought heheard a footstep, and shut down the lid until it hadpassed, when he raised it again and went on with hiswicked work. It did not take long, however, and he3oon replaced the copybook in the precise spot inwhich he had found it, wiped the pen, and put itcarefully back in its place, relocked the desk, hurriedback to Elsie's room, put the key just where he hadfound it, and taking the book, returned to the nurserywithout having met any one.He threw himself down on a couch and tried toread, but in vain; he could not fix his attention uponthe page-could think of nothing but the mischiefhe had done, and its probable consequences; andnow, when it was too late, he more than half repented;yet as to confessing and thus saving Elsie from unmerited blame, he did not for a single moment enter-tain the thought. But at length it suddenly occurredto him that if it became known that he had beeninto Elsie's room to get the book he might be sus-pected; and he started up with the intention ofreplacing it. But he found that it was too late; shehad already returned, for he heard her voice in thehall; so he lay down again, and kept the book untilshe came in search of it.He looked very guilty as the little girl came in,but not seeming to notice it, she merely said, "I amlooking for my book. I thought perhaps some onemight have brought it in here. Oh! you have it,<pb n="200"/>200            SELUS    DINYSHORE.Arthur! well, keep it, if you wish; I can read itjust as well another time."" Here, take it," said he roughly, pushing it towardher; "I don't want it; 'tisn't a bit pretty.""I think it is very interesting, and you are quite;welcome to read it if you wish," she answeredmildly; "but if you don't care to, I will take it." " Young ladies and gentlemen," said the governess,'as they were about closing their exercises the nextmorning, " this is the regular day for the reports, andthey are all made out. Miss Elsie, here is yours;bring your copybook, and carry both to your papa."Elsie obeyed, not without some trembling, yethoping, as there was but one bad mark in the reportand the copybook showed such evident marks ofcare and painstaking, her papa would not be veryseriously displeased.It being the last day of the term, the exercises ofthe morning had varied somewhat from the usualroutine, and the writing hour had been entirelyomitted; thus it happened that Elsie had not openedher copybook, and was in consequence still in igno-rance of its sadly altered appearance.She found her father in his room. He took thereport first from her hand, and glancing over it, saidwith a slight frown, "I see you have one very badmark for recitation; but as there is only one, and theothers are remarkably good, I will excuse it."Then taking the copybook and opening it, muchto Elsie's surprise and alarm he gave her a glance of<pb n="201"/>ELSIE DIASXIOIE.           201great displeasure, turned rapidly over the leaves, thenlaying it down, said in his sternest tones, " I see Ishall have to keen my promise, Elsie.""What, 'papa ." she asked, turning pale withterror." What I" said he; " do you ask me what ? Did 1not tell you positively that I would punish you ifyour copybook this month did not present a betterappearance than it did last ?""0 papal does it not?    I tried so very hard;and there are no blots in it."" No blots? " said he; " what do you call these ? 'and he turned over the leaves again, holding the bookso that she could see them, and showing that almostevery one was blotted in several places.Elsie gazed at them in unfeigned astonishment;then looking up into his face, she said earnestly butfearfully, " Papa, I did not do it.""Who did, then?" he asked."Indeed, papa, I do not know," she replied."I must inquire into this business," he said, losing,and if it is not your fault you shall not be punished;but if I find you have been telling me a falsehood,Elsie, I shall punish you much more severely than ifyou had not denied your fault."And taking her by the hand as he spoke, he ledher back to the school-room."Miss Day," said he, showing the book, "Elsiesays these blots are not her work; can you tell mewhose they are ?"<pb n="202"/>202            ELSIE DINSMORE." Miss Elsie generally tells the truth, sir," repliedMiss Day, sarcastically, "but I must say that in thisinstance I think she has failed, as her desk has agood lock, and she herself keeps the key.""Elsie," he asked, turning to her, " is this so ?""Yes, papa.""And have you ever left your desk unlocked, orthe key lying about ?""No, papa. I am quite certain I have not," sheanswered unhesitatingly, though her voice trembled,and she grew very pale." Very well then, I am quite certain you have toldme a falsehood, since it is evident this must havebeen your work. Elsie, I can forgive anything butfalsehood, but that I never will forgive.  Comewith me. I shall teach you to speak the truth tome, at least, if to no one else," and taking her handagain, he led, or rather dragged, her from the room,for he was terribly angry, his face fairly pale withpassion.Lora came in while he was speaking, and, certainthat Elsie would never be caught in a falsehood, hereye quickly sought Arthur's desk.He was sitting there with a very guilty countenance.She hastily crossed the room, and speaking in alow tone, said, " Arthur, you have had a hand in thisbusiness I very well know; now confess it quickly, oiHorace will half kill Elsie."" You don't know anything about it," said he dog.gedly.<pb n="203"/>ELSIE DN1SSZORE.            203"Yes I do," she answered; "and if you do notspeak out at once, I shall save Elsie, and find meansto prove your guilt afterward; so you had much bet-ter confess."" Go away," he exclaimed angrily, " I have nothingto confess."Seeing it was useless to try to move him, Loraturned away and hurried to Horace's room, which,in her haste, she entered without knocking, he havingfortunately neglected to fasten the door. She wasjust in time; he had a small riding whip in his hand,and Elsie stood beside him pale as death, too muchfrightened even to cry, and trembling so that she couldscarcely stand.He turned an angry glance on his sister as sheentered; but taking no notice of it, she exclaimedeagerly, " Horace, don't punish Elsie, for I am certainshe is innocent."He laid down the whip, asking " How do youknow it? whatproof have you? I shall be very gladto be convinced," he added, his countenance relax-ing somewhat in its stern and angry expression."In the first place," replied his sister, "there isElsie's established character for truthfulness-in allthe time she has been with us, we have ever foundher perfectly truthful in word and deed. And then,Horace, what motive could she have had for spoilingher book, knowing as she did that certain punish-ment would follow ? Besides, I am sure Arthur is atthe bottom of this, for though he will not acknowledge,H*<pb n="205"/>ELSIE DlIfSMORE.            205have turned all her love for me into hatred; andjustly, too.""No, papa, oh! no, no   nothing could ever dothat I" and the little arms were clasped closer andcloser about his neck, and the tears again fell likerain, as she timidly pressed her quivering lips to hischeek" There, there daughter! don't cry any more; wewill try to forget all about it, and talk of somethingelse," he said soothingly. "Elsie, dear, your AuntAdelaide thinks perhaps you were not so very muchto blame the other day; and now I want you totell me all the circumstances; for though I shouldbe very sorry to encourage you to find fault withyour teacher, I am by no means willing to have youabused.""Please, papa, don't ask me," she begged. " AuntLora was there, and she will tell you about it.""No, Elsie," he said, very decidedly, "I want thestory from you; and remember, I want every wordthat passed between you and Miss Day, as fai as youcan possibly recall it."Seeing that he was determined, Elsie obeyed him,though with evident reluctance, and striving to putMiss Day's conduct in as favorable a light as consist-ent with truth, while she by no means extenuatedher own; yet her father listened with feelings ofstrong indignation."Elsie," he said when she had done, "if I hadknown all this at the time, I should not have pun-u* 2<pb n="206"/>206            ELsrB DINSMOREished you at all.

Well, daughter," he added, kiss-ing her tenderly, " I shall endeavor to be less sterin future, and you must try to be less timid andmore at your ease with me.""I will, papa," she replied meekly; "but indeed Icannot help feeling frightened when you are angrywith me."Mr. Dinsmore sat there a long time with his littledaughter on his knee, caressing her more tenderlythan ever before; and Elsie was very happy, andtalked more freely to him than she had ever done,telling him of her joys and her sorrows; how dearlyhe had loved Miss Allison-what happy hours theyaad spent together in studying the Bible and inprayer-how grieved she was when her friend wentaway-and how intensely she enjoyed the little letternow and then received from her; and he listened toit all, apparently both pleased and interested, encour.aging her to go on by an occasional question or aword of assent or approval.<pb n="207"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             207" What is this, Elsie ?" he asked, taking hold ofthe chain she always wore around her neck, anddrawing the miniature from her bosom.But as he touched the spring and the case flewopen, revealing the sweet, girlish face, it needed notElsie's low murmured "Mamma" to tell him whothat lovely lady was.He gazed upon it with emotion, carried back inmemory to the time when for a few short months shehad been his own most cherished treasure. Then,looking from it to his child, he murmured, "Yes,she is very like-the same features, the same ex-pression, complexion, hair and all-will be the verycounterpart of her if she lives.""Dear papa, am I like mamma " asked Elsie, whohad caught a part of his words."Yes, darling, very much indeed, and I hope youwill grow more so."" You loved mamma 2" she said inquiringly."Dearly, very dearly."" 0 papa ! tell me about her ! do, dear papa," shepleaded eagerly."I have not much to tell," he said, sighing. "Iknew her only for a few short months ere we weretorn asunder, never to meet again on earth.""But we may hope to meet her in heaven, dearpapa," said Elsie softly, " for she loved Jesus, and ifwe love Him we shall go there too when we die.Do you love Jesus, papa ? " she timidly inquired, forshe had seen him do a number of things which she<pb n="208"/>2o8           ELSIE DINS1MOZE.knew to be wrong-such as riding out for pleasureon the Sabbath, reading secular newspapers, and en-gaging in worldly conversation-and she greatlyfeared he did not.But instead of answering her question, he asked,"Do you, Elsie?"" Oh ! yes, sir; very, very much; even better thanI love you, my own dear papa."" How do you know  " he asked, looking keenlyinto her face." Just as I know that I love you, papa, or any oneelse," she replied, lifting her eyes to his face in evi-dent surprise at the strangeness of the question. "Ah!papa," she added in her own sweet, simple way, " Ido so love to talk to Jesus; to tell Him all my trou-bles, and ask Him to forgive my sins and make meholy; and then it is so sweet to know that He lovesme, and will always love me, even if no one elsedoes."He kissed her very gravely, and set her down, say-ing, " Go now, my daughter, and prepare for dinner;it is almost time for the bell."" You are not displeased, papa ?" she inquired,looking up anxiously into his face."No, darling, not at all," he replied, stroking herhair. "Shall I ride with my little girl this after-noon 2?" 0 papa! do you really mean it? I shall be soglad 1" she exclaimed joyfully." Very well, then," he said, "it is settled.

No, stay," he added quick-y, as she turned to obey; "think a moment andtell me where you put the key of your desk yester-day, for it must have been then the mischief wasdone.

I see it all now," he ex-claimed, with a satisfied nod. " There, that will do,<pb n="210"/>210            ELSIE DINSIORE.Elsie; gu now and make haste down to your din.ner."But Elsie lingered, and, in answer to a look ofkind inquiry from her father, said coaxingly, " Please,papa, don't be very angry with him. I think he didnot know how much I cared about my book.""You are very forgiving Elsie; but go, child, 1shall not abuse him," Mr. Dinsmore answered, withan imperative gesture, and the little girl hurried fromthe room.It happened that just at this time the elder Mr.Dinsmore and his wife were paying a visit to somefriends in the city, and thus Elsie's papa bad beenleft head of the house for the time. Arthur, know-ing this to be the state of affairs, and that though hisfather was expected to return that evening, his motherwould be absent for some days, was beginning to bea good deal fearful of the consequences of his mis-conduct, and not without reason, for his brother'swrath was now fully aroused, and he was determinedthat the boy should not on this occasion escape thrpenalty of his misdeeds.Arthur was already in the dining-room when Mr.Dinsmore came down." Arthur," said he, " I wish you to step into thelibrary a moment; I have something to say to you.""I don't want to hear it," muttered the boy, witha dogged look, and standing perfectly still."I dare say not, sir ;.but that makes no difference,"replied his brother. " Walk into the library at once."<pb n="211"/>ELSIE DINSfORE.            2 IArthur returned a scowl of defiance, mutteringalmost under his breath, " I'll do as I please aboutthat;" but cowed by his brother's determined lookand manner, he slowly and reluctantly obeyed." Now, sir," said Mr. Dinsmore, when he had himfairly in the room, and had closed the door behindthem, "I wish to know how you came to meddlewith Elsie's copybook ?""I didn't," was the angry rejoinder."Take care, sir; I know all about it," said Mr.Dinsmore, in a warning tone; " it is useless for youto deny it. Yesterday, while Elsie was out and AuntChloe in the kitchen, you went to her room, took thekey of her desk from the mantel-piece where she hadleft it, went to the school-room and did the mischief,hoping to get her into trouble thereby, and then, re-locking the desk and returning the key to its properplace, thought you had escaped detection; and I wasvery near giving my poor innocent little girl thewhipping you so richly deserve."Arthur looked up in astonishment." Who told you ?" he asked; " nobody saw me;"then catching himself, said hastily, "I tell you 1didn't do it. I don't know anything about it."" Will you dare to tell me such a falsehood as thatagain ?" exclaimed Mr. Dinsmore, angrily, taking himoy the collar and shaking him roughly." Let me alone now," whined the culprit. " I wantmy dinner, I say.""You'll get no dinner to-day, I can tell you,"<pb n="212"/>?I2            ELSIE DINSMIORkreplied his brother. " I am going to lock you intoyour bedroom, and keep you there until your fathercomes home; and then if he doesn't give you theflogging you deserve, I will; for I intend you shallhave your deserts for once in your life. I know thatall this is in revenge for Elsie's forced testimony inthe affair of the watch, and I gave you fair warningthen that I would see to it that any attempt to abusemy child should receive its just reward."He took the boy by the arm as he spoke, to leadhim from the room.At first Arthur seemed disposed to resist; but soonseeing how useless it was to contend against suchodds, he resigned himself to his fate, saying sullenly," You wouldn't treat me this way if mamma was athome.""She is not, however, as it happens, though I cantell you that even she could not save you now,"replied his brother, as he opened the bedroom door,and pushing him in, locked it upon him, and put thekey in his pocket.Mr. Horace Dinsmore had almost unbounded inflauence over his father, who was very proud of him;the old gentleman also utterly despised everythingmean and underhanded, and upon being made ac.quainted by Horace with Arthur's misdemeanors heinflicted upon him as severe a punishment as anyone could have desired.<pb n="213"/>brapter   iNinti)."Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath oomamnded thee."-Det. v. 12."She is mine own;And I as rich in having such a jewelAs twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold."SHAuexPEAB, Tico Gentlemen of Vrroan.AND now happy days had come to the little Elsie.Her father treated her with the tenderest affection,and kept her with him almost constantly, seemingscarcely willing to have her out of his sight for anhour.   He took her with him wherever he went inhis rides and walks and visits to the neighboringplanters.She was much admired for her beauty and sweet-ness of disposition, much caressed and flattered, but,through it all, lost none of her native modesty, butwas ever the same meek, gentle little girl. She feltgrateful for all the kindness she received, and liked tovisit with her papa; but her happiest days were spentat home on those rare occasions when they were freefrom visitors, and she could sit for hours on his knee,or by his side, talking or reading to him, or working<pb n="214"/>214            ELSIE DINSMORE.at her embroidery, or knitting and listening while haread. He helped her with all her studies, taught hersomething of botany and geology in their walks,helped her to see and correct the faults of her draw-ings, sang with her when she played, bought herquantities of new music, and engaged the best mas-ters to instruct her-in short, took a lively interest,n all her pursuits and pleasures, gave her every in-dulgence, and lavished upon her the tenderest caresses.He was very proud of her beauty, her sweetness, herintelligence, and talent; and nothing pleased him bet-ter than to hear them spoken of by others in termsof praise.And Elsie was very happy; the soft eyes grewbright with happiness, and the little face lost itspensive expression, and became as round and rosyand merry as Enna's.Miss Day went North, expecting to be absent sev-eral months, and Elsie's papa took her travelling,spending some time at different watering-places. Itwas her first journey since she had been old enoughto care for such things, and she enjoyed it exceed-ingly. They left home in July, and did not returnuntil September, so that the little girl had time torest and recruit, both mentally and physically, andwas ready to begin her studies again with zeal andenergy; yet it was so pleasant to be her papa's con.,tant companion, and she had so enjoyed her freedomfrom the restraints of the school-room, that she wasnot at all sorry to learn, on their arrival at Roselands,<pb n="215"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              215that the governess would still be absent for someweeks."How bright and happy the child looks!" wasAdelaide's remark on the day of their return, as, fronthe opposite side of the room, she watched the speak-ing countenajce of the little girl, who was givingEnna and the boys an animated description of herjourney."Yes." said Lora, "and how entirely she seemsto have overcome her fear of her father " for at thatinstant Elsie suddenly left the little group, and run.ting to him, leaned confidingly on his knee, whileapparently urging some request, which he answeredwith a smile and a nod of acquiescence; when sheleft the room, and presently returned carrying a richlybonnd book of engravings.Yes, Elsie had lost her fear of her father, and couldnow talk to him, and tell him her feelings and wishes,as freely as ever Enna did; and no wonder, for in allthese weeks he had never given her one harsh wordor look; but indeed he had had no occasion to doso, for she was always docile and obedient.It was Sabbath afternoon-the first Sabbath aftertheir return-and Elsie was in her own room alonewith the books she loved best-her Bible, hymn.book, and " Pilgrim's Progress."She had spent a very happy hour in self-examina-tion, reading, and prayer, and was singing to herselfin a low tone her favorite hymn," I lay my sins on Jesus,"<pb n="216"/>216            ELSIE DINSMORE.while turning over the leaves of her Bible to find thestory of Elijah, which she had promised to read toChloe that afternoon-when a child's footsteps wereheard coming down the hall, the handle of the doorwas turned hastily, and then, as it refused to yield,Enna's voice called out in a fretful, imperious tone,"Open this door, Elsie Dinsmore. I want in, I say."Elsie sighed, as she thought, " There is an end tomy nice afternoon," but she rose at once, and quickcrossing the room, opened the door, asking pleasantly" What do you want, Enna ? "" I told you I wanted to come in," replied Enna,saucily, " and now you've got to tell me a story toamuse me; mamma says so, because you know I'vegot a cold, and she won't let me go out.""Well, Enna," said Elsie, patiently, "I am goingto read a very beautiful story to mammy, and youare quite welcome to sit here and listen."" I sha'n't have it read! I said you were to tell it.I don't like to hear reading," replied Enna in her im-perious way, at the same time taking quiet posses-sion of Elsie's little rosewood rocking-chair-a latepresent from her papa, and highly prized by the littlegirl on that account-and beginning to scratch withher thumb nail upon the arm."Oh ! don't scratch my pretty new chair, Enna ! Elsie entreated; " it is papa's present, and I wouldn',have it spoiled for a great deal."" I will: who cares for your old chair a" was thereply m a scornful tone, as she gave another and<pb n="217"/>ELSIE DINSSSORE.             217harder dig with her nail. "You're a little old maid-so-particular with all your things-that's whatmamma says you are. Now tell me that story."" I will tell you a story if you will stop scratchingmy chair, Enna," said Elsie, almost with tears in hereyes. " I will tell you about Elijah on Mount Carmel, or Belshazzar's feast, or the children in the fier3furnace, or-""I sha'n't hear any of those ! I don't want any ofyour old Bible stories," interrupted Enna, insolently."You must tell me that pretty fairy tale HerbertCarrington is so fond of."" No, Enna; I cannot tell you that to-day," repliedElsie, speaking gently, but very firmly."I say you shall I" screamed Enna, springing toher feet. " I'll just go and tell mamma, and she'llmake you do it."" Stay, Enna," said Elsie, catching her hand to de-tain her; " I will tell you any story I know that issuitable for the Sabbath; but I cannot tell the fairytale to-day, because you know it would be wrong. Iwill tell it to you to-morrow, though, if you will wait.""You're a bad girl, and I'll just tell mamma ofyou," exclaimed Enna, passionately, jerking her handaway and darting from the room." Oh ! if papa was only at home," sighed Elsie, sink-ing into her rocking-chair, pale and trembling; butshe knew that he had gone out riding, and wouldprobably not return for some time; he had invitedher to accompany him, but she had begged to be al<pb n="218"/>218            ELSIE DIANSKfOR&.owed to stay at home, and he had let her have herwish.As she feared, she was immediately summoned toMrs. Dmsmore's presence."Elsie," said that lady, severely, "are you notashamed of yourself, to refuse Enna such a smallfavor? especially when the poor child is not well.I must say you are the most selfish, disobliging childI ever saw.""I offered to tell her a Bible story, or anythingsuitable for the Sabbath day," replied Elsie, meekly,"but I cannot tell the fairy tale, because it would bewrong.""Nonsense ! there's no harm   at all in tellingfairy tales to-day, any more than any other day;that is just an excuse, Elsie," said Mrs. Dinsmoreangrily."I don't want her old Bible stories. I won't havethem. I want that pretty fairy tale," sobbed Ennmpassionately; " make her tell it, mamma."" Come, come, what is all this fuss about ? " askedthe elder Mr. Dinsmore, coming in from an adjoiningroom." Nothing," said his wife, "except that Ennais not well enough to go out, and wants a fairystory to pass away the time, which Elsie alone isacquainted with, but is too lazy or too self-willed torelate."*  He turned angrily to his little granddaughter." Ah I indeed, is that it ? Well, there is an old say-<pb n="219"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             219mg, 'A bird that can sing, and won't sing, must bemade to sing.'"Elsie was opening her lips to speak, but Mrs. Dins-more bade her be silent, and then went on. " Shepretends it is all on account of conscientious scru-ples. 'It isn't fit for the Sabbath,' she says. Now Isay it is a great piece of impertinence for a child ofher years to set up her opinion against yours andmine; and I know very well it is nothing but anexcuse, because she doesn't choose to be obliging.""Of course It is; nothing in the world but anexcuse," responded Mr. Dinsmore, hotly.Elsie's face flushed, and she answered a littleindignantly," No, grandpa, indeed it is not merely an excuse,but-""Do you dare to contradict me, you impertinentlittle hussy!" cried the old gentleman, interruptingher in the middle of her sentence; and catching heiby the arm, he shook her violently; then picking herup and setting her d6wn hard upon a chair, he said," Now, miss, sit you there until your father comeshome, then we will see what he thinks of such impertinence; and if he doesn't give you the complete.whipping you deserve, I miss my guess.""Please, grandpa, I--"" Hold your tongue! don't dare to speak anotherword until your father comes home," said he, threat-mningly. "If you don't choose to say what you'rewanted to, you shall not talk at all."<pb n="220"/>220            ELSIE DINSMORE.Then goinmg to the door, he called a servant andbade him tell "Mr. Horace," as soon as he returned.that he wished to see him.For the next half-hour-and a very long one itseemed to her-Elsie sat there wishing for, and yetdreading her father's coming. Would he inflict uponher the punishment which her grandfather evidentlywished her to receive, without pausing to inquire intothe merits of the case? or would he listen patientlyto her story? And even if he did, might he notstill think her deserving of punishment ? She coulnnot answer these questions to her own satisfaction.A few months ago she would have been certain of avery severe chastisement, and even now she trembledwith fear; for though she knew beyond a doubt thatne loved her dearly, she knew also that he was astrict and severe disciplinarian, and never excused herfaults.At last her ear caught the sound of his step in theball, and her heart beat fast and faster as it drewnearer, until he entered, and addressing his father,asked, " Did you wish to see me, sir ? "" Yes, Horace, I want you to attend to this girl,"replied the old gentleman, with a motion of the headtoward Elsie.  " She has been very impertinent tome.""What ! Elsie impertinent ! is it possible I I certainly expected better things of her."His tone expressed great surprise, and turning tohis little daughter, he regarded her with a grave, sad<pb n="221"/>ELSIE DIVSMORE.             221look that brought the tears to her eyes: dearly asshe loved him, it seemed almost harder to bear thanthe old expression of stern severity." It is hard to believe," he said, " that my littleElsie would be guilty of such conduct; but if shehas been, of course she must be punished, for I can-not allow anything of the kind. Go, Elsie, to mydressing-room and remain there until I come to you.""Papa- " she began, bursting into tears." Hush I" he said, with something of the old stern-ness; "not a word; but obey me instantly."Then as Elsie went sobbing from the room, heseated himself, and turning to his father, said, " Now,sir, if you please, I should like to hear the wholestory; precisely what Elsie has done and said, andwhat was the provocation; for that must also be takeninto the account, in order that I may be able to doher justice."" If you do her justice, you will whip her well,"remarked his father in a tone of asperity.Horace colored violently, for nothing aroused hisire sooner than any interference between him and hischild; but controlling himself, he replied quite calmly,"If I find her deserving of punishment, I will notspare her; but I should be sorry indeed to punishher unjustly. Will you be so good as to tell me whatshe has done ?"Mr. Dinsmore referred him to his wife for the com-mencement of the trouble, and she made out as bada case against Elsie as possible: but even then there<pb n="222"/>222             ELSIE DINSMORE.seemed to her father to be very little to condemn; andwhen Mrs. Dinsmore was obliged to acknowledge thatit was Elsie's refusal to humor Enna in her desire fora particular story which Elsie thought it i ot best torelate on the Sabbath, he bit his lip with vexation,and told her in a haughty tone, that though he didnot approve of Elsie's strict notions regarding suchmatters, yet he wished her to understand that hisdaughter was not to be made a slave to Enna's whims.If she chose to tell her a story, or to do anything elsefor her amusement, he had no objection, but she wasnever to beforced to do it against her inclinations,and Enna must understand that it was done as a favor,and not at all as her right."You are right enough there, Horace," remarkedhis father, " but that does not excuse Elsie for herimpertinence to me. In the first place, I must say Iagree with my wife in thinking it quite a piece ofimpertinence for a child of her years to set up helopinion against mine; and besides, she contradictedme flatly."He then went on to repeat what he had said, andElsie's denial of the charge, using her exact words,but quite a different tone, and suppressing the factthat he had interrupted her before she had finishedher sentence.Elsie's tone, though slightly indignant, had stil.been respectful, but from her grandfather's rehearsalof the scene her father received the impression thatshe had been exceedingly saucy, and he left the room<pb n="223"/>a          BELSIE DINSMORE.            223with the intention of giving her almost as severe apunishment as her grandfather would have prescribed.On the way up to his room, however, his anger hada little time to cool, and it occurred to him that itwould be no more than just to hear her side of thestory ere he condemned her.Elsie was seated on a couch at the far side of theroom, and as he entered she turned on him a tearful,pleading look, that went straight to his heart.His face was grave and sad, but there was verylittle sternness in it, as he sat down and took her inhis arms.For a moment he held her without speaking, whileshe lifted her eyes timidly to his face. Then he said,as he gently stroked the hair back from her fore-head, " I am very sorry, very sorry indeed, to hearso bad an account of my little daughter. I am afraidI shall have to punish her, and I don't like to do it."She answered not a word, but burst into tears, andhiding her face on his breast, sobbed aloud." I will not condemn you unheard, Elsie," he saidafter a moment's pause; "tell me how you came tobe so impertinent to your grandfather."" I did not mean to be saucy, papa, indeed I didnot," she sobbed." Stop crying then, daughter," lie said kindly, "andtell me all about it. I know there was some troublebetween you and Enna, and I want you to tell me allthat occurred, and every word spoken by either ofyou, as well as all that passed between Mrs. Dinsmor%<pb n="224"/>?.4            ELSIE DINSbMORE.your grandfather, and yourself I am very glad thatI can trust my little girl to speak the truth. I amquite sure she would not tell a falsehood even to saveherself from punishment," he added tenderly."Thank you, dear papa, for saying that," saidElsie, raising her head and almost smiling throughher tears. " I will try to tell it just as it happened."She then told her story simply and truthfully, re-peating, as he bade her, every word that had passedbetween Enna and herself, and between her and hergrandparents. Herwords to her grandfather soundedvery different, repeated in her quiet, respectful tones;and when she added that if he would have allowedher, she was going on to explain that it was not anyunwillingness to oblige Enna, but the fear of doingwrong, that led her to refuse her request, her fatherthought that after all she deserved very little blame."Do you think I was very saucy, papa l" sheasked anxiously, when she had finished her story."So much depends upon the tone, Elsie," he said,"that I can hardly tell: if you used the same tonein speaking to your grandpa that you did in repeating your words to me just now, I don't think it wavery impertinent; though the words themselves werenot as respectful as they ought to have been. Youmust always treat my father quite as respectfully a;you do me; and I think with him, too, that there issomething quite impertinent in a little girl like yousetting up her opinion against that of her elders.You mvut ever try it with me, my daughter."<pb n="225"/>ELSIE DIESrORE.            225Elsie hung down her head in silence for a moment,then asked in a tremulous tone, " Are you going to,unish me, papa "" Yes," he said, but first I am going to take youdown-stairs and make you beg your grandfather'spardon. I see you don't want to do it," he added,looking keenly into her face, "but you must, and Ihope I shall not be obliged to enforce obedience tomy commands.""I will do whatever you bid me, papa," she sob-bed, " but I did not mean to be saucy. Please, papa,tell me what to say."" You must say, Grandpa, I did not intend to beimpertinent to you, and I am very sorry for whatevermay have seemed saucy in my words or tones: willyou please to forgive me, and I will try always to beperfectly respectful in future. You can say all thatwith truth, I think ? "" Yes, papa, I am sorry, and I do intend to be re-spectful to grandpa always," she answered, brushingaway her tears, and putting her hand in his.He then led her into her grandfather's presence,laying, " Elsie has come to beg your pardon, sir."" That is as it should be," replied the old gentle-man, glancing triumphantly at his wife; " I told heryou would not uphold her in any such impertinence."" No," said his son, with some displeasure in histone; " I will neither uphold her in wrong doing, norsuffer her to be imposed upon. Speak, my daughter,and say what I bade yon."<pb n="226"/>i26            ELSIE DINSMORE.Elsie sobbed out the required words." Yes, I must forgive you, of course," replied heigrandfather, coldly, "but I hope your father is notgoing to let you off without proper punishment."" I will attend to that; I certainly intend to punishher as she deserves," said his son, laying a markedemphasis upon the concluding words of his sentence.Elsie wholly misunderstood him, and so trembledwith fear as he led her from the room, that she couldscarcely walk; seeing which, he took her in his armsand carried her up-stairs, she sobbing on his shoulder.He did not speak until he had locked the door,carried her across the room, and seated himself uponthe couch again, with her upon his knee.Then he said, in a soothing tone, as he wiped away.her tears and kissed her kindly," You need not trem-ble so, my daughter; I am not going to be severewith you."She looked up in glad surprise."I said I would punish you as you deserve," hesaid, with a smile, " and I intend to keep you shut uphere with me until bed-time. I shall not allow youto go down-stairs to tea, and besides, I am going togive you a long lesson to learn, which I shall requireyou to recite to me quite perfectly before you can goto bed."Elsie grew frightened again at the mention of thelesson, for she feared it might be something whichshe could not conscientiously study on the Sabbath;out all her fear and trouble vanished as she saw her<pb n="227"/>ELSIE DrNSMORE.             227father take up a Bible that lay on the table, and turnover the leaves as though selecting a passage.Presently he nut it into her hands, and pointingto the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of John'sGospel, bade her carry the book to a low seat by thewindow, and sit there until she had learned themperfectly." 0 papa! what a nice lesson !" she exclaimed, looking up delightedly into his face; "but it won't beany punishment, because I love these chapters dearly,and have read them so often that I almost knotievery word already.""Hush, hush!" he said, pretending to be verystern; "don't tell me that my punishments are nopunishment, I don't allow you to talk so; just takethe book and learn what I bid you; and if you knowthose two already, you may learn the next."Elsie laughed, kissed his hand, and tripped away'o her window, while he threw himself down on thecouch and took up a newspaper, more as a screen tohis face, however, than for the purpose of reading;for he lay there closely watching his little daughter,as she sat in the rich glow of the sunset, withher sweet, grave little face bending over the holybook." The darling !" he murmured to himself; " she islovely as an angel, and she is mine, mine only, mineown precious one; and loves me with her whole soul,Ah ! how can I ever find it in my heart to be sternto her 8 Ah ! if I were but half as good and pure asI<pb n="228"/>228            ELSIE DINSSMORE.she is, I should be a better man than I am." Andhe heaved a deep sigh.Half an hour had passed, and still Elsie bent overher book. The tea-bell rang, and Mr. Dinsmorestarted up, and crossing the room, bent down andstroked her hair."Do you know it, darling ?" he asked."Almost, papa," and she looked up into his facewith a bright, sweet smile, full of affection.With a sudden impulse he caught her in his arms,and kissing her again and again, said with emotion,"Elsie, my darling, I love you too well; I couldnever bear to lose you.""You must love Jesus better, my own preciouspapa," she replied, clasping her little arms around hisneck, and returning his caresses.He held her a moment, and then putting herdown, said, " I shall send you up some supper, and Iwant you to eat it; don't behave as you did aboutthe bread and water once, a good while ago."" Will it be bread and water this time, papa " sheasked, with a smile."You will see," he said laughingly, and quittedthe room.Elsie turned to her book again, but in a few mo-ments was interrupted by the entrance of a servanttarrying on a silver waiter a plate of hot, butteredmuffins, a cup of jelly, another of hot coffee, and apiece of broiled chicken. Elsie was all astonishment" Why, Pomp," she asked, "did papa stlnd it 7"<pb n="229"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             229"Yes. Miss Elsie, 'deed he did," replied the ser-vant, with a grin of satisfaction, as he set down hisburden. " I reckon you been berry nice gal dis dayor else Marster Horace tink you little bit sick.""Papa is very good; and I am much obliged toyou too, Pomp," said the little girl, laying aside herbook, and seating herself before the waiter."Jes ring de bell, Miss Elsie, ef you want more;and dis chile fetch 'em up; Marster Horace say sohisself." And the grinning negro bowed himselfout, chuckling with delight, for Elsie had always beena great favorite with him."Dear papa," Elsie said, when he came in againand smilingly asked if she had eaten her prison fare,"what a good supper you sent me! But I thoughtyou didn't allow me such things ""Don't you know," said he playfully, laying hishand upon her head, " that I am absolute monarchof this small kingdom, and you are not to questionmy doings or decrees "Then in a more serious tone, " No daughter, I donot allow it as a regular thing, because I do not thinlit for your good; but for once, I thought it wouldnot hurt you. I know you are not one to presumeupon favors, and I wanted to indulge you a little,because I fear my little girl has been made to sufferperhaps more than she quite deserved this afternoon."His voice had a very tender tone as he uttered theconcluding words, and stooping, he pressed his lipsto her forehead.2<pb n="230"/>230            ELSIE DnI'SaORE."Don't think, though," he added the next mo-.ment, "that I am excusing you for impertinencenot at all; but it was what you have had to sufferfrom Enna's insolence. I shall put a stop to that,or I will not have it."" I don't mind it much, papa," said Elsie gently"I am quite used to it, for Enna has always treatedme so.""And why did I never hear of it before?" heasked, half angrily. "It is abominable! not to beendured!" he exclaimed, "and I shall see that MIissEnna is made to understand that my daughter isfully her equal in every respect, and always to betreated as such."He paused; but Elsie, half frightened at his ve-hemence, made no reply, and he went on: "I haveno doubt your grandfather and his wife would havebeen better pleased had I forced you to yield toEnna's whim; but I had no idea of such a thing;you shall use your own pleasure whenever she is concerned; but if I had bidden you tell her that storyit would have been a very different matter; you neednever set up your will, or your opinion of right andwrong, against mine, Elsie, for I shall not allow it.I don't altogether like some of those strict notionsyou have got into your head, and I give you fairwarning, that should they ever come into collisionwith my wishes and commands, they will have to begiven up. But don't look so alarmed, daughter; Ihope it may never happen; and we will say no more<pb n="231"/>ELSIE DZlySMORE.            231about it to-night," he added, kindly, for she hadgrown very pale and trembled visibly." 0 papa, dear papa! don't ever bid me do anythingwrong; it would break my heart," she said, layingher head on his shoulder as he sat down and drewher to his side." I never mtend to bid you do wrong, but, on thecontrary, wish you always to do right. But the,daughter, I must be the judge of what is wrongor right for you; you must remember that youare only a very little girl, and not yet capable ofjudging for yourself, and all you have to do is taobey your father without murmuring or hesitationand then there will be no trouble."His tone, though mild, and not unkind, was veryfirm and decided, and Elsie's heart sank; she seemedto feel herself in the shadow of some great troublelaid up in store for her in the future. But she strove,and ere long with success, to banish the forebodingof evil which oppressed her, and give herself up tothe enjoyment of present blessings. Her father lovedher dearly-she knew that-and he was not now re-quiring her to do aught against her conscience, andperhaps he never might; he had said so himself, andGod could incline his heart to respect her scruples;or if, in His infinite wisdom, He saw that the dreadedtrial was needed, He would give her strength to bealit; for had He not promised, " As thy day, so shallthy strength be" ?Her father's arm was around her, and sLe had been<pb n="232"/>e32           ELSIE .DINSMOR:standing silently, with her face hidden on his shoulder, while these thoughts were passing through hermind, and the little heart going up in prayer to Godfor him and for herself."What is my little girl thinking of?" he askedpresently."A good many things, papa," she said, raising herface, now quite peaceful and happy again. "I wasthinking of what you had just been saying to me,and that I am so glad I know that you love me dearly;and I was asking God to help us both to do His will,and that I might always be able to do what you bidme, without disobeying Him," she added simply; andthen asked, " May I say my lesson now, papa? I thinkI know it quite perfectly."" Yes," he said in an absent way; " bring me thebook."Elsie brought it, and putting it into his hands,drew up a stool and sat down at his feet, resting heiarm on his knee, and looking up into his face; thenin her sweet, low voice, she repeated slowly and feel-ingly, with true and beautiful emphasis, the chaptershe had given her to learn: that most touchingdescription of the Last Supper, and our Saviour's fare-well address to his sorrowing disciples." Ah! papa, is it not beautiful ?" she exclaimed,haying her head upon his knee, while the tears tremirfed in her eyes. " Is not that a sweet verse, ' Having.eved his own which were in the world, He lovedthem unto the end' ? It seemsa o strange that He could<pb n="233"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.            233be so thoughtful for them, so kind and loving, whenall the time He knew what a dreadful death He wasjust going to die; and knew besides that they wereall going to run away and leave Him alone with hiscruel enemies. Oh ! it is so sweet to know that Jesusis so loving, and that He loves me, and will always loveme, even to the end, forever."" How do you know that, Elsie ?" he asked."I know that He loves me, papa, because I loveHim, and He has said, ' I love them that love me;'and I know that He will love me always, because Hehas said, ' I have loved thee with an everlasting love,'and in another place, 'I will never leave thee, nor for-sake thee.'""But do you think you are good enough, daugh-ter, for Jesus to love you ""Ah! papa, I know I am not at all good. I havea very wicked heart, and often my thoughts and feel-ings are all wrong, and Jesus knows all about it, butit does not keep Him from loving me, for you knowit was sinners He died to save. Ah  papa, how goodand kind He was ! Who could help loving Him ? Iused to feel so lonely and sad sometimes, papa, thatIthink my heart would have broken quite, and Ishould have died, if I had not had Jesus to love me.""When were you so sad and lonely, darling ?" heasked in a moved tone, as he laid his hand gently onher head, and stroked her hair caressingly."Sometimes when you were away, papa, and I hadnever seen you; but then I used to think of you, and<pb n="234"/>234            ELSIE DINSMORE.my heart would long and ache so to see you, and heaiyou call me daughter, and to lay my head againstyour breast and feel your arms folding me close toyour breast, as you do so often now."She paused a moment, and struggled hard to keepdown the rising sobs, as she added, "But when youcame, papa, and I saw you did not love me, oh ! papa,that was the worst. I thought I could never, neverbear it. I thought my heart would break, and Iwanted to die and go to Jesus, and to mamma."The little frame shook with sobs."My poor darling! my poor little pet," he said,taking her in his arms again, and caressing her withthe greatest tenderness, " it was very hard, very cruel.I don't know how I could steel my heart so againstmy own little child; but I had been very much prej-udiced, and led to suppose that you looked upon mewith fear and dislike, as a hated tyrant."Elsie lifted her eyes to his face with a look ofextreme surprise." 0 papa !" she exclaimed, " how could you thinkthat? I have always loved you, ever since I canremember."When Elsie went to her room that evening shethought very seriously of all that had occurred dur-ing the afternoon, and all that her papa had said toher; and to her usual petitions was added a very fenvent one that he might never bid her break any com-mand of God; or if he did, that she might havestrength given her according to her day.<pb n="235"/>ELSIE DvISMORE.             235A shadow had fallen on her pathway, faint, butperceptible; a light, fleecy cloud obscured the bright.ness of her sun; yet it was not for some weeks thateven the most distant mutterings of the coming stormcould be heard.:     : t~1<pb n="236"/>lanpter    /cnti(." If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleas.ore on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a Delight, the Holy of theLord, Honorable, and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor find.ing thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words."-Isaiah lviii. 18."Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you, morethan unto God, judge ye."-Aets iv. 19.QUITE a number of guests had dined at Roselands.They were nearly all gentlemen, and were now col-lected in the drawing-room, laughing, jesting, talkingpolitics, and conversing with each other and the la-dies upon various worldly topics, apparently quiteforgetful that it was the Lord's day, which He hascommanded to be kept holy in thought and word, aswell as deed."May I ask what you are in search of, Mr. Ever-sham ? " inquired Adelaide, as she noticed one of theguests glance around the room with a rather disap-pointed air."Yes, Miss Adelaide; I was looking for little MissElsie. Travilla has given me so very glowing an ac-count of her precocious musical talent, that I haveconceived a great desire to hear her play and sing.""Do you hear that, Horace        " asked Adelaide,turning to her brother.<pb n="237"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             23,"Yes, and I shall be most happy to gratify you,Eversham," replied the young father, with a proudsmile.He crossed the room to summon a servant, but ashe placed his hand upon the bell-ropo, Mrs. Dinsmorearrested his movement."Stay, Horace," she said; "you had better notsend for her."" May I be permitted to ask why, madam ?" he in-quired in a tone of mingled surprise and annoyance."Because she will not sing," answered the lady,co olly." Pardon me, madam, but I think she will, if Ibidher do it," he said with flashing eyes."No, she will not," persisted Mrs. Dinsmore, inthe same cold, quiet tone; "she will tell you she iswiser than her father, and that it would be a sin toobey him in this. Believe me, she will most assuredlyAefy your authority; so you had better take my ad-tice and let her alone-thus sparing yourself the mor-tification of exhibiting before your guests your ina.bility to govern your child."Mr. Dinsmore bit his lip with vexation." Thank you," he said, haughtily, "but I preferconvincing you that that inability lies wholly in yourown imagination; and I am quite at a loss to under-stand upon what you found your opinion, as E!sie hasnever yet made the very slightest resistance to myauthority."He had given the bell-rope a vigorous pull while* 2<pb n="238"/>238            ELSIE DINSM ORE.speaking, and a servant now appearing m answer tothe summons, he sent him with a message to Elsie,requiring her presence in the drawing-room.Then turning away from   his step-mother, wholooked after him with a gleam of triumph in her eye,he joined the group of gentlemen already gatheredabout the piano, where Adelaide had just taken her6eat and begun a brilliant overture.Yet, outwardly calm and self-satisfied as his de-meanor may have been, Horace Dinsmore was evennow regretting the step he had just taken; for remem-bering Elsie's conscientious scruples regarding theobservance of the Sabbath-which he had for themoment forgotten-he foresaw that there would be astruggle, probably a severe one; and though, havingalways found her docile and yielding, he felt no doubtof the final result, he would willingly have avoidedthe contest, could he have done so without a sacrificebf pride; but, as he said to himself, with a slightsigh, he had now gone too far to retreat; and thenhe hac all along felt that this struggle must come sometime, and perhaps it was as well now as at any other.Elsie was alone in her own room, spending the Sab-bath afternoon in her usual manner, when the servantcame to say that her papa wished to see her in thedrawing-room. The little girl was a good deal alarme4at the summons, for the thought instantly flashed upoiher, " He is going to bid me play and sing, or do something else which it is not right to do on the Sabbatlday."<pb n="239"/>ELSIE DINSBTORE             239But remembering that he never had done so, shehoped he might not now: yet ere she obeyed thecall she knelt down for a moment, and prayed ear-nestly for strength to do right, however difficult itmight be."Come here, daughter," her father said as sheentered the room. He spoke in his usual pleasant,affectionate tone, yet Elsie started, trembled, andturned pale; for catching sight of the group at thepiaro, and her Aunt Adelaide just vacating the music-stool, she at once perceived what was in store for her."Here, Elsie," said her father, selecting a songwhich she had learned daring their absence, and sangremarkably well, "I wish you to sing this for myfriends; they are anxious to hear it.""Will not to-morrow do, papa " she asked, in alow, tremulous tone.Mrs. Dinsmore, who had drawn near to listen, nowlooked at Horace with a meaning smile, which heaffected not to see." Certainly not, Elsie," he said; " we want it now.You know it quite well enough without any morepractice."" I did not want to wait for that reason, papa," shereplied in the same low, 'rembling tones, "but youknow this is tLh holy Sabbath day.""Well, my daughter, and what of that? I con-sider this song perfectly proper to be sung to-day,and that ought to satisfy you that you will not bedomg wrong to sing it: remember what I said to<pb n="240"/>240            ELSIE DSINMORE.you some weeks ago; and now sit down and sing itat once, without any more ado."" 0 papa ! I cannot sing it to-day; please let mewait until to-morrow." *"Elsie," he said in his sternest tones, " sit downto the piano instantly, and do as I bid you, and letme have no more of this nonsense."She sat down, but raising her pleading eyes, brimfulof tears to his face, she repeated her refusal. "Dearpapa, I cannot sing it to-day. I cannot break theSabbath.""Elsie, you must sing it," said he, placing themusic before her. " I have told you that it will notbe breaking the Sabbath, and that is sufficient; youmust let me judge for you in these matters."" Let her wait until to-morrow, Dinsmore; to-morrow will suit us quite as well," urged severalof the gentlemen, while Adelaide good-naturedlysaid, "Let me play it, Horace; I have no suchscruples, and presume I can do it nearly as well asElsie."" No," he replied, " when I give my child a com-mand, it is to be obeyed; I have said she shouldplay it, and play it she must; she is not to supposethat she may set up her opinion of right and wrongagainst mine."Elsie sat with her little hands folded in her lap,the tears streaming from her downcast eyes over herpale cheeks. She was trembling, but though therewas no stubbornness in her countenance, the expression<pb n="241"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             241meek and humble, she made no movement towardobeying her father's order.There was a moment of silent waiting: then hesaid in his severest tone, " Elsie, you shall sit theretill you obey me, though it should be until to-morrowmorning.""Yes, papa," she replied in a scarcely audiblevoice, and they all turned away and left her."You see now that you had better have taken myadvice, Horace," remarked Mrs. Dinsmore, in atriumphant aside; "I knew very well how it wouldend."" Excuse me," said he, " but it has not ended; andere it does, I think she will learn that she has astronger will than her own to deal with."Elsie's position was a most uncomfortable one; herseat high and uneasy, and seeming to grow more andmore so as the weary moments passed slowly away.No one came near her or seemed to notice her, yetshe could hear them conversing in other parts of theroom, and knew that they were sometimes looking ather, and, timid and bashful as she was, it seemed hardto bear. Then, too, her little heart was very sad asshe thought of her father's displeasure, and fearedthat he would withdraw from her the affection whichhad been for the last few months the very sunshineof her hfe. Besides-all this, the excitement of herfeelings, and the close and sultry air-for it was avery warm day-had brought on a nervous headache.She leaned forward and rested her head against the<pb n="242"/>t42           ELSIE DINSBORE.instrument, feeling in momentary danger of fallingfrom her seat.Thus two long hours had passed when Mr. Tra-villa came to her side, and said in a compassionatetone, "I am  really very sorry for you, my littlefriend; but I advise you to submit to your papa. Isee you are getting very weary sitting there, and Iwarn you not to hope to conquer him. I have knownhim for years, and a more determined person I neversaw. Had you not better sing the song  it will nottake five minutes, and then your trouble will be allover."Elsie raised her head, and answered gently, "Thankyou for your sympathy, Mr. Travilla, you are verykind; but I could not do it, because Jesus says, 'Hethat loveth father or mother more than me, is notworthy of me;' and I cannot disobey Him, even tovlease my own dear papa."" But, Miss Elsie, why do you think it would beiisobeying Him? Is there any verse in the Biblewhich says you must not sing songs on Sunday ? ""Mr. Travilla, it says the Sabbath is to be keptholy unto the Lord; that we are not to think ourown thoughts, nor speak our own words, nor do ourown actions; but all the day must be spent in study-ing God's word, or worshipping and praising Him:and there is no praise in that song; not one wordabout God or heaven."" That is very true, Elsie, but still it is such a verylittle thing, that I cannot think there would be much<pb n="243"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             243harm in it, or that God would be very angry withyou for doing it."' 0 Mr. Travilla !" she said, looking up at him ingreat surprise, "surely you know that there is nosuch thing as a little sin; and don't you rememberabout the man who picked up sticks on the Sabbathday . ""No; what was it?""God commanded that he should be stoned todeath, and it was don,%  Would you not have thoughtthat a very little thing, Mr. Travilla ?""Yes, I believe I should," said he, turning awaywith a very grave face."Dinsmore," he said, going up to his friend, "Iam sure that child is conscientious; had you not bet-ter give up to her in this instance "" Never, Travilla," he answered, with stern deci-sion. " This is the first time she has rebelled againstmy authority, and if I let her conquer now, she willthink she is always to have her own way. No; costwhat it may, I must subdue her; she will have tqlearn that my will is law."' Right, Horace," said the elder Mr. Dinsmore,approvingly, "let her understand from  the firstthat you are to be master; it is always the bestplan.""Excuse me, Dinsmore," said Travilla; "but Imust say that I think a parent has no right to coercea child into doing violence to its conscience.""Nonsense l" replied his friend, a little angrily;<pb n="244"/>244            ELSIE DINSrMOR."Elsie is entirely too young to set up her opinionagainst mine; she must allow me to judge for her inthese matters for some years to come."Eversham, who had been casting uneasy glances atElsie all the afternoon, now drawing his chair near toAdelaide, said to her in an undertone, "Miss Ade-laide, I am deeply sorry for the mischief I have anwit.tingly caused, and if you can tell me how to repair ityou will lay me under lasting obligations."Adelaide shook her head. "There is no movingHorace when he has once set his foot down," shesaid; "and as to Elsie, I doubt whether any poweron earth can make her do what she considers wrong.""Poor little thing!" said  Eversham, sighing;"where in the world did she get such odd notions ""Partly from a pious Scotch woman, who had agood deal to do with her in her infancy, and partlyfrom studying the Bible, I believe. She is alwaysat it.""Indeed !" and he relapsed into thoughtful silence.Another hour passed slowly away, and then thetea-bell rang." Elsie," asked her father, coming to her side, " areyou ready to obey me now? if so, we will wait amoment to hear the song, and then you can go toyour tea with us.""Dear papa, I cannot break the Sabbath," shereplied, in a low, gentle tone, without lifting herhead."Very well then, I cannot break my word; you<pb n="245"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             245must sit there until you will submit; and until thenyou must fast. You are not only making yourself mis-erable by your disobedience and obstinacy, Elsie, butare mortifying and grieving me very much," he addedin a subdued tone, that sent a sharp pang to the lov-ing little heart, and caused some very bitter tears tifall, as he turned away and left her.The evening passed wearily away to the little girl,the drawing-room was but dimly lighted, for the com-pany had all deserted it to wander about the groundsor sit in the portico enjoying the moonlight and thtpleasant evening breeze, and the air indoors seemedinsupportably close and sultry. At times Elsie couldscarcely breathe, and she longed intensely to get outinto the open air; every moment her seat grew moreuncomfortable and the pain in her head more severe:her thoughts began to wander, she forgot where shewas, everything became confused, and at length shelost all consciousness.Several gentlemen, among whom were Mr. HoraceDinsmore and Mr. Travilla, were conversing togetheron the portico, when they were suddenly startled bya sound as of something falling.Travilla, who was nearest the door, rushed into thedrawing-room, followed by the others."A light! quick, quick, a light!" he cried, raia-tng Elsie's insensible form in his arms; " the child hasfainted."One of the others, instantly snatching a lamp froma distant table, brought it near, and the increased<pb n="246"/>246            ELSIE DINSBSORMlight showea Elsie's little face, ghastly as that of acorpse, while a stream of blood was flowing from awound in the temple, made by striking against somesharp corner of the furniture as she fell.She was a pitiable sight indeed, with bhr fair face,her curls, and her white dress all dabbled in blood." Dinsmore, you're a brute !" exclaimed Travilleindignantly, as he placed her gently on a sofa.Horace made no reply, but, with a face almost a,pale as her own, bent over his little daughter inspeechless alarm, while one of the guests, who happened to be a physician, hastily dressed the wound,and then applied restoratives.It was some time ere consciousness returned, andthe father trembled with the agonizing fear that thegentle spirit had taken its flight.But at length the soft eyes unclosed, and gazingwith a troubled look into his face, bent so anxiously overher, she asked, " Dear papa, are you angry with me X""No, darling," he replied in tones made tremulouswith emotion, " not at all."" What was it ?" she asked in a bewildered way;"what did I do ? what has happened ? "" Never mind, daughter," he said, " you have beenill; but you are better now, so don't think any moreabout it."" She had better be put to bed at once," said thephysician." There is blood on my dress," cried Elsie, in astartled tone; " where did it come from ?"<pb n="247"/>ELSIE DINSMOBE.              247"You fell and hurt your head," replied her father,raising her gently in his arms; " but don't talk anymore now."" Oh ! I remember," she moaned, an expression ofkeen distress coming over her face; " papa-"" Hush! hush! not a word more; we will letthe past go," he said, kissing her lips. "I shallcarry you to your room now, and see you put tobed."He held her on his knee, her head resting on hisshoulder, while Chloe prepared her for rest."Are you hungry, daughter a " he asked."No, papa; I only want to go to sleep.""There, Aunt Chloe, that will do," he said, as theold nurse tied on the child's night-cap; and raisingher again in his arms, he carried her to the bed andwas about to place her on it."0 papa! my prayers first, you know," she criedeagerly."Never mind them to-night," said he, "you arenot able.""Please let me, dear papa," she pleaded; "I cannot go to sleep without."Yielding to her entreaties, he placed her on herknees, and stood beside her, listening to her murmured petitions, in which he more than once heardhis own name coupled with a request that he mightbe made to love Jesus.When she had finished, he again raised her in hisrms, kissed her tenderly several times, and then laid<pb n="248"/>248            ELSIE DINSMORE.er carefully on the bed, saying, as he did so, "Wb Id you ask, Elsie, that I might love Jesus ""Because, papa, I do so want you to love Himit would make you so happy; and besides, you can-not go to heaven without; the Bible says so.""Does it and what makes you think I don't loveHim ?""Dear papa, please don't be angry," she pleaded,tearfully, "but you know Jesus says, ' He thatkeepeth my commandments, he it is that loveth me.' "He stooped over her. "Good night, daughter," hesaid."Dear, dear papa," she cried, throwing her armround his neck, and drawing down his face close tohers, "I do love you so very, very much !"" Better than anybody else ?" he asked." No, papa, I love Jesus best; you next."He kissed her again, and with a half sigh turnedIway and left the room. He was not entirely pleased;not quite willing that she should love even her Sa.viour better than himself.Elsie was very weary, and was soon adleep. Shewaked the next morning feeling nearly as well asusual, and after she had had her bath and been dressedby Chloe's careful hands, the curls being arranged toconceal the plaster that covered the wound on hertemple, there was nothing in her appearance, excepta slight paleness, to remind her friends of the lastnight's accident.She was sitting reading her morning chapter<pb n="249"/>ELSIE DoINSfORE.            249when her father came in, and taking a seat by herside, lifted her to his knee, saying, as he caressedher tenderly, "My little daughter is looking prettywell this morning; how does she feel ?"" Quite well, thank you, papa," she replied, lookingup into his face with a sweet, loving smile.He raised the curls to look at the wounded temple;then, as he dropped them again, he said, with a shud-der, " Elsie, do you know that you were very nearbeing killed last night? ""No, papa, was I ?" she asked with an awe-struckcountenance." Yes, the doctor says if that wound had been madohalf an inch nearer your eye-4 should have beenchildless."His voice trembled almost too much for utteranceas he finished his sentence, and he strained her tohis heart with a deep sigh of thankfulness for her-scape.Elsie was very quiet for some moments, and thelittle face was almost sad in its deep thoughtfulness."What are you thinking of, darling ?" he asked.She raised her eyes to his face, and he saw thatthey were brimful of tears."0 papa !" she said, dropping her head on hisbreast while the bright drops fell like rain down hercheeks, " would you have been so very sorry ?""Sorry, darling! do you not know that you aremore precious to me than all my wealth, all myfriends and relatives put together? Yes, I would<pb n="250"/>250            ELSIE DINSMORS.rather part with everything else than lose this onelittle girl," he said, kissing her again and again."Dear, dear papa! how glad I am that you loveme so much " she replied; and then relapsed intosilence.He watched her changing countenance for sometime, then asked, " What is it, darling ?""I was just thinking," she said, "whether I wasready to go to heaven, and I believe I was; for Iknow that I love Jesus; and then I was thinking howglad mamma would have been to see me; don't youthink she would, papa ?""I can't spare you to her yet," he replied withemotion, " and I think she loves me too well to wishit."As Miss Day had not yet returned, Elsie's time wasstill pretty much at her own disposal, excepting whenher papa gave her something to do; so, after break-fast, finding that he was engaged with some one inthe library, she took her Bible, and seeking out ashadyretreat in the garden, sat down to read.The Bible was ever the book of books to her, andthis morning the solemn, tender feelings naturallycaused by the discovery of her recent narrow escapefrom sudden death made it even more than usuallytouching and beautiful in her eyes. She had beenalone in the arbor for some time, when, hearing a stepat her side, she looked up, showing a face all wetwith tears.It was Mr. Travilla who stood beside her.<pb n="251"/>ELSIE. DINSMORE.            251"In tears, little Elsie! Pray, what may the bookbe that affects you so " he asked, sitting down byher side and taking it from her hand. "The Bible, Ideclare !" he exclaimed in surprise. " What can therebe in it that you find so affecting ?""0 Mr. Travilla! " said the little girl, " does it notmake your heart ache to read how the Jews abusedour dear, dear Saviour? and then to think that it wasall because of our sins," she sobbed.He looked half distressed, half puzzled; it seemeda new idea to him." Really, my little Elsie," he said, " you are quiteoriginal in your ideas. I suppose I ought to feel un-happy about these things, but indeed the truth is, Ihave never thought much about them."" Then you don't love Jesus," she answered, mourn-fully. "Ah ! Mr. Travilla, how sorry I am."" Why, Elsie, what difference can it make to youwhether I love Him or not "" Because, Mr. Travilla, the Bible says, ' If any manlove not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema,maranatha,' accursed from God. Oh ! sir, think howdreadful I You cannot be saved unless you love Jesus,and believe on Him. 'Believe on the Lord JesusChrist, and thou shalt be saved.' That is what Godsays in His word."She spoke with deep solemnity, and the tears trem-bling in her eyes. He was touched, but for a whilesat perfectly silent.Then he said, with an effort to speak lightly, " Ah I<pb n="252"/>3252           ELSSI DINSgORE.well, my little friend, I certainly intend to repent andbelieve before I die, but there is time enough yet.""Mr. Travilla," she said, laying her hand on hisarm and looking earnestly into his face, " how do youknow that there is time enough yet ? don't put it off,[ beg of you."She paused a moment; then asked, " Do you know,Mr. Travilla, how near I came to being killed lastnight "He nodded."Well, suppose I had been killed, and had notloved Jesus; where would I be now "He put his arm round her, and giving her a kiss,said, "I don't think you would have been in anyvery bad place, Elsie; a sweet, amiable little girl, whohas never harmed any one, would surely not fare verybadly in another world."She shook her head very gravely,"Ah ! Mr. Travilla, you forget the anathema, mar-anatha; if I had not loved Jesus, and had my sinswashed away in His blood, I could not have beensaved."Just at this moment a servant came to tell Elsiethat her papa wanted her in the drawing-room, andMr. Travilla, taking her hand, led her into the house.They found the company again grouped about thepiano, listening to Adelaide's music.Elsie went directly to her father and stood by hisside, putting her hand in hs with a gesture of con-fiding affection.<pb n="253"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              253He smiled down at her, and kept fast hold of ituntil his sister had risen from the instrument, whenputting Elsie in her place, he said, " Now, my daughter,let us have that song."" Yes, papa," she replied, beginning the preludeat once, " I will do my very best."And so she did. The song was both well playedand well sung, and her father looked proud and happyas the gentlemen expressed their pleasure and askedfor another and another.Thus the clouds which had so suddenly obscuredlittle Elsie's sky, seemed to have vanished as speedilyas they had arisen.Her father again treated her with all his wontedaffection, and there even seemed to be a depth oftenderness in his love which it had not known be-fore, for he could not forget how nearly he had losther.<pb n="254"/>ahipter    1Ilcr  ntt." In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, Crather, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things fromthe wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; even so,Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."-L-lkex. 21.SAYS the Apostle Paul, "I say the truth in Christ,. lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness inthe Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and con-tinual sorrow in my heart, for I could wish thatmyself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren,my kinsmen according to the flesh.   . .   . Breth-ren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israelis, that they might be saved."And such, dear reader, is, in greater or less degree,the feeling of every renewed heart; loving Jesus, itwould fain have others love Him too; it desires thesalvation of all; but for that of its own dear ones itloigs and labors and prays; it is like Jacob wrestlingwith the angel, when he said, " I will not let thee go,except thou bless me."And thus it was with Elsie. She knew now thather father was not a Christian; that he had no reallove for Jesus, none of the true fear of God beforehis eyes. She saw that if he permitted her to readto him from God's word, as he sometimes did, it was<pb n="255"/>ELSIE DINTSIORE.             255not that he felt any pleasure in listening, but only toplease her; she had no reason to suppose he everprayed, and though he went regularly to church, itwas because he considered it proper and respectableto do so, and not that he cared to worship God, or tolearn His will.This conviction, which had gradually dawned uponElsie, until now it amounted to certainty, caused hergreat grief; she shed many tears over it m secret, andvery many and very earnest were the prayers sheoffered up for her dear father's conversion.She was sitting on his knee one evening in thedrawing-room, while he and several other gentlemenwere conversing on the subject of religion. Theywere discussing the question whether or no a changeof heart were necessary to salvation.The general opinion seemed to be that it was not,and Elsie listened with pain while her father expressedhis decided conviction that all who led an honest,upright, moral life, and attended to the outwardobservances of religion, were quite safe."He could see no necessity for a change of heart;he did not believe in the doctrine of total depravity,not he; no indeed, he thought the world much betterthan many people would have us believe."Elsie fixed her eyes on his face with a very mourn-ful gaze while he was speaking, but he was busy withhis argument and did not notice her.But one of the guests was just expressing hisapproval of Mr. Dinsmore's sentiments, when catch-<pb n="256"/>256            ELSIE DINSMORE.ing sight of Elsie's face, he stopped, remarking," Yourlittle girl looks as if she had something to say onthe subject; what is it, my dear "Elsie blushed, hesitated, and looked at her father."Yes, speak, my daughter, if you have anythingto say," he said encouragingly.Elsie lifted her eyes timidly to the gentleman's faceas she replied, " I was just thinking, sir, of what ourSaviour said to Nicodemus: ' Verily, verily I sayunto thee, except a man be born again, he cannotsee the kingdom of God.' 'Marvel not that I saidunto thee, Ye must be born again.'"She repeated these words of inspiration with adeep, earnest solemnity that seemed to impress everyhearer.For a moment there was a deep hush in the room.Then the gentleman asked, "Well, my little lady,and what is meant by being born again . ""0 sir!" she replied, "surely you know that itmeans to have the image of God, lost in Adam's fall,restored to us; it means what David asked for when heprayed, ' Create in me a clean heart, 0 God, and re-vew a right spirit within me.'"" Where did you learn all this ?" he asked, lookingat her with mingled surprise and admiration."In the Bible, sir," she modestly replied."You seem to have read it to some purpose," saidhe; "and now since you consider that change sonecessary, can you tell me how it is to be broughtabout "<pb n="257"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              257"God's Holy Spirit, alone, can change a sinner'sheart, sir."" And how am I to secure His aid ? " he asked.Elsie answered with a text: "God is more willingto give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, thanparents are to give good gifts unto their children.'He paused a moment; then asked, "Have youobtained this new heart, Miss Elsie? ""I hope I have, sir," she replied, the sweet littleface all suffused with blushes, and the soft, downcasteyes filling with tears."Why do you think so . " he asked again. " Ithink there is a text that says you must be ablealways to give a reason for the hope that is in you,or something to that effect, is there not ? ""Yes, sir: ' Be ready always to give an answer toevery man that asketh you a reason of the hope thatis in you, with meekness and fear.'" Then raisingher eyes to his face with a touching mixture of deephumility and holy boldness, she continued, " Andthis, sir, is my answer: Jesus says, ' Him that comethunto me, I will in no wise cast out;' and I believeHim. I did go to Him, and He did not cast me out,but forgave my sins, and taught me to love Him anddesire to serve Him all my life."This conversation between the gentleman and thelittle girl had drawn the attention of all present; andnow Mrs. Dinsmore, who had more that once shownsigns of impatience, said, " Well, Elsie, I think youhtive now talked quite enough for a child of youn<pb n="258"/>258            ELSIE DINSMORE.age." Then, pulling out her watch, " It is high timefor little folks to be in bed."Elsie, blushing deeply, would have retired immedi-ately, but her father held her fast, saying, as he gavehis stepmother an angry glance, " You need not go,Elsie. unless you choose; I am quite capable ofjudging when it is time to send you to bed."" I would rather go, if you please, papa," whisper-ed Elsie, who had a great dread of Mrs. Dinsmore'sanger."Very well, then, you may do as you like," hereplied, giving her a good-night kiss. And with agraceful good-night to the company, the little girl leftthe room.Her questioner followed her with an admiringglance, then turning to her father, exclaimed warmly,"She is a remarkably intelligent child, Dinsmore!one that any father might be proud of. I was aston-ished at her answers."" Yes," remarked Travilla, "a text has been run-ning in my head ever since you commenced your con-versation; something about these things being hidfrom the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes.And," he added, "I am sure if ever I saw one whopossessed that new nature of which she spoke, it isshe herself. Has she any faults, Dinsmore?""Very few, I think; though she would tell you adifferent story," replied her father with a gratifiedsmile.The next morning Elsie was sitting reading her<pb n="259"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             259Bible, when she suddenly felt a hand laid on helhead, and her father's voice said, " Good morning,little daughter."" Ah  papa, is that you " she asked, raising herhead to give him a smile of joyful welcome. " I didnot know you were there."" Ah ? I have been watching you for several min-utes," he said; "always poring over the same book,El'ie; do you never tire of it?"" No, indeed, papa; it is always new, and I do loveit so; it is so very sweet. May I read a little tnyou ? " she added, coaxingly." Yes, I love to listen to anything read by my dar-ling," he said, sitting down and taking her on hisknee.She opened at the third chapter of John's Gospel,and read it through. At the sixteenth- verse, " ForGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begot-ten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should notperish, but have everlasting life," she paused, andasked, "Was not that a wonderful gift, papa? andwonderful love that prompted it?"" Yes," he said, absently, stroking her hair.She finished the chapter, and closing the book,laid her head on his breast, asking, "Dear papa, don'tyou believe the Bible "" Certainly, daughter; I am not an infidel," he rephed in a careless tone."Well, then, papa," she continued, half hesita.tingly, " does not this chapter teach very plainly thatK<pb n="260"/>260            ELSIE DINSHORE.we must love Jesus, and have new hearts, if we wantto go to heaven ""Yes," he said, "I dare say it does."Then taking the book from her, he laid it aside,and giving her a kiss, said, " I was much pleased wilhyour intelligent answers to Mr. Lee, last evening."Elsie sighed, and her eyes filled with tears. It wa&not.what she wanted."What an odd child you are !" he said, laughing."You really look as though I had been scolding, in-stead of praising you."She dropped her head on his breast, and burst intotears and sobs."Why, Elsie, my own darling, what ails you?"he asked in great surprise."0 papa!" she sobbed, "I want you to loveJesus."" Oh ! is that all ." he said.And setting her on her feet, he took her by thehand and led her out into the garden, where theymet Mr. Travilla and another gentleman, who imme-diately entered into conversation with Mr. Dinsmorewhile Elsie wandered about amongst the flowers andahrubs, gathering a nosegay for her Aunt Adelaide.<pb n="261"/>TaQpter    twelftli."She had waited for their coming,She had kiss'd them o'er and o'er-And they were so fondly treasuredFor the words of love they bore,Words that whispered in the silence, She had listened till his toneSeemed to linger in the echo'Darling, thou art all mine own 1"MRe.

"Judging from theexceeding gravity of your countenance, one mightimagine that the affairs of the nation had been com-mitted to your care."" 0 auntie ! can't you help me ? won't you ?" an-swered the little girl, looking up coaxingly into thebright, cheerful face bent over her." Help you in what ? reading with your book up-side down, eh " asked Adelaide, pointing with aquizzical look at the volume of fairy tales in her littleniece's lap." Oh !" cried Elsie, coloring and laughing in herturn, "I was not reading, and did not know that mybook was wrong side up.

Ithought of slippers, but he has a very handsome pair,and besides there would hardly be time to workthem, as I have so many lessons; a purse won't doeither, because I have given him one already, and Iwould like it to be something worth more than eitherslippers or purse. But you are so much wiser thanI, can't you help me think ? "" So this is what has kept you so quiet and demuresll day that I have scarcely once heard you laugh orsing; quite an unusual state of things of late," andAdelaide playfully pinched the round, rosy cheek." Ahem! let me put on my thinking cap," assum-ing an air of comic gravity. " Ah ! yes, I have it!your miniature, little one, of course; what could pleasehim better "" Oh ! yes," cried Elsie, clapping her hands, " thatwill do nicely; why didn't I think of it? Thankyou, auntie. But then," she added, her countenancefalling, "how can I get it taken without his knowl-edge ? you know the surprise is half the fun.""Never mind, my dear, I'll find a way to managethat," replied Adelaide, confidently; "so just runaway with you now, and see how much money youcan scrape together to spend on it.""It won't take long to count it," Elsie said with amerry laugh. "But here is papa just coming in at.the door; I hope he won't suspect what we havebeen talking about," and she bounded away to meethim and claim the kiss he never refused her now.<pb n="263"/>ELIS    DINSBORE.           263Once Adelaide would not have been surprisel atElsic's quietness. Patient and sweet tempered thelittle girl had always been, but more especially afterher father's return from Europe-very quiet andtimid, seeming to shrink from Jbservation, with a con-stant dread of incurring reproof or punishment; butthe last few happy months, during which her fatherhad continued to lavish upon her every proof of thetenderest affection, had wrought a great change inher; her manner had lost its timidity, she movedabout the house with a light and joyous step, and itwas no unusual thing to hear her merry, silvery laughring out, or her sweet voice carolling like some wildbird of the wood-the natural outgushings of herjoy and thankfulness; for the little heart that had solong been famishing for love, that had often grown soweary and sick in its hungering and thirsting for it,was now fully satisfied, and revelled in its new-foundhappiness." I have got it all arranged nicely, Elsie," Adelaidesaid, coming into the room with a very pleased faceas the little girl was preparing for bed that evening." Your papa is going away in a day or two to attend tosome business matters connected with your property,and will be absent at least two weeks; so, unless heshould take it into his head to carry you along, wecan easily manage about the picture."Elsie looked up with a countenance of blank dis-may." Why." said Adelaide, laughing, " I thought you'd<pb n="264"/>264           ELSIF DINSMORKbe delighted with my news, and instead of that, youlook as if I had read you your death-warrant.""0 Aunt Adelaide ! two whole weeks withoutseeing papa ! just think how long.""Pooh! nonsense, child! it will be gone beforeyou know it. But now tell me, how much moneyhave you ?""I have saved my allowance for two months; thatmakes tventy dollars, you know, auntie, and I havea little change besides; do you think it will beenough "" Hardly, I'm afraid; but I can lend you some, ifnecessary.""Thank you, auntie," Elsie answered gratefully,"you are very kind; but I couldn't take it, becausepapa has told me expressly that I must never borrowmoney, nor run into debt in any way.""Dear me!" exclaimed Adelaide, a little impa-tiently; " Horace certainly is the most absurdlystrict person I ever met with. But never mind, Ithink we can manage it somehow," she added, in alivelier tone, as she stooped to kiss her little niecegood-night.Elsie's gentle rap was heard very early at her papa'sdoor the next morning.He opened it immediately, and springing into hisarms, she asked, almost tearfully, "Are you goingaway, papa ""Yes, darling," he said, caressing her fondly. "Imust leave home for a few weeks; and though I at<pb n="265"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             265first thought of taking you with me, upon furtherconsideration I have decided that it will be better toleave you here; yet, if you desire it very much, mypet, I will take you along. Shall I?""You know I would always rather be with youthan anywhere else, papa," she answered, laying herhead on his shoulder; " but you know best, and I amquite willing to do whatever you say.""That is right, daughter; my little Elsie is agood, obedient child," he said, pressing her closer toiim."When are you going, papal" she askedt hervoice trembling a little."To-morrow, directly after dinner, daughter.""So soon," she sighed."The sooner I leave you the sooner I shall return,you know, darling,' he said, patting her cheek, andsmiling kindly on Ther." Yes, papa; but two weeks seems such a long, longtime."He smiled. "At your age I suppose it does, butwhen you are as old as I am, you will think it veryshort. But to make it pass more quickly, you mayIvrite me a little letter every day, and I will send youone just as often."" Oh ! thank you, papa; that will be so pleasant,"she answered, with a brightening countenance. "Ido so love to get letters, and I would rather have onefrom you than from anybody else.""Ah    then I think you ought to be willing to<pb n="266"/>266            ELSiE DINSMORE.spare me for two weeks. I have been thinking mylittle girl might perhaps be glad of a little extrapocket-money for buying Christmas gifts," he said,taking out his purse. "Would you "" Yes, papa; oh ! very much, indeed."He laughed at her eager tone, and putting a fifty-dollar note into her hand, asked, "Will that beenough? "Elsie's eyes opened wide with astonishment."I never before had half so much as this," sheexclaimed. " May I spend it all, papa ?"'" Provided you don't throw it away," he answeredgravely; "but don't forget that I require a strictaccount of all your expenditure.""Must I tell you every thing I buy ?" she asked,her countenance falling considerably."Yes, my child, you must; not until after Christ-mas, however, if you would rather not."" I will not mind it so much then," she answered,looking quite relieved; "but indeed, papa, it is agreat deal of trouble."" Ah my little girl must not be lazy," he said,shaking his head gravely.This was Elsie's first parting from her father sincethey had learned to know and love each other; andwhen the time came to say good-by, she clung tohim, and seemed so loath to let him go, that hequite reper.ted of his determination to leave her athome." 0 papa, papa! I cannot bear to have you go, and<pb n="267"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              267leave me behind," she sobbed. "I feel as if youwere never coming back.""Why, my own darling," he said, kissing heragain and again, " why do you talk so I I shall certainly be at home again in a fortnight; but if I haathought you would feel so badly, I would havemade arrangements to take you with me. It is toolate now, however, and you must let me go, dearest.Be a good girl while I am gone, and when I return Iwill bring you some handsome presents."So saying, he embraced her once more, then put-ting her gently from him, sprang into the carriageand was driven rapidly away.Elsie stood watching until it was out of sight, andthen ran away to her own room to put her arms roundher nurse's neck and hide her tears on her boscht." Dere, dere darlin'! dat will do now. Massa Hor-ace he be back 'fore long, and ole Chloe don' likefor see her chile 'stressin' herself so," and the large,dusky hand was passed lovingly over the bright curls,and tenderly wiped away the falling tears."But, 0 mammy!

"I won't cry any more,ow, but will just try to keep thinking how glad 1will be when papa comes home again.""A very sensible resolution, my dear," said Ade-laide, putting her head in at the door; " so come, dryyour eyes, and let mammy put on your bonnet andcloak as fast as possible, for I have begged a holidayfor you, and am going to carry you off to the city todo some shopping, et cetera."" Ah! I think I know what that et cetera means,auntie, don't I ?" laughed Elsie, as she hastened toobey."Dear me ! how very wise some people are," saidher aunt, smiling and nodding good-naturedly, "Butmake haste, my dear, for the carriage is at the door."When Elsie laid her head upon her pillow thatnight she acknowledged to herself, that in spite of herfather's absence-and she had, at times, missed himsadly-the day had been a very short and pleasantone to her, owing to her Aunt Adelaide's thoughtfulkindness in taking her out into new scenes, and giv-ing agreeable occupation to her thoughts. 'She rose at her usual early hour the next morning,and though feeling lonely, comforted herself with thehope of receiving the promised letter; and her facewas full of eager expectation, as her grandfather, inhis usual leisurely manner, opened the bag and digtributed its contents.<pb n="269"/>ELSIE DI1TNSORE.              269" Two letters for Elsie !" he said, in a tone of surprise, just as she was beginning to despair of herturn coming at all. "Ah! one is from Horace, Isee; and the other from Miss Allison, no doubt."Elsie could hardly restrain her eagerness while heheld them in his hand, examining and commentingapon the address, postmark, etc.But at length he tossed them to her, remarking"There! if you are done your breakfast, you hadbetter run away and read them.""Oh ! thank you, grandpa," she said, gladly availingherself of his permission." Elsie is fortunate to day," observed Lora, look-ing after her. "I wonder which she will read first.""Her father's, of course," replied Adelaide.  " Heis more to her than all the rest of the world put to-gether.""A matter of small concern to the rest of theworld, I opine," remarked Mrs. Dinsmore, drily."Perhaps so, mamma," said Adelaide, quietly;" yet I think there are some who prize Elsie's affec-tion."Yes, Adelaide was right. Miss Rose's letter wasneglected and almost forgotten, while Elsie read andreread her papa's with the greatest delight.It gave an amusing account of the day's journey;but what constituted its chief charm for the little girwas that it was filled with expressions of the tender.est affection for her.Then came the Pleasant task of answering, whichx*2<pb n="270"/>270            ELSIE DINSMORE.occupied almost all her spare time, for letter-writingwas still, to her, a rather new and difficult business,Miss Allison having hitherto been her only corre-spondent. And this was a pleasure which was renewedevery day, for her papa faithfully kept his promise,each morning bringing her a letter, until at lengthone came announcing the speedy return of the writerElsie was almost wild with delight." Aunt Adelaide," she cried, running to her to com-municate the glad tidings, " papa says he will be herothis very afternoon.""Well, my dear, as we have already attended toall the business that needed to be kept secret fromhim, I am very glad to hear it, especially for yoursake," replied Adelaide, looking up for a momentfrom the book she was reading, and then returningto it again, while her little niece danced out of theroom, with her papa's letter still in her hand, and aface beaming with happiness.She met Mrs. Dinsmore in the hall." Why are you skipping about in that mad fashion,Elsie ? " she asked, severely; " I believe you will neverlearn to move and act like a lady."" I will try, madam, indeed," Elsie answered, sub-siding into a slow and steady gait which would nothave disgraced a woman of any age; "but I was soglad that papa is coming home to-day, that I couldnot help skipping."" Indeed " and with a scornful toss of the head, Mrs.Dinsmore sailed past her and entered the drawing room,<pb n="271"/>ELSIE D'SMHORE.             271Elsie had once, on her first arrival at Roselands,addressed Mrs. Dinsmore, in the innocence of herheart, as "grandma," but that lady's horrified look,and indignant repudiation of the ancient title, hadmade a deep impression on the little girl's memory,and effectually prevented any repetition of theoffence.'As the hour drew near when her father might rea-sonably be expected, Elsie took her station at one ofthe drawing-room windows overlooking the avenue,and the moment the carriage appeared in sight, sheran out and stood waiting for him on the steps of theportico.Mr. Dinsmore put out his head as they drove upthe avenue, and the first object that caught his eyewas the fairy-like form of his little daughter, in herblue merino dress, and the golden brown curls wavingin the wind. He sprang out and caught her in hisarms the instant the carriage stopped." My darling, darling child," he cried, kissing herover and over again, and pressing her fondly to hisheart, "how glad I am to have you in my armsagain I""Papa, papa, my own dear, dear papa!" she ex-claimed, throwing her arms around his neck, " I'm sohappy, now that you have come home safe and well."" Are you, darling ? but I must not keep you out mthis wind, for it is quite chilly."He set her down, and leaving the servant to attenc.to his baggage, led her into the hall.<pb n="272"/>272            ELSIE DINSMORE."Will you come into the drawing-room, pala "she said; " there is a bright, warm fire there."" Is there not one in my dressing-room  " he asked."Yes, papa, a very good one.""Then we will go there. I dare say the rest ofthe family are in no great hurry to see me, and Iwant my little girl to myself for half an hour,"'he said,leading the way up-stairs as he spoke.They found, as Elsie had reported, a very brightfire in the dressing-room. A large easy chair wasdrawn up near it, and a handsome dressing-gown andslippers were placed ready for use; all the work ofElsie's loving little hands.He saw it all at a glance, and with a pleased smile,stooped and kissed her again, saying, " My dear littledaughter is very thoughtful for her papa's comfort."Then exchanging his warm out-door apparel andheavy boots for the dressing-gown and slippers, heseated himself in the chair and took her on hisknee." Well, daughter," he said, passing his hand caress-ingly over her curls, "papa has brought you a pres-ent; will you have it now, or shall it be kept forChristmas ?"" Keep it for Christmas, papa," she answered gayly"Christmas is almost here, and besides, I don't wantto look at anything but you to-night.""Very well, look at me as much as you like," washis laughing rejoinder. "And now tell me, have youbeen a good girl in my absence ?"<pb n="273"/>SLSIE DINSJORE.             273"As good as I ever am, I believe, papa. I triedvery hard; but you can ask Miss Day."" No, I am entirely satisfied with your report, for 1know my little daughter is quite truthful."Elsie colored with pleasure, then calling to mindthe time when he had for a moment suspected her offalsehood, she heaved a deep sigh, dropping her headupon his breast.He seenied to understand her thoughts, for, press-ing his lips to her forehead, he said gently and kindly" I think I shall never again doubt my little daugh-ter's truth."She looked up with a grateful smile." Miss Day has gone away to stay until after NewYear's day, papa," she said, "and so our holidayshave begun."" Ah ! I am very well satisfied," said he. " I thinkyou have earned a holiday, and I hope you will enjoyit. But I don't know that I shall let you playall thetime," he added with a smile; "I have some notionof giving you a lesson now and then, myself."" Dear papa, how pleasant !" she exclaimed delight-edly; "I do so love to say lessons to you."" Well, then, we will spend an hour together everymorning.  But are you not to have some com-pany ? "" Oh! yes, papa, quite a house full," she said witha slight sigh.  "The Percys, and the IHowards,and all the Carringtons, and some others too, Ibelieve."<pb n="274"/>274            LISfE DINSfMORE."Why do you sigh, daughter?" he asked; " deyou not expect to enjoy their company ?""Yes, sir, I hope so," she answered, rather dubi.ously; "but when there are so many, and they stayso long, they are apt to disagree, and that, you know,is not pleasant. I am sure I shall enjoy the hourwith you better than anything else; it is so sweet tobe quite alone with my own darling papa," and thelittle arm stole softly round his neck again, and therosy lips touched his cheek."Well, when are the little plagues coming ' " heasked, returning her caress." Some of them to-morrow, papa; no, Monday-to-morrow is Sabbath day."" Shall I bring in de trunks now, massa " askedMr. Dinsmore's servant, putting his head in at thedoor."Yes, John, certainly.""Why, you brought back a new one, papa, didn'tyou?" asked Elsie, as John carried in one she wassure she had never seen before, and in obedience toa motion of her father's hand, set it down quite nearthem."Yes, my dear, it is yours. There, John, unlockit," tossing him the key. " And now daughter, getdown and see what you can find in it worthhaving."Elsie needed no second bidding, but in an instantwas on her knees beside the trunk, eager to examineits contents<pb n="275"/>ELSIE DINSJMORE               2/5" Take the Ila off the band-box first, and see v hatis there," said her father." 0 papa, how very pretty!" she cried, as shelifted out a beautiful little velvet hat adorned with acouple of ostrich feathers." I am very glad it pleases you, my darling," hesaid, putting it on her head, and gazing at her withproud delight in her rare beauty. " There! it fitsexactly, and is very becoming."Then taking it off, he returned it to the box, andbade her look further."I am   reserving the present for Christmas," hesaid, in answer to her inquiring look.Elsie turned to the trunk again." Dear papa, how good you are to me !" she said,looking up at him, almost with tears of pleasure inher eyes, as she lifted out, one after another, a num.ber of costly toys, which she examined with excla-mations of delight, and then several handsomedresses, some of the finest, softest merino, and othersof thick, rich silk, all ready made in fashionablestyle, and doing credit to his taste and judgment;and lastly a beautiful velvet pelisse, trimmed withcostly fur, just the thing to wear with her pretty newhat.He laughed and patted her cheek." We must have these dresses tried on," he said,at least one of them; for as they were all cut by thesame pattern-one of your old dresses which I toolwith me-I presume they will all fit alike. There,<pb n="276"/>276            ELSIE DINSMORE.take this one to mammy, and tell her to put it onyou, and then come back to me.""Oh! I wondered how you could get them theright size, papa," Elsie answered, as she skipped gaylyout of the room.She was back again in a very few moments, arrayedin the pretty silk he had selected." Ah ! it seems to be a perfect fit," said he, turn-ing her round and round, with a very gratified look."Mammy must dress you to-morrow in one ofthese new frocks, and your pretty hat and pelisse."Elsie looked troubled."Well, what is it?" he asked."I am afraid I shall be thinking of them in church,papa, if I wear them then for the first time.""Pooh! nonsense! what harm if you do?' Thissqueamishness, Elsie, is the one thing about you thatdispleases me very much. But there ! don't look sodistressed, my pet. I dare say you will get over itby-and-by, and be all I wish; indeed I sometimesthink you have improved a little already, in thatrespect."Oh! what a pang these words sent to her heart lwas it indeed true that she was losing her tendernessof conscience that she was becoming less afraid ofdispleasing and dishonoring her Saviour than informer days   The very thought was anguish.Her head drooped upon her bosom, and the smallwhite hands were clasped convulsively together, whilea bitter, repenting cry, a silent earnest prayer for<pb n="277"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             277pa rdoi and help went up to Him whose ear is eveiopen to the cry of His children.Her father looked at her in astonishment."What is it, darling " he asked, drawing her ten-derly toward him, and pushing back the curls fromher face; " why do you look so pained ? what did Isay that could have hurt you so  I did not mean tobe harsh and severe, for it was a very trifling fault."She hid her face on his shoulder and burst into anagony of tears." It was not that papa, but-but-""But what, my darling   don't be afraid to tellme," he answered, soothingly."0 papa ! I-I am afraid I don't-love Jesus-as much as I did," she faltered out between her sobs." Ah ! that is it, eh ? Well, well, you needn't cryany more. I think you are a very good little girl,though rather a silly one, I am afraid, and quite toomorbidly conscientious."He took her on his knee as he spoke, wiped awaytier tears, and then began talking in a lively strain ofsomething else.Elsie listened, and answered him cheerfully, but allthe evening he noticed that whenever she was quiet,an unusual expression of sadness would steal over herface." What a strange child she is !" he said to himself,as he sat musing over the fire, after sending her tobed. " I cannot understand her; it is very odd howoften I wound, when I intend to please her."<pb n="278"/>278           StLSIE  DIYSMORA.As for Elsie, she scarcely thought of her new finery, so troubled was her tender conscience, so painedher little heart to think that she had been wanderingfiom her dear Saviour.But Elsie had learned that " if any man sin, wehave an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ therighteous," and to Him she went with her sin andsorrow; she applied anew to the pardoning, peace-speaking blood of Christ-that " blood of sprinklingthat speaketh better things than that of Abel;" andthus the sting of conscience was taken away and herpeace restored, and she was soon resting quietly onher pillow, for, " so He giveth his beloved sleep."Even her father's keen, searching glance, when shecame to him in the morning, could discover no traceof sadness in her face; very quiet and sober it was,but entirely peaceful and happy, and so it remainedall through the day. Her new clothes did not troubleher; she was hardly conscious of wearing them, andquite able to give her usual solemn and fixed atten-tion to the services of the sanctuary." Where are you going, daughter " Mr. Dinsmoroasked, as Elsie gently withdrew her hand from hison leaving the dining-room."To my room, papa," she replied."Come with me," he said; " I want you.""What do you want me for, papa ?" she asked,as he sat down and took her on his knee."What for? why to keep, to love, and to look at,"he said laughing. " I have been away from my little<pb n="279"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             279girl so long, that now I want her close by my side,or on my knee. all the time. Do you not like to bowith Lme "" Dearly well, my own darling papa," she answered,finging her little arms round his neck, and layingher head on his breast.He fondled her, and chatted with her for sometime, then, still keeping her on his knee, took up abook and began to read.Elsie saw with pain that it was a novel, and longedto beg him to put it away, and spend the precioushours of the holy Sabbath in the study of God'sword, or some of the lesser helps to Zion's pilgrimswhich the saints of our own or other ages have pre-pared. But' she knew that it would be quite out ofplace for a little child like her to attempt to counselor reprove her father; and that, tenderly as he lovedand cherished her, he would never for one momentallow her to forget their relative positions.At length she ventured to ask softly, " Papa, mayI go to my own room now "" What for ?" he asked; " are you tired of my com.pany ? ""No, sir, oh  no; but I want-" she hesitatedand hung her head for an instant, while the rich colormounted to cheek and brow; then raising it again,she said fearlessly, " I always want to spend a littlewhile with my best Friend; on Sabbath afternoon,papa."He looked puzzled, and also somewhat displeased.<pb n="280"/>280            ELSIE DINSMORE."I don't understand you, Elsie," he said, ' yousurely can have no better friend than your own fathertnd can it be possible that you love any one else bet-ter than you love me?"Again the little arms were round his neck, andhugging him close and closer, she whispered, " It wasJesus I meant, papa; you know He loves me evenbetter than you do, and I must love Him best of allbut there is no one else that I love half so much as Ilove you, my own dear, dear, precious father.""Well, you may go; but only for a little while,mind," he, answered, giving her a kiss, and setting herdown. " Nay," he added hastily, "stay as long asyou like; if you feel it a punishment to be kept herewith me, I would rather do without you.'""Oh! no, no, papa," she said beseechingly, andwith tears in her eyes; "I do so love to be withyou. Please don't be angry; please let me comeback soon.""No, darling, I am   not angry," he answered,smoothing her hair and smiling kindly on her;come back just when you like, and the sooner thebetter."Elsie did not stay away very long; in less than anhour she returned, bringing her Bible and Pilgrim'sProgress with her.Her father welcomed her with a smile, and thenturned to his novel again, while she drew a stool tohis side, and, sitting down, leaned her head againsthis knee, and read until the short winter day began<pb n="281"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             281to close in, and Mr. Dinsmore, whose hand had beenevery now and then laid caressingly upon her curls,said, "Put away your book now, daughter; it isgrowing too dark for you to read without strainingyour eyes.""Please, papa, let me finish the paragraph first;may I ?" she asked."No; you must always obey the instant I speakto you."Elsie rose at once, and without another word laidher books upon the table; then coming back, claimedher accustomed place upon his knee, with her headresting on his shoulder.He put his arm round her, and they sat silentlythus for some moments. At length Elsie asked,"Papa, did you ever read ' Pilgrim's Progress ? "" Yes; a good while ago, when I was quite a boy.""And did you not like it, papa ? ""Yes, very much, though I have nearly forgottenthe story now. Do you like it "" Very much, indeed, papa; I think it comes nextto the Bible."" Next to the Bible, eh ? well, I believe you are theonly little girl of my acquaintance who thinks thatthe most beautiful aud interesting book in the world.But, let me see, what is this 'Pilgrim's Progress'about? some foolish story of a man with a great.oad on his back; is it not ?""Foolish! papa; oh ! I am sure you don't meanit; you couldn't think it foolish. Ah I I know by<pb n="282"/>282            ELSIE DINSfSORE.your smile that you are only saying it to tease me.It is a beautiful story, papa, about Christian: how helived in the City of Destruction, and had a great bui-den on his back, which he tried in every way to getrid of, but all in vain, until he came to the Cross; butthen it seemed suddenly to loosen of itself, anddropped from his back, and rolled away, and fell intothe sepulchre, where it could not be seen any more."" Well, and is not that a foolish story ? can yousee any sense or meaning in it?" he asked, with aslight smile, and a keen glance into the eager littleface upturned to his."Ah ! papa, I know what it means," she answered,in a half-sorrowful tone. " Christian, with the loadon his back, is a person who has been convinced ofsin by God's Holy Spirit, and feels his sins a heavyburden-too heavy for him to bear; and then he triesto get rid of them by leaving off his wicked ways,and by doing good deeds; but he soon finds he can'tget rid of his load that way, for it only grows heavierand heavier, until at last he gives up trying to savehimself, and just goes to the cross of Jesus Christ;and the moment he looks to Jesus and trusts in Him,his load of sins is all gone."Mr. Dinsmore was surprised; as indeed he hadoften been at Elsie's knowledge of spiritual things." Who told you all that ?" he asked."I read it in the Bible, papa; and besides, I know,because I have felt it."He did not speak again for some moments; snd<pb n="283"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.             283then he said very gravely, " I am afraid you read toomany of those dull books. I don't want you to readthings that fill you with sad and gloomy thoughts,and make you unhappy. I want my little girl to bemerry and happy as the day is long.""Please don't forbid me to read them, papa," shepleaded with a look of apprehension, "for indeedthey don't make me unhappy, and I love them sodearly."" You need not be alarmed. I shall not do so unlessI see that they do affect your spirits," he answeredin a reassuring tone, and she thanked him with herown bright, sweet smile.She was silent for a moment, then asked suddenly," Papa, may I say some verses to you ?"" Some time," he said, " but not now, for there isthe tea-bell;" and taking her hand, he led her downto the dining-room.They went to the drawing-room after tea, but didnot stay long. There were no visitors, and it wasvery dull and quiet there, no one seeming inclinedfor conversation. Old Mr. Dinsmore sat nodding inhis chair, Louise was drumming on the piano, andthe rest were reading or sitting listlessly, saying noth-ing, and Elsie and her papa soon slipped away totheir old seat by his dressing-room fire."Sing something for me, my pet, some of thoselittle hymns I often hear you singing to yourself," hesaid, as he took her on his knee; and Elsie gladlyobeyed.<pb n="284"/>284.           ELSIE DINSMfORE.Some of the pieces she sang alone, but in others,which were familiar to him, her father joined his deepbass notes to her sweet treble, at which she wasgreatly delighted. Then they read several chaptersof the Bible together, and thus the evening passed soquickly and pleasantly that she was very much sur-prised when her papa, taking out his watch, told herit was her bed-time." O papa! it has been such a nice, nice evening! "she said, as she bad6 him   good-night; "so likethe dear old times I used to have with Miss Rose,only-"She paused and colored deeply."Only what, darling " he asked, drawing hercaressingly to him." Only, papa, if you would pray with me, like shedid," she whispered, winding her arms about his neck,and hiding her face on his shoulder."That I cannot do, my pet, I have never learnedhow; and so I fear you will have to do all the pray-ing for yourself and me too," he said, with a vaineffort to speak lightly, for both heart and consciencewere touched.The only reply was a tightening of the clasp of thehttle arms about his neck, and a half-suppressed sob;then two trembling lips touched his, a warm tearfell on his cheek, and she turned away and ran quicky from the room.Oh i how earnest and importunate were Elsie's plead-ings at a throne of grace that night, that her " dear,<pb n="285"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              285dear papa might soon be taught to love Jesus, andhow to pray to him."    Tears fell fast while sheorayed, but she rose from her knees feeling a joyful?.ssurance that her petitions had been heard, and wouldbe granted in God's own good time.She had hardly laid her head upon her pillow,when her father came in, and saying, " I have come tosit beside my little girl till she falls asleep," placedhimself in a chair close by her side, taking her handin his and holding it, as she loved so to have him do."I am so glad you have come, papa," she said, hexwhole face lighting up with pleased surprise."Are you?" he answered with a smile. "I'mafraid I am spoiling you; but I can't help it to-night.I think you forgot your wish to repeat some versesto me ""Oh ! yes, papa!

"Notshut your eyes and go to sleep; I will have no moretalking to-night."She obeyed at once; the white lids gently closedover the sweet eyes, the long, dark lashes rested qui-etly on the fair, round cheek, and soon her soft regu-lar breathing told that she had passed into the landof dreams.Her father sat, still holding the little hand, and* These beautiful words are not mine, nor do I know eitherthe name of the author or where they were originally pub-lished<pb n="288"/>288            ELSIE DINrSMOKtOstill gazing tenderly upon the sweet young face, till,something in its expression reminding him of wordsshe had just repeated,"I want to be marked for thine own-Thy seal on my forehead to wear,"he laid it gently down, rose, and bent over her with atroubled look." Ah, my darling, that prayer is granted already !'he murmured; "for, ah me! you seem almost toogood and pure for earth.

"Better lie still, honey, till de roomgets warm.-'"I'll wait a little while, mammy," Elsie said, lyingdown again, " but I must get up soon; for I wouldn'tmiss my walk with papa for a great deal.

You ain't sick, norsufferin' any wayt " exclaimed Chloe, in a tone ofmingled concern and inquiry, as she hastily set downher broom, and came toward the bed, with a look ofloving anxiety on her dark face." Oh, no, mammy! I slept nicely, and feel as wellas can be," replied the little girl; "but I am glad tosee this new day, because I hope it is going to be avery happy one. Carry Howard, and a good manyof my little friends are coming, you know, and I thinkwe will have a very pleasant time together."" Your ole mammy hopes you will, darlin'," repliedChloe, heartily; " an' I'se glad 'nough to see you look-in' so bright an' well; but jes you lie still till it getswarm here.. I'll open de shutters, an' fotch somemore wood for de fire, an' clar up de room, an' bydat time I reckon you can get up."Elsie waited patiently till Chloe pronounced theroom warm enough, then sprang up with an cagerhaste, asking to be dressed as quickly as possible, thatthe might go to her papa.<pb n="291"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               291"Dont you go for to worry yourself, darlin';dere's plenty ob time," said Chloe, beginning heiwork with all speed, however; "de mistress habordered de breakfast at nine, dese holiday times, tolet de ladies an' gen'lemen take a mornin' nap ifdey likes it."" Oh, yes, mammy! and that reminds me that papasaid I must eat a cracker or something before I takamy walk, because he thinks it is n't good for peopleto exercise much on an entirely empty stomach,"said Elsie.

He opened it, and stooping to give hera good-morning kiss, said, with a pleased smile,"How bright and well my darling looks.! Had youa good night's rest ? "" Oh, yes, papa !

" Shallwe not start soon ?"" Presently," he said, stroking her hair; " but it willnot hurt you to get well warmed first, for it is a sharpmorning."" You are very careful of me, dear papa," she said,laying her head on his breast, " and oh! it is so niceto have a papa to love me and take care of me."" And it is so nice to have a dear little daughterto love and to take care of," he answered, pressingher closer to him.The house was still very quiet, no one seemingto be astir but the servants, as -Mr. Dinsmore andElsie went down the stairs and passed out throughthe hall." 0 papa ! it is going to be such a nice day, andI feel so happy!" Elsie gayly exclaimed, as theystarted down the avenue." Do you, daughter ?" he said, regarding her withan expression of intense yearning affection; "I wishI could make you always as gay and happy as youare at this moment.  But alas! it cannot be, mydarling," he added with a sigh."I know that, papa," she said with sudden gravi-ty, "' for man that is born of woman is of few dava,<pb n="293"/>ELSIE DIINSiORBE.             293and full of trouble,' the Bible says; but I dont feelfriightened at that, because it tells me, besides, thatJesus loves me, oh, so dearly I and will never leavenor forsake me; and that He has all power in heavenand in earth, and will never let anything happen tome but what shall do me good. 0 papa, it is sucha happy thing to have the dear Lord Jesus for yourfriend ! '"It is strange how everything seems to lead yourthoughts to Him," he said, giving her a wonderinglook." Yes, papa, it is because I love Him so," she an-swered, simply; and the father sighed as the thoughtarose, "Better than she loves me, even as she toldme herself. Ah ! I would I could be all-everythingto her, as she is fast becoming to me. I cannot feelsatisfied, and yet I believe few daughters love theirfathers as well as she loves me; " and fondly pressing,he little hand he held, he looked down upon herwith beaming eyes.She raised hers to his face with an expression ofconfiding affection; and, as though she had read histhoughts: "Yes, papa,'" she said, "I love you dearly,dearly, too; better than all the world besides."Breakfast-always a plentiful and inviting meal atRoselands-was already upon the table when theyreturned, and they brought to it appetites sufficientlykeen'to make it very enjoyable.Elsie spent the first hour after breakfast at thepiano, practicing, and the second in her papa'sL 2<pb n="294"/>294            ELSIE DINSMORE.dressing-room, studying and reciting to him ; thenthey took a long ride on horseback, and when theyreturned she found that quite a number of the ex-pected guests had already arrived.Among them was Caroline Howard, a favoritefriend of Elsie's; a pretty, sweet-tempered little girl,about a year older than herself.Caroline had been away paying a long visit to somefriends in the North, and so the two little girls hadnot met for nearly a year, and of course they had agreat deal to say to each other.They chatted a few moments in the drawing-room,and then Elsie carried her friend off with her to herown room, that they might go on with their talkwhile she was getting dressed for dinner. Carolinehad much to tell of her Northern relatives, and of allshe had seen and heard, and Elsie of her new-foundparent, and her happiness in being so loved and caredfor; and so the little tongues ran very fast, neitherof them feeling Chloe's presence any restraint. Butshe. soon completed her task, and went out, leavingthe two sitting on the sofa together, laughing andtalking merrily while awaiting the summons to dinner,which they were to take that day along with theirelders."How pretty your hair is, Elsie," said Caroline,winding the glossy ringlets around her finger. "Iwish you'd give me one of these curls. I want toget a bracelet made for mamma, and she thinks somuch n vou. and vour hair is such a lovely color,<pb n="295"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               295that I am sure she would be delighted with one madeof it."" A Christmas gift is it to be " asked Elsie; " buthow will you get it done.in time for you know dayafter to-morrow is Christmas."" Yes, I know; but if I could get into the city thisufternoon, I think I might get them to promise it byto-morrow night."" Well, you shall have the curl, at any rate, if youwill just take the scissors and help yourself, and poormammy will have the fewer to curl the next time,"Elsie answered, laughingly. " But mind," she add-ed, as Caroline prepared to avail herself of the per-mission, "that you take it where it will not bemissed.""Of course I will; I don't want to spoil yourbeauty, though you are so much prettier than I,'? wasCaroline's laughing rejoinder. " There," she cried,holding up the severed ringlet, " is n't it a beauty ?but do n't look scared, it will never be missed amongso many; I don't even miss it myself, although Iknow-it is gone.""Well," Elsie said, shaking back her curls, "sup-pose we go down to the drawing.room now, and Iwill ask papa to take us to the city this afternoon;or, if he is too busy to go himself, to let Pomp orAjax drive us in.""I think it would be better fun to go alone, Elsie-don't you " asked Caroline, with some hesita-tion; adding qni;klyv: "Don't be vexed, but I<pb n="296"/>296            ELSIE DINSMORE.must confess I am more than half afraid of youifather."" Oh! you would n't be, Carry, if you knew him,"Elsie answered, in her eager way; " I was a little my.self, at first, but now I love him so dearly, I neveiwant to go anywhere without him."They found Mr. Dinsmore in the drawing-room,where most of the guests and the older members ofthe family were assembled. He was conversing witha strange gentleman, and his little girl stood quietlyat his side, patiently waiting until he should beready to give her his attention. She had to waitsome moments, for the gentlemen were discussingsome political question, and were too much engagecto notice her.But at length her father put his arm aroundher, and with a kind smile asked, " What is it,daughter ""Carry and I want to go to the city, this after-noon; wont you take us, papa "".I wish I could, my dear, but I have an engage-ment, which makes it quite impossible."" Ah, I 'm so sorry ! but then, papa, we may haveone of the carriages, and Pomp or Ajax to drive us,may we not ?"" No, daughter; I am sorry to disappoint you, butI am afraid you are too young to be trusted on suchan expedition with only a servant. You must waitantil to-morrow, when I can take you myself.""But, papa, we want to go to-day.

His mannelwas quite too grave and decided for her to venturaanother word."What is the matter? what does Elsie want?"asked Adelaide, who was standing near, and haQoverheard enough to have some idea of the trouble.Mr. Dinsmore explained, and Adelaide at onceoffered to take charge of the little girls, saying thatshe intended shopping a little in the city herself thatvery afternoon." Thank you," said her brother, looking very muchpleased; " that obviates the difficulty entirely.

But how could youknow I wanted more money ?"He only smiled, lifted her up in his arms, andkissed her fondly, and then, placing her in the car-riage, said to the coachman, "Drive carefully, Ajax;you are carrying my greatest treasure."" Nebber fear, marster; dese ole horses nebber tinkob running away," replied the negro, with a bow anda grin, as he touched his horses with the whip, anddrove off.It was growing quite dark when the carriage againdrove up the avenue; and Mr. Horace Dinsmore, whowas beginning to feel a little anxious, came out to re-eeive them, and ask what had detained them so long<pb n="299"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.              299" Long!" said Adelaide, in a tone of surprise, "yougentlemen really have no idea what an undertaking itis to shop.

"I wouldgive you the bundle you carried up stairs, just now,but I'm afraid you would say that was not mine togive, because it belongs to you already."" Indeed it does, and I feel richer in that possessionthan all the gold of California could make me," hesaid, pressing her to his heart.She looked surpassingly lovely at that moment, hercheeks burning, and her eyes sparkling with excite-ment; the dark, fur-trimmed pelisse, and the velvethat and plumes, setting off to advantage the whitenessof her pure complexion, and the glossy ringlets fall-ing in rich masses on her shoulders." My own 'papa ! I'm so glad I de belong to you,"she said, throwing her arms around his neck, andlaying her cheek to his for an instant. Then springingaway, she added: "but I must show you the rest ofthe things; there are a good many more."<pb n="301"/>ELSIE DINSASORE.             301And she went on opening bundle after bundle,displaying their contents, and telling him for whomshe. intended them, until at last they had all beenexamined, and then she said, a little wearily, " Now,mammy, please put them all away until to-morrow.But first take off my things, and get me ready to godown stairs."" No, daughter," Mr. Dinsmore said in a gentlebut firm tone; " you are not ready to have them putaway until the price of each has been set down inyour book.""Oh! papa," she pleaded, " wont to-morrow do,I'm tired now, and is n't it almost tea-time ? ""No; never put off till to-morrow what may aswell be done to-day. There is nearly an hour yetbefore tea, and I do not think it need fatigue youmuch."Elsie's face clouded, and the slightest approach toa pout might have been perceived." I hope my little girl is not going to be naughty,"he said, very gravely.Her face brightened in an instant. " No, papa," sheanswered cheerfully, " I will be good, and do what-ever you bid me."" That is my own darling," said he, " and I willhelp you, and it will not take long."He opened her writing-desk as he spoke, and tookout her account-book."Oh! papa," she cried in a startled tone, springingForward and taking hold of his hand, " please, pleaseL* 2<pb n="302"/>302            ELSIE D1NSMORE.ilont look! you know you said I need not show youuntil after Christmas."" No, I will not," he replied, smiling at her eager-ness; " you shall put down the items in the book,while I write the labels, and Aunt Chloe pins them on.Will that do ?""Oh! that's a nice plan, papa," she saidgayly, asshe threw off her hat and pelisse, and seating herselfbefore the desk, took out her pen and ink.Chloe put the hat and pelisse carefully away, broughta comb and brush, and smoothed her nursling'shair, and then began her share of the business onhand.Half an hour's work finished it all, and Elsie wipedher pen, and laid it away, saying joyously, " Oh !I'm so glad it is all done.""Papa knew best, after all, did he not?" askedher father, drawing her to him, and patting hercheek."Yes, papa," she said softly; "you always knowbest, and I am very sorry I was naughty."He answered with a kiss, and, taking her hand, ledher down to the drp'wing-room.After tea the young people adjourned to the nursery,where they amused themselves with a variety of in-nocent games. Quite early in the evening, and greatlyto Elsie's delight, her father joined them; and, thoughsome of the young strangers were at first rather shyof him, they soon found that he could enter heartilyinto their sports, and before the time came to sep.<pb n="303"/>RLSIE   DINSMORB               303arate for the night, he had made himself very popularwith nearly all.Time flew fast, and Elsie was very much surprir iwhen the clock struck eight. Half-past was her bAd-time; and, as she now and then glanced up at thedial-plate, she thought the hands had never moved nofast. As it struck the half hour she drew near heriather's side."Papa," she asked, " is the clock right ""Yes, my dear, it is," he replied, comparing it withhis watch."And must I go to bed now?" she asked, halfhoping for permission to stay up a little longer."Yes, daughter; keep to rules."Elsie looked disappointed, and several little voicesurged, " Oh ! do let her stay up another hour, or atleast till nine o'clock.""No; I cannot often allow a departure fromrules," he said kindly, but firmly; "and to-morrownight Elsie will find it harder to go to bed in seasonthan to-night.  Bid your little friends good-night,my dear, and go at once."Elsie obeyed, readily and cheerfully. "You, too,papa," she said, coming to him last." No, darling," he answered, laying his hand caress-ingly on her head, and smiling approvingly on her;"I will come for my good-night kiss before youare asleep."Elsie looked very glad, and went away feeling her-self the happiest little girl in the land, in spite of the<pb n="304"/>304            ELSIE DI NSHORE.annoyance of being forced to leave the merry groupin the nursery. She was just ready for bed whenher papa came in, and, taking her in his arms, foldedher to his heart, saying, "My own darling ! my good,obedient little daughter! ""Dear papa, I love you so much !" she replied,twining her arms around his neck, " I love you a-1the better for never letting me have my own way,but always making me obey and keep to rules."" I do n't doubt it, daughter," he said, " for I haveoften noticed that spoiled, petted children, usuallyhave very little love for their parents, or indeed forany one but themselves.

I think your papamight have let you stay up a little longer; but hehas promised that to -night-as we are to havethe Christmas-tree, and ever so much will be goingon-you shall stay up till half-past nine, if you likeAre n't you glad ? I'm sure I am."" Yes, papa is very kind, and I know I feel muchbetter for going to bed early last night," said Elsie,cheerfully." Yes, indeed," remarked Mrs. Brown, " late hoursand rich food are very bad for little folks, and Inotice that Miss Elsie has grown a deal stronger andhealthier-looking since her papa came home; he takessuch good care of her.""Indeed he does," said Elsie heartily, thankingMrs. Brown with one of her sweetest smiles." What are we going to do to-day, Elsie ?" askedCaroline."Whatever you all prefer," said Elsie. "If youlike I will practice that duet with you the first hounafter breakfast, or do anything else you wish; butthe second hour I must spend with papa, and afterthat I have nothing to do but entertain my companyall day.""Do you do lessons m   holidays?" asked MaryLeslie, a merry, fun-loving child, about Elsie's own age,who considered lessons an intolerable bore, and hadsome vague idea that they must have been invented<pb n="307"/>ELSIEh DISfMO1B.              307for the sole purpose of tormenting children. Hei blueeyes opened wide with astonishment when Elsiequietly replied that her papa had kindly arranged togive her an hour every morning, because he knew itwould be so much pleasanter for her than spendingthe whole day in play.Elsie did keenly enjoy that quiet hour spent ilstudying and reciting to her father, sitting on a lowstool at his feet, or perhaps oftener on his knee, withhis arm around her waist.She had an eager and growing thirst for knowledge,and was an apt scholar, whom any one with the leastlove for the profession might have delighted in teach-ing; and Mr. Dinsmore, a thorough scholar himself,and loving knowledge for its own sake-loving alsohis little pupil with all a father's fond, yearning affec-tion-delighted in his task.When Elsie left her father she found that the Car-ringtons had just arrived.  She and Lucy had notseen each other since the week the latter had spentat Roselands early in the summer, and both feltpleased to meet.Mrs. Carrington gave Elsie a warm embrace, remark.ing that she had grown, and was looking extremelywell; better than she had ever seen her., But no on,was more delighted to meet Elsie than Herbert, andshe was very glad to learn that his health was gradu-ally improving. He was not, however, at all strong,even yet, and his mother thought it best for him tolie down and rest a little after his ride. She prom.<pb n="308"/>308            ELShia/ '^tI~ SfMO~lB.ised to sit by him, and the two little girls went insearch of the rest of the young folks.Several of the older boys had gone out walking orriding, but the younger ones, and all the little girls,were gathered in a little back parlor, where, by Ade-laide's care and forethought, a variety of story-books,toys, and games, had been provided for their amuse-ment. Elsie's entrance was hailed with delight, forshe was a general favorite." Oh ! Elsie, can't you tell us what to play ? " criedMary Leslie; " I'm so tired," and she yawned wearily."Here are some dissected maps, Mary," repliedElsie, opening a drawer; " would you not like them ?" "No, indeed, thank you; they are too much likelessons."" Here are blocks; will you build houses ?""Oh ! I am too big for that; they are very nice forlittle children."" Will you play jack-stones ? here are some smoothpebbles."" Yes, if you, and Carry, and Lucy, will play withme."" Agreed !" said the others, " let's have a game."So, Elsie having first set the little ones to buildingblock-houses, supplied Harry Carrington-an olderbrother of Lucy's-with a book, and two youngerboys with dissected maps to arrange, the four girlssat down in a circle on the carpet and began theiigame.For a few moments all went on smoothly; but soon<pb n="309"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               3C9angry and complaining words were heard comingfrom the corner where the house-building was going~n. Elsie left her game to try to make peace."What is the matter, Flora, dear?" she askedsoothingly of a little curly-headed girl, who was sob-bing, and wiping her eyes with the corner of herapron."Enna took my blocks," sobbed the child"Oh! Enna, wont you give them back ? " said Elsie,coaxingly; " you know Flora is a visitor, and we mustbe very polite to her.""No, I wont," returned Enna, flatly; "she's gotenough now."" No, I have n't; I can't build a house with those,"Flora said, with another sob.Elsie stood a moment looking much perplexed;then, with a brightening face, exclaimed in her cheer-ful, pleasant way, " Well, never mind, Flora, dear, Iwill get you my doll. Will not that do quite aswell ""Oh! yes, I'd rather have the doll, Elsie," thelittle weeper answered eagerly, smiling through her.ears.Elsie ran out of the room, and was back againalmost in a moment, with the doll in her arms."There, dear little Flora," she said, laying it gentlyon the child's laD, " please be careful of it, for I havehad it a long while, and prize it very much, becausemy guardian gave- it to me when I was a very littlegirl, and he is dead now."<pb n="313"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.                313Flora turned to her as she entered."Please, Elsie, don't be cross," she said coaxingly,"  am real sorry your doll's broken, but it wasn't myfiult. Enna would try to snatch it, and that made itfall and break its head."Poor Elsie! this was quite a trial, and she couldscarcely keep back the tears as, following Flora'sglance, she saw her valued doll lying on the window-seat with its head broken entirely off. She said nota word, but, hastily crossing the room, took it up andgazed mournfully at it.Kind Mrs. Brown, who had just finished helpingher young charge all round, followed her to thewindow."Never mind, dear," she said in her pleasant,cheery tone, patting Elsie's cheek and smoothing herhair, "I've got some excellent glue, and I think Ican stick it on again and make it almost as good asever. So come, sit down and eat your lunch, anddon't fret any more."" Thank you, ma'am, you are very kind," Elsie said,trying to smile, as the kind-hearted old lady led herto the table and filled her plate with fruit and cakes." These cakes are very simple, not at all rich, mydear, but quite what your papa would approve of,"she said, seeing the little girl look doubtfully at them."Doesn't your papa let you eat anything good,Elsie " asked Mary Leslie across the table. " Hemust be cross.""No, indeed, he is not, Mary, and he lets me eat<pb n="314"/>34            ELSIE DINSMORE.everything that he thinks is good for me," Elsie an-swered with some warmth.She was seated between Caroline Howard andLucy Carrington." What did your papa send you away for, Elsie ?"whispered the latter." Please don't ask me, Lucy," replied the little girl,blushing deeply. " Papa always has a good reasonfor what he does, and he is just the dearest, kindest,and best father that ever anybody had."Elsie spoke in an eager, excited, almost angrymanner, quite unusual with her, while the hot tearscame into her eyes, for she knew very well what wasLucy's opinion of her father, and more than half sus-pected that she had been making some unkind remarkabout him to the others, and she was eager to removeany unfavorable impression they might have received." I am sure he must love you very dearly, Elsie,"remarked Caroline, soothingly; " no one could helpseeing that just by the way he looks at you."Elsie answered her with a pleased and gratefullook; and then changed the subject by proposingthat they should all take a walk as soon as they hadfinished eating, as the day was fine, and there wouldbe plenty of time before dinner.The motion was carried without a dissentingvoice, and in a few moments they all set out, a verymerry party, full of fun and frolic. They had a verypleasant time, and returned barely in season to bedressed for dinner.*8-<pb n="315"/>ELSIE DIAISMORE.              315They dined by themselves in the nursery, but wereafterward taken down to the drawing-room. HereElsie found herself immediately seized upon by avoung lady, dressed in very gay and fashionablestyle, whom she did not remember ever to haveseen before, but who insisted on seating the littlegirl on the sofa by her side, and keeping her there along while, loading her with caresses and flattery." My dear child," she said, "what lovely hair youhave! so fine, and soft, and glossy; such a beautifulcolor, too, and curls so splendidly! Natural ringlets,I'm sure, are they not ?"" Yes, ma'am," Elsie answered, simply, wishing fromthe bottom of her heart that the lady would releaseher, and talk to some one else.But the lady had no such intention." You are a very sweet little girl, I am sure, and Ishall love you dearly," she said, kissing her severaltimes. " Ah ! I would give anything if I had sucha clear fair complexion and such rosy cheeks. Thatmakes you blush. Well, I like to see it; blushes arevery becoming. Oh ! you needn't pretend you don'tknow you're handsome; you're a perfect little beauty.Do tell me, where did you get such splendid eyes But I needn't ask, for I have only to look at yourfather to see where they came from. Mr. Dinsmore"-to Elsie's papa, who just then came toward them--" you ought to be very proud of this child; she isthe very image of yourself, and a perfect little beauty,too."<pb n="316"/>316            ELSIE DIrSMrORE."Miss Stevens is pleased to flatter me," he said,bowing low; but flattery is not good for either grown-up children or younger ones, and I must beg leaveto decline the compliment, as I cannot see thatElsie bears the slightest resemblance to me or anyof my family. She is very like her mother, though,"he added with a half sigh and a tender, loving glanceat his little girl, "and that is just what I wouldhave her.  But I am forgetting my errand, MissStevens; I came to ask if you will ride this afternoon,as we are getting up a small party.""Yes, thank you, I should like it dearly, it iisuch a lovely day. But how soon do you start ?"" As soon as the ladies can be ready. The horseswill be at the door in a very few moments."" Ah ! then I must go and prepare," she said, ris-ing and sailing out of the room.Mr. Dinsmore took the seat she had vacated, and,passing his arm round his little girl, said to her inan undertone, " My little daughter must not be so fool-ish as to believe that people mean all they say to her;for some persons talk in a very thoughtless way, and,without perhaps intending to be exactly untruthful,say a great deal that they really do not mean. And1 should be sorry, indeed, to see my little girl sospoiled by all this silly flattery as to grow up con-ceited and vain.She looked at him with her own sweet, innocentsmile, free from the slightest touch of vanity." No, papa," she said, " I do not mind, when people<pb n="317"/>ELSIE DINSMORE.               317say such things, because I know the Bible says,' Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain;' and in another place, ' He that flattereth his neighbor spreadetha net for his feet.' So I will try to keep away fromthat lady; shall I not, papa ?""Whenever you can do so without rude-ness, daughter;" and he moved away, thinking tohimself, "How   strangely the teachings of thatbook seem to preserve my child from every evil in-fluence."A sigh escaped him. There was lurking within hibreast a vague consciousness that her father neededsuch a safeguard, but had'it not.Lucy, who was standing at the window, turnedquickly round." Come, girls," she said, " let us run out and seethem off; they're bringing up the horses. And see!there's Miss Adelaide in her riding-dress and cap;how pretty she looks! And there's that Miss Ste-vens coming out now; hateful thing! I can't bearher! Come, Elsie and Carry!"And she ran out, Caroline and Elsie following.Elsie, however, went no further than the hall, whereshe stood still at the foot of the stairs."Come, Elsie," called the other two from  tleportico, " come out here."" No," replied the little girl, " I cannot come without something round me. Papa says it is too cold furme to be out in the wind to-day with my neck andarms bare."<pb n="318"/>318           ELSIE DINSMIORE." Pooh! nonsense !" said Lucy, "'tain't a bit cold,do come now.""No, Lucy, I must obey my father," Elsie answer-ed in a very pleasant but no less decided tone.Some one caught her round the waist and liftedher up." Oh! papa," she exclaimed, " I did not know youwere there ! I wish I was going too; I don't like tohave you go without me."" I wish you were, my pet; I always love to haveyou with me: but you know it wouldn't do; youhave your little guests to entertain. Good-by, dar-ling. Don't go out in the s4ld."He kissed her, as he always did now, when leav-ing her even for an hour or two, and set her down.The little girls watched until the last of the partyhad disappeared down the avenue, and then rangayly up-stairs to Elsie's room, where they busiedthemselves until tea-time in various little preparationsfor the evening, such as dressing dolls, and tying upbundles of confectionery, etc., to be hung upon theChristmas-tree.The children had all noticed that the doors of aparlor opening into the drawing-room had been closedsince morning to all but a favored few, who passed inand out, with an air of mystery and importance,and generally laden with some odd-looking bundlewhen going in, which they invariably left behind oncoming out again, and many a whispered consulta-tion had been held as to what was probably going<pb n="319"/>ELSIE DINSMORE     .           319on in there. Elsie and Carry seemed to be in thesecret, but only smiled and shook their heads wiselywhen questioned.But at length tea being over, and all, both old andyoung, assembled as if by common consent in thedrawing-room, it began to be whispered about thattheir curiosity was now on the point of being gratified.All were immediately on the qui vive, and everyface brightened with mirth and expectation; andwhen, a moment after, the doors were thrown open,there was a universal burst of applause.A large Christmas-tree had been set up at thefurther end of the room, and, with its myriad oflighted tapers, and its load of toys and bonbons,interspersed with many a richer and more costly gift,made quite a display."Beautiful! beautiful! " cried the children, clap-ping their hands and dancing about with delight;while their elders, perhaps equally pleased, expressedtheir admiration after a more staid and sober fashion.When they thought their handiwork had been suf-ficiently admired, Mrs. Dinsmore and Adelaide ap-proached the tree and began the pleasant task of dis-tributing the gifts.Everything was labelled, and each, as his or hername was called out, stepped forward to receive thepresent.No one had been forgotten; each had somethingand almost every one had several pretty presents.Marv Leslie and little Flora Arnott were mad, per<pb n="320"/>320            ELSIE DI.S.tORPE.fectly happy with wax dolls that could open and shuttheir eyes; Caroline Howard received a gold chainfrom her mamma, and a pretty pin from Elsie; Lucy,a set of coral ornaments, besides several smallerpresents; and others were equally fortunate. All wasmirth and hilarity; only one clouded face to be seen,and that belonged to Enna, who was pouting in a cornerbecause Mary Leslie's doll was a little larger than hers.Elsie had already received a pretty bracelet fromher aunt Adelaide, a needle-case from Lora, and seve-ral little gifts from her young guests, and was justbeginning to wonder what had become of her papa'spromised present, when she heard her name again, andAdelaide, turning to her with a pleased look, slippeda most beautiful diamond ring on her finger."From   your papa," she said. "Go and thankhim; it is well worth it."Elsie sought him out where he stood alone in acorner, an amused spectator of the merry scene." See, papa," she said, holding up her hand. " Ithink it very beautiful; thank you, dear papa, thankyou very much."" Does it please you, my darling " he asked, stoop.ing to press a kiss on the little upturned face, sobright and happy."Yes, papa, I think it is lovely! the very prettiestring I ever saw.""Yet I think there is something else you wouldhave liked better; is there not? "he asked, lookingsearchingly into her face.<pb n="321"/>ELSIE DIVNSMORE.               321"Dear papa, I like it very much; I would ratherhave it than anything else on the tree.""Still you have not answered my question," hesaid, with a smile, as he sat down and drew her tohis side, adding in a playful tone, " Come, I am notgoing to put up with any evasion; tell me truly ifyou would have preferred something else, and if sowhat it is."Elsie blushed and looked down; then raising hereyes, and seeing with what a tender, loving glance hewas regarding her, she took courage to say, "Yes,papa, there is one thing I would have liked better,and that is your miniature."To her surprise he looked highly pleased at herreply, and giving her another kiss, said, " Well, dar-ling, some day you shall have it.""Mr. Horace Dinsmore," called Adelaide, takingsome small, glittering object from the tree."Another present for me ? " he asked, as Waltelcame running with it.He had already received several, from his fatherand sisters, but none had seemed to give him halfthe pleasure that this did when he saw that it waslabelled, " From his little daughter."It was only a gold pencil. The miniature-withwhich the artist had succeeded so well that nothingcould have been prettier except the original herself-she had reserved to be given in another way." Do you like it, papa ?" she asked, her face glow.ing with delight to see how pleased he was.<pb n="322"/>322            ELSIE DINSMORE." Yes, darling, very much; and I shall always think-f my little girl when I use it."" Keep it in your pocket, and use it every day, won'tyou, papa ? "" Yes, my pet, I will; but I thought you said youhad no present for me ?"" Oh ! no, no, papa; I said there was none for youamongst those bundles. I had bought this, but hadgiven it to Aunt Adelaide to take care of, for fear youmight happen to see it.""Ah! that was it, ch?" and he laughed andstroked her hair." Here, Elsie, here is your bundle of candy," saiaWalter, running up to them again. " Everybody haone, and that is yours, Adelaide says."He put it in her hand, and ran away again. Elsielooked up in her father's face inquiringly." No, darling," he said, taking the paper from heihand and examining its contents, "not to-night: tomorrow, after breakfast, you may eat the cream-candy and the rock, but none of the others; they are col-ored, and very unwholesome." " Won't you eat some, papa ?" she asked with win-ning sweetness."No, dearest," he said; "for though I, too, amfond of sweet things, I will not eat them while I re.fuse them to you."" Do, papa," she urged, " it would give me pleasureto see you enjoying it."" No, darling, I will wait until to-m orrow, too."<pb n="323"/>ELSIE DIMSVrOIiE.             323"Then please keep it for me until to-morrow, papa,will you ?""Yes," he said, putting it in his pocket; and then,as 'he gifts had all been distributed, and the little folkswere in high glee, a variety of sports were com-menced by them, in which some of their elders alsotook a part; and thus the hours sped away so rap-idly that Elsie was very much surprised when herfather called her to go to bed."Is it half-past nine already, papa ?" she asked."It is ten, my dear child, and high time you werein bed," he said, smiling at her look of astonishment."I hope you have enjoyed yourself.""Oh ! so much, papa.

But Chloe presently stole softlybehind her chair, and, holding up high above her headsome glittering object attached to a pretty gold chain,let it gradually descend until it rested upon the openbook.Elsie started and jumped up with an exclamationof surprise."Wonder if you knows dat gen'leman, darlin' "laughed Chloe." Oh I it is papa," cried the little girl, catching itm her hand, " my own dear, darling papa! oh! howgood of him to give it to me !

"Dear, dear, darling papa! " and she kissedIt again and again.Then gently drawing her mother's miniature fromher bosom, she laid them side by side."My papa and mamma; are they not beautiful,mammy? both of them?" she asked, raising hel<pb n="327"/>ELSIE DINSMORK.              327swimming eyes to the dusky face leaning over her,and gazing with such mournful fondness at the sweetgirlish countenance, so life-like and beautiful, yetfalling up thoughts of sorrrow and bereavement.My darling young missus I " murmured the oldnurse, "my own precious chile dat dese arms habcarried so many years, dis ole heart like to breakwheneber I tinks ob you, an' 'members how yourbright young face done gone away foreber."The big tears were rolling fast down the sablecheeks, and dropping like rain on Elsie's curls, whilethe broad bosom heaved with sobs. " But your olemammy's been good to your little chile dat you lef'behind, darlin', 'deed she has," she went on."Yes, mammy, indeed, indeed you have," Elsiesaid, twining her arms lovingly around her.

He gave mea little this morning, but said I must not have anymore for a long time.""Now, that is quite too bad," exclaimed MissStevens, " but at least take one or two, child; thatmuch couldn't possibly hart you, and your papa neednever know."Elsie gave her a look of grieved surprise."Oh ! could you think I would do that ?" she said." But God would know, Miss Stevens; and I shouldknow it myself, and how could I ever look my papain the face again after deceiving him so ?""Really, my dear, you are making a very seriousmatter of a mere trifle," laughed the lady; "why, Ihave deceived my father more than fifty times, andnever thought it any harm.

I love books and pic-tures, too, and these are lovely engravings," she added,turning over the leaves with undisguised pleasure."Yes, and the stories are right pretty, too," re-marked Miss Stevens."Yes, ma'am, they look as if they were, and Ishould like dearly to read them.""Well, dear, just sit down and read; there'snothing to hinder. I'm sure your little friends cando without you for an hour or two. Or, if you preferit, take the book and enjoy it with them; it is yourown, you know, to use as you like."<pb n="331"/>ELSIE DINSMlORE.             331" Thank you, ma'am; but, though I can look at thepictures, I must not read the stories until I haveasked papa, because he does not allow me to readanything now without first showing it to him.""Dear me ! how very strict he is !" exclaimed MissStevens." I wonder," she thought to herself, " if he wouldexpect to domineer over his wife in that style ? "Elsie was slowly turning over the leaves of thebook, enjoying the pictures very much, studyingthem intently, but resolutely refraining from evenglancing over the printed pages. But at length sheclosed it, and, looking out of the window, said, with aslight sigh, " Oh! I wish papa would come; butI'm afraid he won't for a long while, and I do sowant to read these stories.""Suppose you let me read one to you," suggestedMiss Stevens: "that would not be your reading it,you know."Elsie looked shocked at the proposal. " Oh ! no,ma'am, thank you, I know you mean to be kind;but I could not do it; it would be so very wrong;quite the same, I am sure, as if I read it with my owneyes," she answered hurriedly; and then, fearing tobe tempted further, she excused herself and wentin search of her young companions.She found them in the drawing-room." Wasn't it too provoking, Elsie, that those peopledidn't send home my bracelet last nightS " ex-claimed Caroline Howard. ' I have just been telling1 *<pb n="332"/>332            ELSIE DlNMSHORE.Lucy about it. I think that it was such a shame forthem to disappoint me, for I wanted to have it onthe tree.""I am sorry you were disappointed, Carry, butperhaps it will come to-day," Elsie answered in asympathizing tone. And then she showed the newbook, which she still held in her hand.They spent some time in examining it, talkingabout and admiring the pictures, and then went outfor a walk."Has papa come in yet, mammy ," was Elsie'sfirst question on returning." Yes, darlin', I tink he's in the drawin'-room disberry minute," Chloe answered, as she took off thelittle girl's hat, and carefully smoothed her hair." There, there ! mammy, won't that do now ? I'min a little bit of a hurry," Elsie said with a merrylittle laugh, as she slipped playfully from under hernurse's hand, and ran down-stairs.But she was doomed to disappointment for thepresent, for her papa was seated on the sofa, besideMiss Stevens, talking to her; and so she must wait alittle longer. At last, however, he rose, went to theother side of the room, and stood a moment lookingout of the window.Then Elsie hastened to take her book from a table,where she had laid it, and going up to him, said,"Papa!"He turned round instantly, asking in a pleasanttone, " We11, daughter; what is it ,"<pb n="333"/>ELSIE DINSMOR.                 333She put the book into his hand, saying eagerly"It is a Christmas gift from Miss Stevens, papa; willyou let me read it? "He did not answer immediately, but turned overthe leaves, glancing rapidly over page after page,but not too rapidly to be able to form a pretty cor-rect idea of the contents."No, daughter," he said, handing it back to her,"you must content yourself with looking at the pic-tures; they are by far the best part; the stories arevery unsuitable for a little girl of your age, andwould, indeed, be unprofitable reading for anyone."She looked a little disappointed." I am glad I can trust my little daughter, and feelcertain that she will not disobey me," he said, smil-ing kindly on her, and patting her cheek.She answered him with a bright, happy look, full ofconfiding affection, laid the book away without amurmur, and left the room-her father's eyes follow-ing her with a fond, loving glance.Miss Stevens, who had watched them both closelyduring this little scene, bit her lips with vexation atthe result of her manceuvre.She had come to Roselands with the fixed determination to lay siege to Mr. Horace Dinsmore'sheart, and flattering and petting his little daughterwas one of her modes of attack; but his decideddisapproval of her present, she perceived, did notaugur well for the success of her schemes. She wasM* 2<pb n="334"/>334            ELSIE DISSMORE.by no means in despair, however, for she had greatconfidence in the power of her own personal attractions, being really tolerably pretty, and consideringherself a great beauty, as well as very highly accom-plished.As Elsie ran out into the hall, she found herselfsuddenly caught in Mr. Travilla's arms." ' A merry Christmas and a happy New Year !'little Elsie," he said, kissing her on both cheeks.'Now I have caught you figuratively and literally,my little lady, so what are you going to give me,eh? "" Indeed, sir, I think you've helped yourself to theonly thing I have to give at present," she answeredwith a merry silvery laugh." Nay, give me one, little lady," said he, " one suchhug and kiss as I dare say your father gets half-a-dozen times in a day."She gave it very heartily."Ah! I wish you were ten years older," he saidas he set her down." If I had been, you wouldn't have got the kiss,"she replied, smiling archly."Now, it's my turn," he said, taking somethingfrom his pocket."I expected you'd catch me, and so thought itbest to come prepared."He took her hand, as he spoke, and placed abeautiful little gold thimble on her finger. "There,that's to encourage you in industry."<pb n="335"/>ELSIE DINS2MONE.              335" Thank you, sir; oh ! it's a little beauty ! I mustrun and show it to papa. But I must not forget mypoliteness," she added, hastily throwing open thedrawing-room door. " Come in, Mr. Travilla."She waited quietly until the usual greetings wereexchanged, then went up to her father and showedher new gift.He quite entered into her pleasure, and remarked,with a glance at Miss Stevens, "that her friendswere very kind."The lady's hopes rose. He was then pleased withher attention to his child, even though he did notaltogether approve her choice of a gift.There was a large party to dinner that day, andthe children came down to the dessert. Miss Stevens,who had contrived to be seated next to Mr. Dinsmore,made an effort, on the entrance of the juveniles, tohave Elsie placed on her other side; but Mr. Travillawas too quick for her, and had his young favorite oihis knee before she could gain her attention.The lady was disappointed,and Elsie herself only halfsatisfied; but the two gentlemen, who thoroughly un-derstood Miss Stevens and saw through all her manceu-vres, exchanged glances of amusement and satisfaction.After dinner Mr. Travilla invited Elsie, Carry, Lucy,and Mary, to take a ride in his carriage, which invi-tation was joyfully accepted by all-Mr. Dinsmoregiving a ready consent to Elsie's request to be per-mitted to go.They had a very merry time, for Mr. Travilla quite<pb n="336"/>336            ELSIE DINSiORE.laid himself out for their entertainment, and no oneknew better than he how to amuse ladies of their age.It was nearly dark when they returned, and Elsiowent at once to her room to be dressed for the evening.But she found it unoccupied-Aunt Chloe, as it after-terward appeared, having gone down to the quarterto carry some of the little girl's gifts to one or twowho were too old and feeble to come up to the houseto receive them.Elsie rang the bell, waited a little, and then, feelingimpatient to be dressed, ran down to the kitchen tcsee what had become of her nurse.A very animated discussion was going on there,just at that moment, between the cook and two orthree of her sable companions, and the first wordsthat reached the child's ears, as she stood on the thresh-old, were, " I tell you, you ole darkie, you dunnonuffin' 'bout it! Massa Horace gwine marry dat bitob paint an' finery! no such ting!    Massa's gotmore sense."The words were spoken in a most scornful tone,and Elsie, into whose childish mind the possibilityDf her father's marrying again had never entered,stood spellbound with astonishment.But the conversation went on, the speakers quiteunconscious of her vicinity.It was Pompey's voice that replied."Ef Marse Horace don't like her, what for theybeen gwine ridin' ebery afternoon ? avill you tell medat, darkies ? an' don't dis niggah see him sit beside<pb n="337"/>ELSIE DINSHORBE.              337her mornin', noon, an' night, laughin' an' talkin' at detable an' in de parlor ? an' don't she keep a kissinlittle Miss Elsie, an' callin' her pretty critter, sweetcritter, an' de like ?"" She ma to our sweet little Miss Elsie ! Bah ! 1tell you, Pomp, Marse Horace got more sense," re-turned the cook, indignantly."Aunt Chloe don't'blieve no such stuff," put in an-other voice; " she says Marse Horace couldn't putsuch trash in her sweet young mistis's place."" Aunt Chloe's a berry fine woman, no doubt," oh.served Pomp disdainfully, "but I reckon MarspHorace ain't gwine to infide his matcrmonical inten-tions to her; and I consider it quite consequentialon Marster's being young and handsome that hewill take another wife."The next speaker said something about his havinglived a good while without, and though Miss Ste-vens was setting her cap, may be he wouldn't becaught. But Elsie only gathered the sense of it,hardly heard the words, and, bounding away like afrightened deer to her own room, her little heartbeating wildly with a coniused sense of suffering, shethrew herself on the bed. She shed no tears, butthere was, oh ! such a weight on her heart, such a ter-rible though vague sense of the instability of allearthly happiness.There Chloe found her, and wondered much whatailed her darling, what made her so silent, and yetso restless, and caused such a deep flush on her<pb n="338"/>338            ELSIE DIySHfORE.cheek. She feared she was feverish, her little handwas so hot and dry; but Elsie insisted that shewas quite well, and so Chloe tried to think it was onlyfatigue.She would fain have persuaded the little girl to liestill upon her bed and rest, and let her tea be broughtto her there; but Elsie answered that she wouldmuch rather be dressed, and join her young com-panions in the nursery. They, too, wondered whatailed her, she was so very quiet and ate almost noth-ing at all.  They asked if she was sick. She onlyshook her head. "Was she tired, then ?"     "Yes,she believed she was," and she leaned her headwearily on her hand.But, indeed, most of the party seemed dull; theyhad gone through such a round of pleasure and ex.citement, for the last two or three days, that now areaction wasi eginning, and th'ey wanted rest, es,peci&. y the very little ones, who all retired quiteearly, when Elsie and her mates joined their parentsin the drawing-room.Elsie looked eagerly around for her father, themoment she entered the room. IIe was beside MissStevens, who was at the piano, performing a verydifficult piece of music. Hle was leaning over her,turning the leaves, and apparently listening withA great deal of pleasure, for she was really a finemutician.Elsie felt sick at heart at the sight-although a fewhours before it would have given her no concern-<pb n="339"/>ELSIE DlVSiOREi.              33.and found it very difficult to listen to and answerthe remarks Mrs. Carrington was making to herabout her Christmas presents, and the nice ride theyhad had that afternoon.Mr. Travilla was watching her; he had noticed, assoon as she came in, the sad and troubled look whichhad come over her face, and, following the glance ofher eyes, he guessed at the cause.He knew there was no danger of the trial thatshe feared, and would have been glad to tell her so;but he felt that it was too delicate a subject for himto venture on; it might seem too much like med-dlingo in Mr. Dinsmore's affairs. But he did thenext best thing-got the four little girls into acorner, and tried to entertain them with stories andcharades.Elsie seemed interested for a time, but every nowand then her eyes would wander to the other sideof the room, where her father still stood listening toMiss Stevens' music.At length Mr. Travilla was called away to give hisopinion about some tableaux the young ladies werearranging; and Elsie, knowing it was her usual timefor retiring, and not caring to avail herself of herfather's permission to stay up until nine o'clock,stole quietly away to her room unobserved by anyone, and feeling as if Miss Stevens had already robbedher of her father.She wiped away a few quiet tears, as she went,and wqs very silent and sad, while her mammy was<pb n="340"/>a340           ELSIE DINStOOBE.preparing her for bed. She hardly knew how to dowithout her good-night kiss, but feeling as she did,it had seemed quite impossible to ask for it whileMiss Stevens was so near him.When she knelt down to pray, she became paintCully conscious that a feeling of positive dislike toIhat lady had been creeping into her heart, and sheasked earnestly to be enabled to put it away. But sheprayed, also, that she might be spared the trial thatshe feared, if God's will were so; and she thoughtsurely it was because she had found out that MissStevens was not good, not truthful, nor sincere." Perhaps dear papa will come to say good-nightbefore I am asleep," she murmured to herself as,calmed and soothed by thus casting her burden onthe Lord, she laid her head upon her pillow.He, however, had become interested in the subjectof the tableaux, aud did not miss his little girl untWthe sound of the clock striking ten reminded him other, and he looked around expecting to see her stillin the room; but, not seeing her, he asked Lucy Car-ington where she was." Oh!" said Lucy, "she's been gone these twohours, I should think! I guess she must have goneto bed."" Strange that she did not come to bid me good'night," he exclaimed in a low tone, more as if thinkingaloud than speaking to Lucy.He hastily left the room.Mr. Travilla followed.<pb n="341"/>ELSIE DINSlMORE.              341"Dinsmore," said he.Mr. Dinsmore stopped, and Travilla, drawing himto one side, said in an undertone, " I think my littlefriend is in trouble to-night."" Ah ! " he exclaimed, with a startled look, " whatcan it be ? I did not hear of any accident-she hasnot been hurt ? is not sick ? tell me, Travilla, quickly,if anything ails my child."" Nothing, nothing, Dinsmore, only you know ser-vants will talk, and children have ears, and eyes, too,sometimes, and I saw her watching you to-night with'a very sad expression."" Nonsense !"  exclaimed Mr. Dinsmore, growmg very red and looking extremely vexed; "Iwouldn't have had such thoughts put into the child'shead for any money.    Are you sure of it, Tra-villa ?""I am sure she was watching you very closelyto-night, and looking very miserable."" Poor darling!" murmured the father. "Thankyou, Travilla," shaking his friend heartily by the hand."Good night; I shall not be down again if you willbe so good as to excuse me to the others."And he went up the stairs almost at a bound, andthe next moment was standing beside his sleepingchild, looking anxiously down at the little flushedcheeks and tear-swollen eyes, for, disappointed thathe did not come to bid her good night, she had criedherself to sleep."Poor darling " he murmured again, as he stoop<pb n="342"/>342            7ELSIE JJINSMORE.ed over her and kissed away a tear that still trem-bled on her eyelash.He longed to tell her that all her fears weregroundless, and that none other could ever fill herplace in his heart, but he did not like to wakeher, and so, pressing another light kiss on hercheek, he left her to dream on unconscious of hisvisit,THE END.BRADBUJY, AGNEW, & CO.

GILBIaS, I.A., AMD AI, E. EDWARDS." Grace Aguilar wrote and spoke as one inspired; she condensed and spiritualizedand all her thoughts and feelings were steeped in the essence of celestial love andtruth. To those who really knew Grace Aguilar, all eulogium falls short of herdeserts, and she has left a blank in her particular walk of literature, which weawer expect to see filled up."-Pilgrimages to English Shrines, by Mrs. Hall."A clever and interesting tale, corresponding well to its name, illustrating thesilent, constant influence of a wise and affectionate parent, over characters themost diverse."-Christian Lady's Magazine."This interesting volume unquestionably contains many valuable hints ondomestic education, much powerful writing, and a moral of vast importance."-Englishwomas's Magazine."It is very pleasant, after reading a book, to speak of it in terms of high com-mendation. The tale before us is an admirable one, and is executed with taste andability. The language is beautiful and appropriate; the analysis of character isskilful and varied. The work ought to be in the hands of all who are interested inthe proper training of the youthful mind."-Palladium."In reviewing this work, we hardly know what words in the English languageare strong enough to express the admiration we have felt in its perusal."-BuckdChronicle." The object and end of the writings of Grace Aguilar were to improve the heart,and to lead her readers to the consideration of higher motives and objects thanthis world can ever afford."-Bell's Weekly Messenger."'Home Influence' will not be forgotten by any who have perused it."-Critie."A well-known and valuable tale."-Gentleman's Magazine."A work which possesses an extraordinary amount of influence to elevate thesind and educate the heart, by showing that rectitude and virtue conduce no lessto material prosperity, and worldly comfort and happiness, than to the satisfactionof the conscience, the approval of the good, and the kt'ue and certainty of blisshereafter."-F-erts County Press.(Cheaper Editions, Crown 8vo., Cloth, 3s.

Her aims are eminently moral, and her cause comes recommended by themost beautiful associations. These, connected with the skill here evinced in theirdevelopment, ensure the success of her labours."-Illustrated News."As a writer of remarkable gracr and delicacy, she devoted herself to theInculcation of the virtues, more cape _ly those which are the peculiar charm otwomen."-Critic." It is a book for all classes of readers; and we have no hesitation in saying, thatIt only requires to be generally known to become exceedingly popular.

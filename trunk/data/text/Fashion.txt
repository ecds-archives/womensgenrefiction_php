OUT OF THE FASHION.
CHAPTER I.
<p>THERE is an old-fashioned square in a very central part of Bayswater, which, for some reason, is no longer considered a desirable place of residence by the fashionable world. It is difficult to account for the unpopularity of Rosemary Gardens, for the place combines many distinct advantages. Its situation can scarcely be surpassed; it is on high ground; its soil is gravel; its aspect bright; it is within a few minutes' walk of Kensington Gardens. Omnibuses pass its select and peaceful gates, and the Metropolitan Railway is within a stone's throw from its houses.</p><p>The place is as central and convenient as a place can be; it has also another advantage: it is quiet. Close to the war and traffic of
<pb n="2     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
the great city, in one of the houses in Rosemary Gardens you may lie down and sleep without being disturbed by a sound. The houses themselves are large, well-planned, and convenient; the house-rents also are very moderate. Still the place is not popular. Many of these palatial houses stand empty; almost all bear marks of seediness and decay.</p><p>No. 80 Rosemary Gardens was, perhaps, the sole exception to the universal rule. Three or four years before this story opens it had been redecorated and lightened. White paint was substituted for dark; windows were opened in unexpected corners; delicate papers graced the walls; and flowers filled the wide, spacious balconies.</p><p>Then a family arrived, and took possession of the restored mansion. This family consisted of a father and four girls. The girls were all young, but not too young, for the youngest even had stepped out of her childhood, and, when the family took possession of No. 80, was over fourteen years of age. The eldest girl was twenty. They were
<pb n="3     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
pleasant girls to look at, and their names were agreeable to say. Margaret was the name of the eldest; Kitty came next; then Betty; then Sibyl. Ross was the surname of the family. The girls were educated according to the fashion of their times. They were up-to-date girls, without being fast. They were learned, without being in any sense of the word bluestockings. They were all four of them merry, unaffected creatures, and the house had a gay time when they came into it.</p><p> Margaret was twenty at this time, and she was very glad to take the lead, and to give her sisters a good time. The girls had been motherless since Sibyl was a baby. Since then they had been under the care of many tutors and guardians. Two of them had finished their education in Germany. One had studied art in one of the best studios in Paris. Sibyl, who was by many considered the cleverest of the family, had lived with an aunt, and received her education at the nearest high school.</p>
<pb n="4     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
But now they all met in London, and Margaret found herself the mistress of a mansion.</p>
<p>"You shall all do exactly as you please, girls," said their father. "Only Margaret shall be head. That is the only restriction I put upon you three younger ones. Margaret must housekeep, and in times of perplexity hers must be the casting vote."</p>
<p>"Who minds that?" said Kitty, her dark eyes flashing. "Who could object to being guided by this dear, gentle old Meg of ours?"</p><p>The little conversation was taking place at the breakfast table; and Kitty, who was boisterous in her movements, upset a cup and saucer, and spilt its contents over the board, in her efforts to stretch across to Margaret to embrace her.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross was like his eldest daughter, quiet in his ways, and undemonstrative. He sighed gently over Kitty, and Margaret also sighed, but neither of them reproved her: it was not their way.</p>
<pb n="5     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>The little household, thus brought together, passed three or four years of uninterrupted sunshine. The girls did not go exactly into society, but they saw many friends both at home and abroad. Other girls came to the house, and other girls brought their brothers with them, and the brothers, as they got intimate, their young men friends. So that altogether life at the Rosses' was very cheerful and very young.</p><p>The house was capable in itself of receiving any amount of sunshine. The rooms, with their great balconies, and large windows, and light decoration, would reflect back light, not absorb it. And when music and song sounded in the drawing-room, and gay girls trooped out on the balconies, and laughing, cheerful sounds floated down to the streets below, the other inhabitants of Rosemary Gardens used to stop on their way home to their own dismal abodes, and wonder what had come to No. 80, and why life was so festive there.</p><p>That old story in the Bible of the years of
<pb n="6     OUT OF 'THE FASHIION."/>
plenty followed by the years of famine has, to a certain extent, become typical of life, and these four girls, who looked as if no shadow could ever touch them, were not to be excepted from the universal lot. The shadow which was to darken their present brightness came on very slowly, and, strange to say, Kitty was the first to notice it.</p><p>"Margaret," she said to her sister, one evening, "do you ever observe anything queer about father?"</p><p>The girls were standing on the balcony when she spoke. The two younger ones had gone to bed, for it was past midnight, and they were tired after a long evening devoted to the entertainment of many guests. When the last visitor had departed, however, Margaret had stepped on the balcony to cool her hot cheeks, and Kitty had followed her.</p><p>"Do you notice anything queer about father?" asked Kitty, a momentary terror filling her bright eyes, as she glanced at her sister.</p>
<pb n="7     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>"No, nothing," replied Margaret. "What do you mean, Kit?"</p><p>"I don't know, Maggie. I expect I am all wrong, as you have never observed anything. But he does look pale and sighs very often, and he does not eat much."</p><p>"I have not noticed it," replied Margaret.</p><p>"Then it must be my fancy," answered Kitty.</p><p>She leant over the heavy iron rail of the balcony, and looked into the gardens in the middle of the square. They were *common-place gardens, with the usual tennis court--a somewhat badly-kept one--in their midst. But now the moon was beautifying the grass, and casting a strange, magic light over the stunted London trees, and Kitty, who possessed a really artistic soul, sighed for pleasure.</p><p>"I am sleepy," she said presently. " *Good-night, Meg."</p><p>Margaret offered her cheek to be kissed, and Kitty went into the drawing-room. Margaret heard her singing the gay refrain
<pb n="8     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
of a song as she tripped across the room. Margaret was not romantic, nor had her artistic tendencies been in any way developed. She looked into the moonlit garden, and was not conscious of any sense of admiration as she gazed at it. Presently she, too, went back into the drawing-room, and, closing the heavy window, bolted it across.</p><p>Margaret was a very considerate young mistress, and the servants had all, before this, gone to bed. She put out the gas, and leaving the drawing-room took up her chamber candlestick to go to her room.</p><p>As she did so Kitty's words came back to her with a painful, queer insistence.</p><p>"Father looks pale; he sighs; he does not eat."</p><p>"Folly!" muttered Margaret. "Surely if there was anything wrong, my father would tell me. I have noticed nothing. Well, I shall watch him to-morrow."</p><p>She went half-way up the stairs to her room, when again the memory of the teasing words came back to her. And now she saw
<pb n="9     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
a picture of her father rise up quite clear and distinct before her. It was a faded picture, and gave Margaret a queer, lonely sense of something intensely pathetic.<p>"That little goose of a Kitty!" she said. "What has the child done to me with her morbid notions? I positively can't rest until I see into this matter. I must go downstairs, and find out if father is still up."</p><p>She leant over the banisters, and saw that the light was still burning in the entrance hall. Then she tripped downstairs, and a moment later was knocking at her father's study door.</p><p>Mr. Ross bade her enter; he looked astonished when he saw her. He had been walking up and down his room, and now he stopped, and looked at Margaret in a harassed way, as if her presence distressed him. This was not at all his usual expression, but it fastened the arrow of conviction at once into Margaret's heart. She saw that Kitty was right.</p>
<pb n="10     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>Her manner was particularly gentle as she went up to her father.</p><p>"You know you are doing very wrong," she said. "You ought not to be up at this hour. You are tired; you are cold--your hands feel like ice."</p><p>"I am not really tired, Maggie," said Mr. Ross. He had quite recovered his ordinary manner now. "You cannot expect old folks never to wish to be quiet and alone. Yes, of course, it is different with you, my dear, and glad I am to think it. You can't have too much life, and mirth, and fun. But old people don't want to sleep as much as the young do, and in short, my dear Margaret, I like to walk up and down my study when the house is absolutely quiet. If I give you and your sisters full liberty, my dear child, it is not too much to ask you to do the same for me."</p><p>"Then you are vexed with me for coming down," said Margaret.</p><p>Kitty would not have said this; but then Margaret was never remarkable for tact.</p>
<pb n="11     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>"No, my dear; I am not vexed," said Mr. Ross. "You have never done anything to cause me real vexation, my dear Margaret."</p><p>Here he came over, and, bending down, kissed Margaret on her forehead.</p><p>"I think you are happy," he continued; "you and your sisters! You all seem very happy."</p><p>"Yes, father; we are perfectly happy."</p><p>"How many years have we been together in this house?"</p><p>Margaret looked up, surprised at the question.</p><p>"We have been here over four years," she said. "Sibyl was fourteen then--she is eighteen now."</p><p>"And you are twenty-four, Margaret?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"You have had four happy years," said Mr. Ross. "That is something--every girl can't say that. Your mother told me she never knew perfect happiness until she was my wife. But you have all had sunny *girl-hoods, my dear. And then the future--a
<pb n="12     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
woman has many possibilities in the future! Now, Margaret, you have disturbed my meditations, and, as I begin to feel sleepy, I shall set you an excellent example by going to bed."
*<pb n="[13]"/>
CHAPTER II.
<p>THIS was the beginning of the shadow which, by and by, grew dark, as such heavy clouds will. This night and this conversation were the beginning of the subtle change which overthrew the household, and caused a moral earthquake, and the upheaval of all old customs.</p><p>But the shadow came on slowly, and the great crash did not occur until nearly a year after Margaret had intruded upon her father's midnight meditations.</p><p>It was early summer now again, and the four girls sat in solemn conclave. There were no visitors in the house this day, and the four had the big drawing-room to themselves.</p><p>"I can't stand it any longer," said Sibyl, who was decidedly the most spoilt member of the household. "I don't know what you mean to do, Betty, and Kitty, and *Mar-
<pb n="14     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
garet, but I call it immoral to go on like this."</p><p>"Yes, Sib, storm away!" said Kitty, "what's up, now? For four years we lived in this house, and had no rows, and now there are three or four a week! Go on, Sib; what has struck horror to your righteous and most moral soul?"</p><p>"Oh! I can't help it," said Sibyl. "You are unkind, Kitty. You make fun of everything; but this is no laughing matter--it isn't, really. It's about the baker."</p><p>Here Sibyl swept across the room, and, flinging herself on Margaret's neck, burst into a passion of weeping.</p><p>"I have kept it in all day," she said, " but I must let it out now, or I shall choke. And, oh! it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so immoral, and it's so cruel of Kitty to laugh."</p><p>"I'm not laughing any longer, Sib," said the repentant Kitty.</p><p>"Hush, darling, dry your eyes, and tell us what is the matter," whispered Betty. "It
<pb n="15     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
can't be worse than the dressmaker affair of
yesterday," she murmured, <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi>.</p><p>Margaret did not speak at all, but she
passed her arm in a wonderfully comforting
way round Sibyl's slight waist.</p><p>"Now, what is it?" repeated Kitty. "Out
with the grievance, Sibyl--don't keep us in
suspense."</p><p>Sibyl raised her head from Margaret's
breast, dashed the thunder drops from her
eyes, and began emphatically:</p><p>
"You don't suppose I trudged over to the
Stores to fetch those horrid cakes for noth-
ing," she said. "The children were coming,
twenty of them. You know how children
will eat. You know I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to go--I could
not help myself."</p><p>"But our own baker is much nearer
than the Stores," interposed Margaret gently.</p><p>Sibyl turned, and almost sprang upon her.</p><p>"That's it, Meg--that's the immorality of
it--and, oh! it isn't the poor baker's fault,
for he has got ten children, and an ailing
<pb n="16     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
wife. I don't blame him--he has got to look after himself, of course he has."</p><p>"I wondered why the cake I ordered did not come," said Margaret. "I ordered a specially large one, which cook was to frost. I wondered to see all those small cakes and tarts on the table."</p><p>"I wouldn't tell you until the party was over, Meg. You gave me leave to arrange it, and I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have you worried. The fact is, Margaret, and Kitty, and Betty, the baker refused to make the cake until his bill was paid. Poor baker! And aren't we an immoral family?"</p><p>The other three girls looked at one an- other. They uttered no exclamations of astonishment, but they exchanged glances full of meaning. Sibyl, having delivered herself of her story, walked across the room, and hid her burning face against the velvet curtain, which cozily draped the window.</p><p>"You did bravely, Sib," said Kitty at last. "And so you spent your own money on all those cakes and tarts! Poor, generous Sib!"</p>
<pb n="17     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>"There's my purse--it's empty!" said Sibyl.</p><p>She opened it disdainfully, and tossed it on the floor.</p><p>" Well!" said Kitty, in an emphatic voice.</p><p>Nobody echoed her "Well!" She had a brightly-colored face, and now her cheeks became damask.</p><p>"There's the butcher, too, and the dressmaker," Betty began, looking at Margaret.</p><p>"Oh, hush, Betty!" said Margaret.</p><p>It was now Kitty's turn to take up the defensive.</p><p>"Why should Betty hush?" she said. "We have all known this thing for a long time in our hearts, and we have been afraid to speak of it. Sibyl is quite right; it's positively immoral of us to keep silence any longer. Come away from the window, and let's get each of us into our own cozy chair, and thresh the matter out. Come, Sib, you know you like the softest cushions; here you are."</p><p>"There's no manner of use," said Margaret. "But, of course, girls, if you wish--"</p>
<pb n="18     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>"We do wish," said Betty. "It can't be half such a nightmare if we talk it over. Kitty is right; it's cowardly not to face the thing. Now then, Margaret, you are the housekeeper. Be prepared for a plain question. Why don't you pay the bills ?"</p><p>"I did, till within a year ago," answered Margaret. "Then my father told me they were all to be sent to him, and he would settle with the tradespeople."</p><p>" Which, of course, he hasn't done," interrupted Sibyl.</p><p>"I'm afraid not, Sib."</p><p>"And we have been having no end of parties, and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a jolly time! Why, I've never had so many new dresses in my life, and beauties--no expense spared. It was only a month ago father told me to go off to Mme. Wild's, and get the very prettiest party-dress she could manufacture. I danced off with a heart like a feather, and Mme. Wild looked me in the face, and said,'I have written a letter to your good papa. When he answers it, you shall have my best atten-
<pb n="19     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
tion, Miss Ross.' It was the insolent look on Madame's face that first opened my eyes. I came straight home, and I walked into father's study, and I said, 'Father, Mme. Wild, the dressmaker, has written you a letter, and she says she will make my dress when you answer her letter.' 'I will reply to her to-night,' answered father, in his gentle voice, and he looked up at me as if he was awfully tired. I did not say another word, and, of course, I went away quite satisfied. But I hadn't the heart to go back again to Mme. Wild. I suppose now that father never answered the letter, and that she has never been paid."</p><p>"No," said Betty, "Mme. Wild has never been paid, but I don't care so much about her. It is Mrs. Moore I am thinking of. She makes all our plain dresses, and comes here to do upholstering and all kinds of odd jobs. She came here this morning, Margaret, and she cried; yes, she did. We owe her twelve pounds, and some of the money we owe is for out-of-pocket expenses, and she is <pb n="20     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
a widow with four little children. I told her she should have her money to-morrow; and she shall, if I sell all my rings to pay her."</p><p>"Why don't you speak, Maggie?" said Kitty. "Why do you sit there, looking so white and still, with your hands clasped together? What is the matter? Has father given you no money at all during the past year?"</p><p>"A little," said Margaret slowly. "The servants' wages are not greatly overdue; that is one thing."</p><p>" What does this mean, Maggie ? How is this to end?" said Sibyl. "I have some sense of honor left. Have you?"</p><p>"I hope so," said Margaret, "only I am divided. Oh! you don't understand, any of you. My father--all these are reproaches heaped on my father ! Oh! you can none of you understand!"</p><p>Margaret was so reserved that her few words fell now with the force of lead on the three girls. They did not speak for a
<pb n="21     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
moment; then Kitty once more came to the front.</p><p>"We simply can't go on like this, Maggie. If you are afraid to speak to father, I will. He <hi rend="italic">must</hi> give us money to pay these trades- people, or--" Her lips turned white, and her eyes misty; she was looking into a queer shady country of perplexity and ruin, and the glimpse frightened her.</p><p>Margaret rose suddenly from her chair.</p><p>"Something must be done!" she said. "I have put off the evil day as long as I could, but we have got to face it. I will speak to my father to-night."</p><p>She left the room. The three other girls looked at one another, and Kitty slowly shook her head.</p><p>"It's going to be awfully bad!" she said. "Maggie wouldn't look like that, nor speak in that dreadfully solemn way if the very, very worst wasn't to be expected."</p><p>"Well," said Sibyl, " after to-day, and my experience with the baker, joined to my experience a month ago with regard to Mme.
<pb n="22     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
Wild, I declare stoutly that I wish I was the daughter of a day laborer, for I don't believe he would be allowed to go in debt. There, get away, you horrid, fat, luxurious footstool. I hate you, for I don't believe you were paid for!"</p><p>"Kitty," said Betty, " how much do you think my turquoise-and-pearl ring would fetch? And who will buy it from me? I can't really take it to a pawn-shop."</p><p>Sibyl stared at her two sisters. Their conversation about the ring was not immediately interesting. She dragged a little wicker chair into the balcony and went out. She seated herself in this, and, taking a book of poems, pretended to bury herself in its contents. She read on steadily, although, of course, she was not taking in a single word. Misfortune and pain were new things in Sibyl's life, and she was holding them at bay with all the strength of her youth.</p><p>Each of the sisters had high spirits, but Sibyl's were perhaps the highest and the proudest. They were all nice-looking girls,
<pb n="23     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
but Sibyl had the most distinguished face, and the most independent bearing.</p><p>"It's immoral!" she kept on repeating, under her breath. "We ought to be living on bread and cheese. Oh! I do wish I was the daughter of a day laborer!"</p>
*<pb n="[24]"/>
CHAPTER III.
<p>MR. Ross was in the habit of coming home late. Margaret, therefore, as she sat in his study, and listened for the sound of his latchkey in the hall-door, was not surprised when eleven struck in a silvery chime from a carriage-clock on the mantelpiece. Twelve o'clock sounded by and by, and the young watcher, lying back in the depths of a great armchair, gave no sign or start of impatience. The fact was she was dreading the interview which lay before her, and every moment of delay was a relief.</p><p>Margaret Ross had a stronger face than her other sisters; she was the only one of her family who was decidedly dark. Her eyes were large, pathetic, and beautiful; otherwise her face was plain. She had been always a grave sort of girl, intensely reserved, and cold to strangers. Those who knew her fairly well,
<pb n="25     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
however, found many points to like. She was so reliable, so honest, so sure to do her very best about everything. Those who knew her well thought there was no one in the world like Maggie, but then, very few knew her well, for it was not in her nature to let many people get a glimpse into her heart.</p><p>In the old days, when her sisters were at school, Margaret had always spent her holidays with her father; they had a great many points in common, although in some respects their characters were opposite as the poles. During these holidays they became the closest of friends, and Margaret quickly learned to give her father the very first place in her heart. He was there enthroned. Few more sacred places could be found than the heart of this good, brave girl. She could not bear to see any faults in her idol. For a whole year she had lived down her fears, refusing to allow the black, dreadful thing which was pursuing her to look her full in the face.</p><p>"Honor on one hand--my father on the
<pb n="26     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
other," she kept repeating now. Her lips trembled; her feet and hands were cold.</p><p>The little clock on the mantelpiece sounded one, and now at last the latchkey was heard in the door. Maggie started to her feet, and turned on the gas. She was in white, and her dark hair was ruffled by her long vigil. She had never looked more girl- ish, and more nearly pretty than when she stepped into the hall to meet her father.</p><p>He started when he saw her.</p><p>"My dear child, what is wrong?" he said.</p><p>"I thought I would sit up to have a little talk with you, father," she said.</p><p>Mr. Ross put his arm round her neck, and kissed her affectionately.</p><p>"You look wonderfully young to-night, Maggie," he said in a pleasant voice.</p><p>She did not make any reply, but, taking his hand, led him into the study.</p><p>It looked cozy and bright, and Margaret had added to its attractions by placing a tempting tray of supper on a side table.</p><p>"What good angel has told you to do that,
<pb n="27     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
Margaret?" said Mr. Ross. For the first time an anxious expression seemed to come into his face. He looked at the food as if he were really famishing.</p><p>"I thought you would be hungry, father. Shall I cut you some sandwiches?"</p><p>"As many as you like, my dear. The fact is, I had no time to eat dinner in town this evening. I had some very pressing calls, and was too harassed to eat. Nothing to trouble you, Maggie, only you may cut me a good lot of sandwiches. By the way, did anyone call to see me to-day?"</p><p>"I believe a good many people. I wanted to speak to you about <hi rend="italic">them</hi>--and--other things."</p><p>"Ah, just so, my dear."</p><p>Mr. Ross opened his private secretary, and busied himself opening and shutting drawers.</p><p>"After all, I am glad you are up, Margaret. Yes, I'll take a cup of coffee. Thank you, my love. It is nice to have a kind daughter to attend on one."</p>
<pb n="28     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
<p>He received the cup from her trembling fingers, drained it off, and helped himself instantly to another.</p><p>"I am better now," he said. "That is the good of being a small eater, Margaret. I get exhausted, and a little refreshment instantly restores me. Now I am fit for anything. Where are my messages, and letters, and telegrams, dear? I will first glance through them, and go to bed."</p><p>Margaret pointed to a salver on the center table.</p><p>"All those came to-day," she said. "That telegram arrived between eight and nine this evening."</p><p>Mr. Ross tore open the yellow envelope. Not a muscle of his face changed as he read. He crushed up the little missive after he had perused it, looked instinctively at the empty grate, but, seeing no fire there, thrust it into his pocket.</p><p>"You'd better go to bed, Margaret," he said, as he deliberately opened a letter.</p><p>"But I've sat up on purpose to speak to
<pb n="29     OUT OF THE FASHION."/>
you, father. Can you grant me just five minutes? I don't think I shall keep you any longer. <hi rend="italic">May</hi> I speak to you, father?"</p><p>Mr. Ross glanced at his watch, quickly smothered an impatient sigh, and turned round to face his daughter.</p><p>"If you must, you must, Margaret," he said. "But is it so very important? We have already begun the day, and I am tired, my love."</p><p>"Oh, I won't keep you long," said Margaret. "And I--I would not hurt you. You are above all others to me--all others. Father, it's just that we can't go on any longer unless you give us some money."</p><p>Mr. Ross had looked almost terrified at the beginning of Margaret's speech, but toward the end his brow cleared.</p><p>"My dear child," he said, going up to Maggie, and putting his hand on her shoulder, "so much emotion and for so little? Surely my dear, if you wanted money you had but to ask for it?"</p>
<pb n="30"/>
30        OUT OF THE FASHION.
"I did," she began, but he interrupted her.
"You are fretting about the tradespeople,"
he said. "I own that I have been tempo-
rarily embarrassed, and hard up, but they
shall receive checks to-morrow. If you wish
it, I will write them out now."
"Oh, no, father, not while you are so
tired."
Mr. Ross smiled slowly.
"Well, I think you might let me off
until the morning," he said. "I don't break
my word; and I promise to send out
checks then. Have I a list of our creditors,
Margaret ? "
" Yes, in this envelope."
"Leave it on my table. I may get up
early to-morrow morning to attend to the
matter. And now for your own immediate
wants. What do you say to this ?"
He pulled a leather case out of his breast-
pocket, and opening it, slowly counted into
Margaret's hand ten crisp £10 Bank of
England notes.
"Oh, father, if you are going to pay the


 
<pb n="31"/>
OUT OF THE PASHION.         31
bills, I really don't want all this. You have
given me one hundred pounds."
"Keep it, child. Did I not say we were
going to begin on a new system ? No debts,
ready money paid down for everything.
Your hundred pounds won't last long if you
dress as I like to see you. And now, good.
night, Margaret, and never again, my love,
get into a tragic state of mind for the lack
of money. As long as I live I hope I may
keep you well supplied. GQod-night Maggie,
dear."
Mr. Ross pressed a prolonged kiss on his
daughter's brow. An impulse made her
throw one arm round his neck and return his
embrace almost as fervently as Kitty would
have done.
"Do go to bed soon, father, dear," she said.
And then she went slowly up to her own
room.

CHAPTER IV.
THn  next morning, when Margaret came
downstairs, the footman handed her a thick
sealed packet.
"Mr. Ross must have gone out very early
this morning, miss," he said, " for when cook
came down she found the hall door on the
latch; and he hasn't been near his room,
Louisa says. I found this, too, directed to
you, Miss Ross, on my master's table."
Margaret felt that this man was staring
into her face with undisguised curiosity.
She drew herself up, took the packet, and
answered coldly:
"I expected Mr. Ross to be absent this
morning. Have breakfast served at once."
The man withdrew, and Margaret hated
herself for having told an untruth.  She
certainly had not expected her father to be
away. His manner last night had soothed
82


 
<pb n="33"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        33
her, and the hundred pounds in her pocket
had given her a pleasant sense of security.
She slept well, and awoke in almost good
spirits. If her father had been going
through a temporary embarrassment and it
was over, there was no reason why they
should not all be as happy as ever again.
She thought how pleased Betty would be
when she found she need not part with her
turquoise and pearl ring, and how unneces-
sary it would be for Sibyl, the baby, the pet,
and the rebel of the family, to speak of them
any longer as immoral.
But when Margaret went downstairs, and
encountered the eager, curious expression on
her servants' faces, she felt her heart sinking
again, and resolved to say nothing about the
hundred pounds until she had opened the
letter which her father had left for her.
It was a lovely morning, and the breakfast
room at No. 80 was as sunshiny and cheerful
as a room could be. Window-boxes filled
the wide window-ledges, and the perfume of
mignonette, sweet pea, and monthly roses

floated in from  the open windows, and
greeted the girls as they sat down to their
breakfast.
They all looked bright, and young, and
cheerful, as they gathered round the table,
and the servants certainly could detect no
shadow of a cloud on any of their faces.
Sibyl seemed in even wilder spirits than
usual. She said she had got a scheme in her
head, and she wanted to consult Maggie and
the others.
"I thought it all out last night," said
Sibyl. "I lay awake until two o'clock, and
then it was formed to perfection. After that
I dropped asleep. It is a lovely scheme, and
since I thought of it I don't want to be a
day-laborer's daughter, for this will be much
more interesting. Shall we all come up to
the drawing-room, Maggie, and shall I tell
you the lovely thing I have thought of ?"
"I'll come to the drawing-room after I have
attended to the housekeeping," said Margaret.
"Oh, the housekeeping! I don't think we
ought to have any dinner, I really don't!"


 
<pb n="35"/>
OUT OF TiE F$ASHION.        35
"Hush, my dear, the servants may hear
you!"
" Well, Maggie, what if they do? Let us
be honest, whatever happens, say I."
" Oh, don't tease," said Kitty, putting her
arms around Sibyl's waist. " Do let poor old
Meg have her morning in peace. She'll come
to us when she can. Now, you know about
Betty's ring? She wants to consult you as
well as me. Come away to her room, and let's
have a consultation."
"Don't do anything about the ring without
telling me first," called Margaret after the
others.
They stared at her in some astonishment,
but made no reply. They went slowly up to
the drawing-room, and, seating themselves in
a heap together on an ottoman, began to ex-
amine the contents of Betty's jewel-case.
They were intently discussing the merits of
different rings, when a quick step was heard
on the stairs, and Maggie, with her face all
aglow, and her eyes full of tears, rushed into
their midst.


 
<pb n="36"/>
36         OUT OF THE FASHION.
"Oh, girls, girls, it's all right!"  she
exclaimed.   "It's all right!     Look  at
these!"
And she tumbled a perfect sheaf of checks
into Kitty's lap.
Betty snatched one up, and began to read
it out aloud.
" Pay Mr. John Hogg eighty-four pounds
seventeen  and fourpence, sterling.' Why,
Margaret, that's the butcher ! Hurrah!
hurrah! hurrah !" she screamed.
" Oh, girls, where are my rings ? Don't let
my darling rings get crushed under your feet.
I need not part with them now, and I value
them so much."
"Is there any check for Mrs. Moore in
this great pile, Maggie ?"
"Yes, for every one," replied Margaret. "I
don't believe when these are paid that we
shall owe a farthing in the wide world."
"Heavenly!" replied Sibyl. "I can't real-
ize it! I positively can't. Don't speak to
me, any of you, girls. Let me lie back with
my eyes closed, and try to comprehend the


 
<pb n="37"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        37
thing. We don't owe a penny in the wide
world ! Can such bliss be ours ?"
"And here is dear father's note," continued
Margaret. "He says I'm to send out all these
checks directly. He is obliged to go away
for a couple of days on business, but he will
be back by Saturday at the latest. He sends
his love to you all, girls."
Margaret half held out the note, but the
other three were not particularly eager to
read it. Betty and Kitty were tumbling over
the checks, and reading the amounts to one
another. Sibyl lay back with her eyes shut,
and a happy, rested expression on her face.
Margaret put the note into her pocket.
"I have another joyful surprise for you,"
she said. " What do you say to all these 2"
And she pulled the banknotes out of her
purse. Even Sibyl now darted up from her
reclining position, and came forward.
"Ten ten-pound notes!" she repeated.
"All our debts paid, and ten ten-pound notes
to the good! Maggie, did the genie of the
ring visit you last night ? "


 
<pb n="38"/>
38         OUT OF THE FASHION.
" Father was the genie," replied Margaret.
"He gave me this money, and he said he
would write checks to meet all the bills.
These are the checks. I believe I was a
coward, girls, not to speak to my father long
ago about these difficulties."
"But you did, Maggie; scores of times."
" He says not. I could not have explained
myself clearly."
"And I went to him," interrupted Sibyl
hotly, " and I spoke out plainly enough, you
may be sure. And he made me a promise,
and he     "
"Hush !"   interrupted  Margaret.   Her
face had   grown pale    and  stern.  She
clenched her hand vehemently over her
father's letter.
Sibyl looked   up, startled.  Margaret's
anger was only like a flash. It melted into
sweet sunshine.
" I do feel happy," she said. "And I can.
not bear a word against my     father just
now.   He has been embarrassed, but it is
over; it is all right now.  I feel as if I


 
<pb n="39"/>

could go down on my knees and thank
God."
"Darling Meg !" said Kitty.
She went up to her elder sister and
crushed the hand, which still held Mr. Ross's
letter, in an almost painful squeeze.
"Can't we celebrate this event ?" said
Sibyl, "after you have consigned all those
checks to the care of the post ? Can't we
just go off somewhere, and have a real jolly
day? To Richmond, or somewhere? I don't
believe I can stay indoors after this. I had
a plan, but it has vanished.   It is not
wanted-let it go! Oh! I tread on air,
and I must breathe air. I simply must go
out!"
" It will take me an hour," said Margaret,
"to write letters to accompany these checks.
After that we can go anywhere. I leave the
choice to you, girls."
She went out of the drawing-room, closing
the door after her. Betty and Kitty began
to put the rings back into the jewel case.
Sibyl rushed to the piano, opened it, and


 
<pb n="40"/>

played with intense gayety and spirit two or
three of the lightest airs then in vogue. She
was a musical girl, but even the power of the
music could not hold her just then. As she
said, she wanted air. She must breathe it
fully, or her wild happiness would half-kill
her. She went to her favorite seat on the
balcony, and, leaning over the railing, looked
down into the square garden. There were
gates to Rosemary Gardens, and from where
Sibyl stood she had a good view of the gates.
At this hour of the morning, carts, carriages,
equipages, of all kinds were coming and
going. The cries of the vegetable-mongers
and the fruit-sellers in the street beyond were
borne to the young girl's ears. The sun
shone over everything; the day was cloud-
less, and the freshness of spring still lingered
in the June air.
A young man walked rapidly through the
gates, and came in the direction of No. 80.
He was tall, with broad shoulders. He had
a cane in his hand, and a rose in his button-
hole. The moment she saw him Sibyl

sprang from her post of observation, and,
sinking down on a low garden chair, pre-
tended to turn the leaves of a book.
The young man had seen the flash of her
white draperies, however. He hurried his
footsteps, came under the balcony, and stood
still.
Sibyl did not move, nor raise her eyes.
She looked like a maiden spellbound by
what she was reading, but she did not turn a
page. The young man remained quite still,
then he began, in a very low, sweet sort of
way to whistle that most seductive of all airs,
"Garry Owen."
He whistled right through the air once,
and was beginning it a second time when
bang went Sibyl's book on the floor, and her
head popped over the balcony.
"I might have known that was you, Mark I
What a hideously vulgar thing you are
whistling! How do you do a"
"I do very well, thank you. Is it too early
to pay a call at No. 80 ? "
" Yes, it would not be correct."

"There's some nice shade in the Gardens
now-, and nobody there."
" Go and take a stroll in the shade, and
when you're tired whistle ' Garry Owen' once
again. Good-by."
"But, Sibyl--  "
"Yes; I really can't shout to you any more
from the balcony. These are not the days

She was absolutely going to say Romeo
and Juliet, but blushed a rosy red in-
stead.
" These are not the days of Shakespeare,"
responded the young man gravely, " so, as I
really want to say something, had I not better
come in?"
"How tiresome you are, Mark; and un-
reasonable, and provoking! Well, if you
must come in, you must.  I'll run down and
,et you in myself."
She rushed across the drawing-room, knock.
ing down a small table in her flight.
" What is the matter ?" exclaimed Kitty
"Where are you going, Sib ? "


 
<pb n="43"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         43
"Oh, it's only that stupid Mark Danby.
He will bother me to speak to him."
She slammed the door noisily after her.
" Stupid, indeed!" echoed Kitty, looking at
Betty.
Betty rose, stretched herself slightly, and
yawned.
" Never mind," she said. " I am sure Mr.
Danby knows his own affairs, and Sib won't
be guided by anyone."
"I don't want to interfere," retorted Kitty.
"Mark Danby is, without exception-"
Betty held up her finger.
"Hush !" she said, " they are coming--"
and the next moment the pair entered the
room, Sibyl talking high, with a pretty pre
tense of anger.
" Don't you think Sibyl is very unkind to re-
fuse me, Kitty?" said Danby. " She informs
me you are all bound for Richmond, and
declares I am on no account to accompany
you. You'll let me come, won't you, Kitty ? "
"You can come if you please," answered
Kitty. "T hat is, if Margaret says yes."


 
<pb n="44"/>
44         OUT OF THEE FASHION.
" Where is Margaret "
"In the library, writing letters."
"I'll find her and   get permission at
once."
" No, don't; she's frightfully busy."
"I'll just get permission and come back
again."
He left the room without waiting for an-
other word.
Sibyl buried her head in a great bunch of
lilies of the valley, and laughed a low, silent
laugh into their bells.
What a day it was ! How different from
yesterday, with its shadows and its distress !
Yesterday Sibyl felt stern and virtuous; the
path was of thorns, but she would tread on
them, and not wince when     they pierced
her. To-day the path was of roses, and she
felt that she was part of an idyl, and that
Tennyson ought to write about her and
Mark.
Margaret's letters were written and posted,
and soon after a merry party of five went
down to Richmond. They had a boat and


 
<pb n="45"/>

went on the river, and afterward dined in a
private room in the " Star and Garter."  A
feeling of rest was over all four girls. Dis-
grace had nearly touched them, but it had
gone away again. Danby and Sibyl laughed
and quizzed one another unmercifully. The
other three made plans together. The old
life was to be resumed, and now it was to be
truly a perfect life, for no debts could be
contracted.
Three of the girls talked of money, for the
want of money had been their sore sorrow of
yesterday. But Sibyl, who had perhaps, felt
that sorrow the most keenly the day before,
had soared high above the region of money
now. She laughed, and jested, and avoided
personal topics, but all the time her heart
was singing the sweetest of all songs, and her
eyes looked like dark violets.
The girls came home in the dusk of the
evening, and Danby bade them good-by
under the shade of the porch at No. 80.
"I'll see you to-morrow," he whispered to
Sibyl


 
<pb n="46"/>
46         OUT OF THE FASHION.
She turned her head away. He took her
silence for consent, and ran off happy.
The girls went into the house. A plain
man, dressed very plainly, was standing in
the hall.
" Can I speak to you in private, ma'am ?"
he said to Margaret.


 
<pb n="47"/>
CHAPTER V.
"I WILL see you in here," said Margaret,
in a cold voice.
She opened the door of a small room on
the ground floor, which she used as a sort of
private study. It was a dull little room, and
was dark now, for the servants had not
thought of lighting the gas.
"Had you not better go into father's
study, Maggie?" exclaimed Sibyl.  "This
room is not lighted."
"No, I will come here," replied Margaret.
"I can soon turn the gas on."
She found a wax taper, held it to one of
the jets in the hall, and soon the little room
was filled with an ugly, hot light.
Margaret called the plain man in, and the
door was closed behind them. The three
other girls went up to the drawing-room.
Here it was deliciously fresh and cool, for
47


 
<pb n="48"/>

the windows were wide open, the gas burnt
low, and the softened light from one or two
shaded lamps gave a refined appearance.
There were fresh flowers, too, in baskets
and vases, and their perfume added to the
pleasant, luxurious feeling of the drawing-
room.
"How delicious this old room is!" said
Betty. "I do think ours is the prettiest
drawing-room in London.     Isn't the effect
out of these windows quite country-like, the
moon glinting through the trees in the
Square garden, and that little rustle of the
wind among the leaves ! "
"I vote we have supper in the drawing-
room," said Kitty. "I'll ring the bell, and
ask Peters to bring up a tray with some fruit
and milk."
She did so; the man appeared. She gave
her order, and he closed the door respectfully
behind him.
" How nice to feel that Peters has been
paid all his wages in full," said Betty. " I can
order him about now: I couldn't yesterday."


 
<pb n="49"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        49
Sibyl went out on the balcony.   She
wanted to look at the moon in the Square
garden; she wanted to be alone.  She felt
quite sure that something very nice was
going to happen-something that would
change all the world for her, something that
would take all the commonplace out of life,
that would put the ideal in.
Sybil was delighted to feel that she was
going henceforth to live the ideal life.
"What a change from yesterday !" she
murmured; and half unconsciously, half out
of sympathy with somebody, she whistled a
bar of "Garry Owen."
Just then the hall door was banged rather
noisily, and the man in plain clothes walked
down the steps, and up the road toward the
gates of Rosemary Gardens.
"What an ugly man!" thought Sibyl.
"What a detestable man! He makes me
shiver. I do think the night has turned sud.
denly cold."
She came in and began to close the win
dows.


 
<pb n="50"/>
50         OUT OF TIIE FASHION.
"What are you doing ?" exclaimed her
sisters.
"It has turned cold," said Sibyl. "Don't
you notice it ?"
Kitty laughed.
" Cold ! you must be cold, child !" she said.
"The evening is grilling. Betty and I are
simply melted. Ah ! here comes supper and
something to drink. That's good, and better
still, here's Maggie. Maggie, what did that
queer man want ?"
"I'll tell you after supper," replied Mar-
garet.
The servant, having placed the tray on a
small table, withdrew, and Margaret began
to help her sisters to plates of strawberries
and cream.   She was busy, moving deftly
about, and her silence was unnoticed. She
did not eat any fruit herself.   This was
also unnoticed, for happiness makes people
queerly selfish now and then, and the other
three felt intensely happy while they ate
their frugal supper of fruit and milk.
When the meal was over Sibyl stood up,


 
<pb n="51"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.           51
stretched herself, yawned, and turned to the
others.
"I'm sleepy," she said. "I shall go to
bed. Good-night, everybody."
"Come here first, Sib," said Margaret.
There was something a little strained in
Margaret's tone, but still none of the others
noticed it. Sibyl went lightly up to her.
"Did I hear you say, Sibyl, that Mark
might call here to-morrow ? "
Sibyl blushed all over her face.
"He said he would come," she answered.
Then she added, half pettishly-for she did
not half like the consciousness that three pairs
of eyes were fixed on her-" Not that I gave
him leave-he does it on his own responsi-
bility."
" But you don't forbid him to come ?"
"Maggie, of course not."
" You know what he is coming for ?"
"How    can I possibly tell?  I'm dread.
fully sleepy; do let me go to bed."
Margaret put her arm    round her slim
young sister's waist. It seemed to Sibyl-


 
<pb n="52"/>
52         OUT OF THE FASHION.
but this may have been fancy-that she leant
against her as if she suddenly needed sup-
port. Her voice, however, had not a trace
of apparent emotion in it.
"Don't go to bed yet, dear," she said; "I
have something to say."
Sibyl dropped into a low chair, crossed her
hands on her lap, and glanced with the dawn-
ing of fright in her eyes at Kitty and Betty.
They were also sitting, but Margaret stood.
"I have something to say," she began.
She seemed to find the next words difficult.
Her lips were dry; it was a distinct effort to
get out any further speech.
"I thought I ought to say it before we
went to bed," she began again. " We have
had a happy day-it is over, we shan't have
any more."
"Margaret!"    Three voices uttered the
name in different accents of distress.
"We    are dishonored," said  Margaret.
Then she looked out of the window. Her
lips were trembling, her brows slightly knit.
She was on the verge of breaking down.


 
<pb n="53"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          53
She did not. In half a moment she re.
covered herself.
" Girls," she said suddenly, " I won't keep
the truth from you any longer. I cannot, I
dare not. Once I thought I'd let you all
have happy dreams to-night, but delay would
only be cruel. Oh! my darlings, how can I
take the brightness from you? 0 Sib, my
dear, my sweet, how can I take the joy from
your life  And yet you ought to know the
truth."
Sibyl sat in a speechless maze, but Kitty
came up to Margaret and took her hands.
" Of course, we ought to know the truth,
dear," she said. "Don't tremble, Maggie;
whatever is wrong, it is not your fault, and
it is far better to know the truth at once."
"The truth is this," said Margaret. "Our
father has-has-disgraced us and himself."
Sibyl sprang to her feet. Her face turned
crimson, words rose to her lips. She came
close to Margaret, and was beginning to pour
out a torrent of indignant questions when
Kitty interrupted her.


 
<pb n="54"/>

"Don't," she said. "You see Maggie has
only begun to speak; let her go on. Don't
interrupt. Who cares what you, think at this
moment!    Now then, Maggie, dear, you'll
be better after you have told us everything."
"I'll never be better," answered Margaret.
"I never can be better nor well again. This
is the truth, girls. Our father has absconded.
He has taken money, and he has disappeared.
That man in plain clothes is a detective. He
has asked me questions-many questions.
He says he will find our father, and if he
finds him he will be   "
"Don't," said Sibyl. "Don't say it.   I
know what you mean, only don't say it."
"I don't want to," said Margaret in a
dreary voice. "Perhaps our father will not
be found. That is the best thing we can
hope for; he is clever, and it is possible he
has got away safely."
"I don't understand," said Betty. "It is
something very awful, but I don't take it in.
What money could father take? I thought
the business was his own."


 
<pb n="55"/>
OUT OF TIHE FASIIION.       55
"Yes," replied Margaret, " but there were
partners-and-and other people's money
was involved. Anyhow he has gone, and
taken a large sum with him."
"Maggie !" suddenly exclaimed Sibyl, her
voice rising to a piercing cry, " what about
the checks that were sent out this morning ?
Was he paying all those awful debts with
the money he had stolen?"
"I don't know," replied Margaret.
"Are those ten £10 notes stolen money?"
"I don't know," responded Margaret again.
" Maggie, have you nothing to say ? "
"What can I have to say?     What can
anyone have to say who has just been
stunned? I am stunned, and I have nothing
to say."
Margaret had stood all the time she was
speaking.  Now she turned suddenly and
walked out of the room. The other girls
did not attempt to detain her; indeed, her
absence gave them a certain sense of relief.
They could at least huddle together, and
discuss the catastrophe which was crushing


 
<pb n="56"/>
56         OUT OF THE FASHION.
them. They knew that it affected Margaret
more painfully than anyone else, but all their
hopes were equally shattered; they looked
at one another in affright.
"To have had a long, lingering sense of
depression," said Betty at last, " and then to
have had it lifted for twelve short, beautiful
hours, and now this crushing blow ! Well, I
must confess that I cannot comprehend it."
It was midnight when the girls went to
bed. They crept upstairs softly, for they did
not want the servants to hear them.    As
they passed Margaret's door, they saw a light
streaming out.
"Poor Maggie!" they said one to the
other. But they were all too unhappy about
themselves just then to volunteer to go in
and comfort her.

CHAPTER VI.
THE story of a ruined house and home is
generally a nine days' wonder. If the catas.
trophe is anything on a large scale, the papers
take it up, and the world speaks, and wags
its censorious old head. There is gossip and
talk, commiseration, contempt, scorn, and, in
the end, forgetfulness. The world rushes
away to revel in a greater scandal; friends
return to their own interests; the thing that
seemed so mighty to the victims ceases to
excite comment.   Its brief day is over; it
sinks into oblivion.
This was the case with that disgraceful
crash which brought to the ground an old
and much-respected firm, which ruined some
small tradespeople, and some widows, and
simple country folk, and which absolutely
destroyed the happy home in Rosemary
Gardens.
57


 
<pb n="58"/>
58         OUT OF TIHE FASHION.
This story is not about the crash, nor its
victims, but about four girls who, in conse-
quence of it, had to turn round and face
the world, and prove the metal they were
made of.
That happy June day at Richmond was
followed by an awful fortnight of suspense.
Mr. Ross was not the only partner who had
vanished, to all appearance, from the face of
the earth.   Three men had fled, taking
money with them. If they were captured
the excitement and disgrace and exposure
would be all the greater.
They were not captured. Strange as it
may seem in these days of detectives and
telegrams and civilized espionage, they
managed to escape, and at the end of a fort-
night the unhappy girls began to entertain a
scanty hope that their father might never be
found. It was poor consolation at the best,
but things were so low with them just then
that they clung even to the uttermost shreds
of hope.
One day the post brought a letter for Mar.

garet. She opened it, read its contents, and
handed it to her sisters.
"It is from Uncle David," she said. "He
writes that he will call here to-day at twelve
o'clock. He wishes to see us all together.
You had better not go out, Sibyl."
" As if I wanted to !" said Sibyl.
She spoke in a pettish tone, and would not
raise her eyes to meet her sister's.
"Poor child ?" thought Margaret. "It
falls more heavily on her than on any of us-
that is, in some ways, I mean. Why has
Mark not been near the house for the last
fortnight? "
Punctually at twelve o'clock Mr. David
Ross arrived. He was not a London man; he
had come from Yorkshire for the express pur-
pose of seeing his nieces. He had neither
part nor lot in his brother's affair, and was
himself stern and honorable, rather close as
concerns money, and rather chary with regard
to kind words. He had kept aloof from the
girls for a fortnight, but now he thought it
well to pay the poor, unhappy girls a visit.


 
<pb n="60"/>

They none of them wanted him nor cared for
him, but that did not at all matter to David
Ross.
" Well, my dears," he said, when he entered
the drawing-room, "this is very sad, very
terrible, and it cannot be regarded as a divine
dispensation, for it is the result of dishonest
wickedness. How are you, Margaret ? You
look pale!"
" I am quite well, thank you, Uncle David."
Mr. Ross touched his niece's forehead with
his lips. The three other girls came up to
him, and he performed the same ceremony on
the brow of each. Then he sat down in a
deep easy-chair, and stared all round the room.
" This is a handsome apartment," he said.
The girls did not feel it necessary to make
any response to their uncle's remark.
"A very handsome room ! " he repeated.
"Showily and extravagantly furnished, with
a vast lot of unnecessary sunshine. And ab-
solutely flowers, fresh-cut flowers, in the
vases!"
"Poor Mrs. Moore brought them yesterday,"


 
<pb n="61"/>

interrupted Betty. " She was in the country,
and she brought a basket back with her. We
did not buy them. Don't think so."
Sibyl kicked out her foot impatiently. Mr.
Ross had prominent, light gray eyes-they
were cold in expression, and could look almost
lusterless when he chose. These lusterless
eyes now gazed full at Betty, and then
dropped to the level of poor Sibyl's little
pointed shoe.
" You have grown a good deal, my dear,"
he said, addressing his youngest niece. "You
are quite a big girl for your age. And, by
the way, how old are you ? "
"I am nineteen," said Sibyl, "I have been
grown-up for two years or more."
"H'm-ha! That's as other people think.
Muriel is seventeen, and she calls herself
grown-up.  Little chit! I consider her an
infant."
The fishy eyes grew softer as Muriel's
name was mentioned, and Margaret hastened
to ask a question or two about her cousin.
"We will speak of Muriel presently, my

dears. I will now come briefly to the sub.
ject which has brought me to town. Plain
and ugly truths must be put in a plain and
uncompromising fashion; and, without wish-
ing unnecessarily to hurt your feelings, I
must acquaint you with the fact that you are
penniless and disgraced young women."
"No, Uncle, that is not at all the case,"
suddenly retorted Sibyl.
" What do you mean, miss ?"
"We are without money, but we are not
disgraced."
" How do you put that, my dear niece ?"
Sibyl sprang to her feet; her great beauti.
ful eyes flashed sudden sparks of fire.
"Because no one life can disgrace another,"
she said; "because God has given each of us
our own lives. He has given me my life,
and Maggie, and Kitty, and Betty theirs;
and whatever our father has done, we are
honorable girls, and. we mean to go on being
honorable girls. We are poor, but we are
not disgraced. I deny it for myself, and for
Maggie, and Kitty, and Betty. When I do

a mean, dirty, shabby thing, my very own
self, then shall I be disgraced-not before!"
Sibyl rushed to Margaret's side, put her
arms round her neck, laid her head on her
shoulder, and cried quietly.
" Heroics !" muttered Uncle David-" very
young heroics!" Aloud, he said: "My dears,
we must to business.  I have come up to
town at the express request of your Aunt
Matilda to see if there is any way in which
we can help you."
"Oh, no, thank you, Uncle," said Kitty.
"Why do you say 'No, thank you,' miss ?
Have you already taken steps to earn your
own living? If so, I am pleased to hear it."
"It has been too soon to take decided
steps," responded Betty, " but Kitty is right;
we wish to be independent."
"Oh, pooh! independent-with nothing a
year! Now, my dears, listen to me. This
house and furniture will be sold by the credi-
tors. Then you will be homeless, as well as
penniless. Margaret, who is a well-educated
girl, can earn a good income as a governess.


 
<pb n="64"/>
64        OUT OF THE FASHION.
You two middle ones, Kitty and Betty I be-
lieve you are called, must get situations some-
how and somewhere. I will see to that; I
have a good deal of influence, and I know a
home for ladies where you will be received
until such situations are forthcoming. Sibyl
shall come home with me. Muriel wants a
companion, and Sibyl shall have the run of
the house."
Having delivered himself of this oration in
a monotonous tone of voice, Mr. Ross sud-
denly stopped speaking. He looked round
at his four nieces, and after the pause of a
full minute said abruptly to Margaret:
"I wish to catch the three o'clock train to
the north, and should be much obliged if you
would get me a cup of coffee before I start."
"But, uncle-  " began Betty.
" Not a word, my dears-not another
word.   Matters are now satisfactorily ar-
ranged-much better and quicker than writ-
ing. Margaret, kindly order your servant to
bring me some coffee."
Margaret left the room. She was some lit-

tie time away, and during her absence Mr.
Ross pottered about, poking his nose into
every corner, and indulging in disparaging
remarks generally.
"A   most expensive room!" he said:
"ridiculous fallals lying about everywhere.
No wonder my poor, miserable brother dis-
graced his family! Now look here, Sibyl,
when you come to Shortlands, you'll have
to do with plain furniture-plain dress, plain
living, plain food. But mind you, no debts,
no shiftless, beggarly ways-all straight as a
die, and above board and honorable. Those
are the ways at Shortlands, and you had
better be prepared for them when you
come."
"But I'm not coming, Uncle David."
"Pooh, my dear! I'll send you the price
of a second-class ticket, and expect you to
arrive this day fortnight. You can't starve
in London, child, and as you happen to be
blessed or cursed, I don't know which-
probably the latter, with good looks, the
sooner you become the inmate of a plain

Christian home the better. There, my dear,
you leave your nonsense and your airs behind
you in London, and if you do there is noth-
ing to prevent your having a happy time
with my little girl Muriel."
Again at the mention of Muriel's name a
softened expression passed over Mr. Ross's
face. Margaret returned to the room, and a
servant shortly appeared with a tray, which
contained coffee and cakes. Mr. Ross drank
his coffee with relish, ate some cake spar-
ingly, once again kissed his nieces on their
foreheads, told Sibyl he would send her a
postal order for her fare, and expect her to
arrive at Shortlands that day fortnight, and
finally left Rosemary Gardens, in ample time
to catch his return train to the north.
The moment he was gone Sibyl rushed
out of the room, dashed up to the top of the
house, where her own little bedroom was,
put on her hat, twisted a black lace scarf
round her neck, and, seizing her parasol and
gloves, ran downstairs again and out of the
house. It was a fortnight to-day since an

arrow had been planted in the poor little
girl's heart, and she was not at all accus-
tomed to its presence there, nor did she feel
in the least inclined to endure its aching
wound.
She left the house now because it seemed
too small to hold her and her tortured feel-
ings.
"I suppose it's because I'm younger than
the others that I feel almost mad with grief,"
she said to herself. "But then Maggie and
Betty and Kitty have not got Mark. 0
Mark! what has become of you ? Has the
ground opened and swallowed you up?
Why have you not come near me, nor written,
nor given me the smallest token of your
presence since that awful night a fortnight
ago ? "
Sibyl quickly left Rosemary Gardens. The
day was an intensely hot one in July, but the
whirl of thoughts in her soul made her indif.
ferent to the fierce heat of the sun. She
hurried along the High Street, soon reached
Kensington Gardens, and sat down under the


 
<pb n="68"/>
68         OUT OF THE FASHION.
shade of a widespreading elm-tree. Some
children were playing in the distance; some
nurses were gossiping together; a little gentle
breeze came up at intervals, and touched
Sibyl's hot cheeks.
She sat and looked straight before her and
wondered if she were going through a night-
mare, and if presently she would awake with
a start, and find that all her tortures were
only the result of a bad dream.
She shook herself impatiently once or twice,
and, by dint of exercising a tremendous
amount of imagination, almost brought her-
self to believe that she was going back pres-
ently to the old bright home in Rosemary
Gardens; that, when she felt tired of sitting
here, she might cross the High Street, and pass
through the sheltering gates, and go up into
the pretty drawing-room; that Peters would
bring in the tea-equipage, and Margaret would
preside, and friends would drop in and chat.
One friend would come among the others
-a certain young man, who had a pleasant
way; who had a gay voice for talking, whist.

ling, and singing; who could rattle off an air
on the piano, and give utterance to a trivial
nothing, which yet, because of the intonation
and because of the accompanying glance,
meant-oh, pshaw! Sibyl sprang to her feet,
and shook herself impatiently.
"I won't think in that style any longer,"
she said half aloud. " The old life is dead.
It has been put into a coffin, and buried
twenty feet deep under the ground. The
Mark I used to know is buried with the life.
What is the use of thinking about what's gone ?
I'll go home and talk to Kitty about Short-
lands. Hateful Shortlands! I'm not going
to live there. Hateful Muriel, with her plain
dress and plain ways-most hateful Uncle
David, but I'm not going to you, and your
honest Shortlands ! No, I'd rather beg first."
" My dear, how fearfully hot you will make
yourself if you pace up and down so fast on
this broiling day," suddenly remarked an old
lady, who was sitting near: Sibyl stopped,
looked at her, half laughed, uttered an almost
unintelligible apology and hurried home.

CHAPTER VII
THERE were two ways of reaching No. 80
Rosemary Gardens: one was the direct path
which led straight from the gates to the house.
Up this path Mark Danby had come on the
-morning that Sibyl had sat in the balcony
and watched him.
Perhaps for this reason she avoided the
direct path now, and took the longer way
round in preference. By this road she lost
sight of No. 80, and had to traverse two
sides of the Square before she found it
again.
Certainly Rosemary Gardens was a dismal
place. Most of the houses were stuccoed,
and the stucco had fallen off in large quan.
tities, leaving the most dreary of all forms of
house ugliness behind.   Fresh paint was
almost unknown in the Gardens; tidiness
and neatness seemed to have neither part nor

lot in these dreary old mansions; nearly half
of them were empty, with shutters against
the windows, and dismal black boards, signi-
fying that the mansions were at the disposal
of the public, leant forlornly against the
respective railings.
Sibyl walked hurriedly past these empty
houses.  She had seen them    many times
before, and did not notice them in the least
now. She was hurrying home, although she
did not see the least manner of use in hasten-
ing her steps.
To get to No. 80 she had to pass a large
corner house, which, unlike its neighbors,
showed some tokens of neatness and care.
It was not a gay house, like No. 80; it was
stuccoed in drab, like its neighbors to the
right and left, but the stucco was unbroken
anywhere; the railings were whole, the
windows clean. A wide balcony extended
beyond the drawing-rooms at this house. It
was a larger balcony than that which had
been made so picturesque at No. 80. But it
contained no striped awning, no flowers, no


 
<pb n="72"/>
72         OUT OF THE FASHION.
graceful bamboo chairs and lounges. There
was a chair in it, however, an old-fashioned
mahogany chair, with arms, and in the chair
now sat an old lady.
Her name was Jessica Power. She was
unmarried, and, for some reason known only
to herself, she liked all her friends to call her
Jessica.  Even young men, who did not
know her particularly well, addressed Miss
Power as "Jessica." They did so by her
express invitation, accepting the fact that she
was a little odd, but liking her none the
worse for that.
As Sibyl now passed under the balcony of
the corner house, Miss Power popped her
head over the railing and spoke to her.
"Is that you, Sibyl Ross? Come up: I
want to speak to you."
"Very well, Jessica," replied Sibyl.
She ran up the steps and rang the bell.
In a moment or two a very old servant
answered her summons. She wore on her
head a high mob cap, with a broad band of
black ribbon tied comfortably round the cap


 
<pb n="73"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          73
and under her chin. She had a dress made
of a gayly flowered old-fashioned chintz, with
sleeves which used to be called "leg-of-mut-
ton," and a black apron of alpaca, with deep
pockets.
"Your mistress has asked me to run up to
the drawing-room to speak to her, Susannah,"
announced Sibyl, when the servant opened
the door
The old body dropped a respectful courtesy,
pointed to the staircase, mumbled something
about bringing up tea in a few minutes, and
disappeared.
Sibyl ran upstairs and entered the
drawing-room. Miss Power came forward to
meet her. She was dressed in a very rich
black silk, with a cap of choice lace on her
head. Her hair was gray, her eyes dark, her
smile pleasant.
"You have not been near me for a fort-
night, Sibyl!" she said.
"Oh, Jessica! you know why I have not
come to see you," replied Sibyl, her lips be.
ginning to tremble


 
<pb n="74"/>
74         OUT OF THE FASHION.
Miss Power took one of Sibyl's hands in
her own.
"Come and sit by me in the balcony, my
love," she said. " Here, this is your favorite
little chair. Now, Sibyl, I saw you passing,
and an impulse made me call out to you. I
know everything: there has not been one
scrap of the gossip which has not reached
me; Susannah took care of that. Susannah
doesn't talk much, but she goes out in the
evening, and she listens to the gossip of the
neighbors, and what she hears she gathers
up. Susannah poured her gatherings into
my ears for the last fortnight, Sibyl."
"Yes, Jessica."
" So, my love, I know all about everything
-I probably know three times or four times
as much as really happened. But I like to
assure you on this point, so that you need
not have to tell me the tale over again.
Now I asked you to come up to put a plump
question to you."
"Very well, Jessica."
"What a     dead-and-alive 'very  well' 


 
<pb n="75"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.           75
Why, a fortnight ago, the child could
scarcely contain her own high spirits, and
now-I don't believe Susannah has exag-
gerated her report so much."
"She could not have exaggerated," said
Sibyl, in a low voice. "Nothing, nothing,
could be worse than what has happened."
"Well, my love, well-we won't go into
that now. Here's my plain question, Sibyl:
Do you and your sisters mean to take a good,
hard grip of the situation, or will you let
matters slide ? "
Sibyl opened her eyes very wide. For a
moment a look of resolution and courage
filled them; then they drooped, tears
gathered under the full lids, and a broken,
crushed kind of voice issued from the soft,
rosy lips.
"I feel just now," said Sibyl, "that I must
let matters slide. There is no grip in me
anywhere."
"That is bad, my love, and there must be
a reason for it, over and above the mere fact
of your money being gone. The loss of


 
<pb n="76"/>

money never crushed Nineteen yet, never-
impossible. Nineteen laughs at money, and
doesn't believe in it. Oh, my dear child, the
charm and the power and the greatness of
Nineteen are more than a match for all the
money in the world. You must have an-
other trouble, Sibyl."
"Don't question me, Jessica!"
"But I must. It is absolutely necessary
that I should get to the bottom of every-
thing."
"Oh! I can't be probed. Do turn your
eyes away. I really cannot bear to be cross-
examined just now."
"Well, well, poor little girl, I would not
be unkind for the world. Here comes
Susannah with the tea. You shall pour me
out a cup of tea, Sibyl. Susannah, we'll
have the little table out here on the balcony.
Thank you-I see you have remembered all
my wants. These strawberries look tempt-
ing, the cream is fresh, and here are Miss
Sibyl's own favorite tea-cakes! Now, Sibyl,
help me first, and then yourself. That will

sure you shut the door after you."
Susannah dropped another of her old.
world courtesies, looked at her mistress, then
rolled her eyes with an interrogative glance
at Sibyl, made no comment with her lips,
but said unutterable things by means of her
expressive face, and tripping neatly out of
the balcony, went across the drawing-room
and disappeared.
" Susannah is a dear old soul !" remarked
Miss Power.
"I suppose she is," answered Sibyl, "but
isn't she a remarkably silent old soul as well ?
I have hardly ever heard her speak."
" My love, she never does, except rather
late in the evening. Then, as a rule, she
unburdens herself to me. Her words come
with a rush, and I expect the effort exhausts
her, for I can scarcely get her to articulate
until the same hour arrives the following
night. But now to return to you and your
sisters. How are the other three girls, by
the way "


 
<pb n="78"/>
S          OOUT OF THE FASHION.
"I suppose they are quite well."
"Is Margaret quite well? If there is one
of you about whom I have felt a degree of
anxiety, that one is Margaret."
"Thank you, Jessica, Margaret is not
il."
"Well, that is good news. I knew she
was a brave girl. In fact, you all are.
You'll all take a firm grip presently, even
you, my poor little nineteen-year-old."
"Jessica," said Sibyl, suddenly, "do you
know that Uncle David Ross came to see us
to-day   He has offered me a home at Short-
lands."
"Well, my love ?"
"I am to go and live there, Jessica, to be a
companion to Muriel Ross. I am to help to
amuse her, and for that purpose he says I
shall have the run of the house."
"Yes, dear."
"You wouldn't say 'Yes, dear,' in that
calm voice, Jessica, if you had listened to
Uncle David this morning. He says the
house is a plain house, the people plain, the


 
<pb n="79"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          79
ways plain. By 'plain' read 'ugly,'--the
people are ugly, and their ways are mean."
"Oh, tut, child ! you have no right to speak
in that fashion."
Miss Power got up, shook some crumbs out
of her black silk dress, and, leaning over the
balcony, looked down the gardens as far as
she could see.
" There is nobody coming," she said, after a
pause.
"No," returned Sibyl, with a sigh. "No-
body ever does come, just now."
Miss Power gave the girl a quick look.
"Go home, my love," she said, after a
pause. "Come back to see me to-night, or
to-morrow, or any time when you feel
stronger, and in the meantime take a message
from me to the sister who has the greatest
taste for housekeeping, who has the largest
supply of spirit to carry her through this
adversity, and who, in short, is most likely
to take a grip of the situation. Which of
your sisters will you send to see me,
Sibyl?"


 
<pb n="80"/>
80        OUT OF THE FASHION.
Sibyl absolutely laughed, and the dawning
of interest began to appear in her eyes.
"Jessica," she said, "you are like no one
else. You never do things without meaning.
i What can be your meaning now  "
"You'll know fast enough, child, if I can
see sufficient grip in any of the family. It
all depends on that. Now, who will you
send ?"
"Margaret always used to be our house-
keeper, and she is brave-oh, very brave.
But I think, Jessica, I do think somewhere
below the surface Maggie carries about with
her a broken heart. You know what she
thought of our-our father."
"I know, child. I know perfectly. Poor
Maggie! I always knew it would come
hardest on her."
"But she is a very good housekeeper,
Jessica. Shall I send her to you ?"
"Perhaps not, my dear. She will find her
niche, no doubt, but I must have spirit as
well as talent-I must have cheerfulness,
dash, daring."


 
<pb n="81"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          81
"Good gracious, Jessica! what can you
mean "
" I thought I'd excite your curiosity, Sibyl.
I see, my love, that you'll recover by and by.
You feel low enough to-day, but in the end
you won't let matters slide. Please now tell
me about your middle sisters. What about
Kitty and Betty   Describe their characters.
Speak of them as if you were writing a de-
scription to go into a novel."
Sibyl laughed again.
" Kitty is very fearless," she began.
"Fearless-that is good. What else is
Kitty "
"She has such high spirits that even
during the last fortnight she has been heard
to laugh; she is awfully clever, and she can
say sharp, witty things; she is quick, too, and
practical."
"Capital girl Kitty  must be," rejoined
Jessica. "Now about Betty?"
"Betty is nearly as good a housekeeper as
Maggie. She is a better cook than Kitty,
and she is clever with her needle. In other

your solicitors ? "
"Our what?"
"My dear, there must be some business
people acting for you, or if not for you, at
any rate for your father's creditors. If you
do not know the name, find it out, and send
me word at once."
"I think I do know, for Margaret has
mentioned them     several  times.  Messrs.

"Thank you, my dear child. Now you
can run home. Be sure you give my mesn

CHAPTER VIII.
SIBYL ran downstairs, and, without waiting
for Susannah's aid, let herself out into the
street. There was animation once more in
her face and bearing. She looked younger
than when she had entered the house. She
did not know why she felt hopeful, but hope
unquestionably once more shone in her eyes.
She was conscious of a distinct sense of curi-
osity, and prepared to rush eagerly home,
and give an animated account of her inter-
view with Jessica Power.
She raced down the massive flight of stone
steps which led from the deep portico to the
street. Then she stood still. The color
rushed like a flood all over her face. The
next moment it receded, leaving it stricken,
and pale, and wretched. Mark Danby was
walking fast to meet her; he came up, and,
before she could prevent him, took one of her
hands in both of his.
83


 
<pb n="84"/>
84         OUT OF THE FASHION.
" I have been at No. 80," he said; " you
were not there. Kitty was in, and she gave
me some tea. I thought, perhaps, you were
with Jessica; I meant to call on the chance."
Mark spoke in a hurry. All the time he
was speaking his eyes were fixed on Sibyl's
face. They were dark eyes, bold and eager
in expression.  Sibyl would have given
worlds to turn from their gaze at that instant.
The sudden meeting agitated her. She was
dreadfully afraid of tears coming. She knew
she ought to be cold, and proud, and distant.
She hated the flutter of joy which filled her
heart; and she was painfully conscious that
her face was a transparent one, and that
Mark was looking through it into her soul.
"Haven't you a word to say to me,
Sibyl?"
"Oh! of course, Mark, how do you do?
Please let go my hand."
Danby unclasped his own strong hands
slowly.
" You don't look well," he said, in a grave
voice. " You look much worse than Kitty."


 
<pb n="85"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         85
a Oh, please don't talk about my looks."
"Well, I have a good many other things
to talk about. Where can we go to have a
quiet time ?"
"Nowhere."
"Sibyl, you don't mean that ?"
Danby turned round and looked once more
at the young girl. She tried to avoid return-
ing his glance. Then her shy eyes were
raised to his. He smiled at her; and, in
spite of herself, Sibyl returned the smile.
"My little darling," he said, in a fervent,
passionate voice.
He drew Sibyl's hand through his arm.
Nobody saw them in the old, deserted
gardens.
"Let us come into the Square garden; it
will be absolutely empty," said Danby.
They went there without another word.
The Square garden had one or two broken-
down rural seats. It was a place not kept in
any kind of order, and, but for its tennis-
court, would have been a howling wilderness
long ago. When Danby and Sibyl entered


 
<pb n="86"/>
86         OUT OF THE FASHION.
the garden   the tennis-court was empty,
They found a rustic seat which was suffi-
ciently whole to bear their weight, and sat
down side by side. Danby sat close to Sibyl.
She did not move away; she remained abso-
lutely motionless, her hands crossed idly on
her light summer dress, her eyes gazing
straight before her. Once again her eyes had
grown dark and deep, and looked like spring
violets in the midst of her fair face.
Mark Danby had almost killed her with
his neglect, but this was absolutely forgotten
now; he had come back again-he would
give a good reason for the absence which had
almost broken her heart.
" Sibyl, you know what I was coming for
that day ?" he began, suddenly. " Speak to
me, look at me, say you know."
"But-but you didn't come, Mark."
"I will explain that later. Answer my
question now. Say you know what I was
coming about."
"I-I-am not quite sure."
"Sibyl, are you speaking the truth ? Look


 
<pb n="87"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        87
at me, look me full in the face, and say those
words again.  Say again that you are not
quite sure."
Sibyl would have given the world to make
a saucy rejoinder. She could not; she felt
exactly as if she were under a spell; her lips
quivered; she turned her head, and looked
at Mark
"I did know," she said, almost in a
whisper.
"Ah, my little darling! I won't torture
you any longer. I was coming to ask you to
be my wife: I ask you now. Come into my
arms, and say 'Yes' there."
Danby came closer, folded his arms round
the girl, who half shrunk from, half leant
against him, and printed a kiss on her lips.
"You will be my wife ." said he.
"Oh, Mark, I love you !" said Sibyl.
And now all the tears of a fortnight past
appeared to have broken their barriers. She
struggled in vain to restrain them; they would
have their way, and came, accompanied by a
few deep-drawn, painful sobs


 
<pb n="88"/>
88        OUT OF THE FASHION.
Mark Danby was like many other men; he
hated to see a woman cry. He was fond of
Sibyl, but he wished she would not weep so
violently while she leant against him.
" You have not answered my question," he
said, presently. "I have asked you to be my
wife. I want to hear 'Yes' from those lips,
and, Sibyl, I want those pretty eyes of yours
to look at me through smiles, not tears."
Sibyl made a tremendous effort. Her
choking, painful sobs grew less; they ceased.
She even gave Mark the smile he wished for.
"You will be my wife, darling ?" said the
young man, stooping and kissing her once
again. At the second kiss she started back,
and almost pushed him from her.
"You mustn't kiss me any more," she said.
"I am not yours."
"Not mine! I like that, and just after
telling me that you loved me-and, Sibyl,
you look as if you loved me."
"Yes, Mark, I do love you."
"Then why do you say you are not
mine ?"  Danby suddenly pulled out his


 
<pb n="89"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        89
watch. " I say ! I had no idea it was so
late. I have to be at Waterloo to catch a
train for the country before seven o'clock.
Now, Sibyl, you know you love me, and of
course you'll be my wife. We must be
married soon-very soon-almost at once.
I'll come to see you again early next week,
only let me hear' Yes' from the lips I love
best before I go."
"Dear, dear Mark, I long to say ' Yes,' but
I dare not, I must not. My people are dis-
graced, and I won't bring disgrace upon you.
I said to Uncle David Ross to-day that my
father's dishonor could not spoil my life, but,
oh, it does-it does-cruelly !"
"Sib, you are a perfect little goose.
What do I care about your father, or any
nonsense of that sort ? We'll be married, my
dear, and live happy ever after. To hear
you talk, anyone would suppose you had
been having a conversation with my worldly
old mother."
"Ah," said Sibyl, with a start, "I knew

"Let her not approve! Ido, and I sup.
pose I am the person to be principally con-
sidered. Now, Sibyl, I really must fly; give
me another kiss, and say ' Yes.'"
Sibyl struggled against the kiss, not out-
wardly, but in that mental part of her being
which told her to be stiff and cold and to
flee from temptation. But her struggle was
feeble and ineffectual. The kiss was given
and returned, and something was murmured
into Mark's ears which appeared to satisfy
him. He crushed the girl's hands between
his own so frantically that she almost cried
with pain, and, promising to write and to
return without fail the following week, he
left her.
Sibyl came out of the Square garden
presently, with a confused, delirious sense of
bliss in her heart, and an intangible, and yet
very real pricking of her conscience.
She was engaged to Mark Danby; her
wish was granted; her crowning desire given
to her. She loved him with the fervor of a
very passionate, willful nineteen-year-old girl.

He was full of faults, and she thought him a
god.
Poor conscience ! It had not much chance
of being heard just then. The more Sibyl
thought of what had happened the greater
rose her ecstasy. When she entered No. 80,
it seemed once more to herself that she was
treading on air.
Since the crash of a fortnight ago the girls
had given up late dinner; Peters, with
several other servants, had disappeared from
the establishment. The cooking at No. 80
was scanty just now, and the attendance of
the most meager. Except five o'clock tea, a
meal which no woman under any circum-
stances will do without, the Rosses took food
anyhow, anywhere, and anywhen. They
were now in the drawing-room, and might, or
might not, take supper before they retired
for the night.
Sibyl was rushing past the closed doors of
the drawing-room to seek the shelter of her
own bedroom, when suddenly a pair of hands
were placed before her eyes from behind, and

Kitty's high, cheerful, but somewhat teasing;
voice was heard:
" Not a bit of it, Sib! You are not going
to banish yourself in this style. Come right
into the drawing-room, and tell us what you
have been doing all these long hours when
you have so mysteriously absented yourself.
If you are a good girl, and give a fair, un-
varnished account of your doings, I'll tell
you who I had the pleasure of entertaining
in your absence."
"Kitty, do let me go upstairs, I'm so
tired," pleaded Sibyl.
"Tired ? I never saw you look better in
my life."
"But I am tired, really. I    look well
because my cheeks are flushed."
"Well, I suppose if you must banish your-
self, you must. Poor little Sib! Margaret is
in the drawing-room, and so is Betty, and we
were having a rather interesting discussion
with regard to ways and means."
"Oh, I don't want to hear it-I can't
listen."

" As you please, my love. It concerns you
as well as the rest of us. We were on the
subject of summer dress, when I heard
your fairy footfall, and rushed out to way-
lay you."
"You will excuse my coming in, Kitty,
and oh! I had a message for you. You and
Betty are to go and see Jessica in the
morning."
"Jessica? I don't know that we'll have
time."
"You must go; she has sent a most par.
ticular message. You have to be there at
nine o'clock. I really do think it's some-
thing important."
"Well, I'll tell Betty. Why     doesn't
Jessica send for Margaret if she has impor-
tant things to talk over? Sibyl, you have
not guessed whom I entertained this after-
noon."
"I know," answered Sibyl. "You gave
Mark Danby his tea."

"Yes."

CHAPTER IX.
MIss POWER was old and rich, and had ap.
parently nothing whatever to do. Neverthe-
less she kept early hours, and never wasted a
moment of her time. Punctually as the clock
struck eight she sat down at the head of her
modest breakfast-table, and drank the coffee,
and helped herself to the nice fried bacon
which Susannah invariably prepared for her.
Susannah, in her queer, old-fashioned dress,
stood behind Miss Power's chair while she
ate. Susannah looked intensely grim and re.
spectful in this attitude, never indulging in
speech, but showing by the queer contortions
and varying expressions of her features that
her thoughts were very busy.
Miss Power read the Times as she sipped
her coffee, and when the meal was over the
old servant brought the big family Bible,
and Jane, the kitchen-maid, was summoned

up, and Miss Power read a few verses aloud.
She never prayed, she only read the verses,
and when she had finished she invariably
went up to her drawing-room, where she
busied herself for an hour or two, getting
it into the prim state of neatness which she
loved best.
On this particular morning Susannah fol-
lowed her mistress upstairs. She entered the
drawing-room without knocking, and stood
silent and respectful just within the door.
Miss Power was maturing a stand of beau-
tiful ferns; she turned round and said
abruptly:
"I am coming to the kitchen by and by,
Susannah; if you have any complaint to
make of Jane you can make it then."
"Eh, ma'am, not I," answered Susannah.
She closed her lips with a snap, as if she
were locking them, but still she lingered in
the room.
Miss Power stood still for a moment; a
slight passing expression of annoyance swept
over her fine face. It did not linger there;


 
<pb n="97"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         97
she went up to the old servant, and spoke
quietly:
"You have something on your mind,
Susannah. Say it in as few words as pos-
sible, for I am expecting friends to call
this morning, and am consequently very
busy.".
"I know," retorted Susannah, "I know
who are coming."
"Very well; if you have anything to say
about my visitors, say it and then go."
"Eh, ma'am, it's only this," said Susannah;
she raised her sunken eyes, which were sud-
denly lighted with an inward fire. " It's only
a word, ma'am, and it won't be hearkened to.
Still, I must say it. Money's hard to win, and
easy to lose, and sore to do without, and who
are those Rosses, I want to know. That's
what I say to myself. Who, and what are
those Rosses ?"
"You can go downstairs now, Susannah,"
replied Miss Power.
The old servant turned and left the room
without another word.


 
<pb n="98"/>

" Susannah does not approve," murmured
Miss Power to herself.
She did not say anything more, but, open.
ing the windows which led into the balcony,
stepped out, and looked up the Gardens in
the direction of the Rosses' house. She saw
no sign of Betty and Kitty approaching, but a
postman just then ran up the high steps of
her house, and deposited a letter in the box.
A moment later Susannah brought it in, and
presented it to her mistress on a silver salver.
Miss Power read the contents of her letter
slowly, and with interest. Three sides of a
sheet were closely written, and these were the
contents:
ASHTON MANOR, July 11.
MY DEAR JESSICA :
There is not the least doubt that my foolish son
Mark has gone absolutely to the length of flirting
with a girl who lives somewhere in your Gardens.
You know my views for Mark, and how much turns
on them. Of course, under these circumstances, any
wife of his own choosing would be unacceptable to me,
but when, in addition, I discover that the object of his
preference is one of the daughters of that dreadful
man whose name has so lately figured in the news-
papers-I allude to the Ross and Banbury business--
you may guess what my feelings must be.


 
<pb n="99"/>

It is impossible for a mother to control the doings
of a son who is not only grown up but a good deal
over age. But tact, my dear Jessica, tact can do
wonders in these delicate cases, and I am sure if it is
in your power you will help me in this matter. What-
ever happens, Mark must marry into a good family,
and his wife must have money. You know how in-
secure my present position is, and will fully sympa-
thize with me.
Yours affectionately,
JANE DANBY.
P. S.-I should be very glad to see you at Ashton
Manor on Saturday, 25th, until Monday, 27th, if you
can tear yourself away from your queer, delightful,
funny old house, and queerer, and more delightful
hand-maiden Susannah.
"But I cannot tear myself away from
them," murmured Miss Power.       "This letter
from  beginning   to end   is balderdash.    I
never did care for you, Jane Danby, and I
certainly do not feel inclined to begin to do
so after reading a letter like this."
Miss Power slipped it into her pocket as
she spoke, for at this moment the drawing.
room door was opened and Kitty and Betty,
looking sweet and radiant in fresh cambric
dresses, rushed in.


 
<pb n="100"/>
100        OUT OF THE FASHION.
"Dear Jessica," they both exclaimed.
They ran up to the old lady, and kissed her
affectionately.
"Sibyl said you wanted to see us,"
remarked Kitty. "We are awfully busy, for
the house and furniture are to be sold next
week. And we want to take lodgings at
once, and not to go to that dreadful home for
women."
"No, we'd certainly die there," interposed
Betty.  "In homes of that sort nobody
laughs, and nobody plays, and Kitty and I
couldn't stand it-could we, Kitty ? "
" No," said Kitty. "Margaret is the only
one of us who could live long in the sort of
neutral atmosphere which must pervade a
cheap home for women."
"And Margaret is the one of you all who
needs the   most sunshine," replied Miss
Power. '- Well, my dears, I have not the
least idea to what home you are alluding, but
if you don't like it, perhaps you won't have
to go."
"That depends," answered Kitty. "Uncle

David Ross came to see us yesterday, and he
said he would find situations for Betty and
Margaret and me as governesses, or shop-
women, or something of that sort. Until he
found the situations, we were to live in the
woman's home. He thought we could not
help ourselves, for of course he thought we
had no money. Well, Jessica, he is wrong;
you know the very night before father dis-
appeared he gave Margaret one hundred
pounds in ten-pound notes-when the earth-
quake came, and everything that seemed
right turned out to be wrong, Margaret took
the money back to the solicitors in Lincoln's
Inn Fields, who had written to her. But
Margaret thought, she said so, that our jewels
were our very own, and we sold them a week
ago, and even after paying poor Mrs. Moore
we really have a little money left, and we
thought we might go and live in lodgings to-
gether until the situations are found for us."
"So we can't stay very long with you,
Jessica," continued Betty. "For we want to
go and search for the lodgings to-day."


 
<pb n="102"/>
102       OUT OF THE FASHION.
"Well, my loves, well, if you carry out
your plan, you will have plenty of time to
look for lodgings by and by. Now, I've
sent for you because I want you. I want
you both absolutely to devote this morning
to me."
The girls were too polite to express im-
patience in their voices, but not clever
enough to keep it out of their faces.
"Sit down, my loves," said Miss Power,
who read their thoughts easily enough, but
did not seem in any way disturbed by them.
" Sibyl told you I wanted to see you, did she
not? "
"Yes. Oh, what do you think, Jessica?
Sibyl has engaged herself to Mark Danby !"
Miss Power put her hand into her pocket,
and gave Lady Jane's letter a vicious little
pinch. Aloud she said in a calm, unsur-
prised voice:
"Was Sibyl engaged when she called to
see me yesterday ?"
"No; she met Mark afterward in the
Gardens, and he proposed to her. She was


 
<pb n="103"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         103
very late in coming home, and when she re.
turned she seemed fearfully excited, and she
said she was engaged to Mark. Maggie had
a long talk with her, and Maggie cried dread-
fully and wanted Sibyl to give Mark up, but
Sib only laughed, and kept on repeating:
'I am  engaged, and I mean to marry him,
and there is an end of the matter.'"
"Did Sibyl seem happy ?" inquired Miss
Power.
"Well, Jessica," replied Betty, "everyone
who saw them together must have noticed
that Sibyl adored Mark. In fact she wor-
shiped him.   It was a case of idolatry, on
her part at least."
Miss Power not only pinched Lady Jane's
letter now; she absolutely tore a little piece
out of it as it lay in her pocket.
" How does Sibyl's engagement strike you,
Jessica ? " asked Kitty. " Do you not think
it is just a wee bit heartless of Sib to think
of such matters just now ?"
"No, my love, I do not. If there ever
was a girl possessed of too much heart for


 
<pb n="104"/>

her own peace of mind, that girl is poor little
nineteen-year-old. But, my dears, this valu-
able morning must not be wasted discussing
anyone's engagement. Business is business,
and there is much at stake. Now tell how
much you both know of housekeeping."
After this startling and unexpected turn
being given to the conversation, the girls
found for a moment or two that their
interests hung fire, and they did not guess
that Miss Power was really putting them
through a very searching examination.
At the end of half an hour she started to
her feet with a satisfied expression on her
face.
"Now, my loves," she said, "you     will
kindly wait here while I go upstairs and put
on my bonnet."
"Do you want us to go out with you,
Jessica "
"I do; I am going to see your lawyers,
Messrs. Rogers & Turner, and I want you
to come and introduce me to them. I have
ordered a carriage to be here sharp at ten.


 
<pb n="105"/>

Kitty, my dear, you can stand in the balcony
and let me know when it arrives. Betty, I
have a small task to give you. Here are my
last week's accounts, they are somewhat in a
muddle. Put them as straight as you can
while I am getting ready to go out."


 
<pb n="106"/>
CHAPTER X.
BEmTY had really a clear head for figures,
but it must be confessed that on this occa-
sion either nervousness, or an overstimulated
curiosity as to Miss Power's extraordinary
behavior, made her bungle the said accounts
in a unsatisfactory manner.   Miss Power
came back in her black velvet poke-bonnet,
with the old-fashioned Spanish black veil,
which she always wore, tied loosely round it,
a magnificent Spanish black lace shawl on
her shoulders, black lace gloves on her hands,
and an old-fashioned parasol of dove-colored
silk as the finishing touch to her attire.
Miss Power's hair was as white as silver,
and she looked a most picturesque old lady
when she returned in her quaint dress to the
drawing-room.
"Come, girls," she said to the two. She
took no notice of Betty's untidy and hope-
106


 
<pb n="107"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         107
less sums, but swept the pair on before her
downstairs, and into the delightful carriage
which awaited them. Miss Power was very
particular about her carriage, and it was a
faultless turnout which rolled past No. 80,
and out through the gates of Rosemary
Gardens. Kitty suddenly laughed aloud.
It was the soft feel of the summer breeze fly-
ing across her young cheeks which caused
this burst of merriment.
"Jessica," she said, "while I sit here I for-
get the earthquake. If it would not look
too dreadfully outre, I should like to hug
you this very minute for making me so
happy."
" But you mustn't do it, Kitty," interrupted
Betty, "for if you do I shall certainly have to
follow suit, and what a mess Jessica's bonnet
would get into then."
"And I want to appear respectable, my
loves, when I sit in the presence of your
lawyers," retorted Miss Power, "so, if you
please, we will reserve our embraces."
" Just for one instant, Jessica, give me your


 
<pb n="108"/>

hand to squeeze," answered Kitty, "and then
I'll positively promise to sit quiet."
The pair of grays soon brought the party
to Lincoln's Inn Fields. In this secluded
quarter the noise of the great city sounded
dim and far away. At Miss Power's request,
Kitty got out of the carriage, and went to
inquire if Mr. Rogers was within. He was
and, for a wonder, disengaged. In five min-
utes' time Miss Power and the two girls
found themselves seated in his office.
"Kitty, will you have the goodness to
introduce me?" said Miss Power. Kitty
blushed a good deal.
" Miss Power is an old neighbor of ours, Mr.
Rogers," she said. "She lives at 50 Rose-
mary Gardens. We have known her for a
long time now."
"The children have found me odd, but re-
spectable," retorted Miss Power. "I live with
an old servant, who is even a little more odd
than I am. I keep no cats, no dogs, no
parrots. By this abstinence in the matter of
pets I prove at once my strength of mind,


 
<pb n="109"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        109
and the unique nature of my character. But
perhaps, sir, another side of my life and cir-
cumstances may interest you more vastly. I
am rich."
Mr. Rogers was a very commonplace man.
He had been staring at Miss Power in a some-
what quizzical and disdainful manner until
she said "I am rich." Then his tone and
look both became respectful. Miss Power
knew this would be the case, and she longed
to have someone to nod to, to express her
inward satisfaction.
"I am delighted to make your acquaint-
ance, madam," said Mr. Rogers. "And-
and-I am pleased that these poor young
ladies should have the benefit of your wise
counsels at-at-this critical juncture."
"It so happens," said Miss Power, "that I
have brought my young friends, Kitty and
Betty Ross, here to-day solely and entirely
for the furtherance of my own purposes. I
wanted to be introduced to you, for, being
the owner of a good deal of surplus capital, I
am anxious to make an investment."


 
<pb n="110"/>
110        OUT OF THE FASHION.
Mr. Rogers's face became eager and abl
sorbed
"I should be delighted to give you any
advice," he said.   "Ah-perhaps-would
you like the young ladies to go into my
waiting-room? My clerk will supply them
with some numbers of the Graphic, and last
week's Punch. You are fond of Punch, eh,
Miss Kitty?"
Miss Power did not give Kitty time to
answer.
" I should prefer the girls to remain where
they are," she said. " Now, if you please, we
will proceed to business. I am given to
understand that No. 80 Rosemary Gardens is
in the market ? "
" Well, yes, my dear madam. You see, in
an unfortunate case of this kind the cred.
itors-- "
Miss Power interrupted with a wave of
her lace-gloved hand.
" Forgive me," she said. "I am not inter.
ested in the creditors. The property is for
sale "


 
<pb n="111"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          111
"Undoubtedly.    It will be sold by auo
tion next week. This day week, I believe;
I will ring for my clerk and inquire."
"One moment first-the furniture is also
for sale?" 
"Yes. House and furniture go either to-
gether or separately-probably the latter.
I propose to sell both together, if I can, at
Tokenhouse Yard, but if the house alone is
sold, the furniture will be put up at auction
the following week."
"And all your pretty things will go to
strangers, Betty," said Miss Power, turning
and looking at the young girl.
Betty's eyes filled with tears. She caught
Kitty's hand in her own, and looked steadily
out of the dusty window.
"Auctions are naturally painful things,"
proceeded  Mr. Rogers.    "But under the
present peculiarly sad circumstances-- "
"Going into the circumstances will neither
aid nor hinder the matter in hand," said Miss
Power.   "My feelings with regard to auc-
tions are that they are sacrilegious.  The


 
<pb n="112"/>
112        OUT OF THE FASHION.
sale of a house and furniture by public auo
tion seems to me almost wicked. I have
come here to-day to know if it is necessary
to sell No. 80 Rosemary Gardens, with its
furniture, plate, china, by auction ?"
"By no means, my dear madam, but it
seemed the speediest way to realize, and for
the sake of the creditors  "
" I beg of you, my dear sir, not to go into
these side questions. I don't care the pro.
verbial brass farthing for the creditors, but
having no other pets, I make pets of these
children, and their feelings are sacred to me.
Now I have come here to-day to make a
straightforward and blunt proposal.    But
first I must ask some questions. Is No. 80 a
freehold "
"It is, Miss Power."
"That is good. I dislike leaseholds. I
hate being worried with yearly ground-rents.
Now, what did you expect to realize for the
house in Tokenhouse Yard next week 2"
Mr. Rogers hummed and hawed.
"I-I-don't know," he admitted. "An

enforced sale is always injurious, and then
the situation, for some extraordinary reason,
is not popular."
"I beg of you, sir, not to speak against
Rosemary Gardens. I reside there."
"My dear madam, a thousand pardons. I
have no doubt you find it as salubrious a
spot as to be found in London."
"That is neither here nor there, Mr.
Rogers. The fact is I wish to purchase No.
80 Rosemary Gardens. I wish to become
the owner of the house, the furniture, the
plate, the china, linen-in short the whole
concern as it stands. I don't want the house
and its belongings to go to the nammer.
Can we make an arrangement on the spot?
But first, perhaps, my dear girls, you would
now go into the other room, and look at
Punch for a few minutes ?"
When the door closed behind Kitty and
Betty, Miss Power turned sharply round to
Mr. Rogers.
"Listen," she said. "I don't wish to give
a penny more than I can help for this house


 
<pb n="114"/>
114        OUT OF THE FASHION.
and furniture. Name a fair sum, and I will
write you a check as soon as ever my lawyer,
Mr. Percival, at the opposite side of the road,
has examined your title-deeds. Don't over-
do it, my dear sir, nor imagine for a moment
that because I am wealthy I am also extrava-
gant."
After this speech Miss Power and Mr.
Rogers had a rather fierce, not to say angry
tussle of words, but in the end the old lady
left the lawyer's office with a flushed, tri-
umphant, but pleased expression of face.
"We will go over and see Mr. Percival
now," she said to the girls. "Not a word, my
loves--ot a word at present. The matter
looks promising, but it is not concluded.
Nothing can be concluded until I have an in-
terview with my friend John Percival."
Kitty and Betty had to sit for nearly an
hour in Miss Power's landau while she inter-
viewed her own man of business. She came
out at the end of this time, and, taking a hand
d each girl in her own, said:
" My loves, we will now go home. I think


 
<pb n="115"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         115
I have concluded my business in a satisfactory
manner, and I can at least promise you that
there will be no auction at No. 80 Rosemary
Gardens."
During the rest of the drive the trio were
silent. Whatever their feelings, their inward
thoughts, their speculations, they gave them
no vent in words. When they reached the
Gardens and drew up at No. 80, Miss Power
for the first time opened her lips.
"What time do you dine ?" she asked.
"We don't dine, Jessica," answered Betty.
"We have no cook, Jessica," chimed in
Kitty. "Therefore, of course we have no
dinner."
" Well, my loves, at what hour in the even.
ing do you all-Sibyl, Maggie, and all-as-
semble in. your drawing-room ? "
" Oh, Sibyl is so erratic, we can never count
on her."
"You must count on her to-night. Give
her my love, and a request from me that she
will present herself in the drawing-room of
No. 80 at seven o'clock this evening. Maggie

must also be there, and, of course, you two
girls."
" Very well, Jessica."
"Of course, you will be alone, remember.
I am coming to talk business-solemn, dry
technicalities must be gone into."
"Oh, very well."
"What a demure, 'very well' from your
lips, Kitty! Aren't you glad there is not go-
ing to be any horrid auction-that the furni-
ture and the house are not going to be torn
asunder?"
"Yes, yes-so glad that if I speak about it
I shall cry."
"Kitty, Rosemary Gardens is after all an
out-of-the-way corner of the world; peo-
ple may be eccentric here if they please.
You may kiss me now, Kitty, and so may
you, Betty. Good-by, my loves; expect me
to-night at seven."


 
<pb n="117"/>
CHAPTER XI.
"TmIS drawing-room belongs to Jessica
now," said Kitty, "and I am going to make
it bright for her. She is the most wonderful
woman I ever came across in my life. She
is the sweetest, perhaps the dearest, but I do
not think she has good taste in the matter of
drawing-rooms. Hers is all drab and old
china; the old china is splendid, and the
drab is artistic, but, somehow, the general ef-
fect is dull."
"And No. 80 never, never at any time
looked dull!" said Betty.
"Yes, it did once, Betty," retorted her
sister; "the day Uncle David Ross sat in
that chair, and screwed up his short-sighted
eyes, and looked as if he thought sunshine
wicked. Well, the room shall have all the
light we can get into it to-night, and how do
my flowers look, Bet? You must not whis

per it to Maggie, but I spent five shillings on
those flowers."
Kitty and Betty had told no one of their
adventures that morning.   Margaret and
Sibyl knew that Miss Power wished to see
them in their own drawing-room  at seven
o'clock. Margaret suggested having tea for
the old lady, and Sibyl, who loved her very
much, spent threepence out of her own
slender purse to buy cream to put into the
tea when it appeared. But only Kitty and
Betty knew the news which Miss Power
would bring, and which would electrify the
elder and the younger sister.
At seven o'clock the four girls were all
waiting in the drawing-room. Kitty and
Betty, who were in the secret, looked very
bright and very much excited. Margaret's
face was pale, and its expression downcast,
but Sibyl was radiantly and quietly happy.
The almost feverish excitement of twenty-
four hours back had subsided. Something

and joys of penury and riches. ~With this
delicious news in her heart she could even go
to Uncle David Ross and be happy.
At five minutes past seven Miss Power ar-
rived. Susannah accompanied her across the
Gardens. She had very old-fashioned ideas,
and did not think it decorous for an aged
gentlewoman to be abroad in the evening ex-
cept in the company of her handmaiden.
Miss Power entered the drawing-room,
saluted the girls, and then sat down in a
comfortable chair assigned to her.
"Well, Margaret," she said, addressing the
eldest Miss Ross, " have Kitty and Betty told
you about the little business we transacted
together this morning ?"
"No," answered Margaret. "They only
said that they had taken a drive with you,
Jessica."
"They are good girls," said Miss Power.
"I did not tell them to keep the thing a
secret, but I respect them all the more for
showing reticence. Well, my dear Maggie,
the little secret is simply this: Before a

week has passed over our heads I expect to be
the owner of this house, with its furniture,
china, plate, and linen. For goodness' sake,
Sibyl, child, don't hold that costly teacup in
so careless a fashion! You'll drop it, to a
certainty. Remember that cup will be mine
before a week is out."
Sibyl did drop the cup without breaking
it. She made a rush forward, and kneeling
by Miss Power, looked up with her eyes full
of wonder at the good lady's face.
"Jessica !" said Sibyl. " Why did you
do this? You know you don't want our
house and our furniture! Why did you buy
them ? You see Maggie can't speak. She
is half stunned with your news. Tell me
quickly why you have bought them, Jessica."
"Softly, softly, little nineteen-year-old!
Well, if you must hold my hand, you must.
The fact is I made up my mind to purchase
this house for a great many reasons. One of
them is that I hate houses of this sort, nicely
decorated and nicely furnished, to go to the
auctioneer's hammer.  They do not fetch


 
<pb n="121"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        121
their value, and-and-it's hateful to see the
furniture that you have a regard for, poked
at, and pinched, and criticised by every fat
vulgar woman who chooses to come and see it.
I know how I'd feel if my feather-beds were
shaken up and looked into in that style.
That was one reason why I thought I'd buy.
I said to myself, No. 80 will go cheap in any
case, and if it's a freehold I'll have it.'
What's the matter, Margaret ?"
"Nothing, Jessica. I am only so thankful,
and I know you have other reasons."
"Well, child, of course I have. But don't
you suppose, you four girls, that all my
reasons will please you. They may or may
not. There is one thing I am quite certain
about-that they will astonish you.  You
may be a great deal too proud to concur
with them. If you are, well, no harm is
done. You can go your own ways, and No.
80 is at least as well in my hands as in those
of a total stranger. If you like my plan,
you all of you have at least a home. Now,
just stay quiet. and don't fidget, Miss SibyL


 
<pb n="122"/>
122       OUT OF THE FASHION.
How can I speak when you are squeezing
my hand in that fashion "
Kitty and Betty, who had stood a little
aloof during the beginning of the conversa.
tion, now drew near with their eyes and ears
very wide open. It had not occurred to them
that Jessica's purchase of 80 Rosemary
Gardens would provide them with a home.
It was good enough thinking of the dear old
thing having the place, but this, what could
this mean?
" Get up, Sibyl, and don't lean on Jessica
in that fashion," said Kitty. "Now, Jessica,
we are all listening. We are intensely anx-
ious and excited."
" Well, my loves, I have bought the house
and all it contains for the reasons I have
already stated. My further reason I now
proceed to disclose. I am a wealthy woman,
but I am not one of those who care to
fling money away. I consider 80 Rosemary
Gardens an excellent speculation, and, with
proper management, I mean it to bring me in
my seven or eight per cent. Margaret, my

dear, you are a careful, prudent, and wise girl
for r your years."
"I am twenty-four, Jessica," said Margaret.
" t is scarcely likely that I should not have
experience."
" That is it, my love; you have experience.
You have kept this house for four years."
"Yes, Jessica."
-' You have managed the housekeeping ?"
"Yes."
"And the weekly books? Oh, I know
you have had difficulties, but your own ac-
counts have been straightforward, have they
not ?"
"Perfectly."
"Betty, you have a taste for figures. You
are a very accurate accountant."
"O Jessica, you must not judge by that
disordered slate which I left in your room."
"My dear, it is not in disorder now.
Susannah wiped it clean before I returned
from my drive. Now, loves, I won't keep
you any longer in suspense. I mean to turn
No. 80 into a boarding house."

Miss Power, having delivered this bomb.
shell into the midst of the little party, lay
back in her chair, folded her hands, and sat
quite silent for a minute. At the end of
that time she said:
"No. 80 Rosemary Gardens is to be a
boarding  house.   This is my unalterable
decision. If you like, girls, I will go away
now, and you can talk the matter out, and
explode about it as much as you please. To-
morrow morning I can return, and we can
discuss the matter in all its bearings."
"Please, Jessica, stay," said Margaret. A
glow of color had come into her very pale
face, and her eyes had the misty look which
shows that tears are not far off.
"Child," said  Miss Power. "Does this
seem hard to you? But my dear, my dear,
good, honest, hard work will be the saving
of you."
"I am not a bit afraid of work," said
Margaret.
"Nor I, nor I," said Kitty and Betty.
Sibyl alone was silent.

mind. It has seemed to me that cleanliness,
and order, and refinement were not incom-
patible with the term. Now, I want this to
be an inexpensive boarding house, and I
want lady-girls, who come up to London
to work, to live here. I will make the
thing pay, for nothing would induce me to
consider it in any sense a charity, and you,
Margaret, and Kitty shall be the heads.
Either you or Kitty shall personally purchase
every scrap of food that comes into the
house. Either you or Kitty shall receive the
visitors, shall superintend the servants, shall
make yourself felt in every department of

money to keep the establishment going, and,
of course, receive every penny of the profits.
You four girls, if you agree to my scheme,
live here rent free. You have no expense
for food or lodging, and I will provide you
each with a moderate salary in addition. If
you dislike the idea of keeping a boarding
house, I know two excellent sisters to whom
I can give the posts, and we shall part none
the worse friends, I hope. My loves, you are
not to say anything about what you think to-
night. I am going home, for I am dead tired.
I'll call in at this same hour to-morrow, and
you shall let me know what you have really
decided."
Sibyl accompanied Miss Power downstairs.
In the hall the old lady put her arm round
the girl's neck.
" So you are going to marry Mark Danby,"
she said.
"I met him yesterday, and he asked me to
marry him," answered Sibyl.
"Well, child, it seems to me wonderful

how any girl can love a man well enough to
give herself up to him for life. You do, my
dear, I can see that-God help you. It
never was my way: I had my chances when
I was young and bonny, but I could not see
the force of that all-surrender business. And
many a time since I have thanked my lucky
star that I have remained Jessica Power."
"Wish me happiness, Jessica," said Sibyl,
in an eager, half-petulant voice.
"Of course I do, my dear. God bless you.
There is Susannah coming up the steps.
Good-night, Sibyl; Susannah, give me your
arm."
"Of all men in the world I wouldn't give
myself absolutely to Mark Danby," murmured
Miss Power. "Body and soul that child gives
herself up to him. There is no saving her;
the deed is done. Well, the world will always
be full of the worshiping sort of women.
They are the ruin of the men, but I suppose
there is no help for them. They can't be
drowned like kittens when they are babies,

worship. Their idols are all clay, and they
suffer. Some are of baser stuff than others;
that's the only difference.   There's nothing
vicious in Mark, but he's a bad sort for a
girl to cling on to. He's selfish, and weak,
and he's tied to his mother's apron-strings."

CHAPTER XIL
ASaTON MANOR was really only a Manor in
name. The house was large, it is true, but
there were no grounds to speak of. Ashton,
a charming village in Surrey, was surrounded
by many really beautiful gentlemen's seats.
The Manor was not beautiful. It was a gray
old house, squarely and plainly built; too old
to boast of any moder conveniences, not old
enough to be picturesque. The house, how.
ever, was left to Lady Jane Danby by her
father. She was a Marmaduke by birth, and
as proud of her blue blood as a titled dame
could be. She had married the Rev. Philip
Danby, a clergyman of the Church of England,
a man without any showy gifts. He was
poor, and it is to be supposed that, as no
woman ever lived who disliked poverty more
than Lady Jane, she must have married him
for love. He died, however, in the prime of
129


 
<pb n="130"/>
130        OUT OF THE FASHION.
his youth; some people whispered, because
Lady Jane's tongue had been too much for
him. He left a son and daughter to the care
of their mother, and shortly afterward she
went to live at Ashton Manor.
Philippa was the name of the girl; she took
after her father: was handsome, frank, and
outspoken. She was afraid of no one under
the sun, and was in consequence a universal
favorite. Mark was also a favorite, although
not with equal cause. He had Philippa's
eyes without their frankness; all Philippa's
passions were intensified in him, but self
was not primary in Philippa, as it was in
Mark.
Lady Jane Danby was poor, in that refined
sort of way which in no sense means priva-
tion. The young people had their modest
wants supplied. The Manor boasted of a
well-kept table, and the domestic service was
excellent. Philippa had even her own little
pony carriage, and Mark his West End club.
Mark was supposed to be reading for the bar
just now. He went to town daily. He


 
<pb n="131"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        131
sometimes stayed there for weeks at a time
with special chums of his own.
It was Lady Jane's nature to grumble, and
the young people often wondered what for.
On a certain July morning the three were
seated at breakfast. It was Saturday, and
Mark did not mean to go to town. Philippa,
in a white dress, was pouring out coffee, and
eagerly debating her chances in a tennis
tournament which was to take place in one
of their rich neighbors' grounds that after.
noon. Mark was fond of arguing with
Philippa; he was saying taunting things now
in a lazy voice, and the young lady's cheeks
were flushing, and her eyes gleaming angrily.
Lady Jane was absorbed in the contents of
a letter which had just arrived by the morn-
ng's post. The same post had also brought
Mark a letter, and Philippa noticed that he
slipped it unopened into his pocket. She
was curious about letters, and meant to get
at the contents of this one presently.
Now, raising her flushed face, she looked
across the table at her mother. Lady Jane

was not pleasant to behold when she was
cross, and she looked undoubtedly cross now.
"What's up, mamsey ?" inquired Philippa.
"Isn't your news pleasant    Who's your
correspondent "
"Philippa, you know I don't wish you to
call me ' mamsey.'"
"Well, mothery. Do say something nice
to me, mothery. Mark is making himself so
disagreeable."
Philippa's frank impertinence generally
won the day for her.
"You know, Phil, I would do anything I
could for you, but really I am harassed.
This letter is from Jessica Power. She
won't come."
"Well, let her stay away."
"My dear, that is all very fine, but you
know I particularly wanted her to be with
us next Saturday. The Vincents are coming,
and your cousins Violet and Clarissa Marma.
duke. Jessica is a host in herself on such
occasions."
"A power, you mean," retorted Philippa.


 
<pb n="133"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         133
Mark rose, stretched himself, and prepared
to leave the room.
"If you are going in for anything in such
awful form as bad puns, Phil, I will leave
you and mother to discuss this question by
yourselves," he said. "You will find me in
the library, when you want me."
He shut the door behind him. The mo-
ment he had done so, Lady Jane's tone be-
came very serious.
"Philippa," she said, "I am full of anx-
ieties."
"Oh, poor mothery!"
The girl went up to her, put her arm
round her neck, and itried to stroke out the
furrows on her forehead.
"With all your heedless ways, Phil, you
are a good child; you would not add to my
cares, I am sure. Philippa, it is most neces-
sary to keep excellent friends with Jessica."
"Well, mother, I thought we were ex-
cellent friends with her."
"Does it look like it when she refuses my
invitation ?"


 
<pb n="134"/>
134       OUT OF THE FASHION.
" She may have her reasons."
"Her reasons ! for not being able to come
to the country, from Saturday to Monday, an
old maid with nothing to do."
"Doesn't she state some cause in her
letter?"
"She says something about one of those
mad schemes she is always taking up. She
wants to give the last blow to the respectabil-
ity of her present address. She tells me she
has bought a house in Rosemary Gardens,
and means to turn it into a boarding house."
"A boarding house? oh, delicious I Will
she manage it herself ?"
" Philippa! Whatever Jessica's faults may
be, she is a lady."
Philippa was silent.  She had her own
ideas of what constituted a lady, but there
were prejudices in her mother's soul which
even she had not the courage to surmount
She skipped round this one now, and said,
adroitly:
" No doubt, mother, Miss Power will visit
us another Saturday."


 
<pb n="135"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          135
"As if that would do any good, child ! I
wanted her for next Saturday, for this day
week."
Philippa was silent for a moment.
"I wish, mamsey," she said then, "that
you would confide in me a little bit. Why
do you want this queer, unique Jessica of
yours to be here at the same time as my
cousin Clarissa "
Lady Jane was too much interested in her
subject to notice Philippa's use of the objec-
tionable term.
" Because Jessica is rich," she said; "enor-
mously rich. It is good to let your cousins
know that we are on the best of terms with
one so wealthy, so eccentric, so benevolent.
That is one reason. The second is this. Jes-
sica always makes a pet of Mark. It will be
good for his prospects with Clarissa, or, at
any rate, with Clarissa's father, that he
should appear to be a favorite with Miss
Power. Then, too, Jessica has great influ-
ence over him. Men, my dear Philippa, are
molded by women.      Mark can be guided


 
<pb n="136"/>
136        OUT OF THE FASHION.
in the direction which will lead to the
furtherance of my plans."
Philippa was again silent for nearly a min-
ute. Then she stooped down, and lightly
pressed her mother's forehead with her own
full red lips.
"Thank goodness for one thing, mam-
sey--"
" Child, child-that   obnoxious   word
again --
"Oh, pshaw! let it pass. I repeat, I am
thankful for one thing-that you don't make
plans for me; but you know better. -Ta, ta !
now I am off to Mark."
Philippa found her brother sauntering
lazily up and down the path which led from
the library to the shabby, little pretense of a
tennis-court, of which the Manor alone could
boast. He did not look up when the girl ap-
proached.
"Hullo!" she called, in a gay, semi-
boyish manner, "here I come with a bud-
get of news. What will you give me
for it?"


 
<pb n="137"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        137
"Nothing,"  answered   Mark.   "I am
worried; I don't want to hear any news."
" Well, let me slip my hand through your
arm. You can listen or not as you please. I
must unburden myself."
Mark made no reply. Philippa established
her slim hand cosily, and began:
"First of all, Jessica won't come. Sec.
ond, Jessica has bought a boarding house.
Whether she will manage it or not personally
is at present unknown. Mamsey, being pre-
judiced, gives a decided opinion on that point,
but the fact of her being prejudiced prevents
her opinion from being of the smallest value.
I incline to the belief that Jessica will be head
of her own boarding house, and, if so, I mean
to go there the next time I visit London.
- Why, what is the matter, Mark  How jerky
your arm is this morning! You are most un-
kind to my poor hand."
" I have told you that I am worried about
things."
"And so is mother worried. What a good
thing Philippa never is! By the way, Marky,

pet, who was that pretty little letter from
this morning ? The one you slipped into your
pocket-you remember."
Danby colored slightly.
"From one of my tradespeople," he replied.
"0 Mark! Where do bad boys go? I
won't ask you any more questions."
"I wish you wouldn't, Phil. I've got such
a beastly headache I scarcely know what to
do with myself."
"I'm ever so sorry. If I were a model
sister, I'd say that I'd like to bear it for you,
but, as I'm not, I can't make myself so agree-
able. Good-by, Marky."
WThen Philippa was out of sight Danby
took the letter which had excited her curiosity
once more out of his pocket. He read its
contents eagerly, his eyes roving over the
words as if he would devour them, and some-
thing of that fierce, absolute sense of posses-
sion coming into his face which had filled it
when he looked at Sibyl in Rosemary Gardens.
He was looking at her writing now. When
he had read to the end of the closely-written


 
<pb n="139"/>
OUT OF THE FASIIION.          139
pages, he turned and went back to the library.
He kept an old portfolio in a corner there,
and a bottle of ink, and a few bad pens. He
sat down with his back to the window, and
began to reply to Sibyl's letter. He was not
at all a good letter-writer, and now so many
conflicting emotions were agitating him that
he had less control over his mode of expression
than usual.
He tore up several sheets of paper before he
wrote a reply to his satisfaction. In the end
the letter was very short, and only those who
could read between the lines could make
much out of it.
I have got yours [wrote Mark]. I am astonished
--ihightened. What you propose is impossible. I
will come on Monday at three. Leare the matter an
open question until then.

CHAPTER XIII.
EVEN deserted gardens have their uses;
even weeds can grow apace without being all
on the side of bad. The square of ground in
the center of that other square which was
known as Rosemary Gardens was certainly
not a spot to be desired for any attractions
of its own on a hot afternoon toward the
end of July. In July no London trees
look well; the smuts have almost done
their worst with them by that time; they
look parched and shriveled; in fact, the
beautiful creatures are thickly coated with
dirt.
The tender green of most young vegetable
life makes these same trees worth beholding
early in May, but at the end of July all
freshness has departed, and they are no
longer pleasant to the sight.
Even in May the square of ground in
140


 
<pb n="141"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         141
Rosemary Gardens was a poor place. In
July it was positively hideous.
Nevertheless this so-called "garden" had
its advantages, for those who went there
were as sure of privacy as they would have
been many miles from the haunts of men.
About three o'clock on Monday afternoon
Sibyl Ross went into the square garden to
meet her lover.  She had dressed herself
with extreme care for the meeting; her dress
was of delicate pink cambric; on her head
she wore a large, picturesque, black lace hat.
The hat had a bunch of pink roses in it.
Sibyl was one of those girls who looked
charming in pink. For some reason it toned
with her own coloring, making her eyes look
deeper and bluer, her complexion more
peach-like in its bloom, her hair a ruddier
gold than any other color would. Pink
made Sibyl look a veritable rosebud. She
tripped across the ugly garden now, and in a
moment she was in her lover's arms.
Danby was really Sibyl's lover. He cared
for her with a fierce passion; he wanted to

have her, to hold her. Life without her
seemed    insupportable.  Such  a  passion
might or might not last, but, while it was
paramount in such a turbulent, unruly spirit
as animated Mark Danby's breast, it was
overmastering in its power.
For a few minutes this pair of young
lovers only looked at one another, too happy
to be together to care to give utterance to
any words. The ugly, deserted garden was
to them as if all the flowers of Paradise grew
there, and as if all the birds that sang to
Adam were making music for their ears.
Sibyl was the first to break the spell.
"O  Mark," she said, with a long, deep
sigh, "your letter gave me such a fright. I
was miserable after I read it."
On hearing these words Mark pulled him-
self together. He had not come into the
square just to kiss Sibyl, and to hold her
hand. He had a task to get through-not a
pleasant one.
"I want to talk to you very seriously," he
began.


 
<pb n="143"/>
OUT OF TIIE FASHION.       143
"Oh, don't,   Mark! your eyes quite
frighten me."
"Take my hand, Sibyl; don't look at my
eyes. Listen to my words. Sibyl, I have
not told my mother yet that we are en--
gaged(."
"Oh!"
Sibyl shrank a little away from Mark.
" I will, of course, my darling, and she'll
thank me for bringing her anything half as
sweet as you. But just at present I know
she has got all kinds of ideas in her head
about me."
"What ideas, Mark?"
Sibyl no longer leant against Danby. She
sat a little away from him, the damask in her
cheek's growing deeper and deeper.
"Why, puss, you are not vexed?" said
Mark. " What are a mother's ideas to a man
who has given his whole heart to a lovely,
bewitching little creature like you?  My
mother doesn't know you, Sibyl."
" But what are her ideas, Mark ?"
"Oh, I can't exactly tell you. I suppose


 
<pb n="144"/>

she would like me to marry some hideous old
thing with a lot of money. Not that she
has ever said as much. But a fellow can see
the way the wind blows."
"Marry the old thing then, Mark. Go
away and marry her."
Sibyl had risen; her lips were trembling,
her eyes full of tears. She looked prettier
than she had ever looked in her helpless,
impotent, little rage, which she knew in her
heart of hearts she could only keep up for a
moment or two.
Mark drew her to him and kissed her
again.
"There, that is my only answer to you,
Sibyl," he said. " But now I have a serious
little matter to talk over with you. I am not
going to tell my mother yet that we are en-
gaged, but I will very soon. Sibyl, what
was that rubbish you wrote to me about you
and your sisters turning No. 80 into a board-
ing house ?"
"0 Mark, don't you like it? We are
ever so pleased and excited. It is dear Jes.

sica Power's doing. She has bought the
house and the furniture, and she will find the
boarders, and the money to board them with.
Maggie and Kitty are to housekeep, and
Betty is to be accountant, and I, my dear sir,"
here Sibyl dropped a bewitching courtesy,
" am to represent the ornamental member of
the staff. I am to look as pretty as I can
myself, and I am to keep the house sweet,
and bright, and gay, and I am to entertain
the visitors."
"Oh! And how will you entertain them,
pray?"
"Why, sing to them, and play to them,
and tell gay little stories, and get up round
games in the evening. Oh, there are hun-
dreds of ways."
"Doubtless," replied Mark, in a gloomy
voice. " And some of the boarders will be
young men, perhaps? And you will play
and sing for them, and look pretty for them,
and keep the house gay and bright, and
charming for their benefit ? "
"No, Mark; we are not going to have

young men boarders. Jessica does not think
that would do. The house is to be a board-

how to act as ladies. And Jessica wishes it
to be more than a boarding house. She
wants it to be a home."
" And you are to wear yourself to a skele.
ton, keeping these maidens amused ?     I
should imagine that of all the trying occu-
pations under the sun, women making end-
less mirth for one another must be one of the
worst."
"But I daresay there'll be lots of young
men, too, for, of course, the girls must be
allowed to see their friends at No. 80, and
perhaps some of them, Mark, will be like
you and like me. It will be very interesting
to watch them."
"Now look here, SibyL  This thing can't
be. I have listened to you long enough.

is what it amounts to. Sibyl, if I were to
tell my mother that I had engaged myself to
a girl who occupied herself in the manner
you have just described, it would kill her;
it really would. My mother is a proud
woman, and she'd simply die of it. I daren't
run the risk. Sibyl, I've come here to-day
to ask you to give it up."
"But, Mark, we are poor. Dear Mark, be
reasonable. Oh, I won't be one scrap less a
lady. Dear Mark, don't look at me like
that."
"Socially you will be no longer a lady,
Sibyl."
Mark got up now, and absolutely turned
his back. He walked a few paces away and
stood looking gloomily across the ugly
garden, poking at the dusty, hard ground
with the point of a little cane which he
carried.
Now, had Sibyl one scrap of spirit, she
would have stolen away at that moment, and
given Mark Danby up there and then. But,
instead of doing this, the poor little soul sat


 
<pb n="148"/>
148        OUT OF THE FASHION.
crouched up in a corner of the rickety old
bench, her eyes growing very big and
frightened, and her lips very piteous.
Mark was saying most detestable things;
all the best part in her nature cried out
against him-and yet-and yet-still he was
her idol-her king, and the king could do no
wrong. Oh, she hated him! How could he
be so mean as to tell her she would not be a
lady because she earned her bread honestly 
But oh, again, she could not hate him; for he
was her very own Mark, to whom she had
given herself absolutely and forever.
She raised her eyes timidly, and looked
at the back of her hero. Mark had those
square shoulders and that well-knit figure
which young Britishers adore. Sibyl could
not help a small, comforting glow of pride
stealing back into her heart, as she reflected
that those shoulders and that adorable form
belonged to her own acknowledged lover.
In a blind little rush and tempest of feeling
she had left the rickety bench, and stood in
front of Mark.

"I don't agree with you," she said. "My
ideas and yours are altogether'at issue. You
asked me to marry you some days ago, and
then you knew that my father had fled from
the country in dishonor. But you loved me,
and you wanted me for myself. When you
knew what my father did I could scarcely
have blamed you, Mark, if you had never
come back to me. When you did come, I
thought what a prince among men you were.
Do you know, Mark, that for years-for at
least two years, we lived in that fine house
over there on the charity of our tradespeople ?
We were clothed by them, and fed by them,
and we did not pay them. I doubt if they
will ever be paid anything beyond a very
small percentage. Of course we girls did
not do it knowingly; still the fact remains
that we did it. When you engaged your-
self to me last week, Mark, did it enter
into your, head that you were going to
marry a girl who had ceased to be a
lady ?"
"That is    stuff!" responded  Danby.


 
<pb n="150"/>
150       OUT OF THE FASHION.
" Your father is not the first man who has
failed: you talk like a child."
"I don't. I talk like an honorable woman.
I don't think I was a lady during those years
when I lived on what did not belong to me;
but I think when I help to take care of Jessica's
boarding house that I shall be the real kind
of honorable lady that God meant me to be."
Danby looked into Sibyl's eyes. They
were always sweet in their expression. Now
the suffering soul which filled them brought
a light into their depths before which his
own fell.
" Look here," he said, after a pause, in which
he had the grace to feel ashamed of himself,
"I can't argue with you, Sib. You may be
right, but the world doesn't look at things
in that way, and the fact is you must give up
taking any share in that boarding house if you
intend to become engaged to me."
" But, Mark, how am I to earn my bread ?"
"Has not your uncle, Mr. Ross, offered you
a home ?"
"0 Mark I"

"My darling, I want you to go there for a
little. Not for long, for we must be married
soon. Of that I am determined. I come in-
to a little bit of property when I am twenty-
five, and if nothing better offers we can start
housekeeping on that, only you must not have
part or lot in the boarding house scheme,
SibyL"

CHAPTER XIV.
IT took Margaret Ross and her sisters
twenty-four hours to think over Miss Power's
scheme. At the end of that time they ac-
cepted their own lot in the matter. They
did this with a little doubt and a certain
amount of hesitation. They did not say to
themselves "We are going down irretrievably
in the social scale," but nevertheless they
felt it, and they took the plunge as one gets
into a cold bath-with a little reluctance.
Then came the reaction. They had done
right, and their spirits began to glow; their
consciences smiled on them, and an easy con-
science is seldom unaccompanied by happi-
ness. Day after day they liked the scheme
of the boarding house better and better; the
social descent was forgotten in the interest
of the work itself. A great burden of care
seemed to have been lifted from four pairs of
152


 
<pb n="153"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         153
young shoulders, and the girls could laugh
merrily, and be so cheerful that censorious
neighbors pronounced them heartless.
By the way, it is wonderful how good peo-
ple preach contentment and resignation in
the midst of affliction, and then glare at the
afflicted one if he or she happens to wear a
smiling face. "Heartless" the victim is in-
stantly designated.
Now the four Ross girls were spoken of as
destitute of feeling by a good many of the
inhabitants of Rosemary Gardens just then;
but, as they did not care what the neighbors
thought, this fact did not trouble them.
Finding her scheme was working so admir-
ably, Miss Power threw herself into it heart
and soul. She, Margaret, and Kitty spent
many long mornings together. The linen-
room was overhauled, the china presses were
examined, the contents of the glass cupboard
turned out. Then came delightful expedi-
tions to different noted shops, where the di-
minished stores could be replenished, and the
house put into apple-pie order.


 
<pb n="154"/>
154        OUT OF THE FASHION.
Miss Power intended the boarding house
to be ready for occupation on the first of
September, and the girls had just a month to
make all their preparations. Maggie once
asked rather wonderingly, "Suppose no
boarders come ?" but Miss Power's dark eyes
fairly ran over with merriment on hearing
this.
"Oh, my love," she said, "the house will
be full, from attic to cellar. You leave that
part of the business to me, my dear girls."
The first cloud which darkened the sun-
shine of the boarding-house idea came from
Sibyl. The other girls were perhaps too
busy to notice that little nineteen-year-old
looked grave when they laughed; that, when
she did smile and joke, the mirth was of
rather a forced character. The best girls
will be selfish in that sort of way when they
are very much occupied, and, had any of
them guessed how sore poor Sibyl's warm
heart felt, they would have cried by the hour
with her out of sympathy.
Since her interview with Mark, Sibyl had,

however, managed to elude suspicion, but at
last the day came when she felt she must in.
flict a cruel blow both on herself and her
sisters.
The morning post brought a letter from
Uncle David Ross. It was a thick letter en-
cased in a square envelope. The front of
the envelope was addressed to
Miss SIBYL Ross,
80 Rosemary Gardens.
The back had "SHORTLANDS" printed in
large, ugly capitals across its flap. There
was the Yorkshire postmark as well: no one
could for an instant mistake the letter.
Sibyl turned pink and then white when
she received it.
"Good gracious!" exclaimed Kitty. "That
letter is from poor old Uncle David. What a
shame ! We have been so busy we never
wrote to the poor old boy to tell him of our
change of plans."
"Well, you need not talk of him in that
disrespectful way as an old boy," answered


 
<pb n="156"/>
156        OUT OF THE FASHION.
Betty. "I can tell you, he would be angry
if he heard you, Kit."
" What care I ?" responded Kitty. "Mag.
gie, please pass me the toast; I'm regularly
famished. Thanks to Jessica, the old dear
can't do us much harm now, and I'm free to
speak of him as I please. Oh! shall I ever
forget the way he sat and looked round the
drawing-room that awful morning he in-
tended to crush us? He'd have done it,
too, if it hadn't been for that darling
Jessica."
"Sibyl, dear, why don't you open your
letter?"  asked   Margaret.    She  looked
kindly at her younger sister, and noticed for
the first time that she was only playing
with her breakfast.
"That letter contains a check," said Kitty.
"A check for your second-class fare to
Shortlands, Sib. You'll have to send it back
to-day. Be sure you write a pretty note of
thanks with it."
To the astonishment of the other three
Sibyl's reply to this innocent speech was a


 
<pb n="157"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       157
burst of tears, a rush across the room, and an
absolute collapse into Maggie's outstretched
arms.
"What is it ?" exclaimed   Kitty and
Betty. " What is wrong!"
"Hush," replied Maggie. "The child has
a trouble on her. She would not sob like
this for nothing.  Would you like to be
alone with me, Sibyl darling? Shall we go
into my little study ?"
"For goodness sake, don't leave us out of
it ?" said Betty. "Aren't we all sisters, and
doesn't Sib know that we'd half-kill anyone
who was unkind to her. There, Sib, you
don't mind my kneeling here and rubbing
your cold, shaking hand, do you ? "
"And you always did say that Kitty's
touch made your headache go away. You
don't want poor Kit not to touch your gold
locks, Sib ? " said Kitty.
"I love her to touch them!" said Sibyl,
speaking with sudden passion. " Your hand
is darling, Betty, and Maggie, oh, Maggie-
what the feel of your arm is to me ! But I


 
<pb n="158"/>

must go away, I must; I must go and live
with Uncle David Ross."
"You must go and live with Uncle David
Ross ?" almost screamed Kitty, who was of
a very excitable temperament. "Have you
gone right out of your mind, Sibyl? Why,
you are to stay here, and be the ornament of
the boarding house, and Jessica is to pay you
forty pounds a year. What are you talking
in that wild fashion for ?"
"I must go to Uncle David," said Sibyl.
"It isn't wild, it's true; I must keep that
check, and I must go to Shortlands. I must
be Muriel's companion. You can't shake me,
any of you; I have promised, and I must do
it."
"Who have you made this promise to,
darling ?" asked Margaret.
"To-to-Mark."
"Oh!"
Betty left off stroking Sibyl's hand, and
Kitty no longer touched her head; Margaret's
arms, however, remained as firmly round her


 
<pb n="159"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       159
slight waist as ever, and it was to Margaret
she now spoke.
"You know, Maggie, I must do what
Mark wishes."
" When you are married to him, perhaps,"
muttered Betty.
"If you marry him !" exclaimed Kitty.
"I must do what Mark wishes," repeated
Sibyl, in a dreary tone. Then, seeing the
mocking smile on Betty's face, her cheeks
flushed and her eyes glowed. She drew her-
self away from Margaret, and stood erect.
"I love to do what Mark wishes! I dare
anyone to prevent me."
"Oh, good gracious!" exclaimed Betty.
"Tell us what you mean, dear," said Mar-
garet, trying to take the excited girl's hand.
"I mean this," answered Sibyl. "I told
Mark about the boarding house, and he-he
was shocked. And he-he said-I should
not be a lady if I did what I-I meant to do.
I shouldn't be a lady socially. Mark said I
must go and live with Uncle David, and I-


 
<pb n="160"/>
160        OUT OF THE FASMION.
I promised him. Mind, girls, I don't agree
with him, but I promised him; I must and I
will obey him, for I love him better than all
the rest of the world!"
"Well?" exclaimed    Kitty, "after that,
Sibyl, I have only one thing to say, and that
is, I'm thankful on my own account!"
"What do you mean, Kitty ? "
"That I've not been blessed with a Mark
to obey. Come along, Betty, there's no use
in our wasting words here. I am sorry for
you, Sibyl; I would not be in your shoes for
a good deal."
Later in that same morning, Sibyl, with red
rings round her eyes, wrote to Mr. David
Ross, acknowledging his check, and naming
the day and hour when she would arrive at
Shortlands. When she had finished the first
letter she wrote a second. The second was to
Mark. In this she gave him her new address,
for she was to go to Shortlands in a couple of
days' time. In the second letter, too, she was
very careful to suppress all her real feeling.
She did not allow a murmuring word to escape


 
<pb n="161"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          161
her, and took infinite pains to make the dreary
future which lay at her door appear as bright
as possible to the man she loved.
In a short postscript she did, however, allow
her suffering little heart to give utterance to
one wail.
"0   Mark! write to me as often as ever
you can," said this simple postscript.
Danby got this letter as usual at breakfast-
time. He slipped it into his pocket unopened,
and read it afterward at his leasure. He
thought the letter dull, not to say stupid:
Sibyl's old sweet self did not rise before him
in a series of little pictures as he read. He
wondered why the letter lacked freshness; he
tried reading it over twice, and the second
time he yawned as he perused it.
At this very moment poor Sibyl's numerous
small possessions were being packed away in
one or two large trunks, which were to accom-
pany her td Shortlands. The next morning
early the other sisters in a body went with her
to Euston, and found a dull old lady who did
not object to being the pretty girl's escort to

Yorkshire. There were some kisses ex.
changed, and some very hard squeezes of the
hand, and then the train slowly puffed out of
the great station, and the three girls, who were
to conduct Miss Power's boarding house in
Rosemary Gardens, went slowly home. They
felt very subdued and sad without little nine-
teen-year-old, and even Kitty could not be flip-
pant for an hour or two. In the course of
the morning, however, she was seen to hug
herself ecstatically more than once.
" Oh, thank goodness I'm not engaged," she
said. On the last occasion she made this re-
mark she was in the linen room counting the
new pillow-cases, and Miss Power happened to
be not far away.
"Come here, Katharine, and let me kiss
you," said the old lady.  "Them's my senti.
ments.   But all the same, my love, I expect
you will sing another song before the year is
out. I never met the girl yet who did not
want to be wooed and married and a'   "
"This girl is an exception," said Kitty.
"She has Sibyl as a warning."

CHAPTER XV.
SIBYL had to change trains at York. She
waited there for half-an-hour, and then
traveled by a very slow local train to a
small station about three miles away from
Shortlands.  She was the only passenger
who alighted at this station. A girl in a
brown holland dress was walking slowly up
and down on the platform when the train
crept into view. She was a slightly-made
girl, with light-brown hair, and light-gray
eyes. Her features were thin and sharp, her
face pale. On her head she wore a brown
hat, trimmed simply with a band of its own
color.  A  more quiet, expressionless little
figure could scarcely be imagined.
Sibyl opened the door of her second-class
carriage, sprang lightly to the ground, and
ran to meet her.
"You are my cousin, Muriel?" she said.
1RR


 
<pb n="164"/>
164        OUT OF THE FASHION.
"Yes; had you not better see about your
luggage ? The train will not stay here a mo-
ment."
"Oh, good gracious!" replied Sibyl, "and
I have left no end of things in the car-
riage."
Miss Ross flew back again like lightning;
she was all animation and brightness and
color beside the other girl in her drab
clothes.
"Come and help me get my things out,"
said Sibyl.
Muriel stood on the platform.     Sibyl
mounted into the carriage, which she had
traveled in alone, and began pulling railway-
rugs, a luncheon-basket, a traveling bag, and
parcel of umbrellas and parasols, along with
sundry books and newspapers out of the
wire cage which ran along the top of the
compartment. These she tossed into Muriel's
arms, and jumped out herself just as the train
began to move.
"Is there no porter about !" she asked.
"Oh, yes, old Williams.    He is seeing


 
<pb n="165"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         165
about your luggage. Have you many boxes 
What a lot of loose things you have traveled
with!
" Do you call those many ?" asked Sibyl.
"I wish you could see Kitty when she is on a
journey !"
Muriel made no response whatever to this.
She turned, so that her companion could see
her in profile (Muriel's profile was even less
attractive than her full face), and waited un-
til Williams, the old porter, appeared, pushing
Sibyl's trunks before him on a barrow.
Williams panted as he walked, and Muriel
went gravely up to him, and began an earnest
colloquy.
Sibyl stood a few paces behind, holding all
her loose possessions.
"Muriel has never said she is glad to see
me; she has not even said,' How do you do ? "'
she murmured. Sibyl bit her lips and tried
to keep the tears back. In a moment Muriel
returned.
"I am sorry," she said, in her grave, thin,
uninteresting voice," but it will be impossible


 
<pb n="166"/>
166        OUT OF TIE FASHION.
to have your trunks conveyed to Shortlands
to-day."
"But I really must have some clothes," be-
gan Sibyl, aghast.
"I am sorry," repeated Muriel; "but your
trunks are so unusally large that they cannot
go on the carriage, even though mother did
send the brougham with the rail round on
purpose. The carrier must bring your trunks.
There is no other method."
"Well, can he bring them to-day ?"
"I don't think so, but I can inquire."
Muriel returned to consult with old Wil-
liams; she came back in a moment.
"Williams says that Dawson, the carrier,
only calls here once a week; his day is Fri-
day. He will bring your trunks to Short-
lands on Friday. His charge will be half-a-
crown, but you can pay on delivery. I am
sorry, but there is no help for it. Will you
come now ? I must not keep the horses wait.
ing any longer."
Sibyl felt herself growing very angly.
"This is Wednesday," she said, "and I am


 
<pb n="167"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       167
to do without any of my property till Friday
evening ?"
" I did not say 'evening'-the carrier may
be able to bring your trunks in the after-
noon."
"Afternoon, or evening, what does it sig-
nify ? Am I to do without even a pair of
slippers to put on until whenever the carrier
arrives? You must be reasonable, Muriel,
and, if my trunks cannot possibly be conveyed
to Shortlands sooner than Friday, you must
at least allow me to open one of them, and
take out a few necessary articles I shall re-
quire."
Muriel looked dubious over this. Open-
ing trunks at a railway station was not in
her experience of life. She was a girl who
was not fond of new sensations; she de-
murred a little, but in the end consented
to accompany her cousin into a kind of shed,
where  the  trunks were   deposited  by
Williams, who stood by without offering any
assistance while Sibyl unlocked one, and
took out in a hurry those clothes she could


 
<pb n="168"/>
168        OUT OF THE FASHIO,.
least well do without. Muriel also stood by
without helping.
"Will you follow me to the carriage
now ?" she said in her even tone, when Sibyl
had supplied herself sufficiently.
As they stepped into the comfortable, well-
appointed brougham, Muriel touched Sibyl
on her knee.
"You had better give Williams a shil-
ling? " she said. " He has taken a good deal
of trouble."
"In what way, I wonder," thought Sibyl
to herself; but she dropped the coin into the
old man's horny palm without a protest.
The drive to Shortlands was up one dusty
hill and down another. A high wind was
blowing, and the dust penetrated through
the crevices of the closed brougham. It was
hot and close inside, and the choking dust
made Sibyl sneeze once or twice.
"Don't you think we might have one of
the windows opened a tiny way ?" she ven-
tured at last to expostulate.
"I am sorry to disoblige you," answered


 
<pb n="169"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       169
Muriel, "but mother never likes me to sit in
a draught. I am not strong."
Sibyl leant wearily back against the
cushions.
"Muriel," she said suddenly, when the
dust and the heat and the stuffiness had be.
come unendurable, "aren't you going to ask
me any questions at all ?"
" Well," answered Muriel, calmly, "I don't
know that I want to begin just now."
"Why ?" asked Sibyl, in surprise.
"You are going to stay a long time with
us-to live with us. There will be heaps of
time to ask you questions."
"How calm you are?" said Sibyl. She
longed to add, "How cold, how horrid, how
maddening ?" but she refrained.
"May I ask you questions instead?" she
asked.
"If you like."
" What do you do with yourself all day at
Shortlands ? "
" What do I do with myself all day ?" re-
peated Muriel, slowly. "It would take me a


 
<pb n="170"/>
170       OUT OF THE FASHION.
long time to answer that question, Sibyl. I
do so many things."
"Yes, yes-well, when you want to amuse
yourself, I mean. You give up some part of
the day to amusement, don't you ? "
"A little time, now and then, perhaps."
"What do you do in the little time ?"
" If it is wet, I sit in the drawing room, and
read aloud to mother. I am reading 'Ali.
son's History of Europe' to her now. Do
you know it ? It is in twenty volumes!"
"Good gracious! no, I don't."
"I don't think mother will like to hear
you say' Good gracious,' Sibyl. It is kinder
perhaps for me to tell you at once that
mother has the greatest horror of all exag-
gerated expressions. She has taught me
never to say a single word more than I
mean."
" I am sure you never do that," said Sibyl,
with fervor.
"No; I hope I never do. Shall I tell you
more about my amusements ? On fine days
I botanize with mother; or if she is occupied


 
<pb n="171"/>
OUT' OF THE FASHlION.       171
with her Waif and Stray Society I dig in my
own little garden. Are you fond of garden-
ing, Sibyl ? Don't you think it is interesting
to watch the growth of Nature even in the
smallest plants ?"
" Look here," said Sibyl, ungratefully, " I'm
a town girl, and I don't know anything
about country pursuits. I don't want to
garden, nor to study botany, nor to read
history aloud to your mother. Please let
me walk up this hill, Muriel, for, if I
don't get some air immediately, I shall
suffocate."
Muriel glanced around at Sibyl.
" You look hot," she said; "that is because
you have excited yourself. There was no oc-
casion.  I don't want you to join in my
pleasures; never expected you to like them."
Then she pulled the check-string.  The
carriage drew up, and Sibyl got out. She
almost ran up the hill, she walked so fast.
She got the air into her lungs again, and a
gleam of hope stole back into her heart. At
the top of the hill was a stile, and at the


 
<pb n="172"/>
172       OUT OF THE FASHION.
other side of the stile a narrow, golden-yel.
low path wandered in a diverse ribbon fash-
ion across a moor; the moor was covered
with bracken, and the bracken was showing
brown and yellow in patches.
Sibyl's eyes began to dance at this sight,
and her heart to move more quickly in her
breast.
When the brougham appeared on the sum-
mit of the hill she ran up to the carriage
window.
"Muriel, where does that lovely path
lead "
"What lovely path ?"
"That one at the other end of the stile."
"It leads home-to Shortlands."
"Then I will go that way. Good-by. Oh,
someone is sure to tell me how to get to your
place."
Before Muriel could expostulate, Sibyl
was over the stile, and flying down the path,
rendered yellow by the evening sun.
Nearly an hour later a disheveled-looking,
untidy girl was ushered by the gray-haired

lands.
"Oh, I am so sorry, Uncle David," began
Sibyl at once. She walked up to her uncle,
who was standing on the hearthrug.     "I
lost my way on the moor, but it was so ex-
quisite, and I found these flowers. May I
give them to you, Aunt Matilda ?"
Mrs. Ross was a very large edition of
Muriel; Mrs. Ross was Muriel stout and
middle-aged.  She looked at her husband,
took no notice whatever of the flowers, but
walked two or three steps down the room to
meet Sibyl.
"How do you do, Sibyl?" she said; and
she pushed her pale cheek forward for Sibyl
to kiss.
"How do you do, Sibyl ?" said her uncle.
Sibyl looked round for Muriel. She was
standing at a little distance, pouring weak
tea into cups of rare old china.
"Sibyl," said her uncle, "we will say
nothing about it on this occasion, but it is
against the rules of Shortlands for any girl

who happens to be here to venture on the
moors alone.  You will remember that in
future, my dear. Matilda, shall I ring the
bell ?"
"Thank you, David," responded Mrs.
Ross.
The bell was rung, and in a moment the
old servant appeared.
"Jonathan," said Mrs. Ross, "take that
rubbish out of the room."
The rubbish consisted of Sibyl's flowera

SHORTLANDS    was a   large, square-built
house; it had a wide entrance hall in the
middle, and square sitting rooms to right and
left. There was the drawing room and th6
morning room at one side of the hall, and at
the other the dining room and the library.
The kitchens were underneath in a great,
well-drained  basement.   Mr. and     Mrs.
Ross thought basements were wholesome,
and, notwithstanding the abundanco of
ground-room, preferred having their dinners
cooked under their sitting rooms. Upstairs
on the first floor were large, solidly-furnished
bedrooms. On the second floor were more
bedrooms, less solidly furnished, and above
these were the servants' comfortable attics.
There was not an unexpected angle or
corner anywhere at Slortlands. The house
was built for utility, for service, for a calm

and well-ordered life. In this house Muriel
had been born. She had been brought up in
it, educated, partly by her mother, and
partly by a governess of the old school.
Muriel had responded to the pains bestowed
upon her in the kindest way; she had been
brought up in grooves, and her whole nature
now fitted nicely into the space allotted to it.
There was no room for outward growth in
Muriel's grooves; but then she did not wish
to grow.
Sibyl thought that she had never seen any
one quite so strange and incomprehensible as
Muriel. What Muriel thought about her
London cousin was not revealed.
After tea the girls went upstairs to the
second floor, where Muriel showed Sibyl the
neat, square bedroom which she was to occupy;
the bedroom was clothed in drab. In itself
it was essentially ugly, but its windows com.
manded a view of the moor across which Sibyl
had walked.
The sun was more slanting now than it had
been an hour and a half ago, and there was a


 
<pb n="177"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          177
greater glory of color lying across the
bracken and the heather. Sibyl's spirits had
been down to zero, until Muriel opened the
door of her bedroom, and revealed this view
to her through its windows. The color and
brightness rushed back to her eyes at the
sight; her cheeks became rosy red; she
clasped her cousin's hand.
"0 Muriel, how exquisite! Do come and
look!" she exclaimed.
"At what ?" asked Muriel.
"The view, the sunset-the color on the
moor! Do, do come and look at it."
"You are from London," said Muriel, "and
father tells me you never see sunsets there.
You will be accustomed to this in a few days."
She twisted her hands out of Sibyl's, and
stood on the hearthrug, looking round the
chamber. Sibyl perched herself on the
window-ledge, pressed her face against the
glass and gazed out. After a time she gave
utterance to a deep, long, satisfied sigh, sprang
lightly to the ground, and, running impulsively
up to Muriel, kissed her.


 
<pb n="178"/>
178       OUT OF THE FASHION.
"Thank you for giving me this lovely,
lovely room," she said.
"I wish you would not exaggerate," replied
Muriel. " This is not at all a lovely room: it
is plain and neat. Mother says a bedroom
should never be more. Please just listen to me
a moment, Sibyl, while I tell you about the ar-
rangements. When your trunks come you
can hang your dresses in this wardrobe; your
linen and smaller articles will go into that
chest of drawers in the corner. This deep
cupboard, you see, holds your bath, and there
is a shelf above for your boots and shoes.
Mother will like us both to keep our rooms
very tidy. Now I think I will leave you for
a little; we dine at seven o'clock. The dress-
ing bell rings at twenty minutes to seven, and
we assemble in the drawing room at five
minutes to the dinner hour. Good-by for
the present, Sibyl."
Muriel walked out of the room without
waiting for her cousin's response. The mo-
ment she had gone Sibyl rushed to the door
to lock it: there was no key in the lock.


 
<pb n="179"/>
OUT OF THE FASIION.       179
She looked around her half desperately. At
that moment she would have thought very
little of dragging the chest of drawers across
the room to barricade the door, and so secure
her privacy. She refrained fromi doing this;
but she did not refrain from dancing madly
on the floor, and pushing her hands through
her hail; and even pinching one hand with
the other.
" Prison would be better!" she said at last.
"   Mark, Mark! what am 1 not giving up
for your sake ? "
The though of Mark soothed and even
calmedher. Sibyl was the sort of girl who
would sacrifice much for the man she loved
-who would glory in her sacrifice, and, up to
a certain point, enjoy it. She ceased to dance
on the floor, and, going to the window,
opened it wide, and leant half out.
The breeze, which had blown dust into her
eyes as she and Muriel drove together in the
brougham, now brought strength and refresh.
ment. The first gong sounded; she put in
her head, and turned to the dressing-table to

make what toilet she could. She was deter-
mined now to be brave, to make the best of
things, and to look as pretty as she possibly
could for Mark's sake. To-night she had no
dinner dress to put on, but she could make
her wavy golden hair as fluffy, as soft, as
picturesque as hair could look. Sibyl had
never descended to the adoption of an abso-
lute fringe, but she had short locks curling
here and there on her temples, and wavy
tendrils of those bright threads of gold
would get loose from their pins, and fall
about her neck, and nestle round her ears.
Kitty and Betty thought nothing more
beautiful than Sibyl's head when she had
tossed it into order, as they expressed it, with
a pitchfork.
To-night the tossed condition had even a
daring appearance: it seemed so out of keep-
ing with the neatness and composure of Short-
lands.
But Sibyl had no adornment for this first
dinner but her bright hair, and she was deter
mined to make the most of it.


 
<pb n="181"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        181
When the second gong sounded Muriel
knocked at her door; Muriel's little head
looked as if it were clothed in satin. Her
light-brown, thick hair was parted in front,
and plaited in a tight mass round the back
of her head. Not a hair dared to displace
itself; all was neatness and order. Muriel
wore a brown check silk dress; beside Sibyl
she looked the most modest of maidens.
The girls went down to the drawing room
without uttering a word. When they
entered the room they found Mr. and Mrs.
Ross standing together on the hearthrug
talking to a young clergyman, who was pres.
ently introduced to Sibyl as Mr. Purcell.
" Mr. Purcell is our new curate," whispered
Muriel; "you will hear him preach on Sun.
day. Mother takes the greatest comfort in
his ministrations."
It was Sibyl's turn now to make no re
sponse. She went over to the window, and
gave a faint, impatient sigh when she dis.
covered that no window in the drawing room
looked over the moor. Dinner was an-

nounced, and the family migrated into the
dining room. Sibyl found herself opposite
to Muriel and Mr. Purcell. She could not
help observing that Mr. Purcell's dull, gray
eyes traveled very often in her direction'
during the meal. They seemed, as far as
she could gather, to wear an approving and
even delighted expression. This was some
sort of comfort, for Mr. and Mrs. Ross also
looked at her constantly, and their eyes ex-
pressed the reverse of approval or delight.
Mr. Ross, while he ate his soup, kept his
large, prominent eyes so determinately fixed
upon the top of her head that she began to
wonder if a hair-pin had suddenly taken
upon itself to stand up straight.
After dinner Mrs. Ross called Sibyl to her
side.
"My dear," she said, "I will ask Muriel to
bring you a little bandoline to-night, and will
request you to brush some on your hair.
Neither your uncle nor I can permit you to
sit at table again the show you were this
evening."


 
<pb n="183"/>
OUT OF 'THE FASHIION.       183
"Show?" said Sibyl. "But my hair is
naturally frizzy, and no girls have smooth
heads now."
" Excuse me, modest girls will always have
smooth heads. We won't discuss this matter
any further.  Muriel, you might get the
' History' and 'Smith's Commentary' ready.
Mr Purcell has promised to expound the
early history of the first century with the aid
of the commentary this evening. Have you
got any needlework to do, Sibyl ?"
"No," said Sibyl; "I don't work much,
and anyhow my trunks are at the station."
"Then, my dear, you can help me this
evening. Muriel, fetch the Waif and Stray
basket."
Half an hour later Sibyl found herself
seated at a good distance from the lamp,
struggling over the intricacies of an old
woman's bedgown. Mrs. Ross was knitting
something hideous, which she called a " Hug-
me-tight."  Muriel's fair, shining head was
bent over a cambric handkerchief which she
was enbroidering; Mr. Ross sat in his arm-

her lips quivered.
The electricity of her gaze communicated
itself to the reader. His voice faltered; he
raised his eyes, glanced at her-a warm, de-
lightful feeling filled his breast, and a pink
blush overspread his features.
Sibyl resumed her needlework, and for the
first time Mr. Purcell found Shortlands inter
esting.

CHAPTER XVII.
THE best-laid plans sometimes come to
nothing, and Lady Jane Danby, whose prin.
cipal object in life just now was to secure a
suitable wife for her son Mark, was doomed
to see the summer glide into autumn, and
even the first tokens of early winter set in be-
fore she saw any likelihood of having her
plans fulfilled.
Clarissa and Violet Marmaduke were the
daughters of Lady Jane's brother; not her
eldest brother, who inherited the title, but a
younger one, who had married an immensely
rich wife, and whose two girls were the sole
inheritors of their mother's fortune. Clarissa
was the eldest, and Lady Jane thought that
she would make an excellent wife for Mark.
She had thought this for some time, and had
laid her plans with a good deal of diplomacy.
The young people had met in Switzerland

the summer before; they had not been thrown
together, but had got into the habit of fall-
ing into each other's company a good deal.
They talked and laughed and flirted after
the cool fashion in which cousins can flirt,
when they are so inclined, and Lady Jane's
hopes were high.
Clarissa's father was the owner of a
splendid place in Cornwall, and Lady Jane
broadly  hinted that Mark and     Philippa
should spend Christmas with their cousins.
Strange to say, the hint was disregarded.
Lady Jane thought hard during the spring
and early summer; it was so necessary for
Mark to marry money, and Clarissa was just
the girl to bring him distinction in every
way. Lady Jane resolved to ask her nieces
to Ashton Manor, to get Jessica Power to be
one of the party, and by hook or crook to
have the young people engaged to one an-
other before Clarissa left her house.
It was not a particularly honorable idea,
but Lady Jane's honorable connections were
more numerous than her thoughts.


 
<pb n="187"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         187
For some reason, which she was never able
to discover, Clarissa and Violet promised to
come to the Manor, and then day by day and
week by week deferred their visit. The ex-
cuses they made were excellent. Violet had
a bad cold, Clarissa had to accompany her
mother to Sweden, but they would come-
oh, yes !-they wanted to spend a little time
with dear Aunt Jane, and dear Philippa and
Mark.
At last, in October, Lady Jane's hopes
once more suddenly revived. Clarissa wrote
to say she would be with them that evening.
She must make her visit alone, for Vi was at
Brighton with mother.
"Mark," said Lady Jane, "Clarissa is
coming down by the 3:30 train from Water-
loo; you'll be sure to meet her and escort
her down, won't you ? "
Mark, who was fond of Clarissa, looked
pleased and interested.
"Of course I'll meet her," he said. "It's
rather a bore her choosing such an early
train, for I had made an engagement for that

very hour; but never fear, mother, I'll be at
Waterloo in good time."
Mark left the room as he spoke. Lady
Jane turned to Philippa.
"At last! " she said, with a sigh.
" Well, mothery," replied that young lady,
"if I were you I'd leave 'At last!' alone,
for, in my opinion, it has not arrived
yet."
" Nonsense, Philippa, you speak without a
bit of heart. You don't know how devoured
with anxiety I am. All my life I have
striven to do my very utmost for Mark. I
have denied myself for his sake. When I
see him married to his cousin Clarissa, I shall
be happy."
" Dear me, mamsey, I hope you'll be happy
whoever Mark marries."
" What do you mean, miss ? Whoever
Mark marries ? He is as good as engaged to
Clarissa this minute."
Miss Danby stuck her hands into the

ing on her heel, whistled a bar of "Sweet.
hearts."
"Philippa, your unladylike conduct nearly
maddens me."
Philippa stopped whistling at once.
"Dear mother," she answered, "you know
I would not really vex you for the world, but
how can I help giving vent to astonishment
when I hear you say that Clarissa and our
Marky are nearly engaged ?"
Lady Jane almost sprang from her chair.
"Marky! How can you speak of your
brother in that way? It's enough to put
Clarissa against him."
"Oh, no, it isn't; she's not that sort, by any
means. Now, mothery, will you listen to a
word of advice from this wild, impertinent,
boyish daughter of yours "
" Well, my love, you know I'm very fond of
you, Philippa, although you do try me so often."
"Of course, mother, I know that. Now
do listen. Leave Mark and Clarissa alone.
Don't throw them together, and don't look at
them with that expression on your face which

says so plainly, 'Oh, my children, come and
kneel to me for my blessing!' Just let
things alone-do, if you want anything to
come of this. But I fear, I fear, I fear!"
Philippa ran out of the room, and Lady
Jane, left to herself, wept some angry tears.
She thought her daughter one of the most
trying of mortals.
Mark accompanied his cousin down to
Ashton by the 3:30 train. They arrived at
the Manor just in time for afternoon tea.
Everything was looking its best; the draw-
ing room was bright with autumn leaves and
flowers, a cozy fire crackled on the hearth, and
Lady Jane, in dove-colored silk and soft
white lace, looked aristocratic enough to be
anybody; the tea equipage was of the choicest,
the tea of the most fragrant, and Mark led
Clarissa in with all the eclat which the oc.
casion demanded.
The weather was cold enough for furs, and
Clarissa was clothed up to her delicate, fair
throat in sable. She had a sable cap on her
head, and her eyes, which were large and dark


 
<pb n="191"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       191
in color, were full of eager expectation. If
she was not in love with Mark, she liked him
-even Philippa had to admit that.
The party sat round the hearth, and chatted
and laughed. Clarissa gave a ludicrous ac-
count of the many reasons which had pre-
vented her coming sooner to the Manor.
"I wanted to come," she said, looking up
innocently and affectionately at Mark; " for
you know I promised to pay you a visit in
your own house this summer. Don't you re.
member, Philippa how we planned it all that
evening at Lucerne ? Oh, yes, I wanted to
come, and so did Vi, for that matter, but so
many things came in the way, and last of all,
there was mother's illness. Oh dear, oh dear,
the summer has gone, and I have not redeemed
my promise!"
"You have done the best you could, my
love," said Lady Jane. "You are here now,
and we can forget the past while we enjoy
the present. We'll keep Clarissa as long as
we can, won't we, Mark ?"
"I hope so," answered Mark. He was


 
<pb n="192"/>

looking at his cousin with undisguised ad
miration.
The color mantled into her cheeks under
his gaze. She tossed aside her fur cap, and
unfastened the warm sables round her throat.
She was a very beautiful girl, very bright,
fresh, and sweet; it was impossible for all
present not to be charmed with her.
At dinner Clarissa wore white, and Mark
looked particularly handsome in his evening
dress. He did not wear his evening dress on
ordinary nights, but he thought it only right
to pay this little mark of respect to his cousin.
" She's handsomer than ever," he said to him-
self; " and I don't think I'm conceited when I
fancy that she likes me. Of course it never
can be anything but cousinly affection," and
Mark gave the ghost of a sigh, and made up
his mind to be intensely virtuous during the
evening.
He had forgotten to write to Sibyl that day;
a letter of hers-a sad letter, too-lay unan-
swered in his pocket.
All these young people could sing, and


 
<pb n="193"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          193
after dinner they crowded round the piano,
and had a gay time.  They tried a few trios,
then Philippa sang alone, then Clarissa sat
down to the piano, and presently she and
Mark had the musical part of the entertain-
ment to themselves, for Philippa left the room
to attend to the wants of a sick Sunday
scholar, and Lady Jane was far too worldly
wise to approach the piano.
Clarissa's voice blended beautifully with
Mark's, and they sang several love songs with
great feeling together.
Just before bedtime, when the four were
standing round the fire, and Mark's eyes were
traveling  very  often in the direction of
Clarissa's, Philippa made one of her abrupt
observations.
"Cook has just told me that she is going out
to the pillar-box with a letter of her own. If
yours is ready, she will take it at the same
time, Marky."
The suddenness of this attack, joined to the
dancing light of mischief in Philippa's eyes,
threw Mark completely off his balance.


 
<pb n="194"/>
194       OUT OF TEE FASHION.
"Mine ready ? What do you mean?" he
asked, with an uneasy laugh.
"What I say, my dear boy.  You write a
letter every night and post it. Cook can save
you the trouble to-night if it is ready, that is
all."
"It is not ready," he answered. And he
turned on his heel. He could have bitten out
his tongue the next instant for having avowed
the existence of the nightly letter.  He felt
afraid almost to glance at Clarissa, but when
he did look at her again, her face was calm.
She had observed nothing.


 
<pb n="195"/>
CHAPTER XVIII.
MARK had not then the least intention of
flirting with his cousin. In his heart of
hearts he was true to Sibyl. He loved her
better than any girl he had ever met. Sibyl
without money would be a better wife for
him than the richest maiden of his day.
Still, Mark was not the most constant of
human beings. He had a very fine figure
and a handsome face, but he had not a par.
ticularly strong order of mind. Clarissa was
very pleasant to talk to, very pleasant to look
at. He could not help being impressed with
the idea that she liked him with something
more than cousinly regard. He was not con.
ceited enough to suppose that she was madly
in love with him, but he thought that a very
little effort on his part would make her so.
Clarissa was too handsome and too rich not
195


 
<pb n="196"/>

to have had many offers of marriage, but she
evidently had never cared for anyone suffi-
ciently to say " Yes." As Mark watched her
face, he used to wonder, in case he said the
fateful words, if she would say "Yes" to
him.
Lady Jane had sufficiently profited by
Philippa's advice to leave the young people
to themselves. She felt happy during these
days, for, although Mark did not mean to flirt,
he was undoubtedly attentive, and that other
affair about which she had once received
some dark hints, that " common kind of girl"
who lived somewhere in Rosemary Gardens,
about whom she had written to Jessica,
surely Mark had forgotten all about the
girl long ago.
When Clarissa had spent nearly a week at
the Manor, the letters were brought in one
morning as usual at breakfast-time. Phil-
ippa had two, Mark one, which he slipped
into his pocket, and Lady Jane received
three or four as her share of the post-bag.
Clarissa had no letter to read that morning,


 
<pb n="197"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        197
and she noticed, with a kind of lazy wonde;r
how Mark popped his out of sight, and how
Lady Jane and Philippa devoured theirs.
Meeting Mark's eyes, she bent forward
and spoke:
"How unlike a woman you are, Mark,"
she said. " Women can't bear to leave their
letters unread."
Mark colored as she addressed him.
" Your letter was a bill, wasn't it, Marky ?"
suddenly exclaimed Philippa, raising her
eyes from her own epistle. Then she con-
tinued, without listening for his reply:
"Oh, mothery, Clarissa, and Mark, do
listen! I have got such a delicious letter
from dear old Jessica Power. Her boarding
house is started, and she incloses me a pro-
spectus. Here it is: 'No. 80 Rosemary
Gardens. Boarding house for girls,' and here
is the tariff of terms. I tell you what it
is, I mean to go to that boarding house.
Clarissa, suppose we go up there together?
You know you want to do some shopping.
Suppose we go to-morrow, and spend two or

198       OUrT OF THE FASHION.
three days   What is it, mothery ? Do you
object ?"
" Of course I do, my dear. Do you think
my brother would permit Clarissa to go to a
common boarding house? Boarding houses
are always low, second-rate kind of places."
"But this is not low, nor second-rate, nor
common. This is Jessica's boarding house,
her own little pet investment, paid for and
provided out of her own money, and the girls
who manage it are quite ladies, as good as I
am, Jessica says."
"Well, my dear, well, but I don't think
Clarissa's father would wish her to go to any
place of the kind."
"I am   sure he would not," murmured
Mark, whose face had suddenly grown very
white.
"I don't think father would mind in the
least," interrupted Clarissa.  "Neither he
nor mother are at all faddy, and they like us
to go about and see life."
"Besides," continued Philippa, " Jessica
says that no girl will be admitted to the


 
<pb n="199"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          199
boarding house without an introduction, and
that the sole qualification necessary is that
she shall be a lady. Poverty is nothing, Jes-
sica says, but gentle ways and gentle birth
are essential."
"Just like Jessica," murmured Lady Jane.
"She will probably fill her house with
genteel paupers."
"Well, mamsey, we'll pay, if we go. Do
let us, do say yes-just for two days, mamsey,
love! Clarissa come, come and coax with
me. You know mother can refuse you noth-
ing!"
"Do let us go," said Clarissa, in her soft
voice.
Lady Jane looked at her pretty niece in a
sort of bewilderment. Then she glanced at
her son.
Mark shook his head, and formed "No"
with his lips.
"Mark agrees with me," said Lady Jane.
The color deepened all over Clarissa's face
when her aunt said this.
"I am of age," she said, pouting her rosy

lips, "and I know my own father and mother
would let me go. If you wish, Aunt Jane, I
can telegraph to them."
"Oh, no, my love, not if you are sure, and
your heart is set on this."
"Of course her heart is set on it, mamsey,"
interrupted Philippa, "of course we'll go,
we'll both go. It will be a delicious new ex-
perience. Put on your hat at once, Clari,
and we'll run up to the village and send a
wire to old Jessica."
"Philippa, you get more slangy in your ex-
pressions every day," exclaimed her mother.
"I don't care; I must let off steam some-
how! Now then, Clarissa, pet, we'll fly off
and get this affair arranged in double-quick
time."
The girls rushed out of the room.
"How impulsive Philippa is," Lady Jane
said, looking at her son.
"Yes," he answered, in an abstracted man-
ner. Then he added, "You're not going to
let the girls go to that boarding house,
mother?"


 
<pb n="201"/>
OUT OF THE FASIHION.        201
I don't know," she said. " How am I to
prevent it? Clarissa, as she remarks, is of
age, and your uncle George, her father, al-
ways had eccentric views about all men
being brothers, and that sort of thing; pro-
vided the boarding house was respectable, he
would be sure to let her go, and if we oppose
her she will only telegraph for leave. As
she goes, Philippa may as well go with her,
eh, Mark ?"
" Certainly," remarked Mark. He went to
the door, turned the handle, hesitated, and
came back again.
" Mother," he said, "you are clever. Can't
you manage to keep the girls from going to
80 Rosemary Gardens ?"
"My dear Mark !"
" The fact is, I know the place."
"You know it ? But this boarding house
of Jessica's has only just been opened."
" I know the people who live there."
"Do you ? Who are they? "
"Their name is Ross. Their father--  "
a I know," exclaimed Lady Jane, impulsive

ly. Then she remembered some rumors she
had once heard about Mark, and wondered
that she could ever have doubted her boy.
"My dear fellow," she said, "I dare say
the daughters of this unfortunate man are
in themselves blameless, and if Jessica has
taken them under her protection-Well, well,
Mark," seeing a cloud still on her son's brow
-" I cannot too much admire your anxiety
about your sister, and your"-she looked up in
his face-" cousin," came out slowly and with
meaning. "If I can keep the girls at home,
I will, Mark. And now, my son, let me ask
you one word. You know my wishes, my
longings, and desires. Have you made any
progress "
"No, no, none. I wish you would get this
idea out of your head, mother."
He spoke crossly, and left the room in by
no means a good temper.
If Mark had told his mother to dismiss
the idea she had suggested, he by no means
banished it from his own head. Through
the day it stayed with him, and the more he


 
<pb n="203"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       203
thought of it the more did it fascinate him.
Still in his heart did he love Sibyl best. " If
they both had money, I would not hesitate
a minute which I should choose," he said;
" but Clarissa is very sweet-and these duns
-they do press me awfully, and how am I ever
going to confess the fact to the mater that
I am hundreds of pounds in debt ? "
Mark spent a very uncomfortable day.
He went to town, but found it impossible to
turn his attention to dry treatises on law.
He spent but a short time at his chambers
and returned by an early train to Ashton.
Clarissa was walking by herself in the
garden. He could not help joining her, and
looking at her a good deal oftener than he
ought, and coming to the conclusion that, in
her way, she was just as pretty as Sibyl.
It was growing dusk, for the days were
very short, and nothing in the world was
easier than for a young man like Mark to say
soft, pattering words in a meaning voice to a
girl like Clarissa, in the soft, dusky light.
No one could have received those nothings

with more appreciation than she did. When
they entered the house Mark was more cer.
tain than ever that if at any time he did ask

CHAPTER XIX.
THE boarding house was a splendid success.
It was opened on the 1st of September with
great eclat by Jessica herself.  On this occa-
sion it did not look the least like a boarding
house.  The window-boxes were all full of
fresh flowers; the balconies were laden with
them, and on the balconies the girl-boarders
stood, and talked to one another, and
wondered what strange thing had happened
to them, and how they could possibly manage
to attain for thirty shillings a week such an
artistic and luxurious home.
The boarding house, with its bright young
hostesses, soon became popular, and, as Jessica
had predicted, was quickly filled from attic
to cellar.  The prices charged varied accord-
ing to the floors, girls who had very small
means being accommodated with bedrooms in
205

the bright, freshly-painted attics for a pound
a week.
"And there will be no extras," Jessica in-
sisted.  "You understand me, Maggie, I am
quite resolved on that head.  We will name
a price to each girl and stick to it.  And re-
member, when the evenings get chilly, each
of the girls is to have a fire in her bedroom,
and there is always to be a supply of fresh
candles, and a book or two lying about; for
I want the lassies to regard their bedrooms as
real homes, where they may rest, and be happy
as circumstances will allow them."
Of course with these rules governing the
establishment, and love and peace, and a sense
of pleasant, homely luxury which pervaded
the very air of the house, it could not help
being more than popular.
Maggie, to whom all the letters were ad-
dressed, had a great many more applications
for her rooms than she could accept. She felt
quite sorry to have to write so very often in
reply to the pleading letters, that the house
was full, quite full.  Jessica Power talked


 
<pb n="207"/>
OUT OF TEE FASHION.          207
seriously of buying the next house as soon as
ever she had the chance, and so adding to the
capacities of the boarding house.
"I am truly sorry for the girls who can't
come," Kitty said. "I feel convinced that
no girls who are away from their real homes
could be happier than those who live with us.
These fresh country girls, with all their lives
before them, are too delicious; their enthusi-
asm quite carries me away."
"Of course you have no enthusiasm your-
self, Kitty," remarked Betty, in a sly voice.
"None, Betty, in comparison with the Hop.
kinses, and two Macjones girls, from Wales.
Gladys Macjones told me last night that she
quite expected to be initiated into the
mysteries of art in three months; and Mary
posted a sonnet to the editor of the Nine-
teenth Century a couple of days ago. She
hopes Gladstone will notice it. Oh, they ex-
pect so much-those Hopkinses and Mac-
joneses-nothing-nothing in all the world
seems impossible to them."
While the girls were chattering, Miss

Power walked into the room. She had now
got accustomed to crossing the square with-
out Susannah's company. She had only
thrown a shawl over her head to come over
,to No. 80, and now she tossed it on the sofa
of Maggie's little private sitting room.
"Well, Kitty, what are you all smiles
about ?" she asked.
" We are so happy," replied Kitty. " The
boarding house is a merry sort of place,
and the girl boarders are full of interest."
" But we miss little Nineteen-year-old," re-
marked Miss Power.     "The place would
have been still merrier if she had not left
us. Do you often hear from the child, Mar.
garet."
"Yes," replied Margaret.   "She writes
regularly once a week."
"I trust she is happy ?"
"I  hope so," answered Margaret, "she
writes cheerfully enough, and makes us laugh
over Uncle David's funny ways. Still-"
Margaret was about to add something further,
when one of the servants brought in a tele

gram.   She opened it and read its contents,
and then handed it to Miss Power.
"We cannot take them in," she said; "the
house is quite full."
Miss Power read the telegram over twice.
The first time her lips twitched; the second
time her eye smiled.
"Why, Maggie," she said, "this telegram
is from  Philippa  Danby-Mark Danby's
sister-and the girl she wants to bring with
her is Clarissa Marmaduke, one of the great.
est heiresses of the day, and niece to the
Earl of Silchester."
"Well," repeated Maggie, "I am sorry, but
the house is full from attic to cellar. You
don't want me to turn anybody out, do you
Jessica ?"
"Yes, my love, I do. I would not refuse
Philippa's request for all the world. Phil-
ippa is one of the best girls I know, and it is
too rich her wanting to come here. It is my
belief, Margaret, and Kitty, and Betty, that
that scoundrel Mark has never told his sister
or his mother of his engagement to our little

Nineteen-year-old. Won't we take it out of
him just! My dear girls, I wouldn't be en-
gaged to a man like Mark Danby for all
creation, but as Sibyl is his affianced wife,
and as, for some incomprehensible reason, she
likes him, we may be able to do her a good
turn when those girls come here."
"But the house is full," repeated Mar.
garet.
"Yes, yes, my love. Now the question is,
who can we best turn out? Where do the
Macjoneses sleep, Betty ?"
"They have the back attic between them,"
replied Betty.  "Their two tiny beds are
stowed away under the roof. I must say
they have a rather confined space, but they
enjoy themselves immensely, and then you
know we only charge them fifteen shillings a
week each."
" I will ask the Macjoneses to sleep at my
house for two or three nights," replied Miss
Power. "Susannah shall get a room ready
for them; it shall be on the drawing room
floor."


 
<pb n="211"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.           211
"But, Jessica, we cannot ask Miss Danby
and that other girl to sleep up in the back
attic. It really sounds too dreadful."
"My dear, it does not sound dreadful at
all, and Philippa will enjoy it."
" But could you not ask her and Miss Mar-
maduke to use your bedroom on the drawing.
room floor ?"
"No, my dear, no. What novelty would
there be in that to those girls    Let them
have the attic; they will be enraptured."
So Maggie had to fill in her telegram in
the following way:
House full. Only a clean back attic, with two beds,
to spare. Shall I reserve it ?
In the course of a couple of hours a second
telegram was received at 80 Rosemary Gar.
dens. It ran as follows:
Will take the back attic. Expect us to-morrow
evening.                    PHILIPPA DANBY.
At the appointed hour Philippa and Clarissa
made their appearance. Clarissa looked a
little shy, Philippa gayly expectant. Clarissa

was accustomed to the best hotels; to suites
of rooms on the first floor, engaged in advance.
She would have been quite cool and composed
and uninterested in one of these rooms, but
the back attic, with the little bed pushed
away under the roof, made her feel shy.
"Good gracious, my love," exclaimed Phll-
ippa to her cousin, as they stood in their
humble room and looked around them. " Did
you notice that all the girls in the house are
dressed for dinner ? I met groups of them
on the stairs, all rigged out in diaphanous
drapery. Are they giving a party here?
What is going to happen "
" I have not brought a stitch of anything
for the evening," said Clarissa. "It never
occurred to me it was necessary in a boarding
house, and Aunt Jane did snub this one so.
And then that telegram offering us the back
attic."
"My dear, the back attic is delicious,
heavenly; we shall see half over London
from that dormer window. But now, Clari,
about our dress!"


 
<pb n="213"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          213
"I have nothing, Philippa-nothing what-
ever. I am clothed from head to foot in blue
serge, and I have got a brown serge in my port
manteau, in case this one gets soaked, if I'm
caught in a shower. That is all."
"Have you got a bit of jewelry-a gold
locket and chain, or anything of that sort ?"
" No, this dull steel brooch fastens my dress
at the throat. I did not even bring my watch.
chain, for I slipped my watch, for convenience,
into my leather bracelet."
" It was the back attic," ejaculated Philippa.
"I also am   in blue serge, and my watch
reposes in a bracelet. Well, there is no help
for it; let's brush out our hair, wash our
hands, and come down. I hope there is a
good dinner, for I am so hungry."
The two girls tripped downstairs, hand in
hand. Philippa was tall and slender; her
figure was very neat, her black hair crisp and
wavy; her pale face redeemed from plain-
ness by the vivacious expression of her
sparkling, mischievous black eyes. Clarissa
was small. Her complexion was very fair,


 
<pb n="214"/>
214        OUT OF THE FASHION.
but her eyes were large and dark, and seen
by daylight had a peculiar red-brown in
their coloring, which gave them a particu-
larly bright and lovely expression. Her
hair was fair, and had also a very faint dash
of red about it. Clarissa was pretty enough
even to carry off the effect of her heavy serge
dress.
Kitty, in white cashmere, came forward to
meet the two girls when they entered the
drawing room. Kitty had not at all the
manners of the ordinary boarding house.
"It was sweet of you to come," she said,
taking a hand of each. "I was dreadfully
distressed at putting you into the back attic,
but Jessica said you would not mind. For-
give me, I don't know one of you from the
other. Which of you is Jessica's friend?"
"I am," replied Philippa. "I have known
Jessica since I was quite a small tot; she is a
dear, generous, eccentric old soul, and I ad.
mire her immensely. Miss Ross, may I in-
quire why you are gazing so fixedly at me ? "
"You are like your brother," replied


 
<pb n="215"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       215
Kitty. "Like him, yet different-very dif.
ferent." Here she sighed.
"Good gracious! You don't tell me you
know Marky ? "
"Oh, yes, we all know Mr. Danby very
well. What part of the room would you
like best to sit in? I beg your pardon-I
don't quite hear what you are saying ? "
"You are welcome to listen to the solitary
sentence I let escape my lips, Miss Ross. I
was saying to myself, 'Nuts to crack with
Marky, by and by.' You will perceive by
the style of my speech that your delightful
back attic suits me perfectly. Now what
were you good enough to ask me a minute
ago ? "
"What part of the drawing room would
you like best to sit in ? "
"Clarissa and I will choose a little humble
corner where we can sit unobserved. We
had no iaea you were entertaining company
to-night."
"Nor are we-oh, you mean that the girls
are in light dresses. We who live here gen.

erally put on something cool in the evenings.
It is refreshing to change our heavy dresses,
and good economy besides, for we can wear
out our old summer frocks in that fashion."
"I am so sorry that my cousin and I must
appear in these heavy serges."
"Oh, it does not matter at all!"
"We thought yours was an ordinary board-
ing house."
" Which it is not," replied Kitty, her eyes
sparkling. "Here is a very cozy corner, Miss
Danby, and may I introduce my sister Betty
to you ? Betty, here is Miss Danby, and here
is Miss Marmaduke."
"I am sure you must be hungry, both of
you," said Betty, when she had shaken hands,
and found out for herself the likeness between
Philippa and Mark.
"I am   starving," replied Philippa. "I
won't answer for Clarissa; she must speak
for herself."
"Well, the dinner gong will sound in a
moment," replied Betty, "and after dinner
will come our pleasantest time."

CHAPTER XX
THERE was a great sameness about life at
Shortlands.  Breakfast was at eight punc-
tually, lunch at one, tea in the drawing room
at four, and dinner at seven.  These four
meals constituted the pillars of the day.
They were colossal pillars, and could never
be moved a quarter of an inch in any direc-
tion. Trains might be missed, relatives might
die, hearts might be broken, but at one to
the minute Mr. and Mrs. Ross must seat them.
selves at the head or foot of the luncheon
table; Muriel, smooth and composed, must
occupy one side; Sibyl, crossed and ruffled,
the other. Luncheon was but a sample of all
other meals; the knell of doom must, indeed,
have gone forth before these important cere-
monies could be disorganized.
The method observed in connection with
the meals was carried into all the minor de

tails of the household.  At Shortlands there
was not only a place for everything and every-
thing in its place, but also a time for every-
thing and everything done in its own time.
For instance, Muriel's walking hour was from
eleven to twelve every day. Muriel liked to
be out at eleven, and to be wiping her feet on
the mat as the great eight-day clock in the
hall struck twelve. From two to half-past
three she gave herself another hour and half
of exercise, either on foot or in the brougham.
Every moment of this young lady's day
was planned.    She studied geology and
history from nine to ten; from ten to five
minutes to eleven she practiced. From five
past twelve to five minutes to one she made
garments for the poor. After four o'clock
tea she either read aloud to her mother or
embroidered pocket handkerchiefs for herself;
after dinner she resumed her embroidery.
The embroidering of her own name on
pocket handkerchiefs seemed to Sibyl to be
the only light occupation in which Muriel
indulged.


 
<pb n="219"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          219
One day passed exactly like another, ex
cept that on wet days Muriel took her con.
stitutional exercise in the picture gallery,
where she diverted her mind from frivolous
thoughts by committing to memory large
portions of epic verse. The evening was
the only time when the solemn routine of
life at Shortlands was allowed to be broken.
On a certain Thursday evening each fort-
night Muriel bade her parents a dutiful good-
night as the clock struck nine, and tripped
out of the room.
"Muriel goes to have her hair washed,"
Mrs. Ross remarked to Sibyl. "She has to
sit by the fire afterward, and have it
properly dried. It takes just an hour to dry
Muriel's thick hair."
On every second Thursday Muriel's hair
was washed. On the alternate Thursday
also this good -girl absented herself just an
hour before the family retired to rest. On
this occasion she descended to the house-
keeper's room to put the coachman through
his letters. As far as Sibyl could make out,


 
<pb n="220"/>
220        OUT OF THE FASHION.
the coachman never seemed to advance be
yond this rudimentary branch of education.
This was certainly owing    to no fault of
Muriel's, who gave him his full hour, no more
and no less, of instruction every fortnight.
Into this placid home, Sibyl, the unruly,
the undisciplined, the untamed, suddenly
found herself plunged. At first the routine
life had a paralyzing effect upon her. She
was swept along on its current; she recognized
its power; she made violent efforts to con-
form  herself to Muriel's ways; she tried to
brush her frizzy hair smooth; she made val.
iant efforts to read dull books; she heroically
listened to Uncle David's stupid stories, and
to Aunt Matilda's ceaseless talk about waifs
and strays.
This kind of thing lasted for a long time;
then Sibyl's patience burst its bounds; she
electrified this good, excellent family by dis-
playing a decided fit of childish bad temper
and naughtiness at the breakfast table. The
special incident which showed Sibyl in her
true colors took place at the breakfast table.


 
<pb n="221"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        221
The letters were brought in by Jonathan,
and placed in a locked bag by Mr. Ross's
side. With all the method of the house
there was an aggravating want of method in
the opening of the letter-bag. Mrs. Ross and
Muriel scarcely ever held communication
with the world, and Mr. Ross, who thought
his letters could keep until he had time to
attend to them, often kept the bag locked
until he returned from his tour round the
farm.
Now, however, eager eyes watched for
the unlocking of that bag, for Sibyl's almost
daily letter from Mark was the sole bit of
sunshine in her present dreary life.
One morning, when she had been nearly
a fortnight at Shortland, Mr. Ross kept the
locked bag beside him while he read a long
account of a shareholders' meeting out of
yesterday's Times aloud to his wife and
family. Mrs. Ross and Muriel were deeply
interested, and only Sibyl's hungry blue
eyes looked past the Times at the locked
bag.


 
<pb n="222"/>
222        OUT OF THE FASHION.
Mr. Ross suddenly started to his feet.
"My dear," he said to his wife, in a
shocked voice, "what have I been thinking
of ? It is three minutes since my usual hour
for visiting the stables. Muriel, take the
letter-bag to my study. I will not wait to
open it now."
"But, uncle," exclaimed Sibyl, in a pierc.
ing loud tone.
Mr. Ross left the room without taking the
least notice. He was a little deaf, so he may
not have heard her.
" I must run after Uncle David," exclaimed
Sibyl, "for I want my letter."
She turned her flushed, impatient face to
Mrs. Ross as she spoke.
"I know there's a letter for me in the
post-bag," she continued. "I'll run and ask
Uncle David for the key."
" My dear Sibyl, you'll do nothing of the
sort," answered Mrs. Ross. "If there is a
letter for you, you will find it on your plate
at lunch-time."
"I really  can't wait until then, Aunt


 
<pb n="223"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       223
Matilda: I can't and I won't; I want my
own letter, and Uncle David has no right to
keep it from me! "
She was in a decided passion now, and
rushed out of the sober dining room, slam-
ming the door behind her.
Hatless she pursued her uncle into the
stable-yard, and touched him on the shoulder,
as he was examining a sick horse in the com-
pany of a neighboring vet.
" Uncle David, will you give me the key of
the post-bag at once ? "
"Eh-what? Sibyl! What are you do-
ing here ?"
Mr. Ross fell back a few steps in his aston-
ishment, but here he was assailed by such a
piteous look of entreaty in two tearful blue
eyes that his heart relented a little. The vet.
and the two grooms gazed at Sibyl in open-
eyed admiration, and had Mr. Ross remained
obdurate, it is quite possible that key might
have been wrenched from him by violence.
As it was, he fumbled in his pocket and
said:


 
<pb n="224"/>
224        OUT OF THE FASHION.
"There, my dear: I suppose your aunt
sent you for it," and Sibyl danced back to the
house with her prize. She secured her letter,
but Mrs. Ross and Muriel were both deeply
offended, and from this moment her letters
were watched and noticed. Sibyl was asked
who her daily    correspondent was.    She
stoutly refused to disclose his name, and now
her life from being only passively, became
actively, unhappy.
Muriel, although such a placid, gentle,
apparently good sort of girl, could be mali-
cious and disagreeable in small ways. She
made sly and nasty allusions to Sibyl's daily
letters, and, above all things, she taunted her
when they did not come. This was the hard-
est thing of all to bear, for Mark's letters
were less frequent and less affectionate than
of old. Sibyl felt herself sinking into a state
of despair, and very soon despair made her
reckless. She no longer cared to please her
uncle and his wife.
One day in October, the very day after
Philippa and Clarissa had taken up their


 
<pb n="225"/>
OUT OF THE FASIION.         225
abode in the boarding house at No. 80, Sibyl
awoke with a bad headache, went downstairs,
to find no letter waiting for her from Mark,
was reproved for her careless, untidy appear-
ance by Mrs. Ross, was frowned at by her
uncle, and taunted in an undertone by Muriel.
The poor girl felt desperate, and, instead of
following her cousin to the drawing room, as
her usual custom was after breakfast, she ran
up to her room, put on her hat, wrapped a
plaid about her shoulders, and rushed
out.
The moor stretched inviting and beautiful
before her. She had been forbidden to go
there alone, but that fact only made her more
eager to tread under foot the half-withered
heather and bracken. Nobody was noticing
her, and she soon mounted the stile, and
found herself on the breezy, open commons.
The wild, untamed air soothed the fierce
hunger at her heart. She ran in the teeth of
the wind, loosening her plaid, and taking off
her hat, so that the breezes might fan her
through and through.


 
<pb n="226"/>
226        OUT OF THE FASHION.
The breezes played rather roughly with
Sibyl's bright hair. One by one the pins
which confined it disappeared, and soon her
long, fair tresses were flying in the wind.
She crossed one corner of the moor, but
here her progress was stayed by a neatly
fenced-in field, which, several years before,
had been stolen from the common by a crafty
farmer. There was a path leading right
through this field, and a stile opening into
the path. At the other side of the field the
great commons stretched miles and miles away.
Sibyl wondered if she could reach the spot
where the sky now met the earth. Three
gaunt trees stood upon the verge of the horizon.
They would act as landmarks; she would
make for them.
She passed through the stile, and began to
run swiftly across the green field. It belonged
to a cetain Farmer Bates, and Sibyl did not
know that his prize bull was its present lord
and master. The girlish, flying figure, with
golden tresses swept back by the wind and a
red plaid thrown over her arm, was much too

CHAPTER XXI.
SIBYL was a town-bred girl; like other in.
habitants of great cities she had read of
country life and country dangers. The prin-
cipal country danger which met her eyes in
story books was Taurus, the bull. He was
represented as an awful monster, a bellowing,
defiant, cruel fate from which ther was no
escape.
She heard a low, growling bellow now,
and looking round saw Jupiter, and gave
herself up for lost. She uttered a piercing
shriek, and instead of attempting to run,
threw herself flat down on the ground. She
shut her eyes; each instant she expected the
bull's horns to pierce her; she wondered
how she would feel when Jupiter lifted her
on those horns and flung her high in the air.
Why did he not come ? What was the reason ?
She heard a rush, a commotion-the
228


 
<pb n="229"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          229
clatter of sticks-the sound of blows-the
mingling tones of one or two manly voices,
and then she was lifted tenderly from   the
ground, and found her head supported on a
man's shoulder.
" I trust you are not hurt ?" said an anx-
ious voice.
The voice came from the throat of Mr.
Purcell, the curate. Mr. Purcell's face was
darkly, deeply red, and the    thickly-made
hand which he had slipped round Sibyl's
waist absolutely trembled.
"I trust, I hope you are not hurt," he re-
peated; his agitation was intense.
"Oh, no, thank you," said Sibyl, recovering
herself.  She stepped away from    the en-
circling arm and began hastily to twist up
her refractory golden tresses. One of these
tresses a moment before had rested against
Mr. Purcell's  cheek.   She knew   nothing
about it, but he did, and it must be confessed
he liked the sensation.
" I hope you are not hurt ?" repeated Mr.
PurcelL


 
<pb n="230"/>
280       OUT OF THE FASHION.
"Oh, no, not in the least. I am very
much obliged to you. Did you beat the
bull and make him go back "
"Bates and I did between us. That is
Bates leading the bull through that gate
now. He is the farmer who owns this field,
and the bull is his. You ought not to have
come in; it was very dangerous. Did you
not see the board up with the words printed
on it' Beware of the Bull '? "
"No, I did not. There was a stile near
and I came through. I am very much
obliged to you, Mr. Purcell."
"Oh, I'm only delighted. Perhaps I may
be allowed to say that what I do for you I
regard as a-a privilege."
"Thank you. I will say good-by now; I
want to finish my walk."
" But are you not going home ?"
"Home? No, indeed. I am going across
that common until I come to the trees on the
top of that hill. Good-by." She held out
her hand.
Mr. Purcell's thick fingers touched her slim


 
<pb n="231"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.         281
ones; she turned on her heel and was away.
The next instant Mr. Purcell heard hei light
footsteps flying after him.
" Oh, do you know, it is too ridiculous, but
my hat is gone! I can't find it anywhere !
I thought it was hanging to my belt, but it is
not."
Mr. Purcell became immensely interested.
" Where can you have left it ?" he asked.
"I don't know. I walked straight from
Shortlands here. I had the hat when I left
the house. I took it off and fastened it to
my belt. Now it is gone."
" Shall we go back together and look for
it ? "
"Would you mind going back? I want
to continue my walk. I don't care in the
least about wearing a hat. If you find it,
you might hang it on one of the posts of the
stile. Will you ? I shall be so grateful."
Sibyl scarcely waited for Mr. Purcell's
mumbled reply. In another moment she
was off again. She crossed the stile at the
further end, and walked on the wide expanse


 
<pb n="232"/>
232        OUT OF THE FASHION.
of common until she was weary. She could
not reach the three gnarled old trees, for,
brave as she was, she did not want the fate-
ful luncheon hour to see her place at table
vacant.
She ran most of the way home. The hat
was not waiting for her on the stile-post, but
when she reached her own room she saw it
lying calmly on her bed. She scarcely gave
the circumstance a thought at the time, but
when she went down to lunch it occurred to
her as the possible reason why her aunt,
uncle, and cousin looked so black.
Mr. Purcell was also at the table. He
looked excessively red and awkward, and
never glanced at Sibyl. His place was laid
at the same side with Sibyl, but very far
away from her. He was near Mrs. Ross, so
near that he almost looked as if he were sit-
ting in her pocket. He was considered by
the parish and neighborhood generally as
Mrs. Ross's own special curate, and she had
the appearance now of a dragon guarding
him from some deadly peril.


 
<pb n="233"/>
OUT OF TIHE FASHION.       233
When lunch was over, Sibyl was requested
by her uncle and aunt to remain behind.
Muriel and the curate meekly left the room
in company. When they disappeared, Mrs.
Ross went and shut the dining room door.
Then she returned and faced the young girl.
"Sibyl," she said, " your uncle and I are
deeply pained. You are a disobedient, de-
signing, forward girl. You went on the com-
mon when you were strictly forbidden to do
so, and, not contented with this gross dis-
obedience, you tried to inveigle poor Mr.
Purcell into your wiles. Your uncle met him
absolutely carrying your hat! He said, poor
young man, that he did so by your express
instructions. Sibyl, you  are a  forward
coquette. I am ashamed of you. You are
no fit companion for Muriel. Go to your
room and stay there, until your uncle and I
decide what is best to be done with you.
Go at once, my dear, and now, not a word."
"I don't want to say a word," retolted
Sibyl. Her eyes flashed; she banged herself
out of the room.

" She is a pretty creature," said David Ross
to his wife. "Not that it makes any dif-
ference in the sin, but I should not be sur-
prised if Purcell liked holding her hat."
"David!"     said  Mrs. Ross. "I     am
ashamed of you even insinuating such thoughts.
Samuel Purcell is a God-fearing and guile-
less man."
She left the room, and Mr. Ross retired to
his study.
Upstairs Sibyl was very busy.
"This decides it," she murmured to herself.
"Even Mark won't keep me where I'm not
wanted. Back I go to dear No. 80 this very
night. Oh, another week of this awful life
would have put me in a mad-house ! Fancy,
I being accused of flirting with Mr. Purcell !"
She ran nervously about. Her trunks were
dragged forward, her possessions ruthlessly
thrust into them. In a short time the draw-
ers and the wardrobe were emptied. The
ugly room looked bare and desolate, for Sibyl's
two large trunks were full. She locked them
carefully, strapped them with her own ener-

getic hands, turned and re-directed the labels,
and then sitting down on the window-ledge,
opened her purse and counted its contents.
These were slender, but she had enough to
pay for a third-class fare to Euston. She
would go-she would go that very night; her
trunks might be sent after her. She would
walk to the station.
She scribbled a little note and left it on her
dressing table. It was a rather impertinent
little note, for Sibyl's feelings were sorely out-
raged just then. She put on the hat, which
the curate's fingers had defiled, and waited
until Mrs. Ross, Muriel, and Mr. Purcell went
out for their drive. She sat well up on the
window ledge, and watched the brougham
drive swiftly round the carriage sweep.  Mr.
Purcell looked very uncomfortable on the
little back seat, facing Mrs. Ross and Muriel;
his big knees were up nearly to his chin; he
was not talking, but Sibyl saw he was being
talked to and at with vivacity.
The carriage disappeared, and Sibyl slipped
softly downstairs.  She let herself out at the

side door, saw to her relief that the brougham
was bowling away in the opposite direction,
and then set out at a brisk pace up and down
the dusty hills which led from Shortlands to
the little wayside station.
No one stopped her on the road.     She
waited some time at the station, but at last a
train did come up. She entered a third-class
compartment, and after what seemed like the
lapse of ages found herself once more at
Euston Station.

CHAPTER XXII.
PIILIPPA and Clarissa found the "good
time " at the boarding house, which followed
late dinner, a very excellent time indeed.
These were the couple of hours in the day al-
lotted to songs and innocent mirth-making.
The girls could ask their young men friends
to visit them then, and the young men were
very glad to come.
Philippa was the sort of girl to enter
warmly into Miss Power's scheme.      Her
voice and Clarissa's were decided acquisitions
to the music, and the new girls, notwithstand-
ing their serge dresses, bade fair to become
some of the most popular of the party.
This happened the first night. The second
night the fun and frolic and jovialty were
even greater than the first. Miss Danby and
Miss Marmaduke might have lived all their
lives at No. 80, so at home were they with

the ways of the house and the manners of
its inhabitants. They had provided them-
selves with tea-gowns-cheap tea-gowns, but
pretty. Clarissa's was of a soft, pearly shade
of blue; Philippa's was white.
The weather was too cold now for the bal-
cony windows to be open, but the light from
the gay drawing room flittered out through
the crevices of the blinds, and hailed with a
warm glow of welcome a travel-stained girl,
who, about nine o'clock this evening, drove
up to the door.
She ran up the steps, and gave the bell a
loud, familiar peal.    A  strange servant
opened the door to her.
"Is Miss Ross in ?" asked Sibyl. "You
need not say I've come. I'd rather run up to
my room, and make myself tidy first."
The servant looked bewildered.
" But, if you please, miss, the house is quite
full."
"Oh, thank you; perhaps it is to others,
but not to me. I am Sibyl Ross, one of the
young ladies. Don't tell anyone I've come,


 
<pb n="239"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        239
please. I'll go to Kitty's room; I know the
way."
"They are all in the drawing room now,
miss. Shall I take you to Miss Kitty's room,
Miss-Miss Sibyl ?"
The maid had heard of Sibyl; she had also
seen her photograph occupying a place of
honor in most rooms in the house. This.
young country maid was of a romantic turn.
She felt inclined to worship Sibyl's dancing
eyes and piquant- face, and would have done
anything in her power to aid her.
"If you come softly this way, Miss Sibyl,
no one will hear us."
She took Sibyl to Kitty's new room, pro-
vided her with hot water, turned up the gas,
and left her. Sibyl danced about. She was
in an ecstasy at being home again; the idea
of being kissed in a moment or two by Maggie,
Kitty, and Betty was bliss to her hungry
heart.
Kitty's garments very nearly fitted Sibyl.
She ruthlessly pulled out of its cupboard
Kitty's very choicest evening dress, and


 
<pb n="240"/>
240          UT OF THE FASHION.
slipped it on. The dress was gray, but of so
pale a shade that it looked almost white.
Sibyl fastened a silver girdle round her waist,
shook out her radiant hair, pinned it up more
untidily than it had ever been pinned before,
and then half-laughing, half-defiant, her eyes
brimful of mirth, and yet with tears not very
far off, her cheeks flushed with the bloom of
the deepest rose, she stepped along the cor.
ridor, threw open the drawing-room door, and
came in.
They were all standing round the piano
when she entered, and a wave of sweet melody,
and words she had heard before rushed to
meet her.
With the sunshine and the swallows and the flowers
She is coming, my beloved, o'er the sea,
And I sit alone and count the weary hours
Till she cometh in her beauty back to me I
And my heart will not be quiet
But in a purple riot
Keeps ever beating-
At the thought of that sweet meeting,
As she cometh, my beloved, home to me.
The crowd was so great round the piano


 
<pb n="241"/>
OUT OF TIlHE FASHION.~     241
that at first the slim figure, who softly, all
smiles and blushes, walked up the room, was
not noticed.
The song came to an end; there was an
eager chorus of applause, girls and young men
divided to right and left, and Sibyl saw a
girl as young as herself and nearly as pretty
seated at the piano, and playing the finale to
her gay accompaniment.
A man was bending over the girl, a man
with an upright and graceful figure, and a
smooth, dark head. It was from the lips of
this man that the glad, passionate words of
welcome had floated down to Sibyl.
She could not help giving a little cry. She
found it impossible to remember anyone else
in the drawing room: Maggie, Kitty, Betty,
even, were forgotten. She rushed to the
piano, said " Mark!" and held out her two
hands.
For an instant Mark Danby wavered:
Sibyl might be an apparition, so sudden was
her appearance. Then he looked into her
eyes, and the love which was the truest thing


 
<pb n="242"/>
242        OUT OF THE FASHION.
about him mastered all other feelings. He
stooped down, and kissed Sibyl on her lips
before everyone in the room.
A lover's kiss given in public generally
causes some consternation. The girls who
were boarding in the house turned away and
took up something to do, and tried to believe
they had seen nothing. The young men be-
gan to wonder if they ought to go. Clarissa
turned white, and looked at Philippa;
Philippa's eyes almost blazed.  She took
Clarissa's hand and led her across the draw.
ing room.
" Come," she said, "let us sit down in this
corner, and rest until we recover ourselves.
I'm stunned; aren't you ?"
"I don't know," replied Clarissa, in a
dreary voice. The color did not return to
her cheeks.
"Clari, dear Clari, don't tell me that you
care."
" Of course I don't, Philippa, only it's sud.
den, isn't it "


 
<pb n="243"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          243
"I don't suppose it's sudden at all. Kitty
didn't look the least astonished, and I saw
Betty's eyes dance. Look here, Clari, shall
we slip out of the house, and go over and see
Jessica. She'll tell us all about this; she'll
let us know what it means."
"Very well," said    Clarissa. The girls
stole upstairs, put on their waterproof cloaks,
and let themselves out into the square.
As they were walking across it. Clarissa
said, not aloud, but in very ::trolg, forcible
language to her own heart:
" Now you're not going to .:e silly about
this. You never were, you know, one scrap
in love with Mark. Of course, you could
not have been in love with him."
But the refrain of the song she had just
been listening to came back to her, and that
refrain, notwithstanding her bravery, made
her feel a little sick.
Miss Power was at home, and in a moment
the two girls found themselves in her cozy
drawing-room. Clarissa sank down into the


 
<pb n="244"/>
244       OUT OF TIIE FASHION.
first chair, and remained silent.  Philippa
knelt by Jessica's side and poured out her
story.
"We made Mark come up to-night," said
Philippa, " we made an appointment to meet
him at the Grove, and then we got him to
promise to come. At first he did not seem
to like it very much, but then he gave way,
and said he would come. Kitty and Betty
and Maggie took his coming as a matter of
course. After dinner we had what Betty
calls our good time. It was a rery good
time indeed to-night. We all felt music-mad.
I wonder you did not hear the noise we
made across the Square."
"Won't Clarissa come nearer the fire?"
suddenly interrupted Miss Power. "You
look quite cold and white, my love. Here is
a cozy little chair for you; do take it."
"Oh, I'm not a bit cold," said Clarissa,
jumping up. She took the fresh seat, how-
ever, and tried to toast her white cheeks at
the fire.
" Now Philippa, go on," said Miss Power.


 
<pb n="245"/>
OUT OF THE FASIIION.       245
"We sang glees, and quartettes, and trios
until we were tired," proceeded Plilippa.
"Then Clarissa sat down and played an ac-
companiment for Mark, and Mark sang alone.
You know what a caressing voice Mark has,
Jessica ? "
"No, my love, I can't say I do."
"Well, he has. When he sings I often
shut my eyes, and say to myself, 'Now,
Marky, suppose you were not my brother !'"
Clarissa moved restlessly at the fire.
"Well, Mark does sing very well," pro-
ceeded Philippa, resuming her matter-of-fact
tone, "and the song he sang to-night was
about his love coiing back to him, and he
really did sing it as if he were very much in
love. He had just finished the words, and
there was a little pause in the room, when
suddenly a girl we had never seen before, a
very, very pretty girl, rushed into our midst,
and took hold of Mark's two hands, and
looked into his face with the very sweetest,
loveliest light in her own, and said 'Mark!'
-all(, Jessica, Mark stooped down, and

kissed the girl on her lips ! Yes, he did, be-
fore everyone!   Clarissa and I have come
over, Jessica, to ask what it all means."
"Why, my dear Philippa," replied Miss
Power, " it's quite plain what it all means.
Little Nineteen-year-old has come back."
"Good gracious! Who in the world is
Little Nineteen-year-old ?"
"Darling little Sibyl, the youngest sister,
the prettiest of them all, and one of the
wisest, too, with the exception of one nonsen-
sical idea of hers."
"Well, of course I'm not acquainted with
the Ross family intimately, so I cannot be
supposed to know their idiosyncrasies," an-
swered Philippa, somewhat haughtily. "But
I cannot see why 'darling little Sibyl' should
rush up to Mark and kiss him."
"My dear, he kissed her."
"Well, allow herself to be kissed by him;
it's all the same."
"Wouldn't you kiss your betrothed, if
you met him suddenly, Philippa    Ay, and


 
<pb n="247"/>
OUT OF TIIE FASHION.      247
forget all the world besides when you looked
into his face ? "
"Is Sibyl engaged to Mark, then ?"
"Of course she is-she has been engaged
to him for the last two months."
"Then why don't we know? Why is
my mother kept in ignorance?  Why am I
allowed to remain in the dark ? "
"My dear Philippa, Mark himself must
answer those questions."
"He shall, and to-night, too," replied Phil-
ippa, rising to her feet. "I think we have
been treated shamefully. Do you think we
would have come to stay at that house if we
had known that anything of that sort was go-
ing on? Jessica, I wonder you did not tell
us."
" My dear, how could I possibly tell you
did not know ? But as we are speaking of
the matter now, I may as well own I never
did approve of the match."
"Oh, you don't think her good enough for
Mark    Well, no wonder."


 
<pb n="248"/>
248        OUT OF TIIE FASHION.
"On the contrary, I don't think Mark half
good enough for her."
Both the girls said "Oh !" this time, and
Clarissa sprang to her feet.
"Had we not better go back to No. 80
now, Philippa ? " she said.
"Yes, we'll go," said Philippa. "Good-
night, Jessica; I'm sorry you did not give us
a hint; for as you know Mark so well, and
think so little of him, you might have guessed
he would try to deceive us."
Miss Power rose, and put her two hands
on Philippa's shoulders.
"You   are angry now, dear," she said.
"And now I must admit you have much
reason to be angry. When you offered to come
to No. 80, I thought it very probable that
you knew nothing of Mark's engagement, and
I must own that I felt a sense of satisfaction
in thinking that the truth would probably
reach your ears while you stayed there. It
was not my place to reveal your brother's
secrets, but now that he has let them out
himself, you can say anything you please to


 
<pb n="249"/>
OUT OF TIIH' FASHION.      249
him. You are not likely to part him from
Sibyl, however, and there are many reasons
which make me regret that your powers are
so limited. Good-night, dear. Come and
see me in the morigii  if you like, and if I canl
do anything to help you to lay the switch
about Mark's shoulders, I shall be more
than happy. Good-night, Clarissa."


 
<pb n="250"/>
CHAPTER XXIII.
NOTWITHSTANDING her agitation and anger,
Philippa slept soundly all through that night.
Clarissa was the one who stayed awake.
Sleep fled from her wide-open eyes, and
thoughts, busy and anxious, crowded into her
active brain.
Clarissa was the petted heiress, the darling
of her home and neighborhood, an acknowl-
edged beauty, too.   Clarissa possessed a
triple  gift-birth, beauty, fortune-surely
everything she wished for could be hers.
Everything she desired had up to the pres-
ent come at her bidding. Now, for the first
time in her whole life, she was conscious of
having received a direct slap in the face.
She received this blow when Mark took
Sibyl's hands and kissed her.
Clarissa remained for nearly half the night
struggling with her own mortified feelings.
250


 
<pb n="251"/>
OUT OF' 'TE F ASHION.      251
She had by no means made up her mind
whether she would marry Mark, but for over
a year now she had been quite sure, quite ab-
solutely positive, that Mark would wish to
marry her. She thought that in all the
world she was the girl who stood first in his
affections. She was not violently in love
with him, but his attentions gave her pleasure,
his words interested her, the fervent glance
he favored her with now and then caused
her heart to beat agreeably-she knew, as
well as he did, that he had only to say the
word to arouse deeper and stronger feelings
within her.
Now that word would never be spoken.
Clarissa lay in her humble little bed under
the eaves in the attic bedroom and wept.
Her tears flowed noiselessly and easily. IIad
she felt more deeply she might not have
cried at all.
All during the early part of the night,
Clarissa thought of the slap she had received,
but toward morning her meditations took an-
other turn. She became anxious that Mark


 
<pb n="252"/>
252         OUT OF TrHE FASHION.
should not have that switch laid across his
shoulders.
Philippa had spoken angrily of a rod lying
up in pickle for her darling Marky, but Clar.
issa wished the rod to be taken out of pickle.
Then, from   tender thoughts of Mark, who
had all her life been her favorite cousin, this
kind-hearted creature began to think of the
girl who had rushed into the midst of the
charmed circle last night. The girl's face was
pretty, pretty and yet worn, with that pa-
thetic look of wear which only adds to the
beauty of very early youth.   The eyes that
'gazed into Mark's were no strangers to tears,
the full, rosy lips appealed both to pity and
to love.
Clarissa was attracted by this girl, and in
-the morning she got up, pale and heavy-eyed,
it's true, but with her wise and kind little
brain teeming with thoughts.
"We'll go away to-day," said Philippa, as
she took turns with her cousin to arrange her
hair before the small looking-glass.


 
<pb n="253"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.          253
"Yes," answered Clarissa, " but I must see
Sibyl first."
" What-' the darling little Sibyl' ? Do you
want to see more of her ? I must own it is
not what I do."
"I should like to see her again," answered
Clarissa, in a meek voice.
Philippa looked hard at her cousin's back;
she was not permitted to view her face; and
a few seconds afterward the two girls went
downstairs together.
The greater number of the girls who
boarded in the house had left the breakfast
room when Philippa and Clarissa entered.
These girls had gone about their daily avoca-
tions, some to Schools of Art, some to the
Musical Academies, some to teach, some to be
taught. The Rosses, however, were still in
the breakfast room, and Maggie smiled at her
guests, and made them welcome when they
tripped in.
Philippa responded coldly to Maggie's
greeting. She sat down at the breakfast


 
<pb n="254"/>
254        OUT OF THE FASHION.
table, helped herself to cold toast, and
steadily ignored the delicious hot muffins
which Kitty was pushing in her direction.
Sibyl was in the room; she had borrowed an-
other of Kitty's frocks, and Clarissa saw that
her fresh, softly-rounded face looked even
prettier by daylight than candle-light.
Sibyl's eyes were brimful of mirth and
happiness, and Clarissa noticed that her
sisters could not make enough of her.
When the meal was over Philippa rose
and went up to speak to Maggie. Now was
Clarissa's chance. She was a remarkably
gentle girl, and had seldom taken any initia-
tive step before. Tie color flushed all over
her face as she stepped up to Sibyl and, tak-
ing her hand, said in a low, sweet voice:
"I heard last night that you were engaged
to Mark. Let me congratulate you."
Sibyl flushed more brightly even than
Clarissa.
"Are you Mark's cousin, Clarissa ?" she
whispered back.
"Yes, and his sister Philippa is here. She


 
<pb n="255"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.       255
is talking to your sister; come and speak to
her with me."
Clarissa took Sibyl's hand.
"Philippa," she said, touching her tall
cousin with a slight, half-beseeching move-
ment, " this is Sibyl."
"How do you do?" said Philippa.
She took Sibyl's hand, and held it in a
light, limp fashion, then dropping it, she
turned to Maggie.
"My cousin and I must leave to-day.
Will you kindly have our accounts sent to
our room." Then, without again glancing at
Sibyl, she left the dining room.
A few moments later Clarissa rushed into
the attic bedroom.
" Philippa," she said, "I am going to stay
at 80 Rosemary Gardens for the present. I
have spoken to Maggie. I don't want to go
back to Ashton Manor to-day."
"Now, Clarissa, what is the meaning of
this?"
" I am going to see if I cannot help Sibyl
and Mark," continued Clarissa, in a steady


 
<pb n="256"/>
256        OUT OF THE FASHION.
voice. " Sibyl is a very pretty girl, and very
nice, and she loves Mark with all her heart,
and I should like them to be married. You
can go back, Philippa, and scold Mark, but
I shall stay here and help him."
Philippa looked hard at her cousin.
"Clarissa," she said, after a long pause,
"you are an angel, but the aggravation of
your goodness nearly maddens me. Why
can't you be ordinary and vindictive in this
matter ?"
"What have I to be vindictive about?"
asked Clarissa, rearing her slight little neck
in a very royal style.
"Oh, well, nothing, I suppose.  Stay if
you want to, Clarissa. I assure you, you'll be
the reverse of a comfort to me at Ashton
Manor at present. I feel diabolical, and you
are angelic, and the farther apart we are for
the time being, the better. A nice, pleasant,
cheerful period I am likely to have with my
beloved mother and Mark for the next few
days. One tugging me one way, and the
other the other-and all 'on account of that


 
<pb n="257"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.            257
'darling little Sibyl.' There, I hate her; I
can't help it."
Philippa left by an early train. As soon
as ever she was gone, Clarissa sat down in
her attic bedroom, and wrote a letter to her
father:
80 ROSEMARY GARDENS,
October 24.
DEAREST FATHER: I am in the most delightful
boarding house in the world. It is kept by three girls,
real ladies. They won't admit gentlemen boarders,
or you ought to come and never leave it. Oh, it's
quite an heavenly place. I came here two days ago,
with Philippa Danby. MIark came to see us last
night, and what do you think ? We had a delicious
little dwleo2ment in the drawing-room. Mark was sing-
ing a love song. You know what a nice voice he has,
and he sang about hearts, and riots, and meetings,
and all that sort of thing, you know ! Of course,
laugh at them, but I expect you liked them well
enough when mother was a young girl !
Well, he had scarcely finished singing, when in
rushed his lady-love. She was in silvery gray, and
her face was just lovely. She took his hands, and he
looked at her, and then he kissed her before a whole
roomful of people! Mark has been engaged for two
months to Sibyl Ross, the sister of the girls who keep
the boarding house. Mark would not allow her to
help to keep it, but he sent her away to a dreadful
old uncle, who kept a bull and a curate, and who


 
<pb n="258"/>
258         OUT OF THE FASHION.
stole her hats. I can't quite make out that part of
the story, but anyhow Sibyl could not bear either
the uncle or the curate, and so she ran away, and
came back to London. Father, slie is just the wife
for Mark, and he is so fond of her. Philippa and
Aunt Jane, I know, will oppose the match, but you
have no silly, false pride. Father, try and get Mark
something to do.
Your loving daughter,
CLARISSA.
P. S.-I shall be here for the next few days, so you
can write or wire about Mark's appointment when
you get this.
Clarissa's father was at Brighton now, and
she calculated he would receive this impor-
tant letter by the evening post, at the latest.
If he wrote by return, which she hoped he
might do, she ought to get a letter by the
following morning.
None came, which disappointed her, but
immediately after breakfast a yellow envelope
was thrust into her hand.
"The answer is prepaid, miss," said the
maid, standing before Clarissa


 
<pb n="259"/>
OUT OF THE FASHION.        259
She tore the yellow envelope open, with
trembling fingers.
"Will Uncle    Joe's agency  do ?" was
scrawled on pink paper inside.
Clarissa, with trembling fingers, wrote one
word on the prepaid reply: "Splendid!"


 
<pb n="260"/>
CHAPTER XXIV.
CLARISSA'S father sent off his telegram, then
he came and sat with his wife in her
boudoir.
" My dear," he said, after a time, "I don't
think anything has ever given me more re-
lief than that letter of Clari's last night. I
may as well confess to you that I lived in
hourly dread of the post bringing me the
child's announcement that she was herself
engaged to Mark Danby."
"And, my love," responded Mrs. Marima-
duke, raising her handsome, somewhat inert,
face, "had Clarissa so written we would have
been obliged to say' Yes'; for, you know, we
always made up our minds that we would
never oppose Clari's and Vi's love affairs."
" Well, thank Heaven, the danger is past,"
said Mr. Marmaduke. "The dear girl had
evidently only the most cousinly regard for

OUT OF THE FASIIIO.        261
Mark, and now, seeing that he is my own
nephew, I am bound to help him all I can.
I can't say that he takes my fancy, but he
wouldn't be a bad sort of fellow if his mother
could only make up her mind to leave him.
alone. What do you say, Henrietta, my dear ?
Shall I go to town by the next train and see
Clari ?"
"Yes, and for goodness' sake bring the
child home, George; don't leave her in that
queer boarding house by herself."
Mr. MIarmaduke laughed.
"I can't promise anything," he said. "I'll
see how things really appear. The child
speaks well of the place, and she has a wise
little head on her pretty shoulders."
Mr. Marmaduke arrived at INo. 80 Rose-
mary Gardens that evening, in time to enjoy
a very sociable cup of afternoon tea. Thrie
of the Ross girls were present. One poured
out his tea, another helped him to cream and
sugar (he took both), and a third supplied
him with brown bread and butter cut to
perfection.

like young women, and invited Kitty down
to Brighton to stay with Clalissa and
Violet.
After the meal was over, this good man
had first an interview with Clarissa, then
with Mark, and, lastly, Sibyl was introduced
to him. It was in Sibyl's presence that the
Hon. George Marmaduke made Mark Danby
a substantial offer.
"You want to marry this young wonan,"
he said, looking straight into his nephew's
eyes.
Mark colored all over his dark face.
"Yes, sir, I do, if she will have me," he said.
"And you want to manyi my nephew ?"
continued Mr. Marmiaduke, nodding to Sibyl.
"Yes, sir, if he will have me," she answered.
Then she took Clarissa's hand and squeezed it
hard.
" And what income have you to marry on ?"
continued Mr. Marmaduke, looking again at
Mark.
"I'm afraid I have not any, sir."

"H'm. You doubtless have an equivalent
to no income-debts ?"
" I do owe some money, Uncle George."
" I might have known that. How much ')
"Three hundred pounds would cover every-
thing, sir."
"On your honor ? "
"Yes, sir; on my honor."
Mr. Marmaduke said " H'm !" twice, very
loudly.
" You love this girl, nephew ? " he said then.
4" Yes," answered Mark.
His "Yes" was so full of meaning, that
Sibyl quite hurt Clarissa's hand the way she
squeezed it.
" You are reading for the law ? " continued
Mr. Marmaduke.
"Yes."
" Well, now, I'll tell you what it is. If I
were you I'd give up the law, or at any rate
the special branch you are preparing for. I
doubt your ever doing much at the bar. Any-
how, it would be weary waiting to marry on
what you made, and somehow Clarissa and I

don't want this young girl to have to wait an
interminable time. I tell you what I'll do for
you, Mark. I'll pay your debts and start you
clear, and I'll give you a letter to my wife's
brother, Joseph  Symington. He wants a
likely young fellow like yourself to act as
agent to his property in Cornwall. You
would have, of course, to live there, and would
have a small income to start with-say, four
hundred a year. Would this be agreeable to
you ?"
Mark's face had turned very white. He
looked at Sibyl, at Clarissa, at his uncle.
" I don't deserve it," he murmured.
Sibyl rushed forward and clasped Mr.
Marmaduke's hand.
"I don't know how to thank you," her
eyes said. Her trembling lips tried to say
the words, but they failed.
" Well, it's all settled, my dear," said Mr.
Marmaduke; "and as you'll be my niece
soon, you may as well give me a kiss."
At this moment the important conference
was interrupted by a slight, but imperative,

tap at the room door. Before Sibyl had
time to go and open it Miss Power walked
in.
"IIow do you do " she said, shaking
hands with Mr. Marmaduke. Then she
added, before anyone had time to utter a
word: " I know what you are all talking
about. You, Clarissa, and you, George, are
trying to smooth matters for your cousin and
nephew, Mark Danby. He has set his heart
on marrying Sibyl Ross. He is remarkably
lucky in his choice, and as his relatives, it is
undoubtedly your bounden duty to prevent
his losing the luck which he will certainly
have when he unites himself to this young
girl. Come here, Sibyl dear; give me your
hand.  The Bible says," continued Miss
Power, "tllat the price of a good wife is
above rubies. When Mark marries Sibyl he
will have united himself to a lady, and a
beautiful as well as a good girl. What can
any man want more? Mark, I wish you
luck. Shake hands."
Miss Power wrung Mark's hands in a very

hearty manner. Then she turned to Sibyl
and kissed her.
"My love," she said, "You are mother-
less, and on this occasion, I mean to act
as a mother to you. You shall be married
from my house, and I will give you your
trousseau.  In addition to this, I mean to
make you a present of two thousand pounds.
This is by no means a fortune, Sibyl, but it
will give you a little certain income quite in-
dependent of your husband-for I warrant
you, my dear, I shall see it securely settled
on you. Now you four good people can go
on with your conference. I have said my
say, and I must go."
"I might have guessed it," said Philippa.
"I was a great fool to be so taken unawares.
I might have known that Marky wouldn't
hide letters morning after morning for noth-
ing. Oh, my dear mamsey, for goodness'
sake don't begin to cry again! My nerves
really won't stand it."
Lady Jane took a limp handkerchief out of

her pocket. This she applied pathetically to
her eyes. Then she turned and plaintively
examined the contents of a silver salver
near her side.
"Four letters have arrived by the after-
noon's post, Philippa," she said; "here they
are. I haven't opened one of them, for I
know they are all about that detestable
girl."
"But they must be read," said Philippa, in
her practical voice. "Let me look at them.
This one is from Mark. Shall I read it to
you, mothery ?"
"If you like, my love."
"Dear me, I don't like it a bit, mams, but
what can't    be  cured   now,   then-here
goes-    " Philippa tore open the letter, and
read the following words aloud:
" 80 ROSEMARY GARDENS,

"MY DEAR MOTHER: I am the happiest fellow in
the world. Uncle George has behaved like a real old
Briton. He is setting me on my feet, for I will con-
fess that I ldid owe for one or two little matters-"

"Good gracious ! The wicked, ungrateful
boy was in debt, as well as everything else!"
screamed Lady Jane.
"Now, mothery, do let me go on reading:
"--  Uncle George has set me on my feet, and he
has got me the Symington agency, which you know I
was always dying for. Sibyl and I are to be married
as soon as possible. I know you will love her when
you see her-I long to introduce her to you--"
" H'm-h'm. I needn't read the rest," con-
tinued Philippa, "it's rhapsody."
She took up another of the letters.
"This is from    Jessica Power," she said.
She proceeded to open the envelope:
80 ROSEMARY GARDENS,
October 26.
MY DEAR JANE: I congratulate you. Your son
has secured a charming girl for his wife. She is to
be married from my house, and I am going to settle
two thousand pounds strictly on herself.
Yours sincerely,
JESSICA POWER.
"This," continued Philippa, "is from Clar-
issa; I know the kind of sentiments she ia

likely to put into a letter at present, so I de-
cline to read it until I feel less aggravated.
And this is from Uncle George. Now then,
worthy uncle, what are your remarks on the
situation?"
The crackling of paper was heard for an
instant, then a loud exclamation from Phil-
ippa.
"Oh, good gracious, mamsey, do hearken
to this !

"< MY DEAR SISTER: Malk is a lucky fellow.

est, ladylike, nice creature. This is just a line to tell
you that Clarissa and I, and Mark and Sibyl, are all

"Your affectionate brother,

"My dear Philippa! " exclaimed Lady Jane,
"there isn't a thing in the house for dinner!"
"My dear mamsey, for goodness' sake,

I must fly!"

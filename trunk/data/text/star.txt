THE STAR OF FORTUNE.
CHAPTER I.
UNREASONING PREJUDICE.
<p>"SWEET, sweet Dick, Dicky, come here, you rascal. Oh, you naughty boy, how dare you fly away like that when I want to catch you!"</p>
<p>These words were uttered in a clear, musical voice, by a young girl, who seemed radiant with health, and whom "the world's slow stain" had not yet touched. The scene was a well-furnished room in which there was ample evidence that it was the sanctum of a woman of refined and cultivated taste; and the room was part of a house situated in one of the best parts of the classic city of Edinburgh. The speaker addressed her command and admonition to a very beautiful canary which had been liberated for the nonce from a brass cage that stood with open door on the table.  But "Dick," in the fulness*(sic) of his enjoyment of the temporary liberty thus accorded, had flown from point to point which afforded him foothold, such as picture frames and ornaments, and had resisted his pretty mistress's attempts to catch him in order that she might caress him.</p>
<p>It was a charming tableau, this girl and the bird,

<pb n="2     THE STAR OF FORTUNE"/>
one that would have transferred well to canvas, and have made a gem under the deft hands of an artist of feeling and taste.</p>
<p>"You cruel, naughty Dicky, not to come to me continued the young lady, with a pretty pout and an attempt at a frown that was altogether out of place on the fair, bright face. At this point the door opened and a gentleman entered, looking thoughtful, solemn, and even sad.</p>
<p>"Why, papa, whatever is the matter with you?" exclaimed the girl as she glanced at the intruder. "There is something wrong, for you have the tell-tale expression that so clearly denotes the state of your mind."</p>
<p>"Yes, Hester, there is something wrong. I am troubled," was the answer in a positively melancholy tone. "I want to talk seriously to you, but you had better put your bird into his cage again, for we cannot talk while he is flying about."</p>
<p>"I had better take him from the room altogether if what you have to say is so dreadfully serious, and especially if you are going to be cross with me, for Dick is very sensitive, and would be frightened out of his life if he heard his mistress scolded." The bird had alighted on the top of his cage, she managed to secure him, and, having pressed her lips to his bill and fondled him with many caresses, she placed him gently in his little prison-house, and put the cage on a table near the window which was gay with ferns and flowers. "Now, dad, I'm ready," she said with a smile as she dropped into a chair and folded her hands.</p>

<pb n="UNREASONING PREJUDICE.     3"/>
"I am afraid, girl, you are hardly in that serious frame of mind which would be more in keeping with the circumstances," said her father, with some severity. "Indeed, I am sorry to notice the seeming levity with which you are disposed to treat everything."</p>
<p>"But surely, father, you wouldn't have me going about the house with a soured, Puritanical expression of face, as if this world and the beautiful things it contains were hateful to me. It was never intended, I am certain, that we should view life through a distorted medium of crabbed discontent."</p>
<p>"You do not understand me," he replied, with increased severity of tone, as though he considered that her expression of feeling was altogether out of place. "My remark applies to the present moment only. I have no desire that you should look at life through dun-coloured spectacles. Your happiness is too precious to me, and it is my regard for your happiness that has induced me to act as I have done, and it is that act I now wish to discuss with you."</p>
<p>A little shadow of concern swept over his daughter's finely-cut face as some inkling of his meaning dawned upon her.</p>
<p>"What is the act, and what have you done?" she asked quickly.</p>
<p>"I have written to Lieutenant Hallett to tell him in a very emphatic manner that the intimacy between you and him must cease."</p>
<p>Hester's face grew red now, while a light of anger came into her eyes at this unexpected revelation; and there was an unusual warmth in her tone as she answered--</p>

<pb n="4     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

<p>"Then, father, you must excuse me for saying that you have done that which you had no justification for doing."</p>
<p>"There you are wrong, girl. A father is justified in watching over the happiness and welfare of his child."</p>
<p>"But I am no longer a child," she exclaimed indignantly.</p>
<p>"Not in the literal sense, but for all purpose of argument in the present sense you are. At any rate, it cannot be expected that you should be able to form that dispassionate judgment of a matter in which the affections are concerned that I, your father, can, and there can be no doubt in my own mind that if this connection between you and Hallett is persisted in, it will be destructive of your own future welfare."</p>
<p>"Why?" she demanded, with a force of expression that seemed to cause him some astonishment.</p>
<p>"Because he is in every way unfitted to make you happy."</p>
<p>"Why, again?"</p>
<p>"Without going too much into detail, I may answer your question by saying that he is extravagant, reckless, unprincipled--"</p>
<p>"Unprincipled?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I am sorry if the word offends you, but I use it advisedly."</p>
<p>"In what way is he unprincipled?"</p>
<p>"In nearly every way in which that word can be applied. But more particularly in the lack of honourable regard for his actions, which any man who was proud of his reputation would certainly have."</p>

<pb n="UNREASONING PREJUDICE     5"/>

<p>"This is a very serious charge, father," said his daughter sadly, while her face assumed such a look of dejection that it presented a marked contrast to her appearance of a few minutes previously.</p>
<p>"I am fully alive to its seriousnes*(SIC)," he answered, "and I accept all the responsibility of my accusation, for it is an accusation. But, as I have said, it is your happiness I am consulting."</p>
<p>"A curious way of consulting my happiness, truly," she remarked sarcastically. "My happiness is bound up in Lieutenant Hallett, and yet you insult him and wound my feelings."</p>
<p>"To say that I insult him is not correct. I have been to the trouble to learn a good deal about his career, and I have no hesitation in saying that that career has been shameful and dishonourable. Therefore, to tell such a man the truth is not to insult him. As regards your feelings, it may be doubted if you are capable of rightly understanding even your own feelings, for girls of your age are generally led away by mere sentiment. There is such a thing as calf love, and that should not be mistaken for the genuine article."</p>
<p>"Well," replied his daughter dryly, "that may be your opinion, and I will not quarrel with you about it, but you will admit, as a just and upright man, that every one is liable to err--even you, my clever, precise, and usually accurate father."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, I admit that; but in this case there is no error. I have convinced myself that Hallett is not a man who would do honour or credit to my family, and I must repeat again and again that if you were to marry him you would rue the 

<pb n="6     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

step as long as you lived. At any rate, the fact remains that I do not approve of him, and will not countenance your continuing a connection that is so distasteful to me, and so well calculated to cause you shame and misery. In speaking thus, I can have no other interests at heart but yours. If I were indifferent to you, I should allow you to take your own course and do as you like. But as your loving and affectionate father, I cannot sit still with folded arms and see your future destroyed. And you as my daughter must acknowledge my right to control you, unless you wish to set yourself in opposition to my desires and requests, in which case you would have to take your fate in your own hands."</p>
<p>"It is far from my intention," she answered, in a cool and collected way which suggested that, though young in years, she had the power when occasion required of acting and thinking as a matured woman of experience, "to set myself up in opposition to your just parental authority, but I would point out that your charges against Hallett are too vague, too ambiguous for serious consideration--"</p>
<p>"This is absolutely insulting," her father exclaimed, with unusual anger, for he felt that his judgment was being called into question and his rights as a father flouted.</p>
<p>"Pray hear me out. No good can result if this matter is discussed with warmth and temper. What I was going to say is this. I have never observed anything in Hallett's conduct or speech but what was perfectly consistent with the character of a true

<pb n="UNREASONING PEEJUDICE.     7"/>

gentleman and an upright and honest man. I gather from what you say that you have felt it necessary in my interest and out of a jealous regard for the good name of our family to inquire into the private character and past history of Lieutenant Hallett, and presumably you have been told certain things which induce you to believe that he is not a desirable person to know. Well, that may be the case, father, but in common fairness I must ask that you will request him to come here, and in his presence that you will formulate a distinct charge against him, so that he may have full opportunity of answering it."</p>
<p>Mr. Dellaby looked at his daughter in astonishment. He knew that she had a far-seeing and reasoning mind, no less than a determined will, but he had always persuaded himself that in that household he was the supreme ruler, that his word and will were law, and that when he had once delivered judgment no one had any right to gainsay it. It was an unfortunate weakness that, and one which was in every way calculated to bring about the very discord he was so anxious to avoid. Herein, of course, he displayed the spirit of a martinet, a spirit which had been developed and fostered during long service in India, and to brook contradiction or questioning on the part of his daughter, whom he was unable to look upon in any other light than as a child incapable of forming a safe conclusion upon anything, was what he could not do. Of course, this was very unreasonable and unfair but he did not think, and prob1ably nothing in the world could have persuaded him that it was so. Under these

<pb n="8     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

circumstances he must be credited with conscientiousness, for it cannot be supposed that such a man was actuated by mere malice or petty spite. He believed himself right, and men who believed that, however wrong they may be, are entitled to a certain amount of respectful consideration.</p>
<p>It was pretty clear from his manner that he had not anticipated such opposition from his daughter, and the frame of mind he was then in did not allow him to view the subject dispassionately or with a cool and unbiassed*[sic] judgment, and this was the answer he made to her suggestion--</p>
<p>"I consider it outrageous that you should call my statements into question. The sources from whence I have drawn my information about this young man, who seems to have charmed away your usual good sense and reasoning power, are above suspicion, therefore I should regard it as an act of imbecility were I to fall in with your view. Hallett shall never cross the threshold of my door again, and unless you wish to shut yourself out of my heart for ever and ever, you will regard my injunctions. I will not tolerate any disobedience on your part. Dare to go against my will, and I'll bar the door against you as sure as the heavens are above us. There is no appeal from Caesar. Bear that in mind."</p>
<p>He had worked himself up to a pitch of unusual excitement, and appeared to have lost all control of himself, and having given this forcible expression to his views, he waited not for any answer or further comment from his daughter, but hastily left the room, feeling, no doubt, that he could not trust him-

<pb n="UNREASONING PREJUDICE.     9"/>

self to prolong the argument then, for his anger had got the better of his discretion.</p>
<p>Poor Hester was terribly distressed. There were tears in her eyes, but she dashed them away as being out of place on such an occasion. She had always been a loving daughter, and a dutiful daughter, but not even her love or sense of duty could blind her now to the manifest injustice of her father's behaviour. She was greatly put out, her feelings were wounded, and they found expression in a remark she addressed to her bird, which at that moment burst forth into a full gush of song, and, turning to the cage where the little songster trilled so beautifully, she murmured--</p>
<p>"Ah, Dick, happy Dicky; how I envy you! This world might be such a paradise if men were only more considerate, more reasonable. But, 'Man's inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn.'"</p>
<p>It was not often that she was cast down and dejected, for her disposition was a very happy and contended one; but now it was a question of forfeiting a lover's love or a father's affection. From the unexpected turn matters had taken, it seemed that she must certainly forfeit one or the other; it is little wonder that she found it difficult to decide which she should do, and after much earnest consideration and deep reflection, she decided to go to her mother and seek consolation and sympathy from her.</p>

CHAPTER II.

A MAIDEN FAIR.

<p>IT was generally admitted by those whose privilege it was to be well acquainted with her, that Hester Dellaby could justifiably claim to be numbered amongst the belles of which Edinburgh had cause to be proud. She had many natural advantages, such as good health, a good physique, and a bright, cheerful, engaging manner. There are some women who embody in the very highest degree the attributes of fascination, and who draw around them by some irresistible power of attraction other people, in much the same way as certain flowers attract butterflies and bees. Such a woman was Hester. Her years at this time were but a score, so that she had all the advantages which youth offers, and allied to them was a sweetness of disposition, and a cheerful, even temper, which made her very popular with both sexes. She had been well nurtured, tenderly brought up, and educated with a view to her shining some day as an accomplished member of society, for her parents were ambitions*, and a little given to boasting of the "good stock" they came from. Possibly the boast was justified, but anyway they ranked then amongst those who were pleased to think themselves

<pb n=" A MAIDEN FAIR.     11"/>

members of "rank and fashion" in the so-called Northern Athens.</p>
<p>Hester's father had long and honourably served the Old East India Company in the Civil Service. He was a native of Edinburgh, though of English parents, and, marrying young, had gone out to India in the Company's employ. Three sons were born to him there, but two died in early childhood. The third grew up, and at the date of the commencement of this history he held a commission in the army, and was then stationed with his regiment in Malta. In addition to these sons, Mr. Dellaby had two daughters; his eldest, Margaret, was born at sea while her mother was on her way home; and the second, Hester, drew her first breath in Edinburgh. Mr. Dellaby had at that time been compelled to leave India, as his health had broken down. Margaret subsequently became the wife of Lieutenant-Colonel George Henry Pritchard, and had gone out to India with her husband, so that Hester was her father's and mother's solace in their old age. A just and upright man, he was nevertheless a severe one where he considered there was any dereliction of duty, or a lack of obedience to lawful command, or what seemed to him lawful command. His wife had long been content to be guided by him, and she would have thought more of calling his decisions into question than she would have thought of flying. She was a gentle, submissive woman, and believed that her husband could not err.</p>
</p>There was one point upon which Mr. Dellaby was disposed to be very arbitrary indeed, and that was

<pb n="12     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

with reference to his daughter forming a connection with any one of the sterner sex. At first she had laughed at his petty tyranny, and was amused by his treating her as if she were still a child. But this laughter and amusement underwent an entire change soon after she made the acquaintance of John Montague Hallett. They met at one of those little social gatherings, in which young people of both sexes are brought into contact with each other and dream dreams of an earthly paradise. It is an impossible paradise, of course, but youth takes no count of that, for to the young nothing seems impossible, and they firmly believe that the mirage is reality and that shadow is substance. You grey-beards and wiseacres may argue as much as you like, with a view to convincing them that they are wrong, but be assured you will fail.</p>
<p>In the case of these young people it was almost love at first sight. An hour or two of each other's society, and then they both felt they had found their counterpart. A little later in the evening the hostess at whose house the gathering had taken place said to Hester--</p>
<p>"Well, dear, what do you think of young Hallett?"</p>
<p>At the question a little tell-tale flush dyed the girl's cheeks, and she answered demurely--</p>
<p>"He seems very nice."</p>
<p>"He's <hi rend="italic">charming</hi>, dear," the hostess exclaimed. "He's my very ideal of what a young man should be--so different to the stuck-up, stiff-collared, pomatumed-haired fops of the present day, who would scream if they found themselves alone in a

<pb n="A MAIDEN FAIR.     13"/>
room with a mouse. I shouldn't be at all surprised if young Hallett makes a noise in the world some day. All his people have been prominent in one way or other, and he's got go and grit in him.</p>
<p>This praise, which, by the way was only a spontaneous testimony to Jack's worth, and not uttered with any underlying motives such as often actuate ladies when they din the praises of young men into the ears of simpering maidens, had its effect on the listener, although she made no further comment one way or the other. But she had seen with her own eyes, and heard with her own ears, and she was quite capable of forming a perfectly independent judgment, though it may at once be said that her judgment was in accord in the main with that of her friend.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that the acquaintance thus begun ripened. Hallett gave every sign that he had come within the sphere of Hester's attraction, and was being drawn towards her as one orb that has got out of its orbit is drawn towards another. Opportunities were made for meetings, and after a time Jack was invited to Mr. Dellaby's house. Hester had a little gathering of friends, and he was included amongst the invitees. The attention he paid her that evening attracted the attention of her parents, and her father subsequently questioned her about him. She concealed nothing, made no attempt to prevaricate. She told the pretty little story from its initial stage up to the very point at which it had then gone.  It was painfully obvious it did not please her father. He listened with frowning brow and stern countenance,

<pb n="14     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

and reproached his daughter with having been indiscreet, whereupon she exclaimed--</p>
<p>"But you don't suppose that I am going to lead the life of a recluse, and never open my lips to a man unless it be yourself?"</p>
<p>"No," he said sharply, "I don't suppose anything of the kind. But I maintain that you have no right to form an acquaintance with a young man without first taking steps to ascertain that he is honourable and of good report. And in order to do that your father is certainly the proper person to appeal to. In this instance I shall, beyond doubt, go to the root of the matter; for I have too much regard for you, and too much respect for my own good name, to remain silent and indifferent where your happiness is concerned. For aught I know or you know, this fellow may be an unprincipled adventurer."</p>
<p>Hester winced a little, for she did not like to hear it suggested that the man she admired above all others might possibly be what is usually termed "an adventurer," meaning in plain words a scoundrel who sticks at nothing to further his own ends. And yet she displayed no feeling, but quietly remarked--</p>
<p>"You forget, father, that an officer and a gentleman are inseparable terms."</p>
<p>"In theory, yes. But in practice it is not so, for many an army and navy officer is an unmitigated blackguard. However, I make no reflections on Hallett, because I know nothing about him at present. We will renew the subject later on, however."</p>
<p>Mr. Dellaby was a persistent man, and having

<pb n=" A MAIDEN FAIR.     15"/>

resolved to do a thing, it took a good deal to turn him from it. So the first thing he did was to wait on young Hallett at his quarters in the Castle, and demand from him what his intentions were; having been assured that they were honourable, and based on a hope that the young fellow might be found acceptable in the young lady's sight, and the sight of those who had her welfare at heart, he next requested to be referred to Hallett's family, a request that was very promptly complied with.</p>
<p>So far as all this went Mr. Dellaby could find no flaw. The Halletts, as he proved, were people of high standing, and something more than merely respectable. But in the story of Jack's college career there was a black page. While at Oxford he had given way to extravagance and recklessness that had plunged him into serious difficulties, and his mother was unable to discharge his liabilities, but a scandal was avoided by an uncle coming forward and doing so. This was not all, however, for the young man had had an intrigue with a girl, the daughter of a farmer, and had, so it was averred, promised her marriage. Into the merits or demerits of this matter it is not in the least necessary to enter here. It may be mentioned in passing that it was the means of prematurely, to some extent, closing the young man's college career, and his friends had to pay over to the girl's friends a very liberal sum of money to hush the affair up.</p>
<p>Armed with these facts Mr. Dellaby returned home, not altogether sorry, perhaps, that he had found a weak spot in Jack's armour, for the fact could not be disguised that he had felt annoyed, and very much

<pb n="16     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

annoyed indeed, that Hester had dared to form such an acquaintance without first taking him into her confidence and asking his advice. In dealing with the Oxford incident he was not in the least disposed to make any allowance for the proverbial weakness of human nature, nor did he care to consider how highly probable it was that if the incidents in the youth of any eminent man one might like to single out were inquired into, no man would come out unsullied. Youth, it has been said, is the time of folly, and wisdom comes with whitening hair. But Mr. Dellaby was strongly prejudiced, and, quite disposed to view the affair through a magnifying-glass, he clearly proved this when he again discussed the subject with his daughter after he had exhausted his inquiries, for he said to her--</p>
<p>"I don't want to be unkind or unduly severe," showing thereby that he was not speaking strictly in accordance with that high regard for unswerving accuracy which he claimed to have. But men often err from lack of judgment, and it is charitable to suppose that Mr. Dellaby did so in this instance.</p>
<p>"There can be no question in my mind," he went on, "that Hallett is a blackguard." When he saw how Hester was stung by this all too severe condemnation he qualified it by saying--"Well, what I mean is, he is a man of little principle, one who is not likely to have much respect for any woman's feelings. Under these circumstances I shall resolutely decline to recognize him, and I hereby give you strict injunctions to at once sever the connection. Let there be no mistake as to my meaning. You

<pb n=" A MAIDEN FAIR.     17"/>

must treat him as if he were an absolute stranger. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>Poor Hester tacitly admitted that she understood only too well. And while not prepared just then to set herself in direct opposition to her father's wishes, she certainly did not intend to accept his dictum as irrevocable.</p>
<p>To what an extraordinary concatenation of thrilling events this difference of opinion between herself and her father was to lead will be disclosed as the narrative proceeds; but Mr. Dellaby himself had no foreshadowing of what was to come. He considered his word law, his commands final, and in order to give, as he thought, the final blow to the whole affair, he penned the following severe letter to young Hallett--</p>

Sir,--as my daughter's happiness is more precious to me than aught else in this world, I am naturally anxious that she should do nothing calculated in any way to jeopardize that happiness. I must therefore request--nay, demand in the most emphatic manner, that from this moment you cease your attentions to her, for I do not regard you as being in any way likely to promote her well-being. In fact, it would be nothing short of a calamity if she were to become your wife, and I, her father, as well as all those who love her, would regard it as a dire infliction if by your insidious arts and wiles she were induced to disobey my wishes. As the receipt of this letter will give you clearly to understand how very objectionable you are in my sight, you surely will not have the audacity to persevere in forcing

<pb n="18     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

your unwelcome attentions on my child. I have been very outspoken because I consider that any ambiguity would have been a fatal mistake.</p>
"WILLIAM HENRY DELLABY."

<p>Mr. Dellaby read this letter over two or three times, and he evidently considered that its strong language was fully justified, for he did not alter a single word, nor soften down an expression. But sealing it up, he dispatched the missive to Hallett at his quarters in the Castle, and having done that he sought an interview with his daughter, as recorded in the opening pages of this story.</p>

<pb n="19"/>

CHAPTER III.

AT CROSS PURPOSES.

<p>"JACK" HALLLETT was still a very young man, not more than four or five and twenty. He was a lieutenant stationed with his regiment, then quartered in Edinburgh Castle. He represented a long line of ancestors who had honourably and loyally served their country either in the navy or the army. His father had been an admiral and had greatly distinguished himself during the Crimean War for conspicuous bravery and devotion, but during the bombardment of Sebastopol was mortally wounded at the post of duty by a bursting shell. John was his youngest son, and having elected to enter the army in preference to the navy, he had been well educated, and launched upon his career with the prayers and good wishes of his loving sisters and widowed mother.</p>
<p>The lad had the misfortune--the word is used advisedly--to be singularly handsome. He really seemed to embody the physical attributes which go to make up the perfect man, while face and feature were full of the pride of goodly stock and high heritage. It was a patrician face, with clear, frank, blue eyes and a delicate chiselled*[sic] nose; a mobile face, that in certain moods told of the true soldierly

<pb n="20     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

nature, a nature, stern, determined, defiant, unyielding, and full of courage and fire. He who would have set Jack Hallett down as merely a pretty boy would have made a woeful mistake. He had the vivacity of the boy, the laughter of the boy, the joyousness of the boy. But let the occasion arise for the manhood to display itself, and then--what a change! This can best be exemplified by the following little incident in his career. He was barely twenty, when one day as he was strolling along the high-road near his home, he was suddenly startled by a roar of voices, and looking back beheld a sight that might have turned an older head than his. A magnificent pair of horses attached to a brougham had taken fright, and were thundering on towards him utterly uncontrolled, for the coachman, as was subsequently proved, had been seized with apoplexy, and pitching forward on the backs of the animals had startled them into madness; and on they flew to the certain destruction of themselves, the carriage, and its occupants; for, a couple of hundred yards or so ahead, the road bent at an acute angle, and at that angle was a deep stone quarry into which the frenzied horses must necessarily dash. Hallett took in the situation at a glance, and never a muscle quivered, never a nerve quailed. It seemed as if he was doomed to certain death if he dared to oppose himself to those maddened steeds, and the swaying and jolting vehicle that flew along the road and shook the solid earth. But no fear of death was there; no thought of self disturbed him. He placed himself at the side of the road, he breathed hard, his lips were tightly set. As the panting beasts neared him he

<pb n=" AT CROSS PURPOSES.     21"/>

sprang at their heads, caught the bridles, was carried along for some distance, until he managed to regain his feet, and by sheer strength stopped the runaways on the very brink of the quarry. But for this act of heroism--for it was heroism--the elderly gentleman and his daughter would have been dashed to pieces. As the people who had been following in hot pursuit came up they lustily cheered the young man, but he only remained long enough to assure himself that the young lady and her father were safe, then in the excitement and confusion he slipped away, and it was not until some time afterwards that the old gentleman knew to whom he owed the lives of himself and child. Then he had the stupidity to send young Hallett a money present of a hundred pounds, which was returned with scorn and indignation and a wrathful message that he was not a hireling, to want payment for doing that which any man worthy the name would have done.</p>
<p>The foregoing details will bring into prominence a good deal of Jack's disposition and character. Proud he was with the pride of independence; and brave he was with the courage and instinct of a true soldier; and reckless he was with all the recklessness of youth. Gloominess formed no part of his composition. He revelled*[sic] in life, and he had no sympathy with those who groan and sigh and moan because things are not quite in accordance with their own views. He believed that the world had been made beautiful that man might enjoy it, and, imbued with the tincture of Bohemianism, he had hitherto followed on the lines of "Hail, fellow, well met," and "A fig for to-morrow." By his comrades and

<pb n="22     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

messmates he was regarded as a " jolly good sort," and his attractive manners, his <hi rend="italic">bonhomie</hi>, his cheerful spirits, and his handsome person and beaming face made him an especial favourite with the fair sex.</p>
<p>On the first blush it almost seemed as if no more fitting couple could have been mated than Jack and Hester. She, on her part, possessed sufficient seriousness to counteract what might have been termed the levity of his nature. Perhaps "levity" is hardly the correct word to use, for after all it was nothing more terrible than the levity of lusty, joyous, good-looking youth. And whether boy or maid, such a youth can hardly be expected to wear the countenance of a philosopher, nor the gloomy brow of an ascetic, who seems to think it is his mission to go through the world groaning and smiting his breast for the sins of his fellows. From what has now been said of these young people it is not difficult to understand how the acquaintance between them once begun ripened. Opportunities were made for meetings. Hester had found out that at or near a certain hour of the day she had business to transact in Princes Street--the fashionable promenade; some tradesmen to call upon, or some trifle to buy which only could be bought in that famous and most beautiful thoroughfare, with its picturesque gardens and grim fortress on the one hand, and its row of stately buildings on the other. And by a remarkable coincidence the young lieutenant had come to consider it necessary to be passing along the street at the same hour, and the inevitable result was a meeting between the two. Then there were mutual expressions of admirably

<pb n=" AT CROSS PURPOSES.     23"/>

surprise, a hearty handshaking, rippling laughter, and pleasant chat, until the parting came again. And Hester would wander to her home with a growing feeling that the handsome, dashing young soldier was exercising an irresistible influence over her, and she yearned for the next meeting.</p>
<p>Up to this point the girl had kept her feelings secret. Herein perhaps she was prudent, for at the most there had been nothing more serious between her and Jack than a mild and innocent flirtation; and it would have argued singularly bad taste on her part had she tacitly or otherwise led any one to suppose that the young officer had an eye to matrimonial potentialities in displaying a preference for her company. So she held her peace, she preserved her secrets, she dreamed her dreams, and when the busybodies and the tattlers and the prying little minds exclaimed--"Oh, I saw you yesterday again in Princes Street with that handsome young fellow, who seems so vain about his beautiful, even, white teeth that he is always showing them," she would answer quietly and ironically--</p>
<p>"Did you?"</p>
<p>And when the point-blank question was put--"I say, Hester, is there anything serious between you and that fellow?" her answer was no less quiet and dignified, and would run somewhat as follows--</p>
<p>"Surely I have a right to speak to a gentleman to whom I have been introduced under the roof of a friend's house without its being thought that I am about to rush into matrimony."</p>
<p>When Hester heard from her father what he had to tell about young Hallett, her feelings were not

<pb n="24     STAR OF FORTUNE"/>

quite what the narrator expected they would be. To her there was nothing very dreadful in it. For a youngster in his salad days to protest by all the stars in heaven that he was madly in love with the first silly girl who chose to listen to him was no new phase of the human story. It had been repeated almost every day since time began.</p>
<p>Hester had the good sense to understand that a young man could not be gauged and controlled by the same fixed standard by which a girl's conduct is judged. A greater freedom and a greater licence*[sic] are allowed to the man, and it has ever been so since man walked the earth, and right it is that it should be so. Of course, the shrieking sisterhood, who talk so glibly of "woman's rights," will protest against this doctrine, but, happily, they are in a very insignificant minority, and the generality of the fair sex, who prefer to remain women, will make no murmur. At any rate, Hester Dellaby, rightly or wrongly, regarded her lover's faults as venial ones. The blackness her father saw she could not see. The impression Jack had made upon her heart was far too deep to be removed easily. To her he had always been the most chivalric, courteous, considerate gentleman, and she could not possibly view him through any medium that was calculated to distort him to her view, and deprive him of that glamour which now surrounded him as she looked at him from her standpoint. Notwithstanding all this, she could not help but feel some concern that her father should display so strong a prejudice, and show no hesitation in referring to her lover as "an adventurer" and "a blackguard." Those were

<pb n="AT CROSS PURPOSES.     25"/>

strong terms indeed to use, and as serious as they were strong, and unless a man is prepared to justify them to the hilt he should not breathe them, lest he bring himself into grave trouble, or wrongly blast the good name and reputation of him against whom he speaks. Hester knew her father too well to suppose that he would easily yield in his prejudice, for as long as he believed himself right nothing would change him. Under these circumstances the poor girl considered that the best course--even if it were not a duty--was to take counsel of her mother, and so to her mother she went.</p>

<pb n="32"/>

CHAPTER IV.

A VIOLENT SCENE.

<p>BUT in determining to lay the matter before her mother, Hester was not altogether hopeful that she would get that lady's full sympathy.</p>
<p>To use a common, but at the same time an expressive phrase, for it conveys a great deal of meaning, Mrs. Dellaby had no mind of her own. That is to say, she preferred to be swayed by others, rather than make any attempt to sway. She was a quiet, unostentatious little woman, who was content to live a humdrum life and follow blindly the lead of her husband. She had unbounded faith in him. He was truly her "lord and master," and so highly did she estimate his cleverness and ability, that she would have deemed it something only a little worse than treason on her part to have called his decisions into question.</p>
<p>Although Hester was fully aware that her parents lived in perfect unity, it did not seem to her possible that in this case her mother would refuse altogether to exercise some independent judgment. For, after all, it was purely a woman's question. At any rate the sentimental part of it was; for when a young woman falls in love with a young man sentiment runs high. It is no use asking her to be practical, no use 

<pb n=" A VIOLENT SCENE.     27"/>

asking her to sit down and coolly and deliberately go into certain calculations as if she were trying to solve a Euclid problem. Love takes the reason prisoner, and fetters it so that it has no power, and it is the merest fatuity to ask a girl to see through the same spectacles as her grandmother, or to understand the sermons of her elders when they dolefully tell her they have dreamed their dreams, and awakened to find this world's idols are very common clay indeed. Youth is a sweet dream, and God grant it may ever be so.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dellaby listened patiently enough to what her distressed daughter had to tell, and then she admonished her to fall in with her father's views. This admonition was conveyed in a mild sort of didactic sermon, in which the duty of children to parents was lightly touched upon, and there were some vague hints thrown out as to the possible punishment that might hereafter result as a penalty for failing to strictly observe that duty.</p>
<p>The girl could hardly be blamed for her want of appreciation of the sentiment which her mother expressed.  She had asked for bread and been given a stone; and the very source from whence she had hoped to draw consolation proving barren of sympathy, she found herself force to act upon her own responsibility.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances she resolved, come what might, and let the consequences be what they would, to write to Hallett and then be guided by what he might do and say. Although she had not seen him nor heard from him since her father had sent that very violent letter--a copy of which he had

<pb n="28     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

subsequently read to her--which was destined to be productive of so much suffering, she did not believe for a single moment that he had abandoned her. Indeed, she pictured him bowed down with grief and crushed with despair. Nor was she altogether far wrong. Whatever his weaknesses were, and whatever his faults had been, he regarded her with a regard such as he had never had for any other woman; and if any one existed who could influence him to do great things and perform deeds which would add glory to his name, that person was Hester Dellaby.</p>
<p>The receipt of the very trenchant letter from Mr. Dellaby irritated Jack Hallett considerably, for it wounded his pride and insulted his dignity. He could not conceive what he had done to justify such a course as that which Mr. Dellaby had adopted, and his first thought was to send the letter back with an indignant reply; but his better sense prevailed, and he decided to await the tide of events, as he did not think it possible that Hester would allow herself to be influenced by her father's prejudices.</p>
<p>When he received her letter, therefore, which was very short, and suggested as the more practical course that an appointment to meet should be made, as they could discuss the situation so much better <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> than by correspondence, his spirits rose, and he hastened to respond, saying that he could meet her that very evening, and he named a rendezvous where many a tryst had been kept before, and many a love-tale told.</p>
<p>When the first warm greetings had passed she asked--</p>

<pb n=" A VIOLENT SCENE.     29"/>

<p>"Have you ever done anything, Jack, to justify the course my father has taken?"</p>
<p>"No, emphatically no," he exclaimed. "Foolish I have been, and--"</p>
<p>"Stay," she said, interrupting him. "It is enough for me to have your emphatic assurance that the letter he has sent you is unmerited. I want no confession of all your peccadillos*[sic], your escapades, your shortcomings. I am not so foolish as to expect to find a saint in the incarnate garb of a man. To me you have no faults now that I can see. But remember, sir, I look with love's eyes, and love is ever blind. Further, I would impress upon you that you have inspired me with a great passion that cannot be cooled down nor quenched by the mere bidding of a despotic father. That may be strong language for a daughter to use, but I must put my feelings into words since I cannot dissemble nor play the hypocrite. And forget not, Jack, that your honor is at stake--"</p>
<p>"And that honour has never yet been stained," he cried, with an expression of sincerity that could hardly have been assumed.</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear you make that declaration," she replied.</p>
<p>"And let me assure you, Hester," he added, "it never shall be stained. I am a soldier, and come of a race of soldiers who have ever placed honour above mere worldly gain. Your love for me is a very precious thing, and I should be worse than a scoundrel if I trifled with it."</p>
<p>"You would, indeed," she murmured, with a sigh.</p>

<pb n="30     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

<p>"But you do not think me capable of doing so, do you?"</p>
<p>"No, dearest, no, I do not," she exclaimed, with great fervency, as she tightened the pressure of her gloved hands about his arm, for they were walking arm-in-arm, and sauntering slowly and listlessly, as is the wont of lovers, towards the path that winds upwards to the summit of Arthur's Seat.</p>
<p>"And you will trust me, Hester?"</p>
<p>"Aye, with my life; with the essence of my life, my woman's heart."</p>
<p>"And may God forget me if ever I betray the trust. That trust shall keep me straight. It shall be my beacon star, and whatever my fate may be, wherever I may wander, I will not be unmindful of what I owe to you first, and through you to myself."</p>
<p>It was a pretty little speech, and full of lovers' vows as lovers have made them since love began; and such vows have again and again and still again been broken. But he spoke sincerely enough then, and she, being a woman, reposed her confidence in him. How could she do otherwise? Youth is trustful; and love sees not.</p>
<p>It was the pleasant time of twilight as Hester Dellaby and Jack Hallett, with linked arms, and heads inclined towards each other, walked on the upward path that leads to the brow of the grey old hill which has witnessed so much that is stirring and strange in the world's story. But they had no eyes for anything but themselves; no ears for aught but their own voices. Therefore were they all unconscious of the approach of a man who came after

<pb n=" A VIOLENT SCENE.     31"/>

them with rapid strides, and whose every movement seemed suggestive of seething anger. And presently, when he overtook them, he made it instantly manifest that fierce wrath burned within him, for, though he was breathless with his uphill tramp, he exclaimed, addressing Hallett--</p>
<p>"You dastardly scoundrel!"</p>
<p>The speaker was Mr. Dellaby, who, having discovered his daughter's absence within a few minutes of her leaving the house, suspected that she had gone to keep a tryst. So off he set in pursuit, for he had found in her room on a table Hallett's brief note, which she had carelessly left lying there. The young couple were necessarily disconcerted by this unexpected apparition, but the girl so far retained her presence of mind as to reprove her father for the strong language he used. This only served to exasperate him still more, and he said with all the rancour of a desperately angered man--</p>
<p>"Do not dictate to me. It is true you are my child, but I blush for you. I am ashamed of you. As for you, sir"--facing the young officer--" I feel that language is not strong enough to give expression to my disgust for you and contempt for you. You are a coward--a blackguard."</p>
<p>"I must take exception, sir, to both those terms," answered Hallett proudly.</p>
<p>"You may take exception to what you like," retorted the irate father. "I repeat that you are a blackguard; for in spite of my letter, in spite of my warning, you have had the temerity, and been deceitful enough to write to this silly girl, and to tempt her from the path of truth and duty to her

<pb n="32     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>


parents, in order that you may corrupt her with your honied*[sic] words and your shameless lying flattery."</p>
<p>"I resent this base accusation," replied Jack, growing very red in the face by reason of the great effort he made to suppress his anger.</p>
<p>"Resent that if you are a man," hissed Mr. Dellaby, as, entirely carried away by his feelings, he raised a walking-stick he had in his hand, and struck the young man across the forehead.</p>
<p>"Father, father, shame on you," cried Hester in an agony of distress, as she flung herself between the two men. But in this trying moment Jack displayed the coolness and self-possession of a true soldier, and he said dispassionately to her--</p>
<p>"Do not concern yourself, Hester, I shall not retaliate, but another man does not live whom I would allow to deal me such a blow with impunity. This man, however, is your father, so I accept the insult, and am content to let time bring its own revenge; and time will revenge me, of that I am sure. Good-night, Hester, and do not forget me; your father will escort you safely home."</p>
<p>He turned and walked away, and there was a touch of absolute grandeur in his dignified manner, and the absence of wrath under such trying circumstances.</p>
<p>Then, with a bitter cry, Hester covered her face with her hands and wept audibly.</p>
<p>"You ought to be ashamed of those tears," said her father, none of his anger abated.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are right," she replied warmly, as she wiped them away with her handkerchief. "They are a sign of weakness, and I ought to be strong. I

<pb n=" A VIOLENT SCENE.     33

will weep no more; but let me tell you this, that your mad conduct to-night fills me with a sense of burning shame, and if you think that that is the way to beget my obedience or retain my affection you will find yourself woefully mistaken."</p>
<p>"You shall either render me the homage a father, who has the true interests of his daughter at heart, has a right to expect from her, or you can go your ways as an outcast and a wanton, and I will tear you out of my heart, and never mention your name except to curse you."</p>
Poor Hester thrilled with a little shudder at his violent language, but she had the sound sense to make no response, as no good could come of a prolongation of the argument. So she walked home in silence, and he followed, and she felt like one feels who has suddenly and rudely been awakened from a rapturous dream to find that the world is full of moaning.</p>

<pb n="34"/>
CHAPTER V.

MRS. DELLABY'S TRIUMPH.

<p>IT is difficult to imagine a more unfortunate position for a young woman of high-toned principles and conscientious scruples to be placed in than that of suddenly finding herself compelled to stifle down the natural feelings of the heart on the one hand, or to set herself in direct opposition to the expressed wishes of her parents on the other.  It certainly was a position calculated to affect Hester Dellaby very deeply.  For many days she endured a mental struggle which depressed her to an unusual degree. She had always been a loving, a dutiful daughter, but not even her filial love nor her sense of duty could blind her to the manifest injustice of her father's behaviour.  She herself blushed with a conscious sense of shame, for no woman likes to be humiliated in the sight of the man who holds her heart, and certainly she had been humiliated that night as she had never been before. </p>
<p>When they reached the house her father said, with none of his habitual peremptoriness abated-- </p>
<p>"I have something more to say to you, and you had better come to me in the library in half-an-hour." </p>
<p>Now arose within his daughter the spirit of 
<pb n="MRS. DELLABY'S TRIUMPH.     35"/>

strength and self-will which he himself had given her, and, with but an ill-suppressed defiance in her tone, she made answer--
<p>"No, sir" (the <hi rend="italic">sir</hi> somewhat galled him);" no, sir. I shall do nothing of the kind.  You can hardly expect me to be so utterly subdued, so meekly submissive, as to keep calm while you ruthlessly and rudely probe and re-probe a fresh and bleeding wound. I  resolutely decline to hold further converse to-night on the subject." </p>
<p>She gave him no time to reply, but, leaving him looking almost dazed with astonishment, went to her room. </p>
<p>Now, there was no wonder Mr. Dellaby was astonished, for this mutinous spirit, as he was pleased to consider it, took him quite by surprise. In the egotism of his own esteem, and the blind belief in his own infallibility as a ruler of his household, he considered that his lightest command ought to beget silent and immediate obedience, while his judgment should be beyond question. </p>
<p>This doctrine was due no doubt to his Indian experience.  When he first went out to our enormous empire in the East, the servants of the great "John Company" were very apt to develop the overbearing and masterful tone which at one time was considered necessary to the complete subjection of the varied races the Company ruled.  Due allowance and some excuse should be made for this, as the positions in which the Company's servants were often placed were well calculated to make them autocrats.  They as frequently as not carried their lives in their hands, and for their own safety, and the safety of all con-</p>

     D 2     

<pb n="36     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

cerned, they had to exact implicit obedience from large numbers of natives.  A man often found himself in some wild district far removed from help or succour if they should be suddenly needed, and in the welfare of his employers, if for no other reason, he was compelled to be determined, resolute, and to make an autocratic and even despotic display of power, for in those days India was truly held by the few against the many, and the slightest show of weakness would have been fatal to the tremendous interests that were bound up in the Company. </p>
<p>This may all seem like an apology for Mr. Dellaby's conduct, and frankly it is to some extent advanced as such, for, after all, it was his head that was wrong, and not his heart.  Wrong he was in principle, no doubt, but he erred conscientiously--that is, he did not believe he was erring at all, therefore was he conscientious. He could not but help feeling some concern at the self-will which had suddenly displayed itself in his daughter. He knew, and he was proud to think that it was so, that she was by no means lacking in character or individuality; but he made the lamentable mistake of regarding her as a child, and, though a child might be obstinate and self-willed, it was imperative on the part of its natural guardian to subdue the obstinacy and curb the will.  Although Mr. Dellaby never dreamed of allowing himself to be swayed by his wife, he liked to discuss matters with her, and take counsel with her, though it was always as one who asks a friend for advice, but who has fully made up his mind beforehand not to accept that advice, however sound it may be. </p>

<pb n="MRS. DELLABY'S TRIUMPH.     37"/>

<p>It is a contradictory and inconsistent trait of character, but one that is pretty common; undoubtedly it was strongly marked in Mr. Dellaby.  So he went to his wife, and she was alarmed by the obvious signs which told her that he had been greatly upset, and was exceedingly distressed.  With great circumstantiality he narrated to her all that had occurred, and when it came to the incident of the beating--in other words, the assault upon young Hallett--she looked up suddenly from her work, for she was embroidering a stool cover, and said plaintively--</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say, William, that you struck him?"</p>
<p>There must also have been a touch of reproof in her tone, or at any rate he thought so, for he responded sharply--</p>
<p>"Yes, of course I did.  I felt it necessary to teach the impudent young beggar a lesson, and I am only sorry that I was not more severe." </p>
<p>Mrs. Dellaby subsided within herself again, and was silent. </p>
<p>"Now, I don't care a pin's point," he continued, "what Hallett may think.  He was leading the child into the paths of disobedience, and he had to be sent to the right-about.  But I am concerned for Hester. When once a girl gets all sorts of absurd notions about love and that kind of thing into her head, she can no longer be reasoned with in the ordinary way. Therefore, like all unreasonable beings, she must be treated without any regard for her feelings." </p>
<p>"Not quite, dear,", very mildly put in his submissive wife, with a sidelong and timid glance at </p>

<pb n="38     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

him, as though she was afraid of the effect her words were calculated to produce. </p>
<p>"I say yes," he cried, with a gesture of impatience, as though he couldn't brook her interruptions.  "I repeat, that her feelings under such circumstances as these cannot be taken into account.  A father who is really desirous of studying his child's welfare must be cruel only to be kind.  Hester is willful, and after all she is but a child. Why, it is only a day or two ago, so to speak, that I was dangling her on my knee." </p>
<p>Once more did Mrs. Dellaby look up from her work, and, in the deferential and subdued manner so characteristic of her, she showed that she was not in entire accord with him, for she remarked-- </p>
<p>"I think, William dear, that we ought not to regard her altogether as a child. Remember that many a young woman at twenty is not only a wife but a mother." </p>
<p>"And shameful it is that it should be so," was her husband's rejoinder. "The idea of a girl of twenty taking upon herself the responsibility of matron and mother.  It is monstrous, upon my word it is, for half the misery in the world is due to youthful marriages.  Boys and girls come together and marry before they are capable of realizing the responsibilities of life.  And what is the result when the false glamour of courtship and honeymoon has worn off?--all the defects in each other's characters and persons become visible, while the sordid and unromantic side of life is revealed. Then commences the misery, and out of misery cometh sin." </p>

<pb n="MRS. DELLABY'S TRIUMPH.     39"/>

<p>Poor little Mrs. Dellaby sheepily and feebly muttered-- </p>
<p>"I fear you are right." </p>
<p>When her husband preached, she listened and bowed to him as one might bow to an oracle. </p>
<p>"Right! of course I am right!" he answered with his assertive egotism made painfully manifest. "Well, now, do you expect me to be a party to Hester's moral suicide ?" </p>
<p>"Certainly not." </p>
<p>"Very well, then, why talk as though you thought I was doing something entirely wrong ?" </p>
<p>"Oh, William," pleaded the submissive little woman, "how can you say that!  You know what faith I have in your judgment; nor can I believe for an instant that you would stand in the way of anything you honestly thought would promote our dear girl's welfare." </p>
<p>"God forbid that I should!" he exclaimed with the emphasis of sincerity.  "I would willingly sacrifice myself rather than throw a cloud over her life ; but I am convinced Hallett is not the man for her.  I believe him to be utterly without principle." </p>
<p>"Are you sure, dear, that that is so?"  queried his wife with a frightened look; for though she had just expressed faith in his judgment, she could not altogether subdue her womanly nature, nor kill the motherly sympathy she ffelt for her daughter. </p>
<p>"Sure!  I am as sure as a man can be sure of anything.  I have learnt enough of his history to feel perfectly justified in my assertion.  I say he is unprincipled.  I say he is a vagabond in the </p>

<pb n="40     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

worst sense of the word; therefore Hester will never have my consent to her union with him. Besides, why should the girl want to marry a soldier?  The best of them are bad--that's been my experience; and, apart from that, there is always the probability of her being early left a widow. My own idea is that neither soldiers nor sailors should be allowed to marry." </p>
<p>"I am afraid, William," remarked his wife, with an attempt at a laugh, as though she wished him to suppose she was perpetrating a small joke,--"I am afraid, William, you would find that the majority of young women would be against you on that point." </p>
<p>"The majority of young women are fools," he answered irascibly; whereupon she gathered that she had made a mistake, and that it would be better to keep silent, having regard to his mood. She knew too well that his self-assertiveness, his unbending will--pig-headedness some people might have called it--his unyielding prejudices, and his obduracy, when he believed himself in the right and other people in the wrong, made it very difficult to reason with him.  At any rate, she was sufficiently conscious of her own weakness to refrain from making the attempt.  But notwithstanding this, and notwithstanding her blind faith in him, she could not subdue certain misgivings that disturbed the rhythm  of her own heart with regard to her daughter; for she knew that Hester had inherited a good deal of her father's strong will, and if in this juncture of affairs the girl should refuse to obey, it might be provocative of disastrous consequences. </p>

<pb n="MRS. DELLABY'S TRIUMPH.     41"/>

With that obsequious deference therefore that she always displayed towards her husband, Mrs. Dellaby ventured to suggest the advisability of dealing with Hester in a diplomatic rather than a commanding spirit, and it was soon made clear to her that this despotic man was not without an underlying fear of the potential evils of any too high-handed course with his daughter.  For, while it was very easy to speak of her in theory as a child, it might be found in practice that she was capable of displaying the will of a determined woman. Anyway, he more than hinted to his wife that she should see what her motherly influence could effect in the way of inducing the girl to renounce Hallett; and thus it came about that shortly afterwards mother and daughter were together, and the mother, by such argument as came within her power, was endeavoring to convince Hester that disobedience and opposition to the wishes of parents were heinous sins on the part of a child. </p>
<p>Hester was quite willing to concede that point when the wishes were just, but she maintained that there were times when a parent's wishes could be legitimately opposed on the grounds that they were inconsistent with common-sense, or not based upon a fair and impartial consideration of the merits of the case.  Further, she fearlessly asserted that in this instance her cause was a just one, and that her father had behaved with a violence which was little short of brutal.  She was indignant and wrathful, as well she might be.  Firstly, because her father had shown so little regard for her feelings; and, secondly, because his insult to Lieutenant Hallett </p>

<pb n="42     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

was rather what might have been expected from an ignorant and ill-bred person than from one who laid claim to be considered a gentleman.</p>
<p>"It cannot be supposed," she said to her mother, "that I am going to dissever myself from Hallett simply because my father has taken a violent and unreasoning prejudice against him."</p>
<p>"But Hallett's career is well calculated to beget prejudice," answered her mother.</p> <p>"Nothing in his career that my father has told me of warrants prejudice on my part. Besides, I have  Jack's solemn assurance that his honour is unstained."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dellaby would not have been a woman if she had failed to appreciate at its full value such an expression of feeling on the part of a girl for her lover as this. It showed that Hester was not to be coerced against her will, and the motherly heart was disturbed with an anxiety that she found it  by no means easy to conceal. But she was conscious  also that the situation could only be saved by her, as neither heated language nor a display of will would avail aught, for the one would only irritate, and will would beget will. So she rose, or rather tried to rise, equal to the occasion, and her efforts I were crowned with a certain measure of success.</p>
<p>Hester was not lacking in a proper sense of  respect for, nor in loyalty and devotion to, her parents, and, therefore, when her mother pointed out that a little concession on both sides in this  instance could hardly fail to conduce to a much better understanding than rashness at a time when tempers were ruffled and relations strained, she lent. an attentive ear.</p>

<pb n="MS. DELLABY'S TRIUMPH.     43"/>

<p>Mrs. Dellaby could not by any stretch of the imagination be  described as a woman of any individuality. The reader will have gathered this from such analysis as has already been made of the lady's character. And it has further been pointed out that she really, if ever, attempted to call her husband's motives or his conduct seriously into question. She had, however, that intuitive power of arriving at a conclusion without reasoning which is a much more feminine than masculine characteristic. For while the man reasons by a process of deduction, a woman goes straight to the point, owing to some instinct--for the want of a better name--which is peculiar to her. In this instance the lady saw that her daughter might be led, but could not be driven, and so all the motherly influence was brought to bear to induce the girl to wait for a little while before attempting to renew her acquaintance with Lieutenant Hallett. Mrs. Dellaby emphasized the argument that time is a great assuager of wrath as it is of grief, and, given a little time, the father's views might <hi rend="italic>possibly</hi>--she used the word "possibly"--might possibly change, and the course of true love be allowed to flow smoothly. Hester was so far impressedd that she consented to her mother's suggestion  that she should go away for a time--go to some relatives who were temporarily sojorning at a country residence not far removed from Flodden's classic ground. The distance from Edinburgh was not great, but teh good lady considered it sufficient to separate the lovers. She urged, however, as the influencing consideration, that Mr. Dellaby

<pb n="44     THE STAR OF FORTUNE."/>

would have time to cool down and think differently. Moreover, as it was utterly impracticable just then that Lieutenant Hallett and Hester could marry, persistency in open courtship could not fail to keep the wound already made open, and be productive of misery and pain. Whereas a period of quiescence would probably bring about in the end what the young people desired.</p>
<p>"This," pursued the lady, who, of course, held a brief for her husband, "will be infinitely better than open rupture with your father.  You know how determined he is in the face of opposition, and it really would be a terrible thing if you and he were to be at constant strife. I do hope, therefore, that you will fall in with my views; and if you will give me your solemn promise that you will not communicate with Hallett, nor attempt to see him, for three months, I will use such influence as I may possess with your father on your behalf. Now, I certainly think this is a very reasonable suggestion, and you may depend upon it that if you are destined to become Hallett's wife, nothing can keep you apart, but it is far better to exercise patience than oppose your father's wishes, and henceforth live your life with a dark shadow over it."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dellaby certainly argued sincerely, if she did not argue well; Hester was influenced, and she gave the required promise of three months' silence. Very reluctantly she gave it, it is true; but she preferred peaces to war, and three months might be the means of changing her father's views. So in the course of a few days she departed for the south, and Mrs. Dellaby felt that she had scored a triumph.</p>

the hour of awful need to show how much of th

Jack Hallett took his disappointment to heart in

way that his most intimate friends would hardl

'have thought possible, for he had generally bee

regarded as a lad who was incapable of any great o

lasting emotion, and rather disposed to be inconstan

if not insincere. But those who thus judged him

looked no further than the surface, and saw nothin

of the germs of the splendid nature that lay in th

depths and only wanted the proper conditions to cal

them into active life.

It was about this time that one or two regiments

which were then stationed at Colchester were under

orders to sail for Persia, and one day Jack presented

himself to the Colonel of his own regiment-an old

warrioi who had seen much service, and who, fromn

his having been very intimate with Jack's father,

was much interested in the lad-and to him he thus

addressed himself- 

"I am very anxious, sir, to have an opportunity to

make a name for myself, if that is at all possible--

The old Colonel laughed gruffly, and said-

"That is a noble ambition, young gentleman, and

I applaud you for it. But you must have patience.

The opportunity comes sooner or later to every 

man."

"Yes, sir, but I want to hurry on my opportunity,

and I want you to help me."

the Colonel, knitting his ragged brows into a stern

expression of thoughtfulness--

Jack waited as patiently as he could for the resul

passed that he began to despair and fret again. 'A

last, however, he was ordered to go to the Colonel'

quarters, and the old soldier thus addressed him-

"Well, sir, are you still desirous of going away ? 

"I am, sir; my desire has not abated one

"Then I have to inform you that the exchange

can be managed, and you must start for the sout

to-morrow."

"I am deeply indebted to you, Colonel, and no less

grateful," said Hallett, with very obvious emotion.

"I want no thanks.   I only hope you will not

regret the step.  The regiment you are leaving is a

Arthur's Seat-that night when her father had

brought the blushes of a stinging wrong and shame

to her cheeks.

" Will you trust me, Hester ? " Jack had- asked.

"Aye, with my life; with the essence of my life,

my woman's heart," she had answered. Now, unless

those were mere windy words, was the pledge-for

it was a pledge-to pass for nothing ? Were they to

have no binding effect upon her conscience ? for let

it be remembered how great was her faith in Hallett.

Had he not declared with an emphasis of assurance

that carried conviction with it, that he and his race

had ever placed honour above worldly gain ? and,

unless it was a mere lover's phrase, she must set it in

the balance against her father's prejudice, for which

he had shown no better warrant than some story he

had been told about a boyish escapade.

So poor Hester struggled with her heart, her

thoughts, her desires, and she felt like one in a

wilderness crying for sympathy; but her cry had to

be stifled, and she had to wear a smile when she was

ready to weep, and weeping would have been far

more in consonance with her feelings.

"Does he dream of me?" she asked herself.

" Will he continue to respect me ? Will he wear my

image in his heart during the dreadful three months ?

Oh, for some sign," she moaned, "some sign to tell

him I am true to him and he to me ! "

A sign came at last, but it was not what she hoped,

wished, and prayed for.

She was sitting in her bedroom one evening. A

charming little room it was, and filled with many a

nick-nack of feminine taste and fancy. An oriel and

i It is well, indeed, that we do not know as we stand

pon the threshold of our career, for if it were given

us to tear aside the curtain that screens the

-absorbed way gazing out to where the moon's

s shimmered on and transfigured the stream until

resembled a channel of agitated molten silver.

visions of the moonlit landscape, something that she

could construe into a prophecy of her future, some

sign that would give her comfort in her great dis-

tress. Anyway, she was so wrapped in thought that

she heard not a tap at her door, and when the door

opened and a white-clad figure glided in, and a

voice exclaimed-" Why, Hetty, girl, are you moon-

struck ?" she sprang up with a cry, and said-" Oh,

Flo, how you startled me ! "

"Why, I thought you must be asleep, for I

knocked twice, and could get no answer," replied

Flo, merrily. " But whatever are you sitting in the

dark for ? Why, if I were to sit in the dark like

that I should see ghosts. Ugh! I hate ghosts. My

teeth chatter at the thought of 'em.  Here, let's

have a light. Where are the matches and the

lamp ? I've got them; it's all right. There, that's

better. Now then, if you're a good girl, and promise

you won't go mooning any more, I'll give you a

letter."

" Has the mail-bag come in ? " asked Hester, with

a little fluttering of the heart.

"Yes, about ten minutes ago, and I've got a letter

from my dear old boy, and there's one for you; not

from my dear old boy, of course not, but I shouldn't

be surprised now  if yours is a love-letter.  It's

addressed in a man's handwriting, at any rate. Now,

I'm going to sit and devour every word of mine, and

suck in all the kisses he sends me, so don't speak to

me for half-an-hour."

She dropped down on an ottoman to feast on her

lover's words, and as poor Hester glanced at the

superscription on the envelope that Flo had thrust








<pb n="75"/>
THE HAND OF FATE.             69

into her hand her heart leapt up, as the saying is,

and the hot blood rushed into her face, for she

recognised Hallett's handwriting. It was the letter

he had posted to her just before he sailed with his

regiment for Persia. For some moments she hesitated

'what to do. Could she trust herself in Flo's presence

to read what he had written?  But Flo seemed so

utterly gone; so entirely without eyes save for the

Iburning lines that her sweetheart had penned, that

er presence could be ignored; and so kneeling by

he table on which stood the lamp, Hester opened

bier letter with very varied emotions agitating her.

he perusal of the communication, every word of

hen up jumped Flo, and clasping her friend in a

ender and sympathetic embrace, said-

- "What is it, Hetty dear ? Confide in me. Have

u had some bad news ?"

It was some moments before Hester could collect

rself sufficiently to answer. She held the letter

htly clasped in her hand, and sobbed.

"Hetty darling, what is it ? Do tell me," urged

companion.

Then Hester gave her friend the letter, saying,

ead for yourself," and, rising, she paced the.

is you've had some silly tiff, and he has taken himself

and on his soul that no one shall replace you. A

man's vows are not always to be believed in, but that

fellow swears deeply, and if you love him-well, you

know there cannot be love without faith and trust.

I have faith in my lad. I know he wouldn't deceive

me, and I hope yours won't."

By this time Hester had regained her self-

possession, and, having now betrayed herself so

far, she felt that it would not do to 'halt midway,

and thus allow her friend to remain under a wrong

impression. That would certainly be a mistake, and

might be productive of harm.  So she told her the

,whole story, concealing nothing, but laying bare

every detail.  Flo listened with an intelligent

interest, and, though she was by disposition some-

what frivolous and at times light-headed, she showed

now, when occasion required it, that she could be

sensible and womanly, and sitting with her chin

resting on her hands, the tips of her fingers on her

Llips, the while her eyes were bent earnestly on the

lamp globe as though she had some hope that she

might draw therefrom inspiration to talk to her

kinswoman in words of wisdom, for wisdom was

wanted in such crisis as this. And when she had

thus pondered for a time, she murmured without

changing her position-

"It's a serious business, Hetty, old girl."

"Yes," moaned Hester, distressfully, "for he has

-eceived him."

g  "Had you no idea he was going?" and Flo

bandoned the lamp now that she might look at

he sorrowful, tear-wet face of her friend.

" Not the slightest."

"Well, he has been hard hit, Hetty," cried Flo,

sing up and entwining her arms about Hester's

eck.

"It is terrible to think that he believes me false.

h, what a fool I've been! My mother had no

usiness to exact that promise from me, and I was an

diot to give it. Tell me, Flo, dear, what shall I do ? "

iThis was a little too much for Flo. She felt to

he full the responsibility thus suddenly thrust

on her in being called upon to act as adviser

such a complicated and delicate case.  She

eeased her hold of her friend, sat down upon the

toman again, crossed her legs, clasped her hands

out her knee, and stared fixedly at the casement,

d not for many moments did she venture on a

eply, but when she did it only served to show how

wildered she was.

"Upon my word, Hester, I don't know," was the

swer.

" You said just now," remarked HEester, "that if

was your case you would follow your lover over the

rld."

"'Oh, yes!" exclaimed Flo responsively, and

king somewhat startied, "but one is apt to say

ings on the spur of the moment one does not

ogether mean in a case of this kind. You see

are their only child, you know, at home. Upon ml

word it's a ticklish business."

Hester, who had continued to pace the room

during the colloquy that had passed, knelt now

before her friend and placed her hands on her

shoulders, looking her full in the face, while with

an impressive earnestness she said- 

"Flo, put yourself in my place, or, better still,

make my case yours. Suppose a breach not of your

making had occurred between you and Reg, andl

supposing Reg, under a misapprehension that you:

were false to him, had started for a far distant-

land; and supposing you loved him with all the

love a woman is capable of bearing for a man,'

what would you do? Would you fold your hands;

and say, it is willed so? Would you with a sub-

missive meekness simper, 'It cannot be helped; II

must make the best of it' ?) 

} Flo was not equal to answering these questions. 

She showed by the distressful look on her pretty i

face that it was too great a tax upon her mental 

powers, or rather, if the strict truth must be told,-

she was afraid to answer as otherwise she might

have answered, for she did not wish Mr. and Mrs.

Dellaby to reproach her with having influenced their 

daughter. Therefore she endeavoured to dissemble :

somewhat, and with some halting of speech she

answered- 

L.. "Well, the fact is, Hetty, I-I-upon my word, I

don't know how I should act. It is difficult to tell

what one would do in an imaginary case."

"But mine is not an imaginary case."

opinion, but I have your promise, and I'll hold you

to it. Come, let us go down."

The two girls joined the rest of the family at

supper, and though Hester tried to look cheerful

and be amiable, she was conscious that the effort

was, partially at least, if not totally, a failure.!

The time seemed to lag so, for she was all impatient

to be alone with her thoughts.

" Are you not well, Hester, this evening ? "

asked her aunt, with an anxious manifestation of

concern. 

"Oh, yes, aunt; well, that is, I have a headache.

I think I will go to bed soon."

"Do, dear," replied the lady. "And look here,i

Flo, don't you keep your cousin up as you have;

to talk to. She likes the sound of her own voice,

would answer her back."

Of course there was general laughter at this, and

Flo protested that her mother was libelling her.

was only too glad of the excuse to do so, and

hurried to her room, having previously wished Flo

good-night as a sign that she wished not to be'

disturbed. 

When she was alone Hester drew out Jack's

Flo understood the cause, and that afternoon as s

and her cousin took their usual stroll she said- -

"Hester, your going home so unexpectedly h

"You said, dear, when you first read it," Hest

answered, "that if it was your case you would follo

"So I did."

"Well, I have had a letter to-day from Madg

and she expresses a strong wish for me to go out t

"And you are going ? " cried Flo, opening wid

her blue eyes in astonishment at this bold decision. 

"Yes." 

"But supposing your people object ? "

"Under the circumstances their objection will hav

"Do you mean to say you would go in spite

"I mean to say their objection would be

CHAPTER IX.

A HAPPY REUNION.

a dusty plain, at a distance of less than forty

iles in a north-west direction from Delhi, stands the

ty of Meerut. At the time of the great mutiny it

as a strong military centre. From an early period

the history of the "Company Bahadoor," as the

ast India Company was called by the natives,

eerut had been regarded as of considerable im-

ortance from a military point of view.  It was

nsidered to be one of the most convenient stations

the North-West Provinces, and was noted for its

tensive cantonments, European and native.

IIn this place the scene of the story is now for the

e being laid. It is early in the month of March

57. The summer heats have not yet set in, and

ugh at midday the sun is powerful, the mornings

Ed the evenings are deliciously cool. A little later

the year the heat of these plains is almost in-

erable to Europeans, and ladies and children

ecially suffer much. March, however, is pleasant

ough, and it was particularly so in '57, for the

ter had been exceptionally cool-that is, for

dia, of course.

n one of the best parts of the town, and not far

m the English lines, stood a large bungalow

or "compound," in which the spring flowers made a

magnificent show. As was usual in European houses

of this class, the garden was walled in by a mud wall,

which was almost hidden from    view by jungly

undergrowth, while cocoa palms, interspersed by

mango trees, overshadowed it. This place was the

Indian home of Lieutenant-Colonel Pritchard and his

family. He had been stationed in Meerut for a

considerable time, and as it seemed then he was

destined to remain for some time longer; for though

signs had appeared, like handwriting on the wall, 

they had been ignored. It was known that a spirit

of discontent was abroad; but the authorities had

chosen to ignore it, and the Europeans never dreamed

of the terrible storm that was brewing; and amongst

those who most firmly believed the natives were

staunch as a body, was Lieutenant-Colonel Pritchard.

Whenever he had heard fears expressed of possible

danger, he had laughed scornfully, saying that he

was prepared to stake his all on the fidelity of the

Sepoys, who, he averred, clearly recognized how

closely their interests were bound up with those of

the white rulers, who, whatever their faults had been 

in the past, were then beyond reproach.   It is

singular that his opinion should have been so

extensively indulged in by those who ought to have

been able to see the way the clouds were drifting.

It is true there had been great and formidable

military mutinies in the past, and more than once the

power of the " John Company " had been threatened.

Only as recently as 1856 there had been a rising

at Vellore, in the Madras Presidency, where two

Sepoy battalions attacked the European soldiers

had evidently agreed with her, and she had not been

long enough in the Indian climate to feel its effects.

Madge was a fine-looking woman, and her husband

was an equally fine-looking man.  They seemed,

indeed, to be a very well-matched couple.  The

little party were partaking of afternoon tea, and

were very merry and happy. As may be supposed,

Hester was an object of peculiar interest, for she was

fresh from the dear old country where there were so

many ties, so many loved ones; and, of course, she 

had numberless questions to answer and much to

tell. "Handsome Sandon," as he had come to be 

called, was particularly attentive to her; and this, 

and the burning glances with which he regarded

her now and again, did not escape the notice of

Mrs. Pritchard, who, although she had been to

Calcutta to meet her sister, had had so many

other things to talk about, that she had found no

time to touch upon any affairs of the heart. Nor

had Hester so far breathed a syllable about her

connection with Hallett.  Nevertheless, he was

ever present in her thoughts, and she burned with

an eager desire to know where he was, if he had

received her- note, and if he thought of her as she

thought of him.

Sandon had only that very day been introduced

to Hester.  Mrs. Pritchard had organised a little-

excursion to a ruined temple on the banks of the

Goomtee, and he was included in the invitations.

But he had certainly made the best use of his time,:

and had shown a decided preference for the young.

to remind the reader, had been annexed under Lord :

Dalhousie, to the intense dissatisfaction of the land-

population of Oudh were Hindoos, and from this source

the Bengal army was principally supplied. The Oudh-

tlAtte, being a warlike race, made splendid soldiers, and 

were quick and apt at learning English drill. They were

fearless riders, excellent swordsmen, and at first seemed 

to take kindly to the new condition of things. Up to the

time of the Mutiny the native regiments were made up

almost entirely of Oudhmen.                        :

--' I don't think she will," was the only answer the

Captain made. However, Mrs. Pritchard was quite

satisfied. She felt that she had scored a very good

point, and that in a short time she might be able to

announce a formal engagement between her sister

and the gallant Captain Sandon of the 6th Dragoon

Guards.

-. By this time they had entered the cantonments,

when they became aware of some commotion going

on. Mrs. Pritchard pulled up her horse, as the

road was filled with a noisy, excited crowd of-

budmashes and a picket of carabineers, who were

driving a strange-looking old man before them. He

had a long white beard, and was garbed as a fakir.

The expression of his weazened little face was one

of supreme contempt, and his hands were folded on

his breast, as if he felt he was a martyr, and he was

trying to impress the crowd with his own views.

Captain Sandon jumped down to see what was the

matter.  In a few minutes he returned to Mrs.

Pritchard, who had waited with the buggy.

the crucial test for which every one in the secret had

they remained motionless. Their eyes glowed with

on his horse like a statue in front of the muti-

"I echo that hope," said Sandon, "but I also-

sign of weakness on our part at this juncture will be

fatal. It must not be forgotten that we have to deal

HOPES AND FEARS.

? soon as Hester was alone she sank down on to a

ir, and for some moments held the precious letter

rthout daring to open it. Her heart beat violently,

temples throbbed; she was feverish with excite-

ent. This letter was far more to her at that stage

an all the burning questions that were vexing the

uls of natives and Europeans alike throughout

dia.' The one she only understood as a vague and

stract principle; the other, that is, her lover's

tter, was a concrete and solid fact. If there should

a tendency to condemn her for what may be con-

momentous imperial matters, let it not be forgotten

he would never have been in India; and, being in

dia, she now, after weary waiting and sickening

spense, held a letter in her hand from the man in

lhom she had built up her faith-in whom she had

Raced her trust-and who seemed to her, from her

eman's standpoint, her heaven-appointed destiny.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BAZAAR.

RE was one man at least in Meerut-there might

did not hesitate to openly express his astonish-

ont that the shackled eighty-five degraded troopers

ould have been placed under the care of a native

ard only. Of course the subject of the day's

ings was the one common topic of conversation

*roughout the station on Saturday night. At the

nteens, at the messes, in the bungalows it was

cassed. Captain Sandon did not dine at his mess

at night, but sallying forth in mufti, he resolved

go into the native quarters and hear what opinions

pre expressed. He had for some time been apply-

g himself most diligently to the study of Hindoo-

anee, and being a clever man, with great aptitude

r the acquisition of languages, he had made such

pid progress that if he didn't speak it fluently he

least understood all that was said.

Now, in taking the course he did that night, and

was one by no means free from risk, he was

ctuated by motives different to those he might have

penly confessed to. His zeal as an officer and his

yalty as a soldier could not for a moment have








<pb n="214"/>

been called into question, but, under the circ

stances that then existed, he was not compelled

any regulation order ,to play the part of the ea

dropper in the native quarters. Nor could his act _

construed even into a fulfilment of duty. His posit

as an officer did not impose upon him just then

such work. But there was another motive perhaps ;

vague one it might have been, and he might even ha;

declined to have confessed to himself that it had an

existence at all. The motive was some anxiety f

Hester Dellaby and for Mrs. Pritchard's children.

He was-to put it in absolutely plain language

desperately in love with Hester, and he was unmi

takably fond of her nephew and niece. When a

man is in love with a woman she influences his

actions and motives to a much greater extent than

he is ever aware of. In this instance, believing as _

he did that there was a lurking danger threatening,

the station, he was anxious for the safety of those 

who were dear to him. As a soldier he would have

been the first to have exclaimed-               i

"Though these natives are as the sands of the :

sea-shore, and we are but a handful, we will fight

them and pulverize them, or, failing that, die with

our faces to the foe as British soldiers ever do." 

But the reason of his anxiety was the astonishing

supineness of those in command. He saw with the 

far-seeing eye of a tactician that too much faith was

: being placed on native loyalty.  The little puffy

upheavals that had taken place here and there-at

k Madras, Dum   Dum, Barrackpore-impressed him

deeply with the idea that there were internal fires i

at work, and at some unlooked-for moment the

>really is an astonishing thing that he stood

t alone in this view. At any rate, he was allt

one in his boldness in expressing it. The fact;

at for some inscrutable reason those in high

ority did not like to lay themselves open to a,

CHAPTER XXII.

THE STORM BREAKS.

AY, the 10th of May, dawned in all the brilliancy

Indian morning on the doomed station. The

morning ride or drive was taken as usual by

Europeans, and the business of the day pro-

ed with its wonted regularity.  In due course

bugles sounded church parade, and soldiers and

ers turned out looking spick and span in polished

ons, fresh pipe-clay, and brushed-up clothes,

e their highly-burnished accoutrements' flashed

scintillated in the dazzling sunlight.

ptain Sandon intended as soon as service was

r, or at any rate as soon as he could get away, to

over to Mrs. Pritchard's bungalow. As chance

.d it, he met her and Hester and the children

ng out of church. They all greeted him very

nmly. They seemed to be in excellent spirits and

ect health. Of course he had not heard any-

g more of the bazaar incident. On his own bare

rt it was not a matter likely to be investigated

unday. To the authorities possibly it presented

as a mere riot, in which a British officer had

compelled to defend himself from the fanatical

k of a drunken native, and the native got the

of it. Rows of the kind were not altogether

quent between the natives and Tommy Atkins,

but if Tommy Atkins or his superior officer s

native in piping times of peace the subject wa

calling for official investigation, but still it w

so urgent as to necessitate dislocation of S

routine in order that a court of inquiry shoul

held.  Consequently Sandon knew perfectly 

there would be, no steps taken until the m &

morning, nor was the incident likely to be gene'

known over the station until then. It was ob

Captain Sandon thought he had never seen H

looking so radiant, the children so bonnie, or

Pritchard herself so charming as they did on 

eventful morning. As every one knows, in a

tary station like Meerut, Sunday partakes 

much of the nature of a show     day.   To      _

Atkins seldom appears to better advantage thani

Sunday, and it is the one day when the Bri'

officer doesn't seem to be ashamed of his unif

Certainly Captain Sandon need not have

table reason known only to the British officer, l

like all his confreres, would never appear in unif

less his face wore an expression of gravity altogethbe

foreign to it, and it led to both ladies inquiring if h

ald anything on his mind. The fact was he had

good deal on his mind, and never before perhaps in

the whole course of his existence had he fouridi

himself confronted with a more perplexing situation.

His intention in going to the house was to utter a,

word of warning to Mrs. Pritchard, and urge her to.:

send Hester and the children off to Calcutta as soonl

as possible. But now that it came to the-point helm

was disposed to shirk the matter. Suppose he uttered 

the warning, suppose his suggestion was carried out,j X

and suppose after all his fears proved groundless, 

what then?   Would he not appear in a very 

ridiculous light ? The word "alarmist" so frequently !

applied to him of late would then seem more than 

justified; and would his friend Pritchard ever forgive 

him for having needlessly frightened his wife and

(: ~4~:ie-l/aw ?'                              '   !

j- These conflicting thoughts disturbed him, as may

8 be supposed, and he could not make up his mind'

decisively one way or the other. He thought mayhap

that a smoke would help him to a solution of the:

problem, and he asked if he might be allowed to go

out on to the verandah to enjoy a cigar.

C Certainly," answered Mrs. Pritchard.  " You

know you are privileged, Captain.  Hester and I

intend to have a short siesta. I've ordered the buggy

he may save to-morrow's mail."

" Thanks !" exclaimed the' Captain, looking more

4han ever perplexed and troubled.  So marked was

this that Mrs. Pritchard noticed it, and said-

"Why, Captain Sandon, whatever is the matter

,iVlth you ? I've never seen you look so miserable

' since I've known you."  Then suddenly, as if some

'inspiration had struck her, she added, with a pretty,

lartful, and very womanly smile, "Is it all for love of

my dreadful sister?"

Hester had left the room, as she had gone to see

'the children before they took their afternoon nap.

The question seemed to the Captain to give him a

'keynote, and he answered-

" In a sense, yes, it is."

" Poor fellow," returned Mrs. Pritchard, with a

comical sigh. " But your triumph perhaps will come,

Captain. You know a girl before her marriage has

the power.   Afterwards she is simply a domestic

'slave."

"Even as you are," he answered, brightening into

a laugh. " A slave who rules her master."

: "If you are so dreadfully gone on Hester," pur-

sued Mrs. Pritchard laughingly, for the subject was

-congenial to her, "why don't you propose to her in

that the girl admires you, and you ought to know

AN IMPROVISED FORT.

WITH a cry of fear, and an appeal to heaven for

protection, Mrs. Pritchard threw her arms about her

children and sobbed, while Hester, catching the

alarm, inquired anxiously what the news was that

Felbey had brought.

"A riot is going on," answered Sandon, "and

some houses have been set on fire. That is all the

news at present."

At this moment the ayah (the children's nurse)

rushed on to the verandah, and falling down at the

feet of her mistress, she moaned out-

"Mem Sahib, the servants have deserted. They

have gone off to the bazaars. They say that all the

white people are to be killed."

" And you, are you going to remain faithful,

Sada? " demanded her mistress, with a fierceness

that was begotten by her maternal anxiety for the

safety of the little ones, and looking as if she were

about to seize and shake the nurse.

"Oh, yes, mem Sahib, your poor Sada will be

'faithful," cried the ayah, as she shrank away and

cowered with fear.

"But I won't trust you," exclaimed Mrs. Prit-

chard, clutching her now frightened children to her

'breast.

.

" Oh, mem   Sahib; oh, mem   Sahib, don't

her right hand towards heaven, and said solemn

-"My people may torture me, they may hack

to pieces and kill me, but may Shiva smite me wit

leprosy and condemn me to be an eternal outc

if I am not faithful to you."

Captain Sandon heard these words, and, comi

forward, he said-

"Mrs. Pritchard, I am sure you may trust th!

woman.   While all your other servants dese

The poor mother seemed terribly distressed an

half dazed with a dread anxiety, but she wa

she caught the ayah's hand, and said in a voicd

choked with emotion-

Captain Sandon and Lieutenant Felbey had bee

holding a consultation while this little scene wa

being enacted, and at last Felbey said-

"I must return, Captain. Will you accompan

me ?"

"No; we cannot leave these ladies and childre

"But I am under orders, sir," replied the youn

fellow, with an anxious expression.

"Your duty both as a soldier and a man deman

elbey at this command sprang on to his horse, and

oped down the compound, while Sandon ran to

stables, intending to saddle a horse for himself,

d harness another to the buggy. Mrs. Pritchard

s an excellent driver, and the buggy would hold

children, the ladies, and the ayah, while he and

lbey would ride as escort. But he found when he

ached the stable that the syce had gone off with

ery horse, and he returned to the house to report

is to Mrs. Pritchard, whose anxiety, as may be

agined, was greatly increased.  But Sandon

eerily encouraged her to keep her spirits up,

ying that he did not think the riot would swell to

gy great proportions.  "The white troops," he

ded, "will sweep out of their cantonments like a

hirlwind, and scatter these dogs as the wind

atters chaff."

Although he spoke thus he did not believe what

e said, for he was convinced that if the native

oops had revolted there would be dreadful carnage,

d wherever it was possible for them to do so the

utineers would resort to pitiless massacre.

I, "There is the key of my husband's cupboard

will do battle for her young. A human mother is

not less than a mouse."

I "You are a brave woman," answered the Captain;

" but I hope for your sake it will not come to fighting.

It is well, however, to be prepared."  He selected

|two army revolvers that were in the rack.  Then

from the ammunition in the cupboard he loaded both

{he weapons.   One he thrust into his own belt;

tlhe other he laid upon the table, saying-" I will

leave that one there for the present. I am going

For a moment Mrs. Pritchard's face paled again

iat this announcement.  Then she remarked firmly

and pointedly-

" God in heaven bless you, and may He protect

Felbey set energetically to work to carry out tV

order. An English bull's-eye lantern stood on a sii

table. Sandon seized it, struck a match, applied i

to the wick, which lighted readily, then returned t

the room where the ladies were.

"Mrs. Pritchard," he said, "I think it will bee

" Do you know, I was going to suggest that too,' <

she answered, wonderfully collected now that th&

moments and handing the keys to Sandon. Followed

cowed with fright and did not even whimper, he 

hurried across the compound, lighting the way with -

the bull's-eye. He got the door of the storehouse 

open; he sent. the ayah and the children in, and,

leaving them the lantern, he asked the ladies to help

him to bring over some things from the house. AS

they returned they met Felbey struggling along

i" This reminds one of a moonlight flitting," re-

ked the young fellow gaily.

The din and uproar now were dreadful, and the

are of flames could be seen in all directions, while

e incessant roll of musketry told how fiercely the

uggle raged. But there was one sound Sandon

tened for in vain-the sound of big guns-and he

|ondered why the artillery had not been let loose

ainst the mutineers, for the howls and cries, the

rid flames, and the report of the rifles made it

nly too painfully clear that mutiny of a terrible

ind was going on. "It couldn't be possible," he

hought, " that the European troops had been

verawed and rendered powerless. Why then did

hey not make the big guns speak ?"

He and Felbey and the two ladies worked with

such will and energy, that in an almost incredibly

hort space of time they had carried over a great

qantity of things, including all the ammunition and

rms ; the Colonel's papers and business books;

bedding for the children and the ladies; food, water,

andles, and other necessaries; and a considerable

mount of fodder from the stable for Felbey's horse,

hich was taken into the godown.

This place was by no means ill adapted for a

temporary place of refuge. It was solidly built, as

-host places of the kind were. It was oblong in

shape, one storey high. Access was gained to it by

. large doorway. The door was divided into two

alves--one half fastened by bolts shooting up and

rown into the frame-work the other by a stout lock.








<pb n="244"/>
23S           TIE STAR OF FORTUNE.

Over the doorway was a small window about fiftee

feet from the ground. It was protected by three

:tout iron bars. Along each side of the building

were three or four slits not unlike loopholes; their

principal use was to admit air. Each slit was pro-

tected by an iron bar solidly let into the masonry;

3Not that anything human could have got through

the slits, but small animals might. One side and:

one end of the place abutted on the high garden

wall. It was, in fact, poked up in a corner so to

speak, and there was a narrow  alley-way between

the godown and the wall about three feet wide. It

was choked up with rubbish, principally broken cases

and boxes. Inside were a number of cases of wine,

barrels of beer, casks of flour, two or three bags of

rice, a bag of sugar, and domestic stores of that

kind, besides a number of garden tools and a great

quantity of empty boxes and barrels, and some

spare domestic utensils. The horse was placed in a 

uorner;. then the- door was barricaded with boxes,

and a platform raised so that the window could be

reached, for that window practically commanded the

garden in a military sense. Next, bedding was laidc

on a platform of boxes at the end farthest from the

door, and the ayah proceeded to put the children 

into bed, without undressing them, however; and, 

squatting beside them, she crooned Indian lays and

lullaby songs, and tired out as the little ones were,

they speedily dropped off to sleep.

All the fire-arms were loaded, and the ammunition

so placed that it was fairly well protected from

chance ignition. Amongst the arms were two of the

new pattern Enfield rifles, four or five old smooth-

ore Brown Bess guns, several sporting rifles, and a

eavy double-barrel rifled tiger gun, which carried a

ery formidable ball. This gun was placed on the

|latform for use at the window.  In addition the

little garrison were provided with four revolvers.

With this by no means inconsiderable arsenal at

their disposal, Sandon and Felbey felt confident of

being able to hold the improvised fort until help

eached them, and they talked cheerfully and chatted

Ipleasantly in order to keep up the spirits of the ladies.

All the preparations were carried out in a shorter

space of time than it has taken to describe them, but

none too soon, for from the glare that fell through

the window and the openings in the walls, it seemed

as if the whole station was a roaring furnace of

flame, while the sea of fire was roll'ag nearer and

nearer.  From out the clear sky the stars looked

down-looked down on a scene of carnage and

hellish wrath that must have made the very angels

hide their faces in horror at the sight,

CHAPTER XXIV. 

THE TIGER RIFLE SPEAKS.

IN choosing Sunday night for their outbreak, the muti

neers showed that they had calculated their chancesI

with almost mathematical precision. Most of the Euro-

peans were at church or on their way to church, and a

larger number of soldiers were allowed out of barracks

than on a week-day night, and these men were not

allowed, of course, to carry arms. The fool's paradise,-

against which Captain Sandon had so often railed, was

never more clearly indicated than on that memorable 

Sunday. The authorities apparently had given them-.

selves no concern about the desperate prisoners in the'

gaol, and their sympathetic and no less desperate guard.

Yet, as is now well known, from the moment when the

manacled troopers were marched to the prison, solemnli

vows were made that ere the moon had risen and set,

twice they should be liberated; and two native bearers&

i were dispatched with all haste to bear that resolution to

the native troops in Delhi, who were warned to be on

i the alert and ready to rise when the mutineers from

Meerut came in sight of the royal city.

Throughout the Meerut bazaar the signal ran that

when the white people were at their place of worship':

i on Sunday evening the gaol was to be attacked, the'

prisoners liberated, and the streets were then to run red:

little army of native blacksmiths made their way to

gaol. The prisoners were liberated, and the black-

ere apprised of what was taking place, fearlessly rode

the gaol, thinking their very presence would still the

i.With true oriental barbarity these gaol-birds mas-

sex, and applied their torches with shrieks of exulta-

on to the bungalows of the English residents.

As for the Sepoys, they no longer displayed any

eligious scruples regarding the greased cartridges, the

lleged excuse for the mutiny. On the contrary, the

w ammunition was handled with perfect freedom, and

ithout a thought of caste.

Inflamed with success and fanatical fury the tide of

evolt rolled on. While the British commander was

wasting precious moments in considering what was to

be done, the rebel army swelled in numbers. From

i adjacent villages and hamlets the budmashes came

ipouring in, eager to share in the plunder, and to take

ipart in the hideous scenes of bloodshed.

: It was a scene that words fail to give any adequate

conception of. From the burning houses there belched

forth on the sultry air of the Indian night great pinnacles

and pyramids of flame, while every now and then the

piteous shrieks of women, the frantic cries of children,

mingled with the explosion of ammunition barrels and

the roll of musketry.

Colonel Pritchard's house escaped the first blast of

the storm owing to its position. It was somewhat out,

of the main track. The Colonel had built it himself

and he had chosen the spot on account of its picturesque-

Iness, and because he rather liked to be isolated. But

bent as they were on the destruction and plunder of

ievery European house, and on the killing of every

European they could lay their hands on, the natives

were not likely to forget the Pritchard bungalow and

ts occupants, and a great mob, headed by frantic

And so the sacred lares and penates of the once

appy household were desecrated by these sacrilegious

hounds, and the work of destruction went merrily on.

Then from several places at once the flames shot up.

The lamps that were filled with oil were dashed against

the walls so that the oil might feed the fire-not that

[that was needed. So rapidly did it spread that some of

tjhe mob had a difficulty in making their escape, and as

I it was, three or four of them were actually scorched.

|Had it not been for the treacherous syce, the chances

Inotice of the plunderers. But the syce knew there

was a goodly store of wine and beer there, and in

their half-maddened state the natives  craved  for

|drink, though at other times they would not have

touched it.

- "Here, the godown, the godown," roared the syce,

as the crowd was swarming out of the compound, which

was now brilliantly lighted up by the flare of the burning

I building.

' "Aye, aye, the godown," answered many voices, and

the stream began to stop its flow outwards.

" I have oft been in the place," yelled the sycb.

" There is plenty of stuff there. Ho! a battering-r

Pell-mell, headlong rushed the mob towards t

godown, tumbling over each other, and struggli

frantically to be first. A young tree was drawn up-

and five or six men holding it advanced, crying as the

.'went-.

'" Clear the way, clear the way for the batterin

Suddenly from the window over the door belched.

three of the crowd rolled over into the dust, dead. 

Before tile cowards could recover from the temporary

panic this utterly unlooked-for event threw them into,

there was another spurt of fire, another report, and two 

more fellows pitched over, never to rise again. 

It was the tiger rifle that had spoken, and its deadly 

messengers had smitten five of the enemy to death.








<pb n="255"/>
CHAPTER XXV.

IN DESPERATE STRAITS.

THE great crowd that like any angry sea rose and fell,

and moved now this way and now that around the

godown, seemed for some moments to be paralysed by

the unlooked-for outpouring of flame and death. It

had taken them so utterly by surprise, and five of

their number lay dead, while one or two others who

had been wounded were writhing on the ground. The

syce had escaped owing to the fact of his being close to

the door, and its defenders could not so depress the

muzzle of their heavy tiger rifle as to pour its leaden

messengers on the men who were immediately beneath

the window. But the execution done in the direct line

of fire was relatively great, and the moral effect for the

moment was tremendous. The mob fell back from the

dark and deadly building with an instinctive feeling

of horror. Nothing affects an undisciplined rabble so

much as to be menaced from unexpected quarters and

by an unseen enemy, and something like a paric seized

many of these budmashes, who fled to shelter, while

some threw themselves flat upon the ground. This

served to increase the general fright, as it was thought

the death-roll was much larger than it was. The syce,

who had constituted himself the leader of that section

of rascals who had attacked Colonel Pritchard's bunga-

low,' was no less panic-stricken than his fellows, a

hastily dropping the improvised battering-ram he flef

i t he nearest tree. Meanwhile, the defenders reloaded 

their deadly tiger rifle, and were once more ready for,

the assault should it be made. 

When the natives had recovered from the first shock,r

rd. the reaction set in, they. gave vent to a fierce out-

burst of passionate execration, and there arose a great

-ery for vengeance. The courage of the syce returned, 

.and divining that Captain Sandon and the ladies must 

have sought shelter in the godown, he thirsted for

the life of the man who had that very day treated him 

so roughtly. Stepping from behind the tree where heo 

had sheltered himself, he yelled- 

"Brethren, shall we stand calmly by and see our  :

:friends shot down as if they were pariah dogs ?"

"No, no, no," answered the excited mob.

" Shall we exact a deadly reckoning for this slaughter

;"So be it. In this godown some of the accursed

Feringhees have sought shelter. Shall we allow them

"No, no. Death to them."

"Let us batter the door down then, and drag the

Ti This suggestion was answered by another furious

.was the scene. The burning bungalow threw a blood-

red light over all the surroundings. The flames roared,

-the timbers crackled, and dense masses of sparks shot

'the night wind. Excited to a state that was little short

L of raving madness, the rabble charged the godown, but

a volley of bullets tore through their ranks, and several

of their number bit the dust. On the door blows were

rained with sticks and stones, and the sapling which

had been dragged up for a ram was brought into play,

but without producing any material effect. Wild with

rage, yet baffled, the crowd once more fell back just as

the roof of the burning bungalow collapsed with a

tremendous crash, and a huge column of sparks rose up

to the very sky, while dense, suffocating. volumes of

smoke filled the grounds and temporarily obscured

everything.  Taking advantage of this the crowd

made a rush for the godown once more, and furiously

attacked the door with sticks and bars of iron, which

some of them carried. The woodwork was splintered

and cracked, but the door did not yield, for it had

been well barricaded from within. At this juncture of

affairs cries and shouts were heard, and another band of

insurgents came rushing up, many of them carrying

fire-arms, and amongst their number were several

Sepoys armed with muskets and tulwars. The new-

comers were hailed with a roar of delight, and the

position of matters was soon explained. Then a storm

of bullets fell upon the door of the godown, and it was

answered by a volley from the defenders, who felt,

however, as if all hope had gone.

Sandon had watched from the godown window the

angry mob break into Colonel Pritchard's house, and

he saw it given to the flames. So incensed was he,

that had it not been for the two ladies, the children,

and the native nurse under his care, he and his young

comrade Felbey would have sallied forth and ruan

swordsmen, and though they might ultimately have

Gould have given an excellent account of themselves,

and would have done terrible execution before they

i ad fallen. But the defence of the little building was

-ji their hands, and as men and soldiers they could not

desert'their post. During the sacking of their house

Mrs. Pritchard exhibited great alarm. It was terrible

to see her once happy home desecrated by a brutal

and fanatical mob, and little odds and ends that were

endeared to her by a thousand and one associations

destroyed or trampled in the dust. The anxiety and

fear she suffered on account of her children may be

left to the imagination. For her precious darlings to'

fall into the hands of the tigerish wretches who were

thirsting for blood was horrible to contemplate, and

ilshe shuddered again and again, and bent weepingly

^   hier children with the passionate devotion of a

^.mother. Both the children had gone to sleep,

:!oothed with the lullaby of the faithful nurse; but

the yells and cries of the insurgents roused them.

With an expression of fear Freddy leapt up and flung

his arms about his mother's neck, while she strained

him to her bosom and moaned out a prayer to the

Father of all mercy, that He would protect her lambs.

;For some little time Amy remained quiet, her eyes

tfi:de open and turned to the slits in the wall, through

:,hich fell the lurid glare from the burning house. Then

presently she uttered a half-suppressed cry of alarm,

and stretching her hands out to the nurse murmured-

After the first rush of the mob on the godown, Mrs.

Pritchard called Captain Sandon to her side, and, dis-

mounting from the little platform under the window,

he went to her. He had stripped off his coat and his

waistcoat; his shirt-sleeves were rolled up; his arms

were bare. His sword was buckled round his waist,

and two revolvers were stuck in his belt. He looked

now the stern, determined soldier that he was, and one

who would be dangerous while life lasted.

"Captain," said Mrs. Pritchard solemnly, and speak-

ing in low tones so that the others might not hear,

" you have been a good and true friend to us, and my

poor husband had a great faith in you. I for one do

not expect to leave this place alive, but I am resolved

that neither I nor my beloved children will fall into the

power of the demons who are thirsting for our blood.

Give me one of your revolvers. When all hope has

gone my little ones shall die by my hand."

" Come, come," he answered cheerily, " I don't

think our position is so desperate as that. We have

heaps of ammunition, and Felbey and I can keep a

horde at bay for hours. When the first panic that has

seized the station has passed, the troops will sweep the

town clear of those devils. The 6th Dragoon Guards,

the 60th Rifles, and the Horse Artillery Batteries are

within a mile and a half of us. Generals Hewett and

Wilson cannot remain inactive, and it is impossible to

imagine that all the white troops have been destroyed.

'No, it cannot be. In a little while we shall hear the

boom of the big guns and the rattle of the sabres as our

men are let loose. But if the worst comes to the worst,

JI will cut my way out and bring succour."

She shuddered and caught his arm, as she said-

ight along the animal's neck to avoid striking his

against the beam of the doorway. He dug his

at plunge the poor beast bounded out, scattering and

shing down the lumber that had been piled up. If

rebels could not have been more thunderstruck

Felbey dug in his spurs, and slashing right and

with his sword he got free, leapt his horse over the

pound wall, and gaining the road went at break-

k speed towards the cantonments. The heavens

ed filled with fire, and the air palpitated with

uts and cries from all quarters.

'ot that he had any intention of capitulating. There

nothing to hope for from the wretches who were

sting and clamouring for his life. If the woman he

d and the wife of his friend fell into the hands of

rebels, they would meet with a fate worse than

h,while even the innocent children would be subjected

the most fiendish torture. But he resolved that should 

er be. He was too brave a man to dream of giving

e responsibility, he showed that he was equal to them

t until succour arrived, and that was dependent on

would surely bring relief, for it was impossible to

ppose that the rebels would be allowed to retain their

-gotten victory when daylight came. The problem,

trefore, that Sandon had to solve was how to keep

e besiegers from setting fire to the godown. Although

had lost two of his little garrison, he received a

inforcement in the person of Mrs. Pritchard. She

ognised how desperate was the situation, and sternly

dding her children to keep quiet, and not cry for her,

d leaving them and her sister in the care of the ayah,

easked Captain Sandon to utilize her services in

me way. He thereupon placed her at the loopholes

h a couple of rifles, while he busied himself for the

e in carrying out a little scheme that had come

on him like an inspiration.

Amongst the stores in the godown were seven cases

brandy. Prising open the lids of some of these cases,

took out several bottles, and knocked off the heads

h the back of his sword. Then he stood the bottles

tineers had become appallingly heavy, the cooler

ads of the disciplined Sepoys prevailed, and so, while

attention of Sandon was kept occupied by apparent

empts to make a bonfire in front of the door-though

e rascals took good care not to expose themselves to

Ie burning spirits nor the bullets-a number of men

anted the ladders on the wall and against the side of

e building, and mounting they began to tear the roof

Cay.

Sandon had become aware, by the tactics of the

emy in front, that some new plan was being tried,

ough he could not determine what it was. But

resently the ayah crept down from her perch amongst

he boxes, where she was attending to Hester and the

Children, and moving noiselessly over the ground with

ier bare feet, she went to Sandon and whispered-

A "Captain Sahib! they are on the roof."

This warning was full of terrible meaning, and

though he did not like to think that all was quite lost,

et it was difficult to hope. With the coolness which

dcharacterized him throughout the trying hours, he

boaded every gun and revolver, and while he did not

eax his vigilance at the window, he kept a sharp look-

ut above. The sounds that were heard made it now

6nly too evident that the wretches were pulling the roof

CHAPTER XXVII.

FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH.

As poor Mrs. Pritchard gave utterance to this defia

expression, she made a dash for a revolver which I

IManding, rifle raised ready to fire at the first head t

appeared at the hole in the roof. He guessed her obje

'for, half distracted as she was, she was not responsib

for her actions. He therefore seized her arms, but

'was only after a struggle that he succeeded in getti

te weapon from her.

I pray you be calm," he said sternly. " All is

':lost."

As if to give contradiction to his statement, anot

mass of flaming material was at that moment ur

screamed, and as they clung in horror to the ayah they

called out piteonsly-

"C Mamma, mamma, mamma, come to us."

From without came the roar of the rebels as they

realized now how near they were to their prey. Any

one who has ever heard the yelling of a savage mob

infuriated to a pitch of madness can never forget it,

while those who happily have not had that experience

cannot imagine it. The roar of a wounded tiger in the

jungle as he sees his destroyers bearing down upon him

is one of the most appalling sounds in savage nature,

and yet it is nothing to the roar of men thirsting for

the lives of their fellow beings. That angry, desperate

mob around the godown seemed with their cries for

vengeance to rend the very air, and shake even the

solid building itself.

" Drag them out, drag them out," they shouted.

" We'll cut them slowly to pieces, and the Captain

Sahib shall be roasted alive. Bring them out, bring

them out. Take them alive that we may torture

them."

These cries rose and fell like the sounds of tumultuous

waves beating against iron rocks; and the mob surging

like a wind-tossed sea, swept now this side, now that,

and dashed themselves against the godown; recoiling

with the shock, but rushing on again till many of their

number were trampled down and crushed to death.

Captain Sandon, although he realized that hope was

'all but dead, manfully, bravely, heroically did his best

to keep the host at bay, but his movements were terribly

'hampered by Mrs. Pritchard, who seemed to have

'become quite distraught. The very desperateness of the

'situation, on the other hand, restored Hester to con-

|seiousness and activity. Looking ghastly in her pall

i w*hich was enhanced by the blood that still trickled froh

fthe wound in her forehead, she suddenly rose up froi

whiere she had been lying, and throwing her arms abou

her sister, said sternly--

i: a Madge, for shame. Be calm. Our protector w

|s:ave. us. Even now I hear the thunder of gallopin

5orseRs. Succour is coming to us."

|    M :- My children, my children, save them," shrieke

the unhappy mother, whose intense horror, engendere

by the prospect of her little ones falling into the handi

|.of the tigerish horde, had literally made her mad.

"They will be saved," answered Hester, speaking

r.with strange calmness, and as if prompted by som

prophetic instinct. " I tell you I hear the sounds o

beating hoofs. The troops are coming." 

Uninfluenced by this assertion, Mrs. Pritchard, wit

a wail of agonising despair, tore her hair, and breakin

"ont her sister's restraining grasp, rushed to her,

eand clasped them frantically to her bosom,

g out the while-

" God, God, why have you forsaken us ? "

With this outpouring of her great agony nature

succumbed, and a blessed unconsciousness suddenl

seized her as she fell forward in a swoon. Then the

yah once more took the children to her arms and 

oned a lullaby to them   in her attempt to soothe

:Dujlng the occurrence of these pathetic incidents the 

oic Sandon had not remained inactive.   All the

strength, strong as he was, he had piled up some of the

cases until they nearly reached the rafters, then with

the revolvers stuck in his belt, his sword girded about

him, a rifle in his hand, and telling Hester to hand up

E the gulls as he wanted them, he clambered to the top of

his platform, which enabled him to look through the

hole in the roof, and blazing away with a revolver in

each hand, he bowled over the ruffians who were pre-

paring to hurl another mass of blazing material into the

godown.

It was a further surprise for the foe, who, baffled

once more, howled again and again with hellish rage.

But suddenly there arose from some. of their number a

great shout of alarm, and they began to scatter as a

herd of sheep will do when a dog gets amongst them;

and as they fled there came to the ears of the beleaguered

little party in the godown the welcome sounds of a true

British cheer. This was succeeded by a volley, and a

body of cavalry dashed into the compound, some sweep-

ing through the gateway, others leaping their horses

over the walls and sabring and cutting down the dusky

ruffians without pity.

Succour had come at last. The gallant Felbey,

fighting his way through all those who tried to oppose

him, reached the cantonments, and making known

Captain Sandon's position, a company of troopers were

immediately ordered to gallop to the rescue. As they

tore along the road, which was brilliantly illuminated

by the burning bungalows, and riding over and cutting

down crowds of rascals as they swept onwards like a

tornado, it was a neck and neck race who should be

first at the Pritchard compound. Thundering onward,

and panting for vengeance on some at least of the

.'brutes who had that night deluged Meerut with so

much innocent blood, they hurled themselves into the

.om pound, and scattered the cowardly foe like sand

;efore a simoom. 

? As Sandon realized that help had come at last he

' sprang down from his platform. He was grimed witha

'p-owder, smoke, and' dust; it was difficult almost to

5ieeognise in him the prim, faultlessly-dressed officer of

B? a' few hours ago. Forgetting himself for a moment-i

but his forgetfulness was pardonable-he put his arm '

: about Hester's neck, and kissing her with great warmth'

!> said--

"My darling, you are safe."

Then he flung the boxes on one side that had formed

' the barricade for the door, flung the door open as Felbey

w as hammering on it with the pommel of his sword,

and the two comrades grasped hands again. The com-, 

, pound was soon cleared, and while Felbey and half-a-

: dozen gallant fellows' remained, the rest of the troop

EiQ:stied the flying rascals for some distance, until the 

enimmanding officer ordered a halt and then led them

i back to the compound.

In the meantime, Mrs. Pritchard had recovered con-

, sciousness, but she was delirious, and, seeming to forget-

'her children, she called frantically for her husband, and 

1.struggled and raved to such an extent that it was as  l

-nmuch as two strong men could do to hold her. With 

p#one difficulty she was placed on the saddle in front of 

' stalwart trooper. The children and the ayah were

4taken by other soldiers, and as Hester refused to ride  I

-with any one, she and Sandon walked, escorted by half- 

; a-dozen men, including young Felbey. Two or three ,

- times she reeled and seemed about to faint, and Sandon

had to support her. Her head had been bound up as-

well as could be done under the circumstances, and the

bleeding stopped, but she had lost so much blood that.

she was very weak, and it was only by a supreme effort

of will she succeeded in reaching the cantonments, then

& her effort failed and she sank into unconsciousness.

When the surgeons came they began to probe for a.

bullet, but they soon determined that the wound in her

forehead was not a gunshot wound at all, but had pro-

bably been inflicted by a jagged stone, or an iron bar

hurled onward with great force, causing a very ugly

gash, and slightly fracturing the frontal bone. She was.

at once conveyed to the hospital, and every attention

bestowed upon her; while Mrs. Pritchard, the children,

and the ayah were placed in the care of some ladies who

had been fortunate in escaping from the fury of the

mutineers.

When Captain Sandon reached the cantonments, in

spite of the mental strain he had endured for hours, and

the tremendous exertions he had been compelled to

make, he begged of his commanding officer to let him

sally forth with a little troop of horse and pursue the

rebels, but he was told to his amazement that the orders

were that no pursuit was to be made, and troops would

only be allowed to go out for purposes of rescue. No

wonder that he and many other brave fellows chafed

and fretted at this senseless restraint.

Slowly that dreadful night waned, and seldom before

had British troops been compelled through the irresolu-

tion of their commander to remain inactive while their

countrymen and women were being hacked to pieces;

and seldom had civilians been called upon to endure a

night of such mental strain and horror as was endured

by the white residents in Meerut. The British soldiers 

---and they were some of the finest in India-numbered

i- a far short of two thousand, and had only half that

number been let loose against the mutineers, very few 

of the rebels would have escaped. When the whole

station seemed to be in a blaze, and the yelling and 

I fiantio shouts of the infuriated mob was suggestive of

:hiei broke loose, General Hewett moved a body of

troops out, and they fired a few random volleys in the

dark, nearly killing some European officers in doing so.

But after this little fizzle the soldiers were ordered to

withdraw to the European lines again. It was a terrible:

blunder-a fatal error. Many a valuable life that might 

: have been saved was sacrificed; and even those who 

; survived endured suspense and agony which would have -

the mutineers, having completed their demoniacal work,.

i galloped off to Delhi without let or hindrance.

m- s During the next few days the garrison was still kept 

inaative. )No steps were taken to punish the inhuman 

. rascals who had poured forth from the bazaars in their

thousands to burn and slay, with the exception of the 

hanging of a few straggling maurauders who were 

caught red-handed and promptly strung up.

:    The women and children found shelter in a walled

- enclosure known as the Dumdama, and most of the-e

t. 2officers-including the Generals and their staff-took

L  ?p their quarters in a barrack.

During these days of enforced idleness, Captain:

Sandon was restless and angry, and his anxiety about

; 'Hester displayed itself in an unmistakable manner.

: She had been compelled to undergo a slight operation 

for the removal of some piece of fractured bone. The-i

r                                                    a4 








<pb n="281"/>
FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH.          275

operation itself was comparatively trifling, but owing 

probably to the intense nervous strain she had endured

on that terrible night in the godown, surgical fever set in,

and some doubts were expressed as to whether she

would recover. Mrs. Pritchard, fortunately, had so far

regained her normal condition that she was able to

undertake to nurse her, but her distress of mind was

excessive, for no news had reached her from her hus-

band, therefore she was in complete ignorance of his

fate, and her fears for his safety were very great. She

was aware how terribly cut up Sandon was, and know-

ing that she and her children and sister owed their lives

to him, she necessarily displayed great tenderness and

regard towards him. And on the third day after the

operation, when he went to the hospital to make

inquiries about Hester, she told him, by way of com-

forting him, that thee doctors spoke more hopefully of

her sister, and she added--

"There is no doubt that Hetty loves you.   Last

night, during the delirium of the fever, she did nothing

but rave about you, and referred to you in all sorts of

endearing terms."

So far this was consoling, and his hopes rose; but

while he was thus playing the lover, and yearning to 

clasp in his arms the woman who had won his heart, he

was not forgetful that he was a soldier, and he did not

hesitate to give expression to indignation and anger

that he should be compelled to remain idle and keep his

sword in its scabbard when there was brave work to be

done.  That very day, as it so chanced, a letter was

brought by a faithful native bearer from a party of

fugitive men, women, and children who had escaped

from Delhi, and were secreted in a jungle. The writer

T2

implored that troops might be sent to rescue them. He

said that the mutineers swarmed all over the roads, and 

had vowed to murder every white person they could get

hold of. Therefore the fugitives dare not move from 

their hiding-place. They were in a dreadful state, for

they had no food and no water, and unless they were

rescued in the course of the next few hours they must 

-atl perish.

Captain Sandon happened to be in the General's

quarters when this letter, which was in French, was

brought in and read. He immediately asked that he 

might be allowed to go out with a little body of troops

and rescue the people. At first the request was refused,

for it was pointed out that a handful of men would be

certain to meet with disaster, as the rebels and bud-

mashes were swarming about the roads in thousands,

and a large number of troops could not be spared, as it

would not do to weaken the garrison. But Sandon was

i;3not to be turned from his purpose. He pressed his point.

;-W said it was the first time women and children in  .

. peril had appealed in vain to British soldiers. He asked

that a dozen men might be allotted to him, and he would

do all that man could do to attempt the rescue. Some-

what reluctantly, permission was at last given, and he

was told to select a party of twenty-four men. He had

no difficulty in doing this. Every man in the garrison

' was ready to volunteer to go. Amongst his little com-

: pany was Lieutenant Felbey, so that the two comrades

:were destined to once more share danger together.

.- While the men were saddling their horses and pre-

paring for the venture, Sandon went to Mrs. Pritchard

to tell her that he was going out on an expedition. He

did not enlighten her on the smallness of his company








<pb n="283"/>
FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH.        277

and the desperate nature of the work before him. She

was sufficiently well aware of the state of matters to

suppose that he would run no risk, and as she bade him

God-speed she said--

"Before you go you might see Hetty. She is much

better, and has inquired about you."

He was delighted at this, and gladly followed Mrs.

Pritchard to the little room where Hester, looking wan

and weak, was lying in bed, her head enveloped in

surgical bandages. She smiled faintly, and put out her

hand to welcome him, and seemed very glad to see

him.

They had a few minutes' chat together, and then he

said in an offhand sort of a way that he was going out

to bring in some women and children. She turned her

languid eyes upon him with the remark-

"The women and children may be thankful that so

heroic a man, and so good a soldier as you, is to under-

take their rescue. If you cannot succeed, no one else

could."

"Tut, tut, my dear, you mustn't speak of me like

that," he answered, as the colour came into his face.

"It is my good fortune to be told off for this duty, but

there is not a man in the garrison who would not have

gone if he had got the chance. I am simply in luck's

way."

"You underrate yourself," she said. " How many

are going with you ?"

"Oh, quite a little regiment," he answered laugh-

ingly.

"But how many ? " she urged.

"Well, a couple of dozen."

"Is that all ?"

CHAPTER XXVIII.

THE TREACHERY OF THE RANEE.

THE news of the success of the mutineers in Meerut

soon spread far and wide throughout North-West

India. It had been anxiously waited for. Traitors

who knew what was to happen had been keenly on the

alert for the first signs of success.  It was so well

understood in native quarters that if the rising planned

to take place in the strong military station of Meerut,

where the number of British troops was greater than in

any other station in the Punjaub, was not nipped in

the bud, the revolt would roll forth like an impetuous

stream that, bursting its banks, gathers volume as it

goes, and sweeps all before it.  But, perhaps, in no

place had events been watched so anxiously as they

were in Jhansi. The treacherous Ranee was thirsting

for the blood of the whites.  She had nursed her

wrongs, or supposed wrongs, until they had crushed

out every feeling of pity, and one great unconquerable

desire for vengeance kept her in a state of feverish

excitement. She was an ambitious woman, no less

than a cruel and crafty one; and what she aimed

at in her own particular case was freeing herself from

the British yoke, consolidating her power, and extend-

ing that power until the ruler of Jhansi should be

recognised as one of the most powerful rulers in India.

It was a dream, a wild, fantastic dream, perhaps, but

she regarded it as one that was likely to be fulfilled if 

only Meerut should succeed.  And so she kept her 

-eyes, so to speak, fixed on Meerut, and listened for any 

.sound that would convey the glad tidings to her that 

the hour of freedom had struck. 

It has frequently been said that the Rajah of Bithoor, 

-:imiliarly known to all the world now as Nana Sahib,

i and dubbed by the Times "the Tiger of Cawnpore," 

was one of the cruelest and most treacherous men who 

-ever walked the earth. But the Ranee of Jhansi was 

not far behind him, either in treachery or cruelty. '

*Like the Nana, she could murder and smile while she

murdered. She could play the false friend with a con-

: summate art that was little short of marvellous.  She

: begot confidence by her plausibility, and no one knew

tetter than she did how to conceal the blackness of her

designs and the cruelty of her heart by a fawning

<l.manner and a smiling face. At first she had chafed

-and talked of her injuries, but she dis-

rea that was a mistake. It was due to this that

t he succeeded so completely in throwing the little

handful of British officers in Jhansi off their guard and

-: disarming suspicion. She schooled herself to play a

! part. She entertained the officers of the garrison, she

- lent them her hunting elephants, she sent them pre-

tsents, and she placed her servants at their orders. But

hl this time, like the crafty panther seeking its prey,

Ii3ire was watching her victims and crouching for the

spring.

Life in Jhansi among the British was at the best

monotonous. It was a hot and dusty station, and each

: day passed wonderfully like another. The European

officers only numbered nine, and some of them had

their wives and families. The nine included young

Hallett, who since his arrival had managed to make

himself popular with his countrymen at least, but he

soon fell into the Ranee's bad books. A few days after

his arrival he was invited with a few of his comrades to

the Ranee's palace, where they were entertained with

the lavish display and prodigality for which she had

become notorious. But though she might have suc-

ceeded in impressing him with the magnificence of her

surroundings, she failed to make a favourable impres-

sion upon him as regarded her own personality, for

that evening at the mess one of his brother-officers said

to him-

"Well, what do you think of the Ranee, Hallett ?"

"Very little."

"Why, how is that ? Everybody likes her."

"Do they? Well, I don't. I should say that she is

about as insincere a woman as you would be able to

find in a long day's march. She has got the heart of a

devil, I'm convinced of that, and I should be sorry to

trust her farther than I could see her."

"Oh nonsense," exclaimed his companion somewhat

patronisingly. "You mustn't take silly prejudices like

that, or you'll never make your way in India.  The

fact is the Ranee is a capital woman. I don't know

what we fellows should do without her. She keeps us

going in elephants, and the feeds she gives us are things

to be remembered. It's a deadly dull hole this, but the

Ranee does her level best to relieve the monotony for

us. And now take my advice, my friend. You, as a

subaltern, have got to study your own interests; but

those interests will suffer, believe me, if you display

.-unfounded prejudices of that kind.  The Ranee is ;

an influential woman, and a staunch friend to the

:   -I quite understand that your advice is kindly  :i

imeant," returned Hallett somewhat ironically, "but 

:I have opinions of my own, and also a habit of sticking 

*!; ttem until I am convinced I am wrong. Of course, 

i -m - only a youngster, as you remind me, and perhaps

when I have cut my wisdom teeth, and am something 

more than a subaltern, I shall acquire the art of dis-

sembling. At present I am   ignorant of it, and I

repeat I don't like the Ranee, and am not going to

:say that I do. One has only to look into her fierce,

restless eyes to understand her deceit. My impression

is, that if this she-devil got half a chance she would cut

all our throats and gloat over her deed."

"Oh, come, come," observed his brother-officer,

t C she is not so bad as that.''

",r;z well, we'll agree to differ," said Hallett.

^e'sation had not escaped the sharp ears of listening  i

servants, and in due course it was repeated to the 

;  anee, with all the exaggerations incidental to gossip 

that is passed from lip to lip amongst Eastern races,

I: and when she heard it she muttered- 

'" This insolent white puppy must be taught a lesson."

Then turning to her trusty factotum, Mata Singh,

told him   what she had heard, and she added

^?ignificanfly,  Singh, you will see to it when the e

.mioment comes that this young fool is seized and

brought before me. There are dungeons beneath my 

. palace here, where my ancestors have found quarters

for their enemies. In one of these dungeons this lad

shall rot in chains. I will torture him for his in-

solence."

Singh expressed his readiness to carry out her

commands to the very letter. He, like his mistress,

was burning to spoil the English, and he looked

forward eagerly to the hoped-for day when they would

be swept from the face of India. Another staunch

retainer upon whom she knew she could rely was

Chuna, the escaped prisoner from Meerut. 

This man was a zealot il her cause, and he had

exerted himself to the utmost to corrupt the native

garrison of Jhansi. His efforts had been so far suc-

cessful that the soldiers only waited a signal to rise and

massacre every white man, woman, and child in the

place. Had it. not been for the Ranee's restraining

influence this rising would have taken place without

any reference to Meerut at all, but she knew perfectly

well that though she and her people might score a,

temporary triumph, it would be very temporary indeed

unless the British regiments in Meerut were prevented

leaving there by strife within their own gates. If

the attempt in Meerut failed, then all would be lost,

but the reports that reached her almost daily spoke

most encouragingly of the prospects. One of the reports

which came from a moonshee or writer employed in

the commissariat department, ran thus-

" These Feringhees are fools. They suspect nothing.

They have such unbounded confidence in themselves, andc

such a supreme belief in their own infallibility, that

they refuse to believe it even within the bounds of possi-

bility that a day of reckoning is coming. But this day

will of a certainty dawn, unless our people are content

to remain for ever in bondage, and to forget and forgive

accursed people crossed the seas to invade our territory.

Therefore take heart, great lady.  The greatness and

ipower which erstwhile were the prerogatives of your

house will return, and Jhansi shall once again be one

of the mighty states of India."

This letter, which was typical of many she received,

flattered the Ranee's vanity. In her hurry to reach the

, goal. towards which she was pressing she never paused

:t:,ensider whether or not the fawners and lickspittles

surrounded her were actuated by true patriotism,

o:   were mere place-seekers, anxious to serve them-

selves and bring grist to their own mills. The history

of her own house-that is, of the rulers of Jhansi-was

a history of bloodshed and cruelty.  They had kept

! their power by the sword, and their enemies had been

` smitten with a relentlessness of purpose which aimed

I at making the rulers of Jhansi greater even than the

I Moguls of Delhi. But the Ranee did not take this

into consideration. She had been robbed of her birth-

right, so she believed, by the English, consequently

she bore them no love. She did not believe in being

a puppet. She would be a ruler or nothing.

At last the supreme moment came.      One night a

hot and dusty traveller entered Jhansi without let or

hindrance. He had come from Meerut, and had all

the appearance of one who had sped without sparing

himself. He was one of the Ranee's spies, and he at

once sought her presence, for he was the bearer of

great tidings.

Prostrating himself before her, and bowing his fore-

head to the dust, he said-

"Rejoice, lady, for I bring you good news. All has

gone well in Meerut. The Sepoys rose mighty in their

wrath, and with fire and sword they swept the town

clear of the hated Feringhees, whose bodies lie like

unowned curs in the gutters, which have been washed

with blood."

"And the white troopers, what of them?" the Ranee

almost shrieked in the intensity of her excitement.

" Such of them as remain are paralysed with fear,

lady, and are no more capable of offering resistance

than an army of sucking babes would be."

"Aha! this is news indeed," she cried.   "And

what of our brave people, who have done this great

thing ?"

" Flushed with victory they have gone forth to Delhi,

where the same thing has been repeated, and the power

of the Mogul has been restored. The King of Delhi

sits on his throne again, powerful as in the dead and

gone days. But a new era dawns. The white Raj is

destroyed for ever."

"Thou art sure of that ? " she demanded fiercely.

" Aye, as sure as that death will come to all things

that live."

For a moment a dark frown swept over her cruel

face, and she muttered as if to herself-" The King of

he left the royal residence to carry out his mission,

-: "To-morrow; aye, to-morrow shall witness great

V' The morrow came, and soon after reveille had

: hands of Lieutenant Hallett. It was written in English,

and dated from the Ranee's palace. Of course it was

.not in her own handwriting, but that of one of her

moonshees, or clerks. The note was worded as fol-

lows:-

"The Ranee of Jhansi presents her compliments to

Lieutenant Hallett, and requests with much respect that

he will do her the honour of calling at the palace as

early as possible. The Ranee understands that Lieu-

tenant Hallett has recently come from Persia, and she

is anxious to obtain some information of a particular

character about that country, which probably he can

give her. She therefore begs that he will favour her

with a visit."

This artfully-worded note was quite calculated to

throw the young man off his guard. Although his

opinion of the Ranee was by no means a flattering one,

and he had with singular accuracy gauged her character

to a large extent, he did not suspect treachery. Indeed,

if the truth must be told, he was rather pleased by the

notice she bestowed upon him, for it seemed in no way

remarkable that she should make such a request. And

as he had a couple of hours on his hands before the

general morning parade, he went off to the palace,

where he was received by several obsequious flunkies,

and at once conducted to the Ranee's presence;

Two hours later, to the summons of the bugles, the

native troops began to assemble on the parade-ground,

and the officers rode up and down, utterly unconscious

of the danger that menaced them. The troops consisted

of a wing of the 12th Native Infantry, and the 14th

Irregular Cavalry. Hallett, to the astonishment of all

his brother-officers, did not put in an appearance when

the muster sounded, and as he was nowhere to be found,

his absence was reported to the Colonel, who was ex-

ceedingly angry, and ordered that the young fellow was

P'g;ity. Then the business of the parade was proceeded

IR anee, saying that their lives should all be spared, and

they should be afforded safe-conduct to Meerut. Be-

lieving this, they allowed themselves to be led forth,

l4nd were taken to a garden, where a body of the

Imutineers were concealed. These wretches sprang up

'as soon as the people appeared, and then ensued a scene  I

child was spared. Over seventy people were hacked to

pieces in that fair garden, until the ground ran red

with blood, and the very birds, that had erstwhile made

sweet music in the trees, fled in horror away. With

insane ferociousness, even the bodies of the silent dead

were subjected to the most fiendish outrages.

Jhansi had thus followed Meerut, and the mutineers

were triumphant.

CHAPTER XXIX.

- - ;      FOR LOVE AND LIFE.

;WHEN young Hallett found himself in the presence of

the Ranee, he noted that the apartment was crowded 

with armed men, and as he was about to approach her 

in order to pay her the compliment of kissing her hand,

:; she waved him off with an imperious gesture, saying-

" Defile me not with your foul lips."

 Then for the first time his suspicions were aroused,

-and he began to think something was wrong; but~

-irawing himself up proudly, he replied-   -

S'TWhat means this? How have I offended you, my

H' lfe spoke in English, for the Ranee, although she did

Hnot write it, spoke and understood that language well.

."It means that you are an unclean animal," she

if"snarled fiercely. " Therefore should I be defiled if you

;'touch me. It means 'that you have spoken lyingly and

4iisrespectfully of me, and for that you will pay the

!penalty with your life. It means that all your accursed

'tin reaches its meridian. You would have died with

i maligned me; and for that I have allured you here in

e order that you may be chained up and slowly starved to

I death. Thus perish my enemies."








<pb n="297"/>

She looked like the savage she was as she spoke.

Her face was the face of a merciless, pitiless barbarian,

who was thirsting for blood. Hallett glanced hurriedly

round. He realised that escape was impossible, but he

resolved to sell his life dearly; and suddenly drawing

his sword, which up to that moment he had been

allowed to retain, he made a sudden spring forward in

the direction of the Ranee, and there is little doubt he

would have run her through the body had not one of

the body-guards, with singular adroitness, precipitated

himself on the young fellow, and the impact was so

great that the two fell to the ground. Before the

Englishman could even attempt to rise he was seized by

half a dozen stalwart fellows, disarmed, dragged to his

feet, and held so firmly that he was utterly powerless.

A bitter cruel smile wreathed itself about the hard,

cruel mouth of the Ranee, who said with a contemptuous

sneer-

" Treacherous knave! It is in keeping with the role

of your countrymen that you would play the assassin.

But for this attempt upon my life you shall pay a double

penalty. Hark ye, my people, and Mata Singh, see

you that this, my will, is carried out. Every morning,

so long as he shall live, let him be tied naked to the tail

of a bullock-cart, and scourged through the streets, so

that my faithful subjects may see that I know how to

treat the enemies of my country. And two days from

now have his foul and lying tongue cut from his mouth,

and let it be brought to me, so that I may know that

my orders have been carried out. Remove him."

Hallett was dragged from the room amidst the yells

and groans of those around him. His heart turned to

lead as he realised how small indeed were his chances

o'f escaping the terrible doom which the fiendish Rane 

Zhad pronounced. It was hard to die young, to die inl

the first flush of his early manhood, and when a career

seemed opening out before him, but it was doubly hard 

that his life should be sacrificed now that-after en-

 during so much and sacrificing so much-he was within

i !- hundred miles of the woman he loved dearer than life,

'Blank despair seized him, and he resolved that if any

, -chance offered he would destroy himself, and so cheat

'4he treacherous Ranee of one part of her revenge at least

' The palace occupied by the Ranee was situated on

-the summit of a rocky eminence, that rose up by a

gentle incline from the plain on the one side, and broke *

away in terraced precipices on the other. The palace

was an old building, and, in common with places of

that kind in India, it was provided with a number of

-dungeon-like chambers.  In one of these chambers

Hallett was placed. The only means of ventilation and

;-tvwas that afforded by a solt of narrow embrasure

i   , the rock. Glancing through that opening, the eye

: Has enabled to range over a wide panorama. Hallett's

,first feeling was one of terrible, blank despair. It was

only too painfully apparent that he had been treacherously

i -entrapped, nor could he doubt for a moment that his

; .omrades must have been killed, and that the native

I. troops had mutinied. Otherwise the Ranee would never

i have dared to imprison him. No wonder, as he thought

i:f these things, that his heart turned to lead. The

ianee had more than justified the opinion he had

i; formed of her; and since she had made it evident that

she had come by some means to know what he had said

about her, it was not likely that she would show him

.ihe slightest mercy.








<pb n="299"/>
FOR LOVE AND LIFE.            293

For some little time he remained in such a fever of

suppressed excitement that he was dazed to a certain

extent, and felt almost as if he must go mad. But after

a while he grew calmer, and, as was but natural, he-

began to think of Hester. He was in ignorance, of

course, of all that had taken place in Meerut, but he

recalled every word of her letter to him, and it proved

a sort of mental tonic, until, in spite of the desperate

nature of his position, something like a glimmering of

hope began' to dawn. He was too energetic, too brave,

to submit quite calmly to the carrying out of the Ranee's

sentence upon him, and when once the reaction had set

in, his spirits revived very considerably. If a weapon

had been placed in his hands, and he had been told to

cut his way to the woman he loved, he would have faced

fearful odds, and have risked every possible danger.

But though a man be as strong as Samson and as bold

as a lion, what can he do if he is chained and caged t

He may fling himself against his bars, and batter him-

self against his prison walls, but only to his own hurt.

Some such thought as this came to the wretched young

man as he paced up and down the narrow limits of the-

chamber. In such a case all that one can hope for is,

that some unlooked-for, some inconceivable chance may

favour one. This indeed is the only hope that can pos-

sibly be cherished. Slender it may be, and forlorn it

is; but even a forlorn hope sometimes succeeds. And

so Hallett thou ht to himself-                 -

"If fickle (rtun) hasn't altogether deserted me,

she may unexpectedly and in an unlooked-for quarter

open up a way by which I can escape."

There was not much consolation perhaps in this reflec-

tion, but such as there was he comforted himself with it.








<pb n="300"/>
294           THE STAR OF FORTUNE.

Slowly the dreadful day waned, and the night came.

. It so far brought him relief that he was enabled to

vbtai some sleep, which he did by making a pillow of

i:his jacket, and stretching himself on the bare ground.

He awoke with the dawn, feeling somewhat cramped'

::and& stiff, yet mentally refreshed. A cool, refreshing a

-e< waa sbloving in through the barred aperture, and

n$:if g himself in the direct line of the current of air,

ihe drew it into his lungs and felt grateful, although the

pangs of hunger were very keen, for he had had nothing

to eat since the preceding morning. Everything was

..very still, and the growing light of the strengthening

i dawn'was reddening the landscape. He leaned his head

r- against the iron bars, of which there were three, and

! gazed dreamily out to where the river flowed far below.

Suddenly it occurred to him to test the strength of

those bars, which he found were old and rusty. They

jdaa}d probably been there for generations, and the cement

:      fth.ey had originally been set was cracked and

l~    ,eonihbed. It seemed to him that the middle bar

: he shook it showed signs of weakness. He shook it

- harder, and he felt sure then that it was weak. Then

did he put forth the lusty strength of his youth, and the

- iower part of the bar came away. It had broken from

i.the part embedded in the cement. Having now got a

i.leverage, it was relatively easy to force the upper part

Jlose, and in a few moments he stood with the bar of .

an in his hand. He would have been a strange man

:- he had not become somewhat excited, for firstly he

iheld a weapon in that bar of iron, and secondly a way !

of escape seemed to have suddenly presented itself to

i He managed to squeeze himself partly through the -








<pb n="301"/>
FOR LOVE AND LIFE.            295

increased opening he had made, and he noted that from

the aperture there was a drop of something like twenty

feet on to a ledge of rock; and then as far as he could

gather it was almost perpendicular down to the plain

where the river flowed. No one perhaps save he who

was in desperate need would have drawn much hope of

life and liberty from that precipitous rock-face. But

Hallett was in desperate need, and with an energy

begotten by his condition, he used the broken bar as a

lever wherewith to prize out one of the others, which

yielded at last to the pressure thus put upon it, and it

broke away from the top; and by alternately pushing

and tugging with might and main he wrenched it from

the bottom holding.

He could now get through the aperture with ease.

His first care was to tie the bar of iron to his waist with

his handkerchief, for it would have to serve him as a

weapon. Then lowering himself outside until he hung

by the tips of his fingers, he paused for a few moments

and dropped on to the ledge. Before he could steady

himself the impetus carried him forward, and he found

himself taking a series of flying leaps, as it were.

Down, down he went; it was impossible to stop. At

last he pitched on to a turf-covered slope, down which

he flew as if he had been shot from a catapult; until

breathless, dazed, half-stunned, he reached the level

ground. He was bruised and bleeding, and so violent

had been the shaking he had received in his breakneck

descent, that he lay where he had fallen for some

minutes, and felt as if and believed that the was dying.

Then, as he began to recover his scattered senses,

he heard a confused roar and shouting. His escape

had been noticed, and the alarm was being spread.

. Ad :1- THE STAR OF FORTUNE.

Bullets whizzed near him by scores, but did not strike

him..

; At last the longing for life, and thoughts of the

woman he loved, nerved him to another effort. So up

he sprang, and running forward, he found himself at -

the entrance to a wooden bridge spanning the river.

Pht7ere were three or four excited natives standing there,

:   ley showed a disposition to dispute his passage. 

:X e iron bar was still bound to his waist; he loosened

it, and told the fellows to stand on one side; but instead 

of doing so, they made a rush for him.   One fell

stunned by a blow from the bar, and the others were

scattered. He sped across the bridge, and gained the 

plain. There he paused, and considered whether it was

not his duty as a soldier to go back and ascertain what

wsas really the fate of his comrades, for he could only

surmise that the troops had mutinied. He had no proof

?ss yet. The proof came, however, even as he stood

seemed to him conclusive evidence. Fortunately the

shot went wide of its mark, and raised a huge column

:of dust which actually aided him by screening him for *

::a while from his enemies.

. He had always been noted for his powers of running,

nd they were to serve him in good stead now. On he

sped, until half dead with fatigue, his breath spent, his 

limbs trembling, he reached a small native village.

dashed in, and in a little side-building leading out of it

was a great heap of dried grass, used as fodder for the

animals. Into that heap of fodder he threw himself,

feeling as if he. were really going mad with thirst and

excitement.

In a little while, however, he fell into a sleep from

which he did not awaken until the evening. Then he

was disturbed by the peasants bringing in their bullocks

after working in the fields. He lay very still and was

not discovered, and when the animals had been put up

for the night, and the men had retired, Hallett stole

from his place of concealment. A leather bucket that

had been used for watering the cattle stood in one

corner. It was still half full of water, and of this

water, impure as it was, the young man drank greedily.

Feeling refreshed by the rest and the drink, he went

cautiously forth. It was the supper hour of the natives,

and that was in his favour. Sometimes creeping, and

moving with the greatest care, he gained the outskirts

of the village, which consisted of not more than a couple

of dozen mud hovels. Suddenly he heard the neigh of

a horse close to him. The animal, which was roped to a

stake, was feeding in a compound.  He entered the

compound, and by the aid of the light of the stars he

untethered the horse, made a bit and bridle of the rope,

put it over the animal's head, and then springing on to

the animal's back he rode forth. The horse was a poor,

half-famished brute, but still it carried him well enough

for the time, and presently he gained a road, which, from

its direction, he guessed must lead towards Meerut,

-which he now wished to reach.

All night long he held on his way until it was broad

daylight. Then he met a native woman carrying a

and demanded some of her goods; and drawing a

.pli of rupees from his pocket, he placed them in her

For this she permitted him to drink as much of the

journey until he gained a jungle, where there was a

CHAPTER XXX.

THE CAMP.

WHEN Captain Sandon volunteered for the expedition

to rescue the fugitives from Delhi, who were reported

to be hiding in a jungle not far from that city, he little

knew how desperate the service was. Owing to the

supineness of the authorities in Meerut and other places,

the mutineers swarmed over all the roads. It might

be said with a strict regard for truth that the great

revolt of the Sepoys had so far been allowed to go

unchecked, and   the unfortunate Europeans were

abandoned to fire and slaughter. But Sandon was

not the man to shrink from the duty he had under-

taken; while Felbey and his little band of heroes were

equal to a small army, for now that they were freed

from the restraint of the station, they showed that they

burned with a desire for a terrible revenge. Sandon

himself shared the spirit and enthusiasm of his men.

He remembered his murdered brother; he thought of

the awful massacre during the last few days of helpless

women and children in Meerut, and as he rode on

beneath the great calm canopy of heaven, there was

within him the turmoil and the bitterness of an avenging

thirst for blood.

Within five miles of Meerut the little band came

upon their first obstacle. A stream was before them,








<pb n="306"/>
*OO           THE STAR OF FORTUNE.

Wind on the opposite bank of that stream was an en-

|Bampment of rebels, who at once opened fire with two

all mountain-guns, which carried death to two of

English soldiers. Sandon did not hesitate for a

ioment as to the course to be pursued. He formed his

Aen up in open line. In his clear, ringing voice he

'    the words of command: "Walk-Trot-Gallop-

Pi_?e" Then like a cyclone suddenly let loose from

i    caves of the wind, that little body of horsemen

iwept over the stream and into the native camp. The

rebels made a vain effort to stand firm, but they went

4own like nine-pins, until the ground was strewn with

Wheir dying and dead. Then the rest fled in confusion,

and some of the English troopers dismounting, and

lading up the two mountain-guns, turned them upon

fhe flying enemy with disastrous effect. In this en-

eounter four of Sandon's followers had been slain, so

tt his little party were much weakened. But the

v iyeora spiked the guns, piled up all the baggage,

i       tnits,: aia tents which the surprised rebels had

ibehhind, and set the- heap on fire; while the am-

~nunition that was found was tossed into the water.

Flushed with victory the column swept on, and ere

Ihe day closed they had to fight another pitched battle

-With an overwhelming number of rebels, who for a

time surrounded them, and the English were com-

lled to fight back to back. But at last they dispersed

er foes with terrible loss, though they themselves

i'suffered cruelly and were reduced to twelve only;

while amongst the slain was brave young Felbey, who

had done great execution before he fell. He had fought

Alike a lion at bay, and had met a soldiers's death.

Sandon's grief was very great and very sincere when








<pb n="307"/>
THE CAMP.                 301

he saw that his noble companion had fallen. But it

was the fortune of war, and he knew that on the

morrow it might be his turn. As well as they were

able the survivors buried their fallen comrades, and then

weary and worn they threw themselves on the ground,

their arms in their hands, their horses close to them,

With the dawning day the men rose, and munching

their breakfast rations, which was of necessity small,

they led their horses to a stream.to drink; then mount-

ing rode forward again, and before noon encountered

and defeated without loss to themselves a band of armed-

rascals who were evidently bent on plunder. Con-

tinuing their journey towards the Mogul city, whose

gorgeous domes and minarets could be seen afar off

glittering in the brilliant sunlight, they suddenly heard

a shout of welcome, and beheld about a hundred yards

off three men, evidently Europeans. These men rushed

forward to meet them, and informed Sandon that they

were members of the band of fugitives who had

managed to entrench themselves in the jungle near a

stream, but they were in a terrible plight, and unless

succoured at once must inevitably perish.

When Sandon and his men reached the encampment,

the first man to come forward and greet him was his

friend Colonel Pritchard, who had been wounded in

the head, and looked ghastly ill. He could scarcely

find voice to speak as he feebly grasped his comrade's

hand; but when at last words came to him, he gasped

out-

"Tell me, how fares it with them ?"

By "them" he meant his wife, his children, and

his sister-in-law. Sandon understood, and with some-

thing of his wonted cheeriness he answered-

" Well-they are well, all of them."

"_ Thank God, thank God," murmured Pritchard, as 

ie- covered his sunken eyes with his hands, and when

,I's emotion had passed he led Sandon aside and saidi

: brokenly-" If I could only have seen with your eyes

of half-a-dozen brave comrades and a few civilians to

protect a number of women and children. We got;

-.lthem out of the city, hoping to reach Meerut, but

I almost immediately were attacked by a body of rebels,

'and we suffered great loss. With the remnant of our

-[t was a pitiable story, and as Sandon once again 

ipped the emaciated hand of his friend, he said firmly,:

wretched shelter that had been made for them by inter-

lacing boughs of trees, and kissing the soldiers' hands

or grasping their knees, pleaded to them to save them.

As the food supply was all but absolutely exhausted,

Sandon selected six of his men, and ordered them to

ride out on a foraging expedition, he leading them.

When they had ridden a few miles, they came to a

village. At first some opposition was shown to them

by the villagers, especially by one determined man,

who, armed with an Enfield rifle which he had evi-

dently stolen, called upon his fellows to slaughter the

Englishmen, and with his rifle he aimed and fired at

Sandon. The bullet missed its mark, however, and

Sandon at once drew his revolver and shot the fellow

dead. This cowed the others, and Sandon forming his

men up in line declared to the assembled crowd that he

would shoot every man in the place and burn the village

down, unless all the arms were brought forward,

together with a waggon-load of provisions. As there

could be no mistaking that he meant what he said,

some of the people sullenly retired to comply with his

demand; while in order to guard against treachery,

Sandon formed a cordon with his little band round a

number of men and youths, and the stern English

soldiers sat like grim statues on their horses, a sword in

one hand, a revolver in the other.

When an hour had passed, two heavily-laden drays

drawn by bullocks were observed coming along the

village street. Among the things thus brought were a

number of old Brown Bess guns and a quantity of

ammunition. The provisions principally consisted of

rice, native cheese, and flour, together with some fruit

and sweetmeats. Sandon made the drivers of the

illocks proceed ahead, and having given the head mail

f the village an order for payment of the things sup-

|j1ied, he and-his followers brought up the rear, and in

:his manner they proceeded to the place where the

fogitives were encamped, and the relief thus brought

||roved invaluable. Sandon and Pritchard resolved to

fain the bullocks and the waggons as a means of

.. ort, for the women and children, but the drivers

e allowed to return to their village. That, as it

eurned out, was a fatal mistake. During the night the

fellows must have carried word to the rebels in Delhi,

The sentries who had been placed on duty by Sandon

ireported that a body of the enemy was advancing.

Instantly all was bustle in the little camp. Very hastily

-an extemporised fort was formed by the bullock-

vwaggons, the bags of rice, and such other things as

were likely to form shelter to the defenders and present

obstacles to a rush on the part of the attackers. The

.Comen and children were placed in safety as far as it

pS- ihle to do so. Then Sandon and Pritchard.

Pqosed' of their men to the best possible advantage.:

he enemy was about one hundred       strong, and,

was composed entirely of Pandies-that is, rebel

soldiers. They approached within a hundred yards and

opened fire, but not a single shot took effect, and

instantly a volley was poured into them which stretched;

aseveral of their number on the ground never to rise

gain. This loss caused the others to withdraw to a 3

?afer distance, and to take advantage of the shelter

:'te trees afforded. From their position they kept up:

a desultory-fire for some time, with the result that two 

of the bullocks were shot. For hours the fight was'

carried on, and the enemy was still further reduced.;








<pb n="311"/>
THE CAMP.                 305

but the defenders suffered no loss. Then the enemy.

ceased firing, but did not retire. The two English

officers took advantage of the lull to strengthen their

position as much as possible. The command virtually

devolved on Captain Sandon, for Pritchard was so ill

that he could hardly move, and his voice had become

Ao weak that he had difficulty in making himself heard.

With what might almost be described as superhuman

efforts the men worked; and in spite of the want of

proper appliances, they succeeded in throwing up a

rough sort of parapet, and some of the most active of

the ladies were instructed in the loading of the muskets.

The night fell and was passed in suspense and dread.

Twice did some of the enemy try to steal into the camp,

but the'vigilance of the brave little band of defenders

defeated the attempt, and each time inflicted loss upon

the foe. In the morning a fresh body of rebels came

up with two eight-pounder guns which they had brought

from Delhi. It was evident that if these guns were got

into position and fire was opened upon the camp all

would be lost; but Sandon was not the man to remain

inactive in the face of this terrible danger. So ordering

every man who could do so to mount, two volleys were

poured into the insurgents, and before they could re-

cover from the confusion this threw them into, the

defenders swept out of their shelter and hurled them-

selves against the foe, and in less than a quarter of an

hour were actually in possession of the guns, which,

with ringing cheers, they turned upon the Sepoys and

scattered them. Then the guns were dragged to the

camp; and this heroic feat evoked cheers even from the

sick women and the children. As the ammunition for

the guns had been captured as well, Sandon felt that

Lhe could now hold out for some time and keep the 

!acowardly foe.-for cowardly he was-at a respectful dis- 

tance.. But it was very certain that unless the defenders

were relieved they must ultimately succumb. Sandon

!:therefore decided that by some means or other word i

.i::ust be sent into Meerut. But he could not spare an

.n:/t:ive, man; for this duty; and while he was debating

~75iti himself as to what was best to be done, a half-

:caste youth, who had been born in Delhi and brought 

up as a Christian, volunteered for the service, notwith-

standing that he was very ill. His offer was accepted; 

and as soon as it was dark he stole away on his perilous

errand. A little later Sandon and four men made a

: aortie, and catching the enemy napping, punished him 

severely, and returned to the camp with a quantity of

rice and some arms.

w1e: a9r ' ltely necessary, in order to spin out

aid from Meerut came not; and the inference was, the

youth had failed to reach the city.

: The state of the besieged was now becoming more

tand more pitiable. Women and children died, and

- their poor bodies could not be buried, while those who

: lived envied those who were dead. Colonel Pritchard

!'had grown so weak and was so emaciated that he could

no longer stand, and he was placed in the rear, where a

bed was made up for him, and the ladies afforded him

such comfort as they could. Sandon's fighting force

while out in the open collecting fuel.

Things were desperate indeed now, and even Sandon

began to take a gloomy view, for unless the enemy

drew off there seemed to be nothing for it but capitula-

tion, though, as far as he was personally concerned, he

resolved to die sword in hand. His magnificent

courage, his splendid fighting qualities, his abilities as a

soldier had been the means so far of keeping the rebels

at bay; but there was a limit even to his powers, and

already he was beginning to feel the strain. Want of

proper rest and food, coupled with anxiety, had told

upon even his cast-iron constitution.

One morning just as the sun was rising the camp re-

ceived a reinforcement in the shape of one man-a

young man, haggard, gaunt, and famished-looking.

He had come from Jhansi, and his name was Hallett.

x2








<pb n="314"/>
CHAPTER XXXI.

ih -r  ,  THE DYING MESSAGE.

-FOR days and days Hallett had been wandering about

the country, dodging predatory bands of rebels; travel-

ling by night and sleeping by day. Quite unable to

'get any information, except what he gathered inferen-

tially, he was in ignorance of the exact state of affairs,

though it was very obvious to him that the mutiny had

been very general. He managed to get to a place

i called Bhiwani, a little to the north-west of Delhi,

where he learnt that Delhi was absolutely in the hands

idf the rebels, and that all the Europeans had been

~atssareiea. He then set off to try and reach Meerut,

when passing near the encampment of the fugitives

he was attracted by the firing, and creeping cautiously

up to ascertain from whence it proceeded, he recognised

the British uniform of the defenders, and by making a

detour he succeeded in reaching them. As an English

officer he at once reported himself to Sandon, stating

his name and rank. The name did not strike Sandon

at first, and therefore in this ragged, dust- and travel-

stained, half-starved man he did not recognise the lover

of the woman whom he also loved.

Although Colonel Pritchard was not in effective com-

mand, owing to his illness, he was still by courtesy

recognised as being in nominal command, and so








<pb n="315"/>
THE DYING MESSAGE.             309

Hallett was taken to him; and as the sick man put

out his withered hand for the other to take, he said

feebly-

"You are surely the Jack Hallett of whom there has

been so much talk, and with whom my sister-in-law

seems to have been infatuated."

Hallett soon made it clear that he was the identical

person; and Pritchard could not refrain from telling

him that it appeared as if Fate had for some special

purpose directed his footsteps there. Naturally Jack

inquired tenderly and anxiously about Hester; but all

that Pritchard could say was, that when he left Meerut

she was well. He did not mention to Hallett that he

had a rival in that very camp, for the painful circum-

stances and peril in which they were all placed rendered

silence on such a subject the kindlier course. But

Hallett soon heard that Sandon had come from Meerut

since the mutiny broke out, and so he did not hesitate

to inquire of him how Hester fared. Then, and not

till then, did Sandon recognise him-; but he too held

his peace for the same reason that had actuated Colonel,

Pritchard.

When Hallett had partaken of food, and had re-

moved some of the encrusted dust by means of a

bucket of water, he felt and looked a new man. And

it was not long before he gave proof to his command-

ing officer of his powers and courage as a soldier.

He was a valuable addition indeed to the tiny garrison,

and Sandon was too brave and too honourable a man

to show any ill-feeling towards him because they were

rivals. As there was now no longer any room to doubt

that the first messenger must have fallen into the hands

of the enemy, Sandon decided to send some one else to

Meerut for succour. And in order that there should

be no insidious distinction made, he arranged that every

man in the camp, with the exception of himself and 

Pritchard, should write his name on a slip of paper, ,

which should then be screwed up and put into a bag

with a number of blanks. A lady was next deputed

-t'6'aw out a slip, and the first name she drew was to

be the man for the perilous ride. Of course Hallett

took his chance with the rest; his name, however, did

not come out first, but the name of a trooper called

William Andrews.   Hallett was disappointed, though

he said nothing; but he tried to console himself with

the thought that having survived so many risks, and

got within a dozen miles of the woman who was his

hope and stay in life, he would surely be spared to.

once more hold her in his arms, and hear again from

[4er lips that she was his. That thought nerved him,

-i "When darkness descended, Trooper Andrews, mounted

on one of the best horses left in the camp, started on his

short but dangerous journey, and in order to divert the

attention of the rebels, the defenders opened fire upon

them, which was returned with interest, and for a

quarter of an hour a terrible fusillade was kept up.

When it ceased the muster-roll of the garrison was

c.lled, and there was one who did not answer to his

ame. That one was Lieutenant Hallett, and search

being made for him he was found lying outside of the;

defences seriously wounded, and beside him was a dead

Sepoy. Hallett reported that he saw the man creeping

like a stealthy wild beast round to the back of the camp,








<pb n="317"/>
THE DYING MESSAGE.             311

and rushing up to seize him, the native stabbed him in

the breast with a long knife, but instantly Hallett shot

him with his revolver. What the man's exact object

was could only be guessed at, but no doubt he was

reconnoitring, and wished to carry information to his

friends.

It was soon seen that Hallett's wound was of a very

dangerous character, and in the absence of medical

attendance and surgical appliances, little could be done

for him; but the women, or such of them as were able,

did all they could for him under the circumstances.

The poor creatures, in spite of their misery and suffer-

ing, were like ministering angels, and imparted con-

solation and hope to the sick and the dying.

It soon became evident that poor Jack was doomed.

He knew and felt that to be the case himself. It was

precious hard, after all he had gone through for

Hester's dear sake, to die as it were on the threshold

of her door. But no man can avoid his destiny, and

when Jack saw that death had set its seal upon him,

he requested Captain Sandon to come to him.

"Captain," he said, with difficulty, for when he

attempted to speak the blood gurgled into his throat,

"Captain, we are strangers, but soldiers, and one

soldier when he is stricken with death in his country's

cause may entrust another with a sacred message. It

is very probable you will live to get back to Meerut,

and if you do so, I, as a dying man, pray you seek

out Hester Dellaby, the sister-in-law   of Colonel

Pritchard, if she be living, and tell her my last words

were of her. She was to have been my wife, but it

is willed otherwise. Give her this small case-it is

her portrait. When I left England I told her I would

..~ ear it next my heart for her sake, and it should keep

me straight. I have done so; it has never gone from

.me; and now into your keeping I give it, and charge

you in the name of God deliver it up to her with my i

. He ceased speaking, for his voice had entirely failed,

:nI SAniandonekeeling oh the ground beside him, held

EIiid iand pressed it with the true grip of a noble

;oldier, and he whispered in the dying man's ear-

. "I will do all that you wish."

Hallett lay upon an extemporised charpoy, placed

'ander some palm-boughs, and the only light on the

!pathetic scene was that which came from the subdued

glow  of a smouldering wood fire a little way off.

Sandon still knelt there and held his comrade's and

; rival's hand. Hallett made another effort to speak, but

failed, his voice being suffocated with the upward rush

And as the brave man turned away he passed his-

there.  Into the jungle at the back of the defences

went four soldiers carrying a fifth, who was dead, with

them.  The fifth was ill-starred Jack Hallett, who,

:'~rapped in a military cloak, was silently laid in a

oldier's grave. The usual honours which are observed

at a military funeral had to be omitted in this case for

fear of arousing the enemy. Two pieces of stick tied

at right angles to each other to form a rough cross

young lieutenant was sleeping the last sleep, which

neither the blast of bugle nor the tuck of drum should

ever more disturb.

For two days the wretched and half-famished fugi-

tives waited in eager and anxious suspense for signs of

the expected relief, but none were forthcoming. Then

did black despair seize again upon every one, for it

seemed as if they were all doomed. Trooper Andrews

could not have succeeded in his mission. And to make

matters worse, as the day was closing the enemy opened

fire again, and they were only kept from making a rush

by the cannon which the defenders handled so well.

While the fight was at its hottest a ringing cheer was

heard-an unmistakably English cheer-and the enemy

were suddenly attacked in the rear. The relief had

come at last; women wept and children screamed with

joy, and Sandon and his half-dozen heroes threw them-

selves upon the foe, who were thus hemmed in and

were utterly annihilated. Andrews had got through

safely, and in compliance with his urgent messages a

party of fifty troopers went out to the relief. 

With dawn of day the fugitives'were gathered toge-

ther and escorted to Meerut. Colonel Pritchard was

borne upon a litter, and it was only too plain to see that

death had marked him for its own. He lived long

enough to see and recognise his wife and children and

Hester, and as he bade the latter adieu he murmured

faintly-

"Be kind to Sandon. He is a noble fellow."

That night the Colonel passed to his rest and was

buried in the English cemetery where so many of the

victims of the great Mutiny were laid.

As may be imagined, the death of her husband was a

terrible blow to poor Mrs. Pritchard, and the only mea-

ASure of consolation she could find was in the fact that

i her two dear children had been spared to her. Hester,

t'o, was much cut up. She had quite recovered from

:the effects of her wound, but she had suffered great 

;anxiety on Hallett's behalf, for news had reached

.eerut of the revolt at Jhansi and the massacre of all

'he Europeans. Therefore she had mourned for Hallett

, as for one dead.

1 For two or three days after his return, Captain

;Sandon saw nothing of Hester, though she heard his

'praises being sounded by men and women, who spoke

-of him enthusiastically. At last he sought an interview

!with her. Then did he tell her of the message of which

i:e was the bearer, and he delivered to her the likeness

entrusted to him by her dying lover.   She received

them in silence.  She had no words, no tears.    It

:  Sandon, like the brave and noble man he was,

r'espected her sorrow and held his peace, merely wish-

to start with his regiment to take part in the siege of '

"Delhi. Then with a passionate outburst of hysterical

grief she shook his hand and prayed God to guard

So they parted, and he went forth to that scene of

hellish strife which was raging around the Mogul city.

CHAPTER XXXII.

PEACE!

IN a quiet home in peaceful England, in one of the

most beautiful parts of beautiful Devonshire, dwells a

widow lady with her son and daughter and her sister.

The widow is Mrs. Pritchard, her sister is Hester

Dellaby.  It is getting on for three years since the

great Mutiny declared itself in the station of Meerut,

and struck sorrow into the hearts of so many families.

Quiet and subdued now is poor Mrs. Pritchard, for

deep and abiding shadows have fallen across her way in

life, and for her the world can never be the same world

it was before that awful Indian experience. Her dear

children have been preserved to her, and for that bless-

ing she is unspeakably thankful; indeed, had it not

been for that, her life might have ended for aught she

would have cared, for both her father and her mother

had paid the debt of nature.

Hester had grown much more of a woman, and her

beautiful face had taken on an habitual expression of

thoughtfulness which seemed a little out of place. Often

when alone she would sit for a long time gazing on

vacancy, as if her thoughts were far, far away. Per-

haps that was not to be wondered at, for no impression-

able and sensitive woman could have gone through the

experiences that had been hers without growing more

thoughtful, and developing a tendency to view life 

through a somewhat sombre medium. It was very,

very rarely indeed that either she or her sister referred

to India.  It was a tabooed subject, for it could

not be   discussed  without reviving  many  bitter

memories.

: Would-be suitors had sighed for some favourable look

: oi 'word from Hester, but to all she was as a statue.

Men said she was cold; and women whispered that her

heart was buried in India. She herself neither con-

firmed nor contradicted what people chose to say. She

wanted to live her life as it suited her; and though she

was staid and meditative beyond her years she could

hardly' help that. She could not change her nature,

could not entirely remove the blight that had fallen

upon her youth.

I  One glorious spring morning, when the great heart 

:lf Nature -seemed to be pulsing with a new-born joy,

t   -Pritcha:rd sat a nt 'open window from whence a

JD- -  an'orama of sea and shore was obtained. She

! had been perusing the Times, and looking up, she ad-

dressed her sister, who was engaged in making a water-

colour sketch of a vase of spring flowers that stood on

the table.

"Hetty," dear," she said, " here is an item of news

that will interest you. I see that the Gloriana troopship

has arrived with the headquarters of the 12th Royal

Lancers on board. Amongst the officers occurs the

name of Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Sandon, V.C."

"Indeed," exclaimed Hetty, with more animation

than she was in the habit of showing, while some acces-

sion of colour seemed to redden her fair cheeks. " But

it can't be the Captain Sandon we used to know, for we

heard, you remember, that he was killed during the

siege of Delhi."

"It must be the same, dear," answered her sister.

" Listen," and she proceeded to read. " Amongst the

officers whom the Gloriana has brought home is Brevet-

Lieutenant-Colonel Sandon, who has so greatly dis-

tinguished himself during the great Mutiny, and has

been awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallant services

during the siege of Delhi. When the rebel city was

stormed by our troops on September 14, 1857, Lieu-

tenant-Colonel (then Captain) Sandon was attached to

one of the assaulting columns which stormed the breach

at the Cashmere Gate. Captain Sandon was one of the

first officers to enter the breach, where some desperate

fighting took place. In spite of a severe wound he re-

ceived, he refused to retire, and by his heroic example

he so encouraged his men, who showed a disposition to

waver, that they rallied, and made such a tremendous 

onslaught on the rebels opposed to them that the position

was won. Later on in the day, although suffering

greatly himself, Captain Sandon rescued at the immi

nent peril of his life a private of the 53rd regiment,

who was surrounded by Sepoys. The man had received

a terrible wound in the left arm which partially disabled

him. The gallant officer killed two of the enemy and

drove the others off, and when the private fainted from 

loss of blood, Captain Sandon lifted him up and carried

him to a place of safety. We understand that Lieu-

tenant-Colonel Sandon intends to resign his commis-

sion, and settle down on his splendid estate of Beech-

holm in Surrey, which he recently inherited from his

uncle."

" Yes," remarked Hester quietly, as tears gathered

in her eyes, "it is our Captain Sandon."  Then she

went on with her painting for a few  minutes, but

suddenly rising she put away her materials and

said-" I am going for a stroll, Madge. I've got a

headache."

Mrs. Pritchard made no answer, but that evening

when the lamps had been lighted, and the children had

gone to bed, she and Hester sat alone, and looking up

from some needlework she was engaged upon, she fixed

her eyes on her sister's face and said-

" Hetty, dear, I have written to Colonel Sandon with

or joint congratulations on his arrival home. Have I

done right ?"

Y "Yes, of course you have," answered Hetty, with a

bright, glad look in her face such as it had not worn for

many a long day. " We owe our lives to Sandon, and

we should surely have been wanting in common grati-

*ade not to have sent him s:ome"        an- 

pl.:^  ow^i ^ fti*ket- ei'hg an answer  ;

_      _--~~~I:;nel, and in it was this passage-

: "-Glad indeed I am to hear that Hester is with you

-and is well. I wonder if she still thinks kindly of me.

When may I come to see you ?"

By return of post went back the widow's answer- 

" We shall be delighted to see you at any' time you

like to come. We can only offer you humble accommo-

a-tion in our humble home, but the welcome will be

t1rty and sincere."

- A few weeks later, on a golden evening in early 

June, a handsome, bronzed man wandered listlessly

with a lady by his side along a fern-fringed path

,bordering a Devonshire stream. And presently the

-two came to a stile, where they lingered, and while she

stood with modest, down-cast mien, he took her gloved

hand, saying-

" Hetty, for over three years I have nursed my love

for you. Your face has been ever present before me.

I have seen it through the cannon's smoke; and it has

been like a vision of sweetness to me amidst the horrors

of the battle-field. Have I earned the right now to ask

you to share the future with me ?"

A moment's pause, then eshe raised -her eyes to his

and murmured the one word- 

" Yes."

Their lips met in ratification -of the compact; and

arm in arm they wanaere'd home, as the young moon

rose and shed a lustre of silver sheen over the land-

scape, which was so peaceful, so beautiful, so truly

English.  That evening, when the dinner-table had

been cleared, and Colonel Sandon had lit a cigar, little

Amy stood beside him, and stroking her fair golden

ringlets, he asked-

" Amy, how would you like to have me for your

uncle, eh ?"

"; Oh, so much. You dear, dear old man! ' cried

the child, with the excitement of delight. "' But how

can you be my uncle ?"

" Well, you see it's this way. Hetty is your aunt.

Now, if I become Aunt Hetty's husband, I shall be

your uncle. Don't you see ?"

"Oh, I say, isn't that jolly?' exclaimed -Master

Fred, who, seated at one end of the table, was busy

carving some orange-peel into grotesque shapes. "I

always knew you liked Aunt Hetty, because I re-

member once in Meerut you kissed her hand in the

garden. And I know she likes you, because when

" Amen to that," murmured Sandon, with impressive

feryour. And a little .later, when Mrs. Piitchard had

;mie off with the children to see them to their beds,

;iindon folded his arms about Hester's neck, and said--

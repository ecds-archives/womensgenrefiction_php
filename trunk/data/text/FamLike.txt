INTRODUCTION
<p>To write a good Anglo-Indian novel needs very special
gifts and qualifications. In the first place, a writer must
have practically had the entree to the society of the two
most exclusive places on the face of the earth, London
and Calcutta. When the late Colonel Meadows Taylor
began his brilliant series of Anglo-Indian tales, one and
all the critics, even when according the highest praise to
them, said they feared that the stories would not be popu-
lar in Britain, save among the limited circle of retired
Eastern officials. A few years showed how very fallacious

<p>It is so easy to fail, because one stratum of Indian life
is so absolutely distinct from another.  The writer who
is under the fond delusion that because he has seen a
good deal of military life and military society in Calcutta,
he is thereby quite warranted to pose as an authority on
official civilian life, or mercantile life, or upon the condi-
tions of society at Madras and Bombay, never made a
more hopelessly humiliating blunder in his whole existence.
The military and the civilian circles of society are broadly
differentiated and demarcated, while the entire social
structure at Calcutta is as widely different from that at
Madras and Bombay as the customs of the East are
different from the customs of the West. It is here so
many writers fail, but it is also here that those few writers
who describe Anglo-Indian life with adequate knowledge
and appreciation score their most undoubted and undeni-
able successes. Such an one is the writer of the work we

most true as well as the most telling which are drawn
from living prototypes. Among all the writers of the
present 'day, there is none that shows more verve and
more vigour in both the conception and the execution of
her characters.
The earliest novel which Mrs. Croker issued was a story
entitled Proper Pride, which saw the light in 1882, and
was followed by a long list of others: Pretty Miss Neville
(I883); A  Bird of Passage (1886); Diana Barrington
(1888); Two Masters (1890); Interference (I891), the
majority of which, although showing an acquaintance with
Eastern life, belongs to what may aptly be termed Mrs.
Croker's " English Period."
In 1892 she issued the novel we now present in this
form, to wit, A Family Likeness, following it up with a
magnificent succession of studies of Anglo-Indian, military,

the deftness as well as the delicacy of Mrs. Croker's work
than when we come to study this great creation. In the
hands of a lesser artist we should simply have loathed
"Dolly," have considered him such an impossible sneak
and a cad to boot, that the sooner he made his exit from
the pages of the novel, the sooner we should have been
pleased. Yet such is Mrs. Croker's art, that we find our-
selves actually pitying " Dolly," making excuses for him,
and feeling that despite his bad record he might have been
infinitely worse. Of course he is thrown into unfavourable
contrast with Gerald Romily, a hero sans peur et sans
reproche. Gerald is a noble fellow, and we rejoice when,
all his troubles and misunderstandings over, he goes out
of our life to begin his own new existence with the one
woman on earth for him-Juliet Carwithen.     Gerald's

Irs. Dickson that Gerald Romily must never make

Gerald lest she should compromise his future, and
only when his and her friends proved to her beyond
intest shadow of doubt that his future would be in
ay imperilled, or his family honour smirched by his
age with her, that she consented. It was a touch

U Adieu, she cried, and waved her lily hand."
IT was a sultry afternoon towards the middle of August; a
glittering blue sea stretched between Dover and the white
ooast of France-a sea to allure the most invincible lands-
man,-and hundreds of eager tourists were hurrying on
board the Calais-Douvres, as she lay alongside the jetty,
with her steam up; whilst heavily laden porters staggered
across a second gangway, carrying the enormous sacks that
contained the Indian mail.
Meanwhile the pleasure-seeking local population lined the
upper pier, and critically surveyed the great travelling horde
as they embarked for their autumn holiday. Proud and
complacent the individual who could recognize and indicate
some well-known public character, be it peer, politician,
author, or actress, or even the hero or heroine of some recent
society scandal.  Well-dressed women, soldierly looking
men, pretty girls, children and their nurses, and idle sailors,
were all more or less resting their elbows on the cold stone
parapet, their whole attention concentrated on the stream
of people whose departure they were superintending with
such flattering interest. There go a young couple, a bride
and bridegroom, basely betrayed by their new portmanteaux;
here comes a burly paterfamilias, followed by his wife and
a flock of chattering daughters ; parsons abound, singly or
in pairs, and strong-minded females in blue spectacles and

gauze veils serenely occupy the best places-places which
have been the just reward of a timely arrival-whilst poor
helpless creatures, with about twenty small parcels, are being
mercilessly hustled to and fro in the throng. Numerous
Americans, with prodigious Saratoga trunks, and a vast
multitude of Cook's tourists, are all on the wing for the
Continent. Two or three days of old-fashioned summer
weather have set the world moving, the Calais-Douvres is
absolutely crammed, and the crowd of spectators on the
upper pier have never enjoyed a more satisfactory inspection.
Some few favoured individuals are down alongside the
steamer, taking leave of friends, and obtaining a nearer
view of coronetted handbags, and Redfern's latest travelling
costumes. A group of four stand close by the gangway,
and have attracted more than one glance and smile, and the
whispered comment, " Old Indians."  The tall gentleman
with aquiline nose, sweeping grey moustache, and a puggaree
round his hat, is Colonel Romilly, a retired officer, who,
after thirty-eight years' service, has luckily survived-as so
many fail to do-to draw his pension of eleven hundred and
twenty-five pounds per annum. Next to him is his wife, a
lady with delicate features and frizzy hair, holding a large
white-covered umbrella, with a frill like a pillow-case, over
a somewhat florid bonnet-a gay, vivacious, fussy little
matron, who looks surprisingly juvenile to be the mother
of the broad-shouldered young man beside her.   Gerald
Romilly is six and twenty, an officer in a Ghoorka regiment,
and at present enjoying a year's leave in England. The
family have come over from Folkestone to speed a friend,
who is on the point of returning to the East-a sharp-faced
elderly matron, with keen eyes and a brisk manner, and
undoubtedly an experienced traveller.  Observe her neat
bundle of wraps, her dust-cloak, umbrella, and handbag 
She has no encumbrances, and possibly congratulates herself
that she is not as others are, overwhelmed with hampers,
cages, baskets, and bundles.
"This is a frightful time of year for you to be going
back, Teresa," said Mrs. Romilly, with a slight sniff. "I
cannot reconcile myself to it. But you will surely come
home next May ?"

"It will not be my fault if I am not home within twelve
months," said Mrs. Manders, emphatically. "Of course I
kow that I shall be grilled alive in the Red Sea, but it is
only for a few days, and Tom's extravagance is so unbridled
when I am away that, if I did not go back for a while, he
would have us all in the poor-house; I am certain the
servants are making their fortunes-they want me to keep
them in check," and she laughed a little dry, complacent
laugh. "And really, with a boy at Eton, and three girls
costing five hundred a year, and the rupee little better than
a shilling,-I have to think of every pice."
" A hundred and thirty a year for each of the girls is pre-
posterous !" exclaimed Mrs. Romilly, "and I have often
said so, Tessy; people always add on for Indian children,
and I cannot see why. They don't eat more, and I can
answer for it-judging by Gerald-that they don't learn
more than others. I wonder you don't ask Mrs. Gace to
reduce her terms for three of a family."
"Perhaps Mrs. Manders is afraid that she might reduce
the children to match ?" suggested young Romilly, with a
twinkle in his grey eyes. " When I was a little chap, and
supposed to be receiving every indulgence, and more than a
mother's care, I never had butter on my bread if I had an
egg for breakfast; the combination was considered too rich !
The same applied to meat and pudding; and in Lent I
abstained, sorely against my will, from milk and sugar in
my tea-in fact, the only thing that they supplied, without
stint, was physic."
"Yes, very likely; but that was twenty years ago," an-
swered the lady; "people dare not treat children in that
fashion nowadays-my young folk will be well cared for-
and, Jerry, I particularly beg that you will not spoil them
when they go to your mother for their Christmas holidays
-don't teach Algy to smoke, and don't put nonsense into
Nita's head, and tell her that she is pretty I"
" Is she pretty, Mrs. Manders ?" he asked, with an air of
ingenuous simplicity.
Mrs. Manders's only reply was a scornful stare, and, turn-
ing abruptly to his mother, she said-
"Now, Susan, let me find you quite settled down by the

time I come back. You have been nearly a year at home,
and here you are, still haunting the offices of house-agents,
and still going from pillar to post, a sort of genteel vagrant."
" Quite true," acquiesced her son. " The Wandering Jew
has a strong rival in my mother."
" But it is so difficult to make up one's mind," pleaded
Mrs. Romilly, piteously. " You see, we have all the world
to choose from; no ties now. If I had one or two married
daughters-- "
" Instead of one unmarried and unruly son," interrupted
Mrs. Manders.
"And advertisements are so deceptive.    A splendid
Elizabethan manor house is generally tumbling to pieces,
and about ten miles from the nearest station ; a mansion in
its own grounds is a wretched villa, close to a high-road. I
went to look at a place the other day, and it was within a
stone's throw of a large cemetery, and our nearest neigh-
bours would have been the inmates of a military prison on
one hand, and a lunatic asylum on the other. And John
here, likes the sea, and I like the country, and Gerald prefers
London; it is so hard to please every one. I think I shall
wait till you come home, and establish myself near you."
" At any rate, we will stick to Folkestone for the present,"
put in Colonel Romilly. " It is a cheery sort of place, and
we have a capital house, and can always meet our Indian
friends as they go through."
" Yes, so you can," assented Mrs. Manders, "and I expect
your house is as usual, a sort of family hotel, or glorified
dak bungalow. I'm certain you have not shaken off your
old habits."
" If our house is a family hotel, I should be glad to know
what yours is at the present moment," inquired Gerald
Romilly. "The Kalka races are on now, and if I know
anything of my godfather, every room is full, and not merely
that, but the compound is white with tents. All he wants
is a big sign-board inscribed, ' The Manders Arms, good
entertainment for man and beast,' the whole surmounted by
the family crest, a one-legged stork."
" A one-legged goose would be far more appropriate, and
so I often tell Tom," said Mrs. Manders, with angry deci-

'don. " I dare say he has forty people to dinner and tiffin
every day of his life I"
" I expect your khansamah is making a good thing of it,"
continued young Romilly, provokingly. " Think of all the
eggs, and butter, and meat he charges for that he has never
purchased; think of the charcoal and Europe stores he is
wasting and selling-think-- "
" Be quiet, Gerald 1" interrupted Mrs. Manders, irritably.
" I have no patience to think of the robbery that I know is
taking place."
"How I wish I was going back with you, Tessy I" ex-
claimed Mrs. Romilly, with a mist in her blue eyes. " I do
indeed; I'd gladly go on board this minute, just as I am.
I declare I would give ten pounds on the spot for the whiff
Of a bazar, or the sniff of a huka I "
Mrs. Manders cast up her eyes and hands (containing bag

xMar you saying such awful things; they will think you are
tay. You were always absurdly fond of India."
" And am still. And why not ? My best and happiest
years were spent out there. I shall never take root in this
country, with its leaden skies and yellow fogs. Fancy Simla
now-the rains nearly over I  Jakko Hill would be just
paradise. I believe I will go back with Gerald. There is
a charm about India that, despite all its drawbacks, keeps a
hold on one's heart."
At this juncture, the group was joined by a smart-looking
woman in a neat tailor-made gown. She had a pair of
bright brown eyes, a straight nose, and an animated ex-
pression, and but for a somewhat heavy jaw, you would
have said that she was handsome, and at a little distance
you would have said that she was young; but if you looked
searchingly into the face behind the spotted veil, you dis-
covered that you were gazing into the countenance of a
woman of eight and thirty. She had an admirable figure,
and was faultlessly dressed, save for a large pair of solitaire
diamond earrings, and an equally dazzling pin.
"My dear Mrs. Romilly," she gushed, extending both
hands, I am delighted to meet you. I suppose you have
come to see off some friends ? "

" Yes. We came over from Folkestone to catch the boat 
train."
"Ah ? "-with a quick,'critical look at Mrs. Manders--
"and we have come down to say good-bye to dear Lady
Castle Blarney-Dolly's cousin, you know; she is going to
Carlsbad"-glancing to where a majestic dowager, in a
long semi-regal mantle, was leaning over the side, conversing
with a handsome middle-aged man, dressed with studied
care, in a creaseless summer suit, and listening to whatever
the countess was expounding, with his hands behind his
back, his head slightly bent forward, his whole manner
indicating charmed and respectful attention.
"You will come back with us and have tea, after the
boat goes ? " said the new-comer persuasively.     N
"Thank you," replied Mrs. Romilly, who never had been
known to refuse tea; " we shall be very glad-   " 
" Did you ever behold such a crowd ?" continued the
other lady vivaciously.
"No, not often," rejoined Colonel Romilly; "this
holiday-making is a new thing since my days, and with
most people the great event of the year, and not for one
class, but for all. I believe I see our greengrocer on board.
I wonder where he is going, and what he is looking forward
to most ?"
"That question is easily answered, sir," said his son
promptly. " He is going to see Brussels sprouts and
Jerusalem artichokes, and looking forward to French beans."
"Don't be so silly, Gerald," said his mother, giving
him a playful little push. "You are like a clown in a
circus."  Then, addressing her Dover acquaintance, she
said-
"I hear Mrs. Lightbody is crossing to-day, after all."
"Yes, she is on her way to Aix; and what do you think ?
She has actually left the baby behind ! "
" I can't say I wonder at that," remarked young Romilly,
emphatically.
"No, of course you don't," said Mrs. Carwithen, turning
to him with a laugh, and now beginning to discuss a recent
ball with considerable animation, once more leaving the
other ladies to themselves. Meanwhile Mrs. Manders, who

bad been, so to speak, shouldered out of the conversation,
had been making excellent use of her sharp black eyes;
presently she fixed her attention on the aristocratic-looking
gentleman, with a flower in his button-hole, talking to the
old lady with a pug under her arm, and a footman standingc
behind her.
"Susan," she said, "just tell me who that man is. I am
positive I recognize his face, but I cannot think where I
have seen him 1"
" Oh, that"--following his glance-" is Mr. Carwithen;
but I am sure you have never seen him before, my dear; he

"I know of him," expressively.  " Dear me I he wears

Mrs. Carwithen had pricked up her ears. The name of
Carwithen is long, and not easily slurred over. She had
caught it; and more, she had heard Mrs. Manders exclaim,
"So that is the man ! "
Gerald Romilly had been at a loss to understand why Mrs.
(arwithen had flushed up unaccountably, and given him
several random answers; he was not aware that she was
absorbed in another conversation.
"Do tell me what you know about him          Teresa "

"Joke I" indignantly. " No, indeed."
"Well, story.  Really, Tessy, I think you might tell

"No, not just now "-with a shake of her head-" it's an
old tale, twenty years old. You shall hear it when I come
back; it will keep very well till then.  Here, I see they

shaking hands with Colonel Romilly.   "I'll not forget

"Well, well, well, I've no time to bandy jokes with you
now ; you argue every question-you are a loss to the Bar,"
impressing a hasty kiss on his bronzed cheek.
"Teresa, Teresa !" cried Mrs. Romilly, clutching her as
she spoke; "never mind Gerald-you know him of old;
but give me just one word, one little hint."
But Theresa was already on board; in another moment
the gangway was withdrawn, the paddles churned, passengers
waved handkerchiefs. Mrs. Manders waved her umbrella as
she leant over and screamed-
"When I come back. Good-bye. I'll write from Port
Said."
"Happy woman !" exclaimed Mrs. Romilly, "with her
face set towards Colaba Lighthouse. But really, John, she

young Romilly, with a laugh, as he followed Mrs. Carwithen

view of putting some searching questions to that artless and
amiable matron.

said Mr. Romilly, by way of commencing conversation.
"Yes, from Trouville. We had a ripping time there I
At least, I can answer for myself."

rejoined, with a glance at her commonplace, good-natured
face, with its broad cheeks, broad nose, and broad smile.

- " I'm sure there was not a man among them who did not

"Now, really, Mr. Romilly, how can you be so very
sily ?"
, "Alas  I'm afraid I was born so. I don't mind making
a small bet that you had not as great a show of pretty girls
over there as we see here."
"No; only they all look so frightfully dowdy, after
Trouville. They have no style, no chic "-she pronounced
it cheek-" about them."
"I can't say that that is much loss! Pray who is the
young lady in the pink frock and sailor hat ? "
"You don't admire her, do you ? She is a Miss Big-
wither-a nobody. Her face is not bad, but her feet would
ealUly frighten you. She is an heiress though. Your mother
will be making inquiries about her;" and Miss Budd
giggled significantly.
"My mother"-with a laugh-" is as anxious to what
she calls 'get me settled' as if I was the eldest of a large
family of plain daughters. And who is this charming vision
with all her hair down ?"
"She is Miss Danvers-one of a large family of pretty
and penniless daughters. She is not the eldest either; but
Miss Violet Angel-to give her her proper name."
"A most proper name, indeed ! " he exclaimed. "I've
often heard of a Blue Devil, but this is the first time I have
seen a Violet Angel."
"Upon my word, Mr. Romilly, you are too ridiculous,"
rotested his companion, with another giggle.   "How

call celebrities who frequent the Row, each name numbered, 
and each individual to wear his number, clearly printed, 
either on his back or round his neck, or on the top of his :
hat. The carriages I should simply placard-no equipage,
or well-known individual, society beauty, actress, preacher, .
racing man, cabinet minister, and so on, to be allowed to 
enter Hyde Park without their label, and I should leave the:
supervision in the hands of the police."
"Now I know that you are joking, as usual, Mr. Romilly; 
but, for my part, I think it is a splendid idea, and I should
like to see it brought into force."
"Then you would have no objection to wearing a ticket
yourself, and to be ticketed as Miss Nancy Budd from
Dover ?" 
"Not the smallest," she answered promptly. "No one 
would take the trouble to read it, unless-unless I wore
something very remarkable."
Romilly secretly glanced at her fantastic headgear, and
wondered what her ideas of a remarkable article could be.
"Here comes Miss Montgomery !" she proceeded in an
excited tone. "I wonder if it is true that she is engaged 
to young Gray, of the Marines. For my part, I don't
believe a word of it."
"Yes, it is a true bill," responded her companion.
"How can you possibly know?      Why are you so
certain ? "
"For a very simple reason. Because the man has given 
it out," he answered with an air of tranquil conviction.
"Now, really, Mr. Romilly, you are too horribly cynical;
it does not suit you at all. It is not considered the man's
place to publish an engagement."
"No, it is generally given out for him. My engagement
has been announced repeatedly."
"That just shows me what I have always suspected."
And she nodded her head till the roses on her hat became
violently agitated.
" Suspected what ?"
"That you are a shocking, shocking flirt. Now, don't

" How do you mean ?"

squatted within, drinking smoke from the inevitable huka,
and listening to all the local gup.
At the corner of the bridge Mr. Carwithen halted an
looked behind him, and the dejected expression of hi4
countenance gave way to one of angry impatience.
"What the mischief is keeping them ?" he muttered
" It will be dark before we get there. I'd like to thrash
the life out of those devils of coolies ! "
Ere he had concluded this benevolent wish, the remainder
of the procession turned the corner. First, a stout hill-man,
with enormous shoulders and brawny limbs, carrying a bo
upon his back, his person enveloped in a coarse brow
blanket, fastened across the chest with rude brass pins.
Next came a "dandy," a sort of chair, borne by four other
coolies; in this sat a benumbed ayah, with an umbrella overi
her head, and a sleeping infant in her lap.
" Chullo I Chullo I " shouted the young man impatiently.
"Come, get on ahead of me, you lazy brutes."
And he proceeded to herd the party up a narrow, slippery
path that led to a mall overlooking the lake. After follow-i
ing the mall for some time, under dripping trees, and
sponge-like overhanging ferns, they came in sight of a large
grey house, with a high zinc roof-a severe-looking residence,

all over it in capital letters.
There was no straggling flower-garden, no waving creepers,
weedy walks, or barking dogs-everything was plain ani
neat and simple, from the bright windows and white painted:

into the verandah.
Dolly Carwithen took off his soaking hat and coat; the
ayah disentangled herself and Miss Bruce's new young lady
from their wraps; the coolies and pony got under shelte
when Miss Bruce herself came on the scene-a short, spare
lady of about thirty, neatly dressed in black, with black
hair, black eyes, a very long nose, a very long chin, and a
tightly closed mouth-by no means a beautiful face, but
the face of a clever and determined woman.

" I scarcely expected you this dreadful day," she said in a
cheery voice, as she offered her hand to Dolly, much sur-
prised to find that this good-looking young man was the
paterfamilias who had been in correspondence with her. He
was of such a widely different type to the parents of her other
charges.
Miss Bruce, an accomplished and enterprising English
governess, had Fcome out to India a few years previously
with the idea that a well-managed exclusive girls' school, if
situated in the hills, would pay. It would be a new experi-
ment, and she was excessively sanguine of its results. She
rented a large house, added a schoolroom, furnished the
premises, laid in three second-hand pianos, secured two
efficient assistants, and confidently awaited the result. But
alas for her hopes, for her friends' fine promises, and her
own circulars, officers and civilians still continued to send
their daughters home, just as if " St. Oswald's" was not in
existence, or ready to supply what Miss Bruce declared must
be a long-felt want.   She was accordingly advised to
moderate her expectations, and to what our American
cousins call "climb down "-in other words, to open her
arms to the children of Eurasians and tradespeople-children
whose parents were willing and able to afford a good educa-
tion in a good climate. The change had answered extremely
well. The school numbered fifty boarders-punctually paid
for-and who possibly gave less anxiety and trouble than
those delicately reared hot-house plants-daughters of
colonels and collectors. Yes, the school was in a most
flourishing condition, and Miss Dix, the head-governess and
lady principal's right hand, was amazed to hear that they
were about to receive an infant aged but two months, and
her amazement naturally found speech.
"Why?" echoed Miss Bruce.       "I'll tell you, Agnes.
Firstly, because all is fish that comes into my net-even
this little minnow. Secondly, because sixty rupees a month,
and her ayah paid for, is a consideration. The child won't
cost ten. Thirdly, and lastly, because she is likely to be
permanent."
For all these reasons, and also by means of his handsome
face and gallant bearing, Miss Bruce smiled graciously on

Dolly Carwithen when she said, "I scarcely expected you
to-day."
" But you got my telegram ?" he inquired, as he dried
his damp face in his silk handkerchief.
"Oh yes. Won't you come in ? Oh, never mind your
boots! " she added recklessly, ushering him into a com-
fortable carpeted room, with tempting armchairs and a
roaring wood fire, and beckoning to the ayah to follow
them.
"This is my assistant, Miss Dix," she continued, as a
pale, refined-looking woman, wrapped in a shawl, rose and:
bowed. " Miss Dix will have a good deal to say to my little 
charge," now turning to examine the infant, who suddenly
opened a pair of brown eyes, and having stared at thet-
stranger for some seconds, wrinkled up its face, and gave'
vent to a succession of yells. Miss Bruce could not truth-:,
fully say, "What a lovely child I what a little angel! " for
at present its nose was a button and its hair of a blazing,
red, so she merely exclaimed-
"Poor darling I she must be cold and hungry," and,
addressing her ayah in fluent Hindustani, sent her out of:
the room in company with Miss Dix, who, taking the child:I
in her arms, limped away with her down the corridor. Miss
Dix had been lame from her birth.
"You see, I had to come up to-day," explained the young'
man, seating himself. "I only got three days' leave; the''
child is not a bit the worse."
"I hope not. You will have some refreshment, won't
you ? A cup of hot coffee, or a peg, or anything ? "
"Thanks, no; I am going to the hotel. I can't stop
long," he went on uneasily, with a glance at his wet boots.
"And I go down first thing in the morning."
But, surely this young man, with a pair of somewhat 
faithless-looking blue eyes, was not going to leave the child
and depart in this fashion, without one word on business ?
Miss Bruce's face assumed its gravest professional aspect,
and her nose seemed to grow longer as she said-
" I see you are very wet, and it would be cruel to detain 
you now. But you wVli call and make all arrangements 
to-morrow, before leaving the station ? "

Oh, aw," pulling his moustache.  "Sixty rupees a

"Yes, rather," with an emphasis that did not say much
his parental affection. " You see, I shall be with my

Irld."
Of course not. The clothes will be extra, and I must

"Oh, I say, I can't afford more than sixty rupees for
erything. You see, she does not eat. She won't want
on for ages. Mrs. Warry said sixty was too much," he
.ded with boyish candour.
Miss Bruce made a mental note of Mrs. Warry's name,

"Well, it is very little; but I suppose I must try and
ke it do! A young child is a great responsibility."
"Yes; but she is as hard as nails. It's a bore she is so

ing the window, she shrieked out a sentence that sent 
all streaming after him. Then she went upstairs,
looked critically at her new boarder. She was sound 
on the ayah's lap, and, really, not at all so plain, o0

her hair, which was very abundant and very red. She had
dark eyelashes and a lovely skin.  Poor mite!  What
would be her fate, in a world where she was evidently not
wanted ?
Then Miss Bruce proceeded to judiciously cross-examine
the ayah. " How long had she been with the mem sahib ? "
"One year-very pretty lady-dark eyes-dark hair-
and so young [when she died. Sahib very sorry for two
three days."
"Sorry for two or three days !" thought Miss Bruce.
"What an eloquent sermon on matrimony I After all, I
believe a single woman, like myself, has far the best of it.
I won't have the child's box unpacked until to-morrow, and
until I see if that young man means to pay. Supposing he
was to go down, and never come near me ! It's rather a
shame to doubt him, but these gay and reckless youths are
sometimes very careless about money. If he plays me false,
I shall just send the child to the dak bungalow. I cannot
afford to support strangers' children."
During that night, had Miss Bruce but known it, little
Juliet's destination hung by a hair.
Dolly had gone to a popular hotel, and there, warmed,
refreshed, and reclothed, had presented himself in the card-
room, and been welcomed with acclamation by several
acquaintances, who were glad to see any new face that
dreary day, and to the query, "Hullo, Doll, what brought
you up here ? " he simply shrugged his shoulders, laughed,
and said, "A bazar pony."
He had not intended to play cards-had merely come to
look on-for he had barely sufficient cash to pay three
months in advance and his return journey. But he was as
weak as water where cards were concerned, and where his
own pleasure was in question, and he was easily persuaded
to cut in. Rubber followed rubber, and, alas! his rupees
soon began to melt like snow before the fire; rupee points
and a gold mohur on the rub, and bets, soon runs away with
a considerable sum, and presently Dolly was cleared out.
Luck was dead against him. After dinner, and fortified by
a bottle of champagne, he went to the Club Baboo, and

He was subsequently surprised to find that, in conse-

the regiment. The colonel did not fancy married subalterns,

the colonel's wife, who cons:dered "the boys" her special
care, could not tolerate young men who told her deliberate
lies. She had affected not tD see Dolly when he swaggered
up to her carriage at the bund. His brother officers had
declined to call upon his wife. He abused all the world
roundly in the bosom of his family, and presently exchanged
into a regiment of Bengal Cavalry, in a distant station, and
departed to another garrison, and another social sphere. At
first all went well. Sodabee was a change for the better.
Here he was treated with unusual consideration by his new
comrades; his wife was visited, and made much of. They 
set up a pretty bungalow, aad a pony-cart, and, had this
pony been the extent of his stable, all would have been well;
but he purchased a couple of third-rate racing animals, and
they ran away with all his ready money. Old bills poured
in; and his pretty little wife proved to be a bad house-
keeper. She could sing nigger melodies from shilling books,
she could braid her hair, she could do tatting; but she
could not make a pudding to save her life, and she could
not keep down the bazar bills, or ever resist buying trash
from passing hawkers. Their money became unpleasantly
scarce. Her health gave way. Dinners were squalid. Dolly 
spent most of his time in the mess, or in driving a fasci-
nating lady friend about the station in his dog-cart. There
ensued scenes of mutual recrimination. Strong language
on one side, tears on the other; and when Mr. Smithson
came to pay a voluntary visit, matters were not improved.

had come over Miss Bruce ?     There was much
ecation on the subject; but one evening all wondering
d whispering was finally set at rest. Juliet Carwithen
sent for to Miss Bruce's private sitting-room. This
no uncommon occurrence, but it was unusual for Juliet
remain away an hour, especially on dancing night, when
her partners were waiting, and still more unusual for her
to return looking as white as a sheet, and with traces of
recent tears upon her face. Her companions crowded round
with one accord, confident that she was the bearer of
Some special tidings. She had been Miss Bruce's mouth-
piece more than once. Juliet waved her hand with a quick
imperative gesture to the performer at the piano, and in an
instant there was a silence suitable to the proverbial pin.
BA Juliet stood in the middle of the room, every eye fixed
upon her expectantly, there was a suppressed thrill of excite-
ment among the girls who swarmed round her. Judging
by her face, Juliet was the bearer of bad news.
; "Some one is dead / " shrieked Marie de Souza. " You
come to tell us of a death ? "
l "No," with a somewhat hysterical laugh, "I come to
tell you of a wedding. Miss Bruce is to be married at
Ohristmas."
Whereupon there ensued another silence of fully ten
seconds, during which the ticking of the clock was the only
sound.
"This is a joke," shouted Marie. " She is older than my

It was a lovely September morning as Juliet was hurried
upwards, past many familiar landmarks, then over the sharp
brow of the mountain, and, losing sight of the glittering
rook-bound tarn, of the very last white house, she was

branches of magnificent trees of flex and evergreen oak.
Noisy rivulets brawled down from rock to rock till lost in
green chasms of ferns and undergrowth. Upon the ground
spread an exquisite flower-carpet of great lilac daisies,
delicate purple orchids, and fairy-like white blossoms, whilst

oulder of a hill, and animated and beautified the land.
As Juliet gazed in rapt admiration, she was brusquely

laying-
"Miss Sahib Khana-tyar 'hi " and she withdrew from
the romantic to the commonplace, from the glories of the
mows by moonlight to whitewashed walls and a vile dak

The first glimmer of light found the travellers once more

Kumaon hills, who shall describe it ? Even the stolid
Paharis will stand to watch the sun slowly creeping up over
the low ranges, over the grey haze of the middle distance,
and suddenly awakening the cold white peaks, and turning
them first to a rosy pink then to a brilliant crimson. The
air was sharp and crisp, the dew lay heavy on the grass at
the roadside, and long silver cobwebs wove the wayside
lowers together; the blue convolvuli, red bush berries, and
little mauve orchids, were all united by one fairy chain. As
the hours wore on, herds of small cows and great unwieldy
buffaloes were driven up the hillsides among bracken and
furze by children of tender years, a dak runner fled by,
droves of pack ponies were encountered, and it became

bN answer to his summons, a tall, thin woman, with a sharp,
weather-beaten face, and very fair but scanty hair, bustled
out of the house, turning down her sleeves as she came. She
was neatly dressed-possibly for the occasion-and accosted
her visitor with outstretched hands.
"Well, I truly never did  We were not expecting you

Juliet loudly as she spoke. "You must have been awful

" Yes, I am a little stiff," responded the girl in a faint
voice.
" This is my husband, Captain Noote. He is a bit hard

Captain Noote touched his cap, and offered a not very
clean hand.
" Glad to see you, miss; glad to see you I Eliza," turning
eagerly to his wife, "what about that whisky, eh ? Did

This fact was sufficiently patent, without any explanation,
thought Juliet, as her eyes wandered round the sitting-
room. Bare, smoke-stained walls, the floor covered with
greasy cocoa-nut matting, a few ancient chairs, a still more
ancient sofa, positively on its last legs, and propped with
bricks. In the middle of the apartment was a square table,
on which was spread a coarse cloth, with several obtrusive
holes, under which newspaper had been inserted by the artful

"Have you lived here long?" inquired Juliet, after a

tired. We got the place cheap, and he had always a taste
for mountains. He's a North-countryman is Noote, and he
loves to farm a bit, and has a real turn for pigs."
«"And does he keep anything else ? "
"Yes, sheep and cows; and I have good English fowl,
and sell my eggs well. I've a lovely incubator; and, beside
the fowl, I've a fine dairy."
"Are you never lonely ?"
"Not I," scornfully. "I have never time to think of
such nonsense; what with milking, and calves, and chickens.
It's only idle folks is like that, and I never was one for
society at any time. I send in a coolie to Durano for papers,
and with eggs and butter, and now and then I go in myself.
I have friends there."
" You go on Sundays, I suppose ?"
"Bless your dear little heart!  No; it's a matter of
seven miles. I've rarely been to church for years. Sunday
is the day I make out my butter bills. I often think it
would be a fine thing if we had one of those prayer-wheels
in the village, turned by water-like those over in Thibet-
that does the praying for everybody."
Juliet gazed at Mrs. Noote in the vain endeavour to
ascertain whether she was in jest or earnest, and then
said-
" Have you ever had a girl to live with you before "
" No; it's quite a new idea; a grand idea, I call it. You

fresh flowers, the songs of the ever busy minars, and
shouts of the reapers in the corn, combined to assure
that it was a sin to be in the house, and, dressing at

scorn, that would not have been unbefitting on the co

Y oh, so you are up ! You are an early bird, like me, I
I've just done, and I'll take you round the place, and
w you what is to be seen."
Evidently Juliet herself was an unaccustomed spectacle
those parts. The milking languished, the two or three
faced women, the imperial-looking gwala-handsome
bronze Apollo-all stopped, and stared, and muttered to
another, What brought a Miss Sahib to such a place ?

Mlrs. Noote noted the sensation her guest had created-
even the very cows seemed to be gazing at her in amaze-
ent,-and, bestowing a pithy sentence of abuse on her
tainers, hastened to carry off the new-comer. She exhibited
with much pride two half-bred English heifers, and greatly
mystified Juliet by informing her that she had " taken them
out in butter from a lady customer."  She displayed her
poultry-yard of cochin-chinas, turkeys, and guinea-fowl.
I"At Christmas I got eight rupees apiece for my turkeys.
Oh, when you are an understanding woman like me, poultry

eyes to be up to these hill-servants; they coax the hens

dwns, tempting them with bits of chupatties. I had a
lovely incubator-a real wonder for hatching-but that fool
of a bearer meddled with it one evening, and it blew up-
went off like a cannon firing hundreds of eggs."
Juliet was then taken round the orchard, and shown the
gs and vegetable garden, full of cabbages and cucumbers;
so the hairy Bhootia pony, the plough-bullocks, and finally
e storeroom, full of grain, flour, dried onions, bacon, and
uch-like uninteresting articles. Beyond it was a sort of
mber-closet, the door of which stood open. Whilst Mrs.
pote carefully weighed out some four, and counted out
otatoes, Juliet continued to explore-that is to say, she
tood on the threshold and peeped in. She saw empty wine-

tobacco in his jar, and the supply of spirits never suffered
twax low (little, little did he suspect how his deceitful
iza watered the whisky). In other respects, Mrs. Noote
might screw and scrape as she pleased; and, indeed, he often
jked with her about her stocking and her savings. Her
,nugs amounted to a sum that would have made him open
his little pig's eyes in amazement. She put by all the fowl
money, and the most of what he allowed her for groceries,
Wages, and clothes, and remitted it to her account in the
- Bank of Bengal. She worshipped money for its own sake;
the accumulating of rupees was her ruling passion. A liberal
'table she was forced to keep, alas I for Noote would have
his own way. He had a good deal in his power, and she
was not certain if he had made his will; but when he could
not see, or feel, her grip upon money was unrelaxing. She
could not endure to part with it, and managed her house-
keeping on the exchange and barter system current among
her poorer neighbours, where coin was almost unknown: a
maund of grain for a young calf, a woollen blanket for a
dozen geese; and transacted business for a goat, or half
a goat, as she would, in England, for a crown or half the
amount. The red-bearded bearer was in her confidence,
and could a tale unfold, how his mistress weighed out flour,
and salt, and sugar; how she put him on an allowance of
three matches a day-one for the fire, one for the lamps,
one for contingencies; how it went to her heart to buy a
stamp I She had wheedled her husband into allowing her
to take a companion, and the sixty pounds a year, all clear
profit, was the companion she yearned for, and her own
special and much-esteemed perquisite.
Juliet accepted her present lot without any outward signs
of discontent, she bided the good days that were coming,
and in a short time had made herself tolerably at home.
She explored the garden, the village, the surrounding hills;
she unpacked her belongings, and arranged her own room
with an effect that seemed magical to Mrs. Noote-she
scarcely recognized it for the same apartment. There were
books, an extemporized writing-table, a quantity of hill

er loud, sharp speeches and occasional explosions never
appeared to ruffle the girl's complete self-possession. She
merely gazed in silence, with calm, interrogative eyes. It
was true that none of the sharp speeches or outbreaks had
been directly levelled at the girl herself; and Mrs. Noote
had a suspicion that beneath all that nonchalant demeanour
lay a temper that it would not be well to arouse. After tea,
Captain Noote and Juliet played backgammon together,
whilst Mrs. Noote knitted socks, with feet like bags, and
watched the couple keenly with her sly little blue eyes.
Even to her they seemed a strongly contrasted pair, as they
Bat at the corner of the table, intent on their game: the
coarse broad hands of the one, the dainty taper fingers of
the other; the captain's common, weather-beaten face and
fur cap, and the girl's fair skin, delicate features, and wealth
of bronze-coloured hair. "What would William John say
to her ? " she wondered as she watched.
The mail went to and from Kala Dara but once a week-
every Wednesday a coolie was despatched to the post-office.
It was Tuesday evening, and two letters were ready for the
morning's post, one lay in Mrs. Noote's wool-basket and the
other in Juliet's blotter. What would have been the result,
if the two ladies could have exchanged and read them ?
Mrs. Noote's effusion was intended for her son, and was
laboriously written with blots, erasures, and much startling
spelling. It said-
" DFEA WILLIAM JOHN,

there instead of rushing up for a few months. We passed a
good many comfortable bungalows standing in gardens and
orchards, and went through a most curious old bazar, with
a long paved street, interrupted by stone steps, which the
on negociated most skilfully. Meanwhile I helped to keep
Mrs. Noote in the saddle. The shop fronts were all made of
elaborately carved wood, and the wares displayed were most
various-huka heads, crinolinettes, country saddles, and
Aspinall's enamel, all jumbled up together. At last we found
ourselves at our destination-a dismal, tumbledown little
bungalow, the abode of Mrs. Noote's friends, Mr. Rozario,
the apothecary, his wife, and family.
" Mrs. Eulalie Rozario is a very stout, handsome Eurasian,
who received us with a child in her arms and two clinging
to her dress. Our arrival was unexpected, but she gave us a
most hearty welcome. Everything indoors seemed at sixes
and sevens, and there were half a dozen children screaming
and fighting in the sitting-room; but nothing seemed to
ruffle the beautifully even temper of our hostess. She sent
out to borrow a loaf and two tea-cups, and prepared for a
meal by laying a filthy cloth at one end of the table. The
meal consisted of coffee, bread and butter, and hill honey.
There were eggs also; but as Mrs. Rozario casually mentioned
that she always bought them from the lepers, I did not touch
them.
" Mr. Rozario now appeared-a big man with an immense
black beard, and round black eyes. He hailed Mrs. Noote
with effusion, and seemed extremely surprised to see me. The
children collected round me, and glared at me open-mouthed;
and, growing bolder, felt my dress, and pinched my arms and
face and hair-I suppose to see if I was real. Mrs. Noote
gossiped volubly with the Rozarios, and I stole away into
the garden, the children swarming after me. I opened the
gate, and went out on the mall; it was overhung with trees,
like the lanes you describe in England, with houses peeping
through the branches, and banks covered with ferns. A
good many broad-shouldered little Ghoorkas went by, and
then two ladies walking, then some men riding. It appeared
quite gay, after Kala Dara. People stared so hard, and
looked back so often, that I thought I must be doing some-

thing odd in standing at the gate, so I went indoors 
presently to bed, which, I am sorry to say, I shared with 
less than three of the children.
"The next morning we all went to church, all but t

"After service, people clustered outside the church

one was asking who I was I I felt like a porcupine; but I
really did my best to be polite, and to swallow down the
compliments, the dinner, and the stuffy atmosphere.
" Oh, how thankful I was to find myself alone on the
breezy hillside once more. Mrs. Noote rode home ahead of
.me, without any offer of the pony, or remark. When we
arrived, she discovered that Captain Noote had been celebrat-
ing the sabbath in another fashion-to quote her expression,
'he had got at the whisky I' The result of this discovery
was a most unpleasant scene, during which I escaped into my
own room, and locked the door. I heard Mrs. Noote shriek-
ing that 'it was the last time she would spend Sunday in
Durano,' and I heard it without a pang. In future I shall
take my Prayer-book up the hills, and hold service among
the mountains, and receive a sermon from the everlasting
snows. You will think I am   a discontented, detestable
wretch, who can do nothing but find faults in her neigh-
bours, and I expect you will write me a fine long lecture.
After all, it is my nature to be fastidious, I am afraid, and I
cannot help it, no more than I can help what Mrs. Noote
calls my red hair.
"I am not such a martyr as I may lead you to imagine.
I have some pleasures-my letters, for one. Then, I am great
friends with all the villagers, I am actually taking music
lessons, and learning to play the sitar, or hill guitar; also I
enjoy my daily rambles-the beauty of this part of the
world makes up for much. Captain Noote and I get on
remarkably well together, but with Mrs. Noote I have nothing
E     in common, not even a taste for backgammon. We are both
on our best behaviour so far, but some day or other I prepare
you for a grand explosion. Do write me a long long letter
soon, dear Dixie, and tell me every scrap of news.

MRS. NOOTE SURPRISES MRS. CASSON.
"This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever

out like huge white waves against a steel-blue sky; the air,
is sharp and crisp; and, although the fringes of ferns have'
withered away from the branches of the trees, they have 
merely changed them for a new coat of velvety green moss, 
whilst their trunks are festooned with graceful Virginia
creeper in every shade, from scarlet to pale yellow. The.
eccentric cherry trees are a blaze of pink blossom, and the
ground is carpeted with purple and white orchids and many,
delicate autumn flowers. By the middle of the month the
crops have been gathered, the walnut trees shaken, and coolies 
and jampannis, employed all the season on the hill stations,
now flock with their earnings to their mountain homes.  ;
Most of Mrs. Noote's customers had departed to the.i'
plains, and she had comparative leisure from her labours
in the dairy and poultry-yard. One afternoon she appeared 
in the verandah unexpectedly attired for visiting,-and ,
uncommonly smart she looked I Both bird and beast had 
been compelled to contribute to her toilette; her fur
shoulder cape was made of the skin of wild cats, and a 
couple of green parrots' wings were stuck jauntily in her
bonnet. She wore a neat black dress, red silk gloves, and
carried a somewhat bloated umbrella.
"Ain't she a gay old girl I Ain't she a wonderful 
woman I" exclaimed Captain Noote, admiringly; "and she
will show 'em all how to dress I Where are you bound for,
Lizzie ? where are you going to now ? "
"I'm  going over to Casson's. You look sharp"-to
Juliet,--" and get ready. It's nigh on five miles, but you

turn. Mind you put on your best hat and gloves, for I
want you to look very stylish, and surprise them."
Juliet needed no second bidding. The prospect of seeing
new faces was delightful, and in a short time she came out
of her room, equipped according to order.
"You will do finely," said her hostess. " I must say you
are a genteel-looking girl, when all is said and done; if you
only had a bit of colour in your face, you would not be bad
looking I" and with this encouraging remark they set forth.
It was, indeed, a long distance; the road was steep, the
path narrow and stony, in some places strewn with loose
boulders. Mrs. Noote talked incessantly the whole way, and
rode the most part of it, whilst her lodger climbed beside
her like a real young mountaineer, and could breast a hill
almost as stoutly as the Greame himself. She was delighted
at the prospect of enlarging her borders, and seeing some-
thing different from their own valley, every ridge and tree
and hut of which she knew by heart. Meanwhile her selfish
companion conversed, with her usual loquacity, on the subject
of the lady they were about to visit.
"She is just a bit too fine, in my opinion, for a planter's
wife," she remarked, as she banged the pony with her
umbrella. "She never soils her hands, and she would not
stand by and see a pig or a calf killed for all you could offer
her. But I'm told she has a heap of money.  Her people
were greatly against the match, and her coming and burying
herself out here; but it's not much she buries herself I" and
Mrs. Noote snorted. "She goes off for weeks and weeks,
and spends the winter on the plains. I believe she is mad
for balls and dancing. Not like me, that cares no more for
such things than a crow does for Sunday."
" Then I suppose Mrs. Casson is quite young ?
She would like to make out she is; but she's nearer my
age than yours; and one day I said to her 'people of our
time of life.' She was rarely vexed, I could see, and she
has never been quite friendly or free with me ever since.
But she is not a woman who sees her duty at home, and
lays herself out to it like people I could mention;" and
L·r. Noote nodded her head three times with an air of
heartfelt superiority.

"There's the house now," she added, as they reached
brow of a hill, pointing to a bungalow about half a m
below them. "You see, they have a flower garden,
tennis ground, and greenhouse, and all sorts of nonse

It was scarcely worth while to mount; but Juliet was
polite to say so. The last half-mile was all a descent,
Mrs. Noote was nervous riding downhill; and she

her young companion was not permitted to say nay.
Snow View, the name of the Cassons' estate, was a pret
house, surrounded by tea-gardens, with a long veran
facing west. A smart servant ushered them into the draw
room, and another led away the pony. Juliet's eyes ro
round the room, eagerly taking in every object. It was n
expensively furnished; the curtains were of Madras mslin
the floor was covered with cane-matting and a few kh
rugs; the chairs and sofas were of wicker and bam
tastefully upholstered; there was a piano; the walls w
hung with water-colours; there were flowers; greatgr
from the Terai jungles, in stands; and plenty of 
papers, and magazines.
Juliet had not half feasted her eyes when Mrs. Cas
entered-a tall, slight, ladylike looking woman, with
blue eyes and fluffy fair hair. She welcomed Mrs. N
civilly, but not effusively, and then turned to her oth
visitor. Could they really have come together-
grasping, garrulous Mrs. Noote, and this beautiful grac
girl ?
"Mrs. Casson, this is my niece, Juliet Carr, who
staying with me," said Mrs. Noote, with transparet
pride.
Juliet became scarlet with amazement and indignation.
"Oh, indeed," said Mrs. Casson, shaking hands, an.i
endeavouring to keep her astonishment out of her counte'
nance. "I had no idea you had a niece; I have not seeR:

"About six weeks."

"Oh," colouring, as she caught Mrs. Noote's keen little
eyes fastened upon her, "I like it pretty well, thank
*    "MAnd anyhow it's a pleasant change from school, where
she has spent all her life," added Mrs. Noote, sharply.
"I suppose so," rejoined Mrs. Casson, rather doubtfully.
" And how is Captain Noote ? " she continued, anxious to
change the too personal topic, and still deeply mystified.
l     "Thanks, just as usual-very busy. And how is your
good gentleman ? "
"Quite well, thank you; he is out shooting shikar
to-day."
"And it's well to be him that can afford to amuse
himself," rejoined Mrs. Noote, with a sniff. Mrs. Noote's
manner was a curious mixture of servility and aggres-
siveness.
Meanwhile Juliet's eyes wandered from familiar magazines
to old china; from old china to pretty photographs; finally,
to the open piano, on which stood her own last new song.
Mrs. Casson interpreted her wistful look, and said-
" I am sure you play or sing, Miss Carr."
"Yes; I am very fond of music."
"So am I; but I have so little time for practising. I
got some new songs last mail," rising as she spoke. " Would
you care to look over them ? "
Juliet also rose with alacrity. It was delightful to talk
once more to an educated lady, with conciliating manners,
and her fingers were actually quivering to touch the keys of
the piano.
" Can you play at sight ? " inquired her hostess. " Do you
know this one ? " placing it before her.
" Oh yes."
"Then perhaps you would show me how it goes; it is
peculiar time. I have never heard it sung; and I cannot
quite manage it."
Juliet hastily removed her gloves, and sat down before the

instrument.  She required no pressing, and no seca
bidding. She was not the least shy or nervous. She fo
all about Mrs. Noote (who was leaning her hands on the
of her umbrella, and looking daggers at her and the
tion she was receiving); she thought of nothing but 
music before her as she struck a few chords with a pract
hand.
"I am certain that you can sing it," said Mrs. C
whose opinion of the young lady was rising every moment,
And Juliet, longing to hear her own voice, admitted
she did sing; she did not even add the usual formula, "
little," and began " The Sands o' Dee." 
As her voice rose and swelled through the room, 
Casson held her breath; and even Mrs. Noote ceased
scratch the matting with her umbrella, and felt that she
listening to something out of the common. As the 
ended in a sort of sobbing wail, there was a moment's pa
and she exclaimed--
"Why, Juliet, you have quite a nice voice   Just
your mother. I truly never did "
Mrs. Casson said nothing, but there were tears in
eyes, and the songstress was amply satisfied.  At 
juncture tea was brought in-a dainty service, an old sil
tea-pot, hot cakes, and actually baker's bread. As               i
Casson presided over the cups and saucers, she and Ju
continued to talk of books and magazine articles, of so
and their different settings of major and minor keys, 
flats and sharps. It was all pure Greek to Mrs. Noote,
was pretending to read the home news, but who was er
furious that Juliet should absorb so much attention,
that Mrs. Casson should treat the girl as she had ne
treated her, viz. as her equal.
Mrs. Casson speedily recognized a kindred spirit in Mi'l
Carr; her freshness, vivacity, beauty, and accomplishment
fairly took her bystorm. Who would expect to find suchararat
avis in this part of the world, and least of all in the squalid
nest of old Mrs. Noote ? As for Juliet, this encounter with
this fascinating, cultivated woman, this return to boo}k,   H
to music, to interesting topics after two months of the
undiluted society of her hosts, was as water in the desert to a

hhrety soul. The dainty tea, the refined surroundings, the
low voice of her hostess, were intensely appreciated.
Mrs Casson noticed the heavy frown on Mrs. Noote's
brow, and hastened to include her in the conversation; but
what could Mrs. Noote talk of that was amusing or interest-
ng ? The price of butter, the rascality of her cook, the
perfidy of her market coolie, and the weight of pigs ? She
was rather short in her manner, and her voice was unusually
rai g, as having devoured a quantity of buttered scones,

off her bonnet-strings, she rose to depart, although pressed
to remain, assured that there was a moon, and for te first
time in her life she was invited to dinner I
"No, no; I must be going," she declared. " Noote will
be uneasy."
At this moment Mr. Casson appeared in a shikar kit, gun
on shoulder, with a well-filled game bag. He was intro-
duced to Miss Carr, and talked to Mrs. Noote, whilst his
wife had a few last words with Juliet, lent her several books,
picked her a bunch of chrysanthemums and mignonette, and
aid-                                                              -
"I hope you will often come over to see me; and I shall
go and pay you a regular formal visit. You may expect me

bead been listening to this, " it's uncommon kind of you,
I'm sure, but young girls don't expect to be called on. I
never did. As to Juliet coming over here often, I could
not allow her to walk so far alone, and I can't spare a

"    But indeed, Mrs. Noote, I walk nearly as far every day,
and quite alone," protested Juliet, eagerly.

affair.  Come, get on the pony; Captain Noote will be

Juliet, too, was rather ruffled. How dared Mrs.

The contrast between Juliet and herself had never

than you are my own niece."
( I have always been called Carr. My father wished it."
"And now you'll always be called my niece, because I 
wish it."
Juliet walked on in silence.  She could not argue with
this detestable woman, she was too angry to speak.
"In some ways you are like your mother," continued
Mrs. Noote, "though she was prettier than you. I never
knew her; for we were both beauties, and both had our
own friends. She was a petted little thing, and fond of
playing at being the lady, just like yourself, and mighty
proud when young Carwithen married her. Lawks I what
a rumpus there was, and what talk I I truly never did hear
anything like the things as was said. Well, well, her grand
match did her no good; he neglected her shameful; she
never had a rupee. It was as well she died, for later on he
got into disgrace, and had to fly the country."
"Disgrace I What disgrace ?" asked Juliet, sharply.
"Something over a horse-race. Oh, it's well known. He
has got married at home, and where there's no stories about
him, and left you out here all these years; and much good
it's done you, being a gentleman's daughter. Your mother
married above her station. Don't you go and make that
mistake; it brings trouble anyway.  Your father wishes
you to marry among your own people."
" Who are my own people ?" inquired her companion,
abruptly.
"I cannot rightly say now; they are all dead.   Old
Smithson used to brag of his family; but that was all my
eye. He was a gin-drinking, beer-swilling old rascal; and
you see, between him on one side, and your father on the
other, you've no call to beproud."
She looked at the girl walking beside her, with her clear-
cut features and delicate, half-scornful grace, her slender
figure, her swift, elastic tread, and secretly wondered how
slle came to be so different to any one she had ever seen-
so different to Lottie Smithson, who could not walk a yard,

This was Juliet's last expedition into society for
time.
Winter came. The snow lay two feet on the gro
long rambles were impracticable, and Juliet was, like Ma
in the moated grange, "aweary, aweary," of hours of
forced idleness, of hours of backgammon in an atm
reeking with tobacco, weary of Captain Noote's qu
and Mrs. Noote's nagging tongue. She spent most of
pocket-money on books and papers and postage stamps;
wrote long letters to her school-fellows and Mrs. Badf
but many of the eagerly expected replies Mrs. Noote po
into the middle of the kitchen fire. It gave her a 
thrill of pleasure to see the girl's face of blank disap
ment when she merely handed her two or three papers
a post-card; it was her revenge for some of Juliet's 
speeches, and nonchalant, disdainful ways.
Mrs. Noote complained to Mrs. Rozario that her ni
had a wonderful taste for low company, a statement i
the latter absolutely declined to believe.
"She is not that sort," she protested indignantly.
" Maybe not, but she is always down in the village, po
about among the people there. She gives them qui

dresses rag dolls, and makes jackets for the children,
they stuff her with stories about fairies and devils and
her music. Why, she and Gindia, the gwala's wife,
as thick as thieves."
" Teach her music I Oh well, I cannot get over that I"
mped Eulalie, in a tone of horror.
"No. And you should hear her playing on the sitar,
d singing hill songs; and when she passes through the
'llage I declare they salaam to her, as if she was a goddess,
never takes no notice whatever of me-no more nor if
was so much dirt."
Mrs. Noote's arraignment was partly correct.  Juliet
imoke the Pahari tongue fluently; she was in a way a hill
girl herself, and when she went down to the village, on an
rrand to the Bunnia's shop, or on her own account, every
one was glad to see her. First of all, she had made friends
with the sturdy brown children, and then with their parents
-who were children too-most of them high-caste Brah-
mins, whose simple dignity and singlemindedness and courtesy
afforded a strong contrast to the inmates of Kala Dara.
They all adored the Miss Sahib, whom they named among
themselves "Sunduria," that is to say, " the beautiful," and
gladly welcomed her under their flat stone roofs, and offered
her dahlias and marigolds. She knew their family histories
and ancient feuds, and all about their lawsuits, leases of
land, and the condition of their cattle and crops. It was
true that Gindia taught her how to play the sitar-an in-
rtument made out of a gourd with strings like a guitar-
and Gindia's old grandmother, Neoli, poured into her ears
m any legends and tragedies, and tales of self-immolation,
and desperate pilgrimages to almost inaccessible mountain
shrines. She gave her a smooth dark-green stone, pierced,
to wear as an amulet against the evil eye, and cautioned 
her to beware of the big blind bull who haunted the Taka
valley, or of the Dekkanee woman, who cast spells near the
old water mill, and above all of the mad fakir.

Wondering listeners. She told them  that the world was

CHAPTER XV.
THE MOUNTAIN SPIRIT.
When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasiug of exquisite
mSioe."-Evangeline, Part I.
PIaOTUR  a Himalayan village at seven o'clock one bright
dewy morning in early autumn, the long crooked street
paved with irregular slabs, and bordered with low walls of
rde blocks of stone. At either side flat-roofed houses, with
* eborately carved wooden fronts, slant away among gardens
of pumpkins, pepper, tall sunflowers, and tangles of single
dahlias.  To the rear are rows of primitive cowsheds.
Houses, gardens, and cowsheds are alike half swallowed up
and lost to view among the high-standing yellow crops. In
narrow doorways old men are sitting drowsily, smoking the
ever-soothing hookah, whilst their sons and daughters are
out gathering in the harvest; children of tender years are
leading whole brigades of sheep and cattle to their daily
meagre pasture; and two or three yelping long-legged
pariahs appear to be left in sole charge of the juvenile
population-babies, kids, calves, and pony foals.
It is an ordinary Kumaoni hamlet, lying far remote from
big towns and cantonments, where the milking, reaping,
weaving, and grinding, goes on with unbroken monotony
year after year-nay, century after century; where a
woman's brightest dream is to be possessor of the heaviest
silver necklet; a man's ambition is bounded by a pair of
plough-bullocks; and the only intelligence that ever pene-
trates from the outer world is that received from neighbour-
ing villages, where news is shouted from hillside to hillside,
ud thus flies through the country, literally by word of
mouth.

Lady Juliet such a wealth of hair? such gold splashes
among the bronze? Had she as clear a complexion, as
finely pencilled eyebrows as her great-great-randdaughter ?
Pooh I not she I She was a fashionable eighteenth-century
beauty, made up with white lead and red pamt, and probably
half her hair was false I thus cruelly wronging his former
divinity. There was, at any rate, no deception about her
exquisite prototype, who sat gazing dreamily at the rain,
wrapt in her own thoughts, and apparently oblivious of his
presence. She was about nineteen years of age, and had
lived in these hills all her life. How ? Why? Where?
How came she by her English accent, her manners, her air of
calm, unruffled repose ? Possibly the latter was inherited from
the ancestress who had endowed her with her face and figure.
In spite of Juliet's appearance of tranquillity, her mind
was in an uproar. Here was a man who had recently seen
her father, who could tell her much about him and about
his mode of life. How was she to question him ? He had
confessed to their mutual dislike; but this was an unparal-
leled opportunity. Time was precious; such an occasion
was not likely to fall to her lot twice.

you and the sahib in the verandah just now, it brought the

became scarlet  "But she is dead," proceeded Krookia;

"I never shall forget such an arrant old humbug," remarked
Gerald; and then catching sight of Juliet's face of cold dis-

Meanwhile the young couple descended the hill side by
i de. The ground was wet, but the grasses, for which the
place was famous, lifted their feathery heads as if merely
refreshed by the storm, and thousands of others, resembling
small snowballs, looked whiter than ever after the recent
rain. What had been meek little runnells stealing timidly
down the hillsides, were now bold, brawling torrents of
dirty water, flecked with solid blocks of creamy foam, raging
tumultuously towards the valley.
The avenue soon gave place to the cart track, and the
track to a narrow path along the side of a ridge, overhung
with straggling brambles. Narrow as it was, Gerald con-
trived to walk abreast with his companion, whose pretty,
slender feet got over the ground with practised ease. The
sun was setting gorgeously, as if summoning the world, and
saying, "Behold the finest sunset that has ever been I"
Here and there he touched a range, and turned it into
dazzling gold; and here and there the peaks he had aban-
doned looked grey and deathlike-like mountain ghosts.
On the left hand, a fringe of pines-storm-worn veterans-
stood out in sharp black outline against a glowing orange
sky. All around was silence-the intense silence of the
great lonely hills at nightfall, and there was not a sound to
be head, save the rushing of the streams and the murmur
of two young voices.
" So you ave been nearly a year in this part of the world,

"No; but I sew,and I read a good deal, and write letters,

"And when your literary labours are over, what do

"I go for long walks with my dog."

"Pray don't be sure of that," he interrpted. "I fancy
you and I will meet often." It was Kismet. He had dis-
covered Lady Juliet for limself, and was firmly determined
not to lose sight of her.
"Mrs. Noote does not care for strangers," said Juliet,
gravely.
"Perhaps she may care for m. I am generally a great
favourite with old ladies."
"But she does not consider herself old. Have you any
sisters ?" continued the girl, wishing to make up for her
late unfortunate remark.
"No, not one; not even a sister-in-law."
" And are you not sorry ?"
"No; I cannot say that I miss them. I generally get on
very well with other fellows' sisters."
"Do you really " was her simple exclamation. "And
where have you been since you came out from home "
"First to a camp, and then I went on a survey trip to the
frontier; it was rather a long and tough business. The
precipices were awful We could only get forward like
natives, in our bare feet, and at the rate of ten miles a day;
the route was scarcely practicable."
"What was the road like ? Anything like lds-a narrow,
slippery path ?"
"There was none in many parts; in others, round the
face of sheer precipices, there were wooden supports intro-
duoed into the rock, and covered with slabs of stone, about
two feet wide-a drop of about three thousand feet. You
crawled along like a fly on the side of a house. Ah, that
was a bad bit, pecially where, in some places, the wood had
rotted away, and a tree trunk was flung across, and you
had to get over on it as best you could, with a ghastly
looking drop, and a river roaring for you below I"
" You must have a good head ? "
"Yes, luckily for me.  I don't often lose it-But, by
Jove, I've lost it now," he added to himself.
"And when you got to the frontier, what did you find ?

f"II met him at the' Rest.' Perhaps you can spare a coolie
to show him the road to Durano; he has lost his way."
i"Oh, of course-of course I" replied Mrs. Noote, only
too delighted to be rid of him so quickly; and, raising her
voice, she called, "Button Singh."
"What's up now ? What makes Miss. Judy so late ?"
inquired Captain Noote, as he shuffled out, pipe in mouth.
"Oh I "-catching sight of the stranger, he snatched away
his pipe and touched his cap-" your servant, sir. What

"I've been out shooting, and have missed my way. If

Condescend to sit at table with Lady Juliet I Needless
to say, he accepted the invitation with effusion.
Mrs. Noote said nothing. She was excessively put out;
once Noote came across a gentleman, he was merely an old
sergeant saluting and "ir-ing," and letting himsef down.
However, she would give it to him to-morrow, encouraging
officers about the place, when he knew  her plans for
William John, and him coming up in three weeks. Just
for the present she dissembled her feelings, and went in
search of another cup and saucer, and a pair of candles;
but she subsequently dispensed hospitality with an un.
pleaant straight line between her brows, and her lips so
tightly closed  they might have been pasted together.
Meanwhile Juliet, who had retired to change her wet
Bkirts and shoes, now joined the company in a soft white

find Mr. Eom'ily (artful wretch) in brisk oonvea tion with

"*Thank you, I should, very much indeed; but Mrs.

. Mra Noote will," interrupted the other. "Just leave
her to me. I shall begin by asking her to bring you to
spend a day; then I shall borrow you alone; then I shall
induce her to spare you to me for a long visit."
Enter Mrs. Noote with a plate of stale biscuits and a pair
of suspicious eyes. What had these two been talking about ?
What nonsense had Mrs. Casson been pouring into the girl's
ears ?-her eyes were dancing in her head  She was ex-
tremely relieved and surprised when her visitor said, in her
most persuasive manner-
"Mrs. Noote, I want you to come and spend a long da
with me this week; and, of course, to bring Miss Carwithen.
"Carwithen I" echoed Mrs. Noote, rather shrilly.
"Yes; don't you think her own name is prettier than
Carr ?"
" Her father does not think so," rejoined the other tartly.
"That may be; but every one should be called by their
real name, otherwise it leads to misunderstandings  And
now about this day, Mrs. Noote. I want you to come down
and see my new Hansee cow, and tell me what you think of
her; and I will give you a sitting of black Spanish eggs."
Here was indeed a bribel "Black Spanish eggs were
':      valuable, and it was known that Mrs. Casson was exceedingly
chary of hers.
"Well, thank yo; I'd like to come. A day's outing will
do me good. I can't come on Thursday, it's butter day;
but I'll see about Saturday, if that will suit; and I'm to
Ep       bring Juliet ? '
r-       " Oh yes, please," with assumed indifference.
"Well, in that case, I must borrow the Bunnia's pony,
and we will be with you about twelve o'clock."  And so
the matter was settled.
On Saturday Mrs. Noote was to be seen walking mincingly

"Are you hurt?" inquired the young man, turnnig
anxiously to Juliet, who leant against a wall hard by, her
face like death, and all her glorious hair covering her like
a mantle.
" No," she answered, with a convulsive gasp; "but only
for you, he would have killed me. You have saved my life.'
She closed her eyes, and made a strong effort to maintain
her self-control.
Meanwhile, the fakir ground his teeth, and moaned, and
gibbered; the fire had now died out of his veins and the
vigour from his limbs; he seemed to have suddenly dwindled
into a decrepit dotard, as he whined and put his hands up
appealingly, and made piteous signs for the restoration of
the sword.
" No, I think not," said Romilly, sternly; "we must have
you looked after, my dangerous lunatic. And to himself he
added, "I must see the commissioner immediately; it won't
do to have this fellow loose about the hills, offering human'
sacrifices."
" Clear out, chullo-chullo," he said in Hindustanee. "Be
gone quickly, or it will be worse for you."
For answer, the lunatic merely whined and grinned and
writhed.  At length he picked up the headless kid, and
presently crawled rather than walked away.
"The sooner you are out of this hole the better, Miss
Carwithen. Here is your hat," handing it to her. " Oome
along, there's no fear now; take my arm," he urged; but
this she refused with a shake of her head.
Once on the open hillside, Juliet stopped and began to
twist up her hair; her hands trembled so much she could
scarcely hold it. What a plucky girl she was,  omilly
thought admiringly; another would have fainted, or at
least made some desperate scene. Up to the present, she
had scarcely spoken, the fountain of her peeh seemed
paralyzed; but at last she said, with a violent shudder-
" Was it an awful nightmare ? or was it real "

In a very short time Mr. Hodder, the Cassons, and all
their retainers, were in full possesson of the whole story;
the very coolies and syces crowded round and whispered
with bated breath, " The Poggel-fakir "
After the details had been thoroughly discssed, after
fJophy had almost swooned at the bare recital, the Darty
started off homewards. Juliet herself did not look haf as
white as Mr. Hodder, who rode every inch of the way well
in the middle of the cortge, apparently expecting to see a'
mad fakir spring from behind every bush.
There is no fear of the fakir now; he is in the Jail Khana'
near Durano, and harmlesi  He maes little altars of mud
and dust, such as children build, and offers upon them live
flies, beetles, worms, and butterflies. This is better for the
community than when he haunted the hills armed with

now hangs, innocently enough, among Gerald Romilly's
polo-ticks and fising-rods.
CHAPTER XXII.
"AKg BIER TO SING.
" Se wil enchant hine ear."
DuRwo, so repeatedly referred to, was a favourite, but not
a fashionable, hill station. It was too remote for the annual
incursion of refugees from the plains; yet its healthy climate,
sunny aspect, and (fictitious) reputation for economy made
it a popular haven for retired officers and civilians who had
no desire to revisit their native land, and wished to end
their days in India. Besides a score of these gentlemen and
their families, living simple Arcadian lives within a few
miles of church and post-office, there was a considerable
garrison, and a few steady yearly visitors, who preferred a

dinners, was generous with apples, walnuts, money, and
advice. Every one said that "Mrs. Bax was such a sweet
old lady."  It was a stereotyped local phrase, and an the
world helped to swell the local fiction-none had the courage
to say otherwise, whatever they thought. To tell the truth,
the benevolent widow had become rather spoilt by years of
uncontradicted rule, and was now completely swathed in
complacent egoism. She was so accustomed to be consulted
on matters of religion, matters of the heart, the pocket, and
the household, that she now identified every one's affairs
with her own, and was perpetually engaged in laying the
moral groundwork of society. Many peole in Durano were
devoted to Mrs. Bax-her pensioners and servants adored
her; but there were a stiff-necked few who murmured
among themselves that she was a meddling, interfering old
woman, especially so the last two seasons since ash had fallen
under the influence of Mrs. Diokson.
No one could deny that Mrs. Bax had a soft, caressing
voice, soothing, purring manners, and an endearing way of
holding and stroking your hand, whilst engaged in con.
versation; but the discontents declared that she plastered
rather with mustard than with healing balms the smarts of
her friends; that she had a pleasant way of saying most
unpleasant things, and gave herself leave to utter speeches
to her acquaintances, her hand pressing theirs, her eyes
smiling up into their eyes, that made many a bold spirit
quail.
She had certainly been more actively and mischievously
meddlesome since she had made the acquaintance of Mrs.
Dickson, a lady who had come up from the plains the
previous season, with a letter of introduction to the chaplain,
and who, it was rumoured, had been at school with Sophy
Casson. A tall, big-boned, gushing person, with a reddish
skin, and very prominent teeth, Mrs. Dickson was not
young, fascinating, rich, or even good-natured. She had
met little Captain Dickson at a country house, where they
were snowed up together for weeks, and, much to the amaze-
r ent of the fnends of both parties, he had 'rposed for her,
married her, and carried her off to India. t-   bride was

Juliet laughed,-a queer little ghostly laugh that almost
frightened herself, and she slowly raised her beautiful dark
upon him as she answered-
And as far as I can see, Mr. Romilly, we shall never
meet again after to-day."
Time will tell, time will show, which of us is the true
prophet. Before we part for the present give me a sensible
answer-your real reason. I shall never rest until I know
it?"
He never guessed that Mrs. Bax's harangue had been
accepted as true worldly wisdom, and had burnt into a
young and smarting soul, and a most sensitive and innocent
nature; that his offer had come at an unfortunate moment,
before cool common sense had time to make itself heard;
and that Juliet's love had taken arms against herself to save,
as she believed, his career and happiness.
There was a sound of heavy crunching boots upon the
gravel, and two figures, portly and middle-aged, who had
outlived their love affairs by thirty years, came slowly upon
the scene.
"Juliet," said the young man, hastily, "this is not your
last word or mine, it cannot be. You have not done with
me-now or ever. I shall write-   "
"Do not," she rejoined emphatically.  " It will be of no
me; it will be only the same thing over again," and she
abruptly turned to depart.
To listen to further pleading was too much for her self-
control; her heart was too full to speak. She had done
right, and the actual moment of sacrifice was over I and oh,
how thankful she would be to creep away somewhere, and
hide herself and her misery I She walked in advance of her
companion, through the garden, and as she passed the gate,
it seemed to her as if she was quitting Paradise, and being
driven out into the stern, cold world by an angel, with a
two-edged sword, signifying honour and duty.
She must keep a brave front, and pretend to be merry and
happy for a few hours. Only a few hours more, and she
eturned to Snow View en route to Kala Dara, and there she
could be as miserable as she pleased; no one would notice
her. No one, seeing the slight figure come down the steps,

WnLMU    JOHN'S presence made a considerable difference in
'  the simple meage at Kala Dara, and many expensive addi-
tions in the shape of tinned provisions and European stores
were added to the usual frugal fare. He ruled the whole
establishment, everything gave way to him, for he was his
mother's idol. He rose late-was rarely in time for any
meal-but never condescended to tender an apology. He
smoked the rankest tobacco all over the house, sat with his
cumbersome slippered feet on a chair, and always appro-
priated the paper-now a daily arrival by special coolie-
and round which poor Captain Noote wandered with a sort
of hungry restlessness, meekly awaiting his step-son's good
pleasure. Rough and ready as were Mr. Pogson's manners,
he was transparently anxious to make an agreeable impres-
sion on Miss Carwithen; he bounced up and placed a seat
for her when she entered a room, paid her highly coloured
compliments, talked to her incessantly "of what we do
down on the plains," and last, but not least, insisted on
accompanying her in her walks.
He walked not because he liked it, as he frankly assured
her, but solely to enjoy the delights of her company-pre-
suming that the delight was mutual, with an air of ex-
asperating confidence-and the poor girl did not dare to
snub him too severely, for was she not wholly in his
mother's power ? Had she not cast away of her own accord
both lover and friend?    She was miserably unhappy.
Sometimes she feigned a headache, and remained in the
seclusion of her own room in order to avoid Mr. Pogson's
detestable attentions. Sometimes she slipped away secretly,
and enjoyed a long, solitary ramble; but she was ever
haunted by the fear that William John was stalking her. as

"So much the better for W. J. Still, you are not saving
money, and it must be deadly for a girl; and not such a
thing as a beau, eh ?"
Juliet made no reply; possibly Mr. Pogson might
consider Gerald a beau I Odious word.
" Never mind," he continued cheerfully, " there is a good
time coming for you before long.  Buss, buss," to the
bearer who was pouring soda-water into a tumbler. " You
know that joke, eh ? " to Juliet.
"No," in a key devoid of all interest.
"Oh, you must hear it, then. A lady from India at
home, said, 'Buss, buss, John,' to the footman, when he
was filling her glass, and he said, ' Oh no, ma'am, not with

"How scornful you look. I suppose no one has ever

"I should like to see you I " she rashly rejoined, her eyes
sparkling with anger.
"Oh, then, by Jingo, you shall    No time like the
present," and he made a futile lurch in her direction,
thereby upsetting and smashing the soda-water tumbler,
whilst the victim escaped with a beating heart into her own
room.   After this disagreeable little scene, intercourse
between Miss Carwithen and Mr. Pogson became decidedly
strained. His compliments and hints were, as it were,
addressed to deaf ears; but she could not sit at table with
her eyes shut, and his vulgar, stolid stare was absolutely
insupportable. All the pleasures of her walks were gone,
for was not William John her too-frequent companion ? He
forced his society on her indoors and out-of-doors.  She
was his partner at whist against Captain Noote and dummy ;
this, at least, was one degree better than a t^te-&-tte over
the backgammon-board, including William John's amorous
whispers. Juliet was truly miserable; even Sophy's heart
would have been softened had she been a witness of her

view of Snow View and Durano. There she sat, with her
back against a rock, her hands clasped in a favourite attitude
round her knees, contemplating familiar surroundings. She
had lived all her life in the mountains, and loved them with
the passion peculiar to hill-people. After days spent in a
close, tobacco-laden atmosphere, how good it was to inhale
the sharp clear air; dear to her senses was the smell of the
nines and the wood smoke. Almost as dear as the far-away
tine of snowy white pinnacles which were blushing under
the sun's last kisses.
Juliet sat motionless, gazing towards Durano, her dark
eyes, beneath their delicate brows, bent on that scene of
so many new sensations with almost tragic intentness. She
was endeavouring to follow up a long line of thought. She
was slowly reviewing her whole past life, then she glanced
at her present lot, with its sordid surroundings and hope-
less outlook, and the hateful, ever-haunting presence of
William John.
Her recent and acute grief had almost driven Gerald
Romilly out of her thoughts-almost-but not quite. It
was not so easy to forget that evening in Durano, his eager,
broken words, the stars, the dim garden, and the breath of
the flowers. And that it had not been a dream, the bit of
heliotrope was an outward and visible token. She wondered
if it was wicked to keep it in her Bible, pressed between
two leaves.  She had refused Gerald abruptly, almost
roughly, because her heart was proud and sore. Had she
been right ? Fortune had opened her a door of escape from
her present life, and she had closed it with her own hands.
She had been offered a great gift, which she had impetu-
ously rejected for Gerald's good. Yes; but if he were to
come and seek her now, what would she say ? Would she
suffer him to judge for himself, whether an obscure, country-
born girl, unacknowledged by her relations, was a suitable
wife for him or not ? He had said he would write, and she
had protested. Had she really done right ? her heart urged
clamorously.
Yes, and the proof was ever with her. She was so miser-
ably unhappy and forlorn. Had she not always been taught
that to do wrong was delightfullv easy and Pleasant: to do

and she nodded a farewell.
" No, no, by Jove I You are not off like that 1 You are

" Well,"-feigning a nonchalance she was far from feel-

" I am a plain man," he said, scrambling to his feet (a
very plain man in Juliet's opinion), " and I am plain-spoken
-none of your humming and hawing chaps. I want you

me tell you that you are the first girl as has ever had an

A momentary silence, during which Juliet was searching
for some polite phrase in which to reject the third offer of
marriage she had received within the last month.
" My mother is set on it; and, of course, you've seen that
yourself. I know you are one of your stand-off ones; but,

with the recent rains, and Mr. Pogson's footing was none
too secure when the impetus of a sudden violent push upset
his equilibrium; he stumbled, scrambled, fell backwards,
and with a howl of mingled rage and terror, toppled over
the low bank, rolled rapidly down a considerable descent,
where his career was brought up by a boulder stone.
Meanwhile his victim had fled with the speed of a deer,
and ere he had recovered the perpendicular, his cap, and his
wits, she was completely out of sight.
"Well, what news ' inquired his eager parent, as she
hurried out to meet him at the gate. "She is in her room,
and has her door shut fast."
"I'll show you what she said," sullenly displaying his
muddy coat, his hands and face all scratched by bushes he
had snatched at as he rolled by. " She gave me a shove and
knocked me over the khud, and nigh killed me.  She had
the will to do it too, I saw it in her eyes. She would not
even listen to me, much less let me kiss her; she was just
like a mad jungle cat, and I riled her proper about that chap

a young devil, that's what she is ? I would not marry her
if she had the Bank of England at her back; and a nice
fool you've made of me," turning on his mother savagely.
"It's all your fault, telling me a pack of nonsense and lies,
and bringing me up to this beastly hole, and my railway
ticket alone twenty-eight rupees I"
*        *        *        *        *
"A pretty way you have treated my poor boy I" said
Mrs. Noote, bursting into Juliet's room. " Nearly knocked
him over the khud, a real grateful return for all our
kindness I"
"I gave him a plain answer to a plain question, Mrs.
Noote, and he insulted me."
"He asked you to marry him, the greatest compliment
he could pay you, miss; and he offered to kiss you, and you
call that an insult I"
"Most certainly I do," her voice shaking with passion,
and I must say-   "
"And I don't," storming down the interruption. "And

under the door, to notify that if she would come forth, Mr.
pogson was prepared " to forgive and forget."
In answer to his mother's threat of starving Juliet out,
he had rejoined, in his own forcible way, "You will never
starve her into marrying me, and I would as soon marry
a young tigress I She has a pride and will that beat all.
She would sooner die than let you break her spirit; you
may see it in her eye."  To which Mrs. Noote vulgarly
retorted, " Very much in her eye."
Nevertheless, she was concerned that none of her arts
would lure the girl from her retreat. No; she refused to
appear, as long as Mr. Pogson was in the house. She wrote
this down in black and white, and gave it to her own
emissary, the ayah.
For two days it poured incessantly, and the rain brought
the cholera. The villagers awoke one morning and found
seven corpses in their midst. Ill news flies fast; at half-
past six it was at Kala Dara, and the awful word had been
whispered into Mrs. Noote's ear. When she carried the
announcement to her son, he was still in bed. He started
up, his face a pale lemon colour, his bold, light eyes seemed
to protrude from their sockets, the damp dew of a mortal
fear was on his brow.
" Then, in that case, my name is Walker 1" he exclaimed,
sitting up in bed. "I am off, sharp; tell them to saddle
the pony."
"But you will wait for your breakfast, lovey ?" pleaded
his mother. " It's downright dangerous to start fasting."
" Zi's far more dangerous to stop. Clear out while I stick
A some clothes; you can send my kit after me. You come
and tell me that the black cholera is in the village, and
press me to stop I No; not for Joe I"
Such was his panic that in five minutes Mr. Pogson was
equipped. True, he was unwashed, and unshaven, and
hardly spared a second to swallow a cup of coffee, and say
good-bye to his mother.
As he hastily saluted her, he pointed to Juliet's door and
laid, in a hoarse voice, and with his mouth full of toast-
"You'd better tell her, and let her clear out, too; mind
you, it's 7er7 close."

"Thank you. I never was ill," was the stiff rejoinder.
" Only a pain in your temper " returned the other, with
her most aggressive glare, and she seized the tea-pot as if
she would like to shake it. "I don't hold with girls as has
black dogs on their backs."
" See, Miss Judy, this is a letter for you," broke in Captain
Noote, as he threw it to her across the table.
Juliet coloured violently as she took it up. It was from
Gerald Romilly. She recognized his bold black writing.
Of course it was merely to say good-bye. She turned it
over; the postmark was Lucknow, the date ten days
previously.  He was no doubt already in the Indian
Ocean on his way home.     She felt a hard lump rise
in her throat; and she caught Mrs. Noote's pale eyes
fixed on her interrogatively. No; she was not going to
open it under their supervision.  She thrust it into her
ocket, intending to take it out and read it alone on the
Mrs. Noote was intensely disappointed, and exclaimed,
with a sneer-
" It's not very important, seeing as it's not worth opening.
A pity I did not keep it another week I"
Juliet made no reply. She felt that there was something
unusual in the domestic atmosphere. Why had William John
raised the siege and run away ? Why was Captain Noote
staring at her as if he would like to say something, and
dared not; and, above all, why, at ten o'clock in the morn-
ing, did he go boldly and openly to the whisky-bottle, pour
out nearly half a tumbler of raw spirits, and swallow it
without any remonstrance from Mrs. Noote ? But she had
no time to speculate. She was longing for some fresh air,
and to be out among the hills; and, putting on her hat
and calling Pouchee, she set forth for a long ramble. The
air and the motion were good for her. She walked steadily
on for nearly four miles before she ventured to open the
letter-it would only contain bad news, and she put off the
evil moment, and allowed sinking hope to utter its last
dying whispers.
At length she reached a well-known retreat, sat down,
and tore the envelope with tremulous fingers; the contents

cows waited at the closed doors of their owners' houses.
From one dwelling emerged a little group, bearing on a bier
a stark body covered with a thin muslin shroud. From
another hut came the piercing sounds of lamentation and
woe.
Juliet paused at the threshold and looked in; there was
the beaten mud floor, the unused grinding-stone and brass
cooking-vessels, though it was the evening hour. A still,
stiff form lay twisted up on a charpoy, half covered with
a rezai. A child was playing with the dead man's huka;
whilst a woman, with her hair down, sat on the floor,
screaming and beating her breast.
As Juliet stood irresolute, a withered old crone suddenly
rose, and darted to the door.
"Begone I" she shrieked.  "Breathe not in the place
of death! Miss Sahib, it is the 'Hyjah ka Bim-ar hai'
(the cholera). Fifteen people have died since yesterday's
dawn ! Why should you die too ? You are young and fair.
The gwala is dead; they carried him but now to the burn-
ing ghat, and also his sons, Punee and Krisna. There is
none of his race to light the pyre."
"The gwala dead I" repeated Juliet, in a tone of in-
credulous horror; "and the children.  Oh, this is too
dreadful I And their mother ? "
"She has escaped. She had gone down with corn to her
mother's house in Durano. Behold, her own house is empty
now; but Jangu, the father of all, went first. Well, he is
thrice blessed. Last year he made the great pilgrimage to
Gangoutri temple. Yes, old man as he was, he ascended to
the very cow's mouth itself. Mahadeo, therefore, took him
speedily; but Ganca Thapa, here," pointing to the distorted
corpse, "devils tore his body from his soul "
Juliet shuddered instinctively as she said, "Are any
sick now ? We will send to Durano for the doctor and
remedies      "
"No need," interrupted the hag; "those who were
stricken are gone. They died speedily, and in great tor-
ment, in spite of the hakim, who gave medicine, opium,
and ginger, and did poojah to the gods, and also magic.

Meanwhile the newly made widow sat wailing and
her hair, and beating her head upon the ground with all 
wild extravagance of Eastern grief. Juliet had heard
the cholera, and knew that its visits were periodical in

hue. 
But Juliet put the proffered whisky aside, and paus e

the sick-room. It was true that she had never seen cholera
before, and that she required all her nerve and self-command
for the present crisis. To all appearances, Mrs. Noote had
aged thirty years in three hours. She looked exactly like
a wizened old woman of eighty. She received Juliet with
signs of gratitude, and appeared much comforted by her
presence; and Juliet hastened to apply the most available
remedies. She got hot bottles, hot stupes; she inoculated
the shivering ayah with some of her own courage, confidence,
and energy, and ordered Captain Noote to and fro; but all
exertions to save Mrs. Noote failed. The fatal blue look
stole over her face, and round the eyes and lips; the mouth
sank in; the extremities became deathly cold. The final
collapse succeeded the acute stage, and Mrs. Noote was sink-
ing rapidly. She recognized Juliet more than once, and
pressed her hand, and struggled painfully to articulate; but
all that Juliet's straining ears could catch from this last
impulse of fading vitality was a murmur that sounded like
bank-book. She fell into a stupor, and about three o'clock
in the morning passed almost imperceptibly away.
Of course her burial must take place without delay-no
need, as among the natives, to wait five hours ere burning
the body, in order to give the soul time to reach the abode
of Yama. Captain Noote was amazed to discover that there
was a coffin in the house--" But then," as he sobbed, when
his first surprise had abated, "Eliza was always such a
wonderful woman for stores,"-and in the coffin which she
had purchased for her husband, was Eliza Noote laid.
Captain Noote began to dig her grave in the garden at
daybreak. Meanwhile, Juliet stood at the little gate, and
saw the sun rise over the snowy range, and flood the nearer
hills with opalescent tints, with a face worn with watching,
and haggard from the strain of a night of ghastly unfamiliar
horrors. Mrs. Noote was dead, the bearer was dead-who
was to be the next ? Must she wait for her fate to overtake
her, like the people in the village ?
But her fate, in another shape, was approaching rapidly;
her ear caught the clatter of galloping hoofs, and, lifting up
her tired eyes, she saw Gerald Romilly. In a second he
had jumped off his horse, and his hand was on the gate.

"If you were, you need fear her no longer,"
endeavouring to speak calmly. "Mrs. Noote died t

"Cholera I" he ejaculated almost under his breath, 
his eager, happy face became grave. In a second, he
changed from the lover to the man of action-the so
who was familiar with all the horrors of a plague-s
camp.
"Open the gate, Juliet," he said, authoritatively;

" Where am I to go ? " she asked, with serious eyes.
"' Here comes your answer," said Romilly, pointing to a
distant figure-Robbie Casson, at the top of his speed,
leading a pony with a side-saddle.
CHAPTER     XXXVII.
REFEREED TO SOPHY.
"Love took up the harp of life,
And smote on all the chords with might."
TENNYSON.
IT is notoriously trying to a clever, managing woman to
have her pet plans frustrated by a silly, wilful girl-and
Sophy Casson had neither forgiven nor forgotten her young
prothyge. She would have been down to Kala Dara to
upbraid her and see how she fared, but had been laid up for
two weeks with a very severe cold. And she honestly
believed that a little of the undiluted society of the Nootes
would do Juliet no harm, and bring her to her senses,-mean-
ing that it would enable her to see more clearly the error of
her ways in refusing Gerald Romilly, and thwarting her
best friend's most cherished schemes. But when she saw a
pale girl, with a tired, haggard face dismounting from her
pony (the Bandersnatch) all old scores were overlooked, she
even forgot her own dread of infection as she received her
prodigal with open arms. Juliet was completely prostrated,
and only too thankful to obey her hostess's commands to go
and lie down and sleep. She slept for fifteen hours, and
awoke entirely .revived and refreshed. As she and her
friend sat over a blazing log fire in the twilight, the next
evening, Sophy said, "Well, Juliet, I suppose you are aware
that I have been very, very angry with you ?"
"Have you, Sophy ? And why ?"
" Because, to me, your best friend, you refuse your con-
fidence. My dear, that is your greatest fault-reserve."
Silence, and then Sophy went on, "Your second offence
is, that for no reason that I can see, you have refused Gerald
Romilly-is not this true ? "

Juliet shaded her eyes with her thin hand, and said,"

"What does the girl mean?" exclaimed Mrs. C
impatiently.
"I mean that I did refusehim, and for a very g
reason."
" Then please let me have your ,idea of a good reason

No reply; but Sophy could see that a tear had sp
into her companion's lap.
"You don t mean to say you don't care for him ? "
"That is just lit," now boldly dashing away her 
"I do. To you I may say it, Sophy-only to you. I
care for him; and that is the very reason that I will
be his wife."
"The poor girl has lost her wits," said Sophy, ad
the fire.
"No, Sophy, I have not lost my wits; but I am not
to be his wife. You know I am not his equal. My o
father refuses to acknowledge me or receive me; how
I expect his father or mother to do so ? My mother

adventuress."
" I don't wish to hear anything she may say. Who cares
for Mrs. Dickson ? "
,"Mrs. Bax told me that if I married Gerald it would be
his social ruin, as I was a nobody, and worse-disowned by
my own relations."
' Apres ? "
" Apres. I went to the Sessions-house garden with Gerald,
and whilst my heart was hot within me he asked me to
marry him, and I refused him. What else could I do ?"
"Then all I can say is, that you were a little fool."
"Oh, dear, dear Sophy, do you honestly think so ? Do
you not think it would be very wrong and dishonourable of
me to marry him ? "
"What do you mean ? " inquired Mrs. Casson, impatiently.
"Listen to me, Sophy. I leave my fate in your hands;
you shall decide," said Juliet, raising a pale, tense face.
" Why should I decide, my dear ? What have I to say
to it ?"
" You know the world so well, and I do not. You know
his people and their position, you know me and my position.
You can see both sides impartially-but I am partial.  I
see too much of my own side, and my heart tempts me,
tempts me horribly I But now I put temptation out of its
power. I ask you, I beg of you, to think of him, not of
me. I only wish to do what is best for him. Yes, you
shall decide; yes, you must decide," and Juliet suddenly
knelt down, and laid her beautiful head in her friend's lap.
Mrs. Casson loved power, and she never had realized its
delights more thoroughly than at the present moment, when
she held the future lot of two people in her own hands.
She was by no means a perfect woman (but who is ?), and
it certainly gave her a tiny twinge of envy to think that
this forlorn girl, who had lived a homeless, insignificant
existence among these wilds, who had looked up to her-
Sophy Casson-as her only friend, had been invited to go
forth and take her place in the great world, whilst she,
Robbie Casson's clever wife, must remain on a remote tea-
plantation for the best Dart of her life: and vet at a word

prospect 
But no, the struggle (if such it could be called) wuas
momentary.   Juliet was a dear, simple, honourable
and Gerald was a resolute man. Once his mind was
upon an object, he strove hard to attain it; and his 
soul was set upon this pretty creature, whose proud
head, with its mass of auburn locks, lay buried in
lap.
"I think, Juliet, you should have left it to him to dec

" Do you really, really ?" exclaimed the other. "I

and then one is tempted to do things just to escape
one's misery."
"I do-really, really. Gerald will be here to-mo

"I don't know."
" Of course you know I Or else I shall begin to think

"Well, well, that can remain an open question,
comes Robbie. Dry your eyes and give me a kiss, and
everything to me."
The next day as Gerald galloped out to Snow View,
was much surprised to find Sophy waiting for him near
tea-house. She was wrapped in a fur cloak, and alone. 4
" Get off," she cried, "and send on the pony. I 13%

" And is that all that stands between us ?" he cried.
;What nonsense I As if I would listen to it for a moment I
I'd marry her if her father was a sweep, and be proud to
call her wife I"
"No doubt," said Sophy, dryly. "But perhaps your
father and mother would not be equally proud of the
connection. However, she is not a sweep's daughter, as it
happens. Sweeps don't have daughters like Juliet Carwithen.
You must make a little allowance for her. I suppose you
are very fond of her, Jerry ? "
Mr. Romilly did not think it necessary to answer such
a preposterous question.
And I think she is fond of you."
Why ? " rather eagerly.
"Oh, I can tell I A woman can always tell I" nodding
her head significantly.
"But give me one reason."
"Well, when she speaks of you behind your back, she
calls you Gerald, and says it quite naturally I "
(Once she had called him dear Gerald to his face, and
said that quite naturally too.)
" What do you mean by making allowance ? " he inquired,
after a considerable silence.
" Make allowance for her pride. She does not know how
proud she is. Oh, if she could only be married like other
girls, from her father's house I"
"Look here," said Gerald, drawing a paper out of his
pocket. "I brought this to show you."   Handing her
a Pioneer, he said, as he pointed to a paragraph, "Just read
it. It's rather a curious coincidence."
"Passengers from Brindisi to Bombay, via ss. Arcadia:
the Marquis and Marchioness of Castle Blarney, Lord and
Lady Blankenburg, Sir Vincent Peerwith, Mr. and Mrs.
Adolphus Carwithen and maid."
"There, you see, we have the whole affair in a nutshell.
I heard from the mater to-day. She says Mrs. Carwithen
has never given dear Dolly a moment's peace till he joined

" Sophy," he said penitently, " I am afraid I spoke very
rudely and ungratefully to you just now-forgive me, it
shall be the last time; but you cannot realize how it stings
a man, and cuts him to the quick, to hear that, when he
offers his love to a girl, she calmly refers the matter to
another woman."
"It'was not that-not that-not put in that way. She
was only afraid of her own feelings tempting her. She
offered to sacrifice herself," said her cousin, eagerly.
" And you were to be the executioner, Sophy, eh ? I see I
Well, Sophy, will you forgive me, and wish me luck ? "
"Of course I forgive you-of course I wish you luck,"
and she pointed to the drawing-room door.
Juliet was sitting over the fire, with a book in her lap,
and started up when she heard a familiar voice in the
passage; the door opened, and a familiar figure entered.
" How do you do, Mr. Romilly ? " she said, accosting him
calmly. Would he remember that she had called him dear
Gerald the last time they had met ?  She hoped not.
"Sophy has told me all your scruples, your ridiculous
reasons for not marrying me, Juliet," he began at once.
" Has she ? " slowly raising her eyes to his handsome face,
aglow with animation.
" Yes, you referred the matter to her. She has handed it
over to me, and this is your answer," and he drew her
towards him by both hands, and kissed her.
Juliet did not blush, protest, or tremble; she became
rather white, and said in a low voice-
"Please let go my hands, Mr. Romilly;" and then, to his
ixtreme consternation, once they were released, she turned
away, sat down, and covered her face with them and wept,
whilst he stood in the middle of the room overwhelmed with
lismay.
However, to his intense relief, she speedily recovered her
ielf-possession, dried her eyes, and said, with extraordinary
nomposure-
"Has Mrs. Casson told you everything ? How people say

But when Sophy Casson entered the room five

said, " Sophy, come here and kiss your future cousin."

forming birds are choosingletters,and firing miniature cannon
to a select audience under the porch. A stout, impressive-
looking old lady, with a high nose and eye-glasses, is haughtily
bargaining with a silver merchant, who is only asking her four
times the usual price, for he knows that she is a Burra mem
Sahib, has three English servants, and that the best hotel
carriage is at her disposal. Next to her sits a pretty little
American lady with white hair, whose nimble fingers are
busy, whilst her sharp, dark eyes are similarly occupied;
nothing escapes them-the snowy-robed, insinuating hawkers,
the chaffering tourists, the guides, the prim, elderly couple,
the loud girl with the dyed hair, the French marquis. This
is a handsome young man who has just dashed up in a high
dog-cart with a fine, chestnut horse. Yes, on closer in-

evidently the young man who has given it to her. She puts
down her knitting to watch their greeting; she dearly loves
a bit of romance. The girl blushes a little as the young man
approaches and says something, and she looks up at him,
every dimple full of mischievous laughter (yes, Juliet had
quite recovered her spirits). The American lady resumes
her sock with a half-stifled sigh.  She, too, has had her
day; nevertheless, she cannot help envying this happy girl,
who has youth and beauty, and a handsome and acknow-

" I am sure I know your face," she drawled, as he doffed
his hat.
"Yes," he rejoined, "I had the pleasure of meeting you
in Dover. I am very glad to see you out here."

waved her hand to you as we drove off. Oh, I saw her,"--
wagging her head significantly-"she really is most dis-
tinguished-looking. I sat beside her at dinner last night,
and asked her to pass me things. I did it on purpose. I
declare I never saw such pretty hands. Who is she ?"
" She is Miss Carwithen."
"Oh, indeed; any relation to our friends ? They have
gone to Cawnpore for the day with Castle Blarney. Is she
any relation to Dolly ?"
"Yes"-he paused, and then      added-" she is his
daughter."
" His what ? " shrieked her ladyship. " Look here, young
gentleman, I did not bring you out to chaff me, or invent
scandal, or jokes."
"I swear to you that she is the only child of Mr. Carwithen
by his first marriage; as to her existence being a joke, it is
a joke he has kept to himself for nineteen years."
"Stop the horss I make them walk I " cried the old lady,
imperiously. " I can't hear properly, with the clatter of the
carriage. Now relate the whole story straight off; begin at
the very beginning."
Thus invited, Gerald Romilly began and told it not
grudgingly or of necessity, sparing no detail, laying bare
Dolly's secret before the eyes of one of his most influential
acquaintances-and a woman noted alike for her outspoken
tongue and nimble penmanship.
"Dolly married to a sergeant's daughter I Dolly, who is
specially severe on low marriagesI What a double-faced
rascal, hiding this charming girl at the very back of the

" I am exceedingly flattered to hear you say so; but I've
always understood that I was rather a duffer."

"Oh, ho I So you intend to keep your discovery."
"Finders are keepers," he retorted, with a smile.
"That is true. Does she know that her devoted and.

"No; nor is he aware that she is in Lucknow.   He

him. Now, don't say no. I am an' arrogant, wilful old
woman. Every one is afraid of me, and gives me my own,:

"I never had the smallest intention of saying no. I
really don't think that the introduction could be in better

" Her step-daughter will not trouble her. I do not think
that Juliet is anxious to be actually received into the bosom 
of the family; a mere formal acknowledgment will content
her-and be more than ample for me."

as my name is Constantia. She is the image of an ancestre s

they are both so proud of. You know the picture of Lady
Juliet ?"
" Yes; I know it well."
" Actually that woman-I mean Mrs. Carwithen-carries
a large photograph of it everywhere. She has it out here in
her sitting-room; it is the family fetish, and here is the
double of Lady Juliet, Carwithen's own daughter, cast out
and neglected. If he had ever dreamt she was like the
picture, of course he would have had her home; he is a
slave to appearances. Now his despised daughter stamps
him as a man of birth."
CHAPTER XXXIX.
MR. OARWITHEN HAS A BAD QUARTER OF AN HOUR.
I own the soft impeachment,"
SHERIrN.
LADY CASTLE BLARNEY was charmed with Juliet (who had
a pleasant, bright way with elderly people). She insisted
on taking her out for a drive to the Wingfield Park in the
afternoon, and on her sitting beside her at dinner, and sub-
sequently accompanying her into her private room, to partake
of coffee.
"And so Gerald Romilly tells me that you are going to
marry him?" said Lady Castle Blarney, as she seated
herself.
"Yes," assented the girl, with a heightened colour;
" some day."
" Some day, you saucy puss I Considering that you have
lived in the wilderness, you have not done badly for your-
self. He is a very good-looking young man. I like his
laugh, and his nice white teeth, and in the natural course of
events he will be Lord Egremont, and you will be my lady."
"Oh, that is nothing l I don't think of that," said
Juliet, hastily.
" Oh no, of course not," ironically; "but it makes things
pleasanter when you have a fine fortune and a handle to
your name. My handle has got me many things in the way

of comfort and civility that, if I had been plain Mrs. Castle
Blarney, I must have gone without. And tell me, child--
just give me that cushion to my neck; these chairs were
surely made for deformed people-have you never seen your .
father ?"
"No, never," replied the girl, with a deep blush.
" How extraordinary I I never heard of such a case in
all my life."
"But I am going to England on purpose to make his
acquaintance. I have the certificates, and everything to
prove who I am, and I ask nothing, but that he will acknow-
ledge me, so that it may not be said that Gerald married an 
adventuress-a nameless nobody."
"Hoity, toity  How her eyes shine   There's a spirit
for you I Well, my dear, you may spare yourself the trouble
of going to England-though of course you must go home
to get your trousseau. Your father and your step-mother
are in this country."
"In this country ?" she repeated incredulously. "And 
I never knew I Where are they ? I shall go in search of
them immediately."
"You may spare yourself that trouble also. They are
actually staying in this hotel. They have gone to Cawn-
pore for the day. You shall see them to-morrow."       '
"Sophy must have known " exclaimed Juliet. "She 
was so bent on coming here. And to meet them so soon I
I feel dreadfully frightened, and yet it must be got over;
and the sooner the better."                            ;
"And better late than never. As for being nervous, it is 
not for you to be abashed. Now I understand Mr. Car-
withen's reluctance to come out, and his horror of India;
but she has a strong will, and rules the roost. By the way, Y
I don't fancy you will be allowed to do that, eh ? I imagine
your young friend has got a pretty strong will of his own."
"Yes, he has," said Juliet, with a smile. 
"And you have had some tussles already ?"
"No-no!     I always give in gracefully."
"As you do most things, my dear. But to return to your  i
father. In vain he pleaded for the south of France, the
south of Africa. Italy. Malta. Egvnt. He even clung to

Suez like a drowning man; but she was firm, and would
not listen to his piteous appeals. Now we are here, he
seems happy enough. He has scarcely met any old friends,
except a Mrs. Manders, who lives here-and avoids him. I
wonder why ? I wonder what she knows ? " she concluded,
with a world of speculation in her eye.
"And I shall see them to-morrow     Oh, Lady Castle
Blarney, my heart goes pit-a-pat at the thought I I shall
never sleep all night."
"Oh yes, you will. Young people always sleep. And
you had better run away now, for there's a carriage under
the porch. I hear Mrs. Carwithen's laugh. You can always
tell an ill-bred woman by that. She has a voice like a pea-
hen I Well, good night, dear," holding up her face. " Kiss
me. I wish I was about to discover a pretty young daughter
like you."
In the verandah Juliet encountered a big, burly, elderly
man, in an ulster, a fashionably dressed woman in a smart
silk dust-cloak; finally, a good-looking, greatly bored gentle-
man. He must be her father. She glanced at him with
trepidation, and his eyes met hers with a look of sleepy
approval, and they passed by-strangers yet. Juliet's pre-
diction was fulfilled, in spite of Lady Castle Blarney's
disclaimer; her usually sound slumbers were fitful and
broken, and she rose very early, but she was restless and
nervous, and could not settle to anything. She took extra-
ordinary pains with her toilet; she tried on two dresses;
she took down her hair three times, and yet she was dis-
satisfied with her appearance. When she took her seat at
the breakfast-table between Gerald and Mrs. Casson, Lady
Castle Blarney gave her a friendly pat on the back as she
passed to her own place.
Mr. Carwithen came in late, and sat opposite. Juliet
knew that he was there, but scarcely ventured to raise her
eyes. She was deadly pale, and her two companions could
see how she was trembling. It was useless for Gerald to
whisper to her, and for Sophy to implore her "not to be a
goose ;" for very little, she would burst into tears.
" Hullo, Romilly," said a hearty voice across the table,
"how are you?'     (He was accosted by Mr. Carwithen,

with that degree of intimacy 'and warmth of manner to
which his position entitled him,-according to Mr. Car-
withen's scale of merit.)
" How are you ? " he rejoined, coldly.
So young Romily was going to put on side, was he, and  '.
give himself airs ?
"I need not say I am surprised to see you out here, for
this is your country," continued the other, in his most
genial manner.
" Yes, in these days, one never is much surprised at any-
thing," replied the younger man, in a cool tone.
"No, I can answer for myself; by Jove, it would take a
good deal to astonish me. I've seen most things, I fancy."
At this moment Mrs. Carwithen, in a faultless travelling-
gown, with her fringe curled to the last hair, sailed in and
sank into the vacant chair beside her husband. Presently 
she looked across, and cast a beaming smile at Gerald, and a 
sharp, inquisitive glance at the girl beside him.
"How do you do, Mr. Romilly ? " she called out in her
rather shrill voice. " I am so pleased to see a familiar face;
you must be sure and call on me; come to tea. My room   :
is number twenty, and we will have a grand talk over old
times."
Gerald muttered something, and she went on.
" You see "-nodding at Dolly-" I have dragged him     i
out to India, after all. I said I would," she concluded
triumphantly.
"Yes, I knew you would carry your point. I am glad
you have come out.   I hope you are pleased with your
trip."
"I am delighted, perfectly fascinated, and if Dolly is not
very, very good, I tell him that I shall take a house in the
hills, and settle out here for life I "
" Oh, I don't think you would care about that; you are
not an old Indian born and bred, with many friends and 
attractions."
" That is true; and, talking of attractions, have you for-
gotten how crazy you used to be about that picture, how
madly you were in love with Lady Juliet Carwithen, or has
another image effaced her from your heart ? "



<pb n="295"/>
A BAD QUARTER OF AN HOUR.                295
"No," he answered gravely; " nor ever will."
"Bravo I what a model of constancy I" cried the lady,
and then resumed her breakfast.
Juliet admired Gerald's entire self-command. What a
contrast to the irrepressive nervousness against which she
herself was struggling, and which it cost her a great effort
to conceal.
Young Romilly was'not nearly as cheery and talkative as
he used to be, thought Mrs. Carwithen; and the same idea
occurred to her as to her husband.
Was he going to give himself airs ? That was a very
nice-looking girl beside him; if she would only raise her
eyes, and not seem so pitiably shy. The other lady, too,
was good style; why was she smiling and biting her
lips ?
Mr. Carwithen stuck his glass in his eye, and looked at
young Romilly, and at the girl on his right hand. Her
face struck him as curiously familiar.
She was pale, but very handsome; and there was certainly
an understanding of some sort between her and Master
Jerry. (He would tell Master Jerry's mamma.) He was
speaking to her in a low voice; why did she not look up ?
he would like to see her eyes.
After breakfast, he strolled over to Lady Castle Blarney,
to talk to her about Cawnpore; but her ladyship was
short in her answers, and absolutely uninterested in his
adventures.
"By the way," he said, " who is that pretty girl you
spoke to just now ? So you have been making acquaint-
ances, after all. She sat opposite us at breakfast. I seem
to have seen her before. Who is she ? "
"I believe you have seen her before," rejoined the old
lady, laying down her knitting, and transfixing him with
her sharp eyes. "Shall I tell you who she is ? "
Dolly rushed upon his fate with a hearty, "By all means,"
and one of his most killing smiles.
"She is your own daughter I"
The killing smile faded at once, and left on his face a
grey, blank look, his lips closed, his nostrils twitched con-
vulsively. For once in his life he had not a word to say.



<pb n="296"/>

He made a half-articulate exclamation which died away in
his throat.
" I wonder you never told us you had a daughter," said
Lady Castle Blarney, sarcastically. "Was the fact too in- 
significant ? You have a daughter, and you have a-tongue-
speak I"                                                I
"Yes, I-I-have a daughter. I am afraid some things    ,
may appear a little strange; but I can explain." 
"You cannot explain her away, at any rate, and you had
better take an early opportunity of explaining matters to
your wife. You see, a grown-up daughter, like murder, will
out."
" Are you quite sure that she is my daughter ? " inquired
Dolly, who was rapidly recovering his sang-froid.
"Perfectly certain. She has all the legal proofs, and the
family likeness is unmistakable." 
" Yes, yes; I see it now, to the picture. I am afraid I i
have gone down in your good opinion."
"You could not possibly be lower than you are."
"Oh, my dear Lady Castle Blarney," in a tone of virtuous
amazement. " You are a woman of the world; do you make
no allowance for an unfortunate young fellow, just out of
his teens, inveigled into a low match ?"
"Teens I why, you must have been five-and-twenty, and
no doubt the inveigling was the other way. You have
treated the girl barbarously; however, she will have a firm
friend in me, and she is going to marry Gerald Romilly."
Here at least was one spark of comfort-a brilliant
match.
"You had better come to my sitting-room, and be
formally introduced, I think. Imagine being introduced
to your own child 1"
"Certainly, I shall be only too delighted; but really,
Lady Castle Blarney, you are awfully hard on me. You
have not heard the story; let me tell it to you."
"You have told enough stories," she answered indig-
nantly. "I know everything. All you have to do is to
make the best of the situation. Come with me, or go and ^
wait in my room, and I will fetch her."
As Mr. Carwithen stood in the middle of her ladyship's

somewhat bare sitting-room, his feelings were decidedly
mixed-intense disgust at being found out, intense anxiety
as to the effect of the discovery on Lyddy, were tempered
by a certain amount of satisfaction at being the parent of
such an elegant, aristocratic-looking girl-a girl who would
one day be a peeress. What a sublime elevation for a
sergeant's granddaughter I  Presently the door-chick was
pushed aside, and Lady Castle Blarney entered, followed by
the very pale young lady who had sat opposite him at break-
fast. She raised her eyes and looked at him steadily, but
wistfully, and, with all his assumption of affection and bon-
homie, he felt indescribably small and sneaky; his knees were
shaky, and his backbone limp.
"This is your father, Juliet, my dear. Mr. Carwithen,
this is your daughter," said Lady Castle Blarney, in a clear
voice.
The girl offered a small, cold hand, and he brushed her
trembling lips with his moustache, and then they regarded
one another in silence.
" Now I shall leave you to make one another's acquaint-
ance," said the countess.  "I shall come back presently,
for I have letters to write;" and she departed and left them
alone.
It was one of the most embarrassing moments in Dolly's
existence-an existence in which critical interviews had not
been lacking-this enforced tete---tete with a strange and
rather dignified girl, whom he had systematically ignored,
but who was nevertheless his daughter.
How had she come by her piquant beauty, her stately
head and throat, her air of aristocratic calm ? She sat
silent, evidently waiting for him to break the ice-and what
was he to say ?
Bearing in mind the maxim " qui s'excuse s'accuse," he
plunged into his delight in thus unexpectedly meeting her,
and declared that he had always intended to have sought
her out at Durano. (This was a startling fiction,-they
both knew that.) He said he was charmed to find such a
beautiful daughter, but grieved to hear that he was to lose
her so soon.
To all his questions, Juliet replied in monosyllables. She

appeared perfectly composed and collected, but she was in.
wardly in a tumult of agitation, and was doing her very  j
utmost to restrain her feelings and her tears. She was at '
last in the presence of one she had idolized for years, and
she found him a shallow, elderly dandy, who was admiring
her hands and her hair, and complimenting her on the
excellent match she was about to make.
" Ah I you shy puss," he said, " if you had had a couple
of seasons in London, I doubt if you would have done better. 
And so you have lost Mrs. Radford ? " he continued. " I   l
saw her death-yes " with a flash of sublime audacity
suddenly pouncing on a scapegoat.  "She was a fraud l
How she deceived me about you I She led me to believe
you were like your mother's side, a girl of the people. She
threw dust in my eyes. She kept me and my darling child
apart all these years, and for her own ends I"
"What ends ? " inquired the darling child, in a sharp key.
"Why, sixty pounds a year."
"You are quite mistaken, quite," she rejoined, with
passionate decision.
" Ah, my sweet, innocent girl, you don't know the world," 
shaking his head mournfully.
"I have not had much opportunity of learning its ways, 
no doubt, but I knew Mrs. Radford. She was my best
and truest friend. I will never listen to a word against
her."
"Well, well, you shan't; we can each have our own
thoughts, can we not ?" with a playful air.
"I know that I have mine," she answered gravely.
"And I am sure they are all as sweet and kind and
beautiful as yourself. Now, shall we vacate this good lady's
room ? You will sit with us at table in future, and, in fact,
make yourself over to us altogether, eh ? By the way, you
naughty girl, you have given yourself away without my
leave I How was that, eh ?"
"Gerald said you would not mind."
"Oh, he said so, did he ? Well, remember you belong to
us now."
"I don't know. Perhaps you had better consult Mr.
Carwithen, and-I will speak to Mrs. Casson."

"Very well, my dear," preceding her out, and holding
back the purdah for her to pass, as if she were a duchess;
and there ensued the curious spectacle of Dolly Carwithen
walking all the length of the great verandah, a proudly
complacent man, escorting his beautiful, distinguished-
looking daughter-Dolly, who by rights should have ap-
peared, so to speak, in a white sheet I
CHAPTER XL.

"Thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges"
IF Dolly Carwithen had had an awkward quart d'heure with
his offspring, who shall depict the ensuing bad moment with
his wife ?
Fired with the rash courage of a coward at bay, he, with-
out the smallest preamble, abruptly plunged into the unex-
pected topic, and gave the whole unabridged history of his
first marriage and his daughter of nineteen, on the principle
that he might just as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb;
nor did he spare to reveal the antecedents of his former
partner, the offspring of a barrack-sergeant. His grown-up
daughter I the girl who had sat opposite to him at breakfast I
It was incredible.
Mrs. Carwithen had an unusual command of language,
and for ten minutes she taxed her powers to their fullest
extent. " So, all the time, he had played the hypocrite and
liar ? (a nasty word, but true). He that was so fastidious,
so great on birth and alliance, rank and precedence I Oh,
what a fall was here I How could he, how dared he, face
his friends ?"  Apparently his treatment of the girl was
quite a secondary consideration, a mere bagatelle. What
preyed on Lyddy's mind was that vital question, "What
the world would say ? "
But well as she thought she knew him, she had not
plumbed the depths of her lord's resources. She had not
grasped the fact that he always contrived to find convenient

shoulders on which to shift his sins. Now it was Mrs.   ·
Radford who was to bear the load. She was dumb,-for
she was dead; and he boldly declared, with a fine show of
righteous indignation, that she had purposely misled him;
had told him that the girl was common, vulgar, and stupid, 
and actually wanting in ordinary intelligence; and under
these painful circumstances, the kindest and best course for
all parties, Lyddy herself included, had been to pay the
yearly allowance, and to hold his tongue. How was he to
know that the girl, his darling, was like a princess of the
blood, and one of Nature's gentlewomen?  Lady Castle
Blarney had taken her up with all her might, and Gerald 
Romilly was her future husband. 
On hearing these two items of intelligence-artfully
reserved till the last-Lydia's face relaxed, and she became
calm. Lady Castle Blarney was a social power; Juliet, a
future peeress. Yes; the situation had its compensations,
and might be borne. They must receive her, be seen with
her, and take her about, and, for the present, "Miss    '
Carwithen" must be inserted on the hotel board list, under
the names of Adolphus and Mrs. Carwithen. They would, 
of course, pay all expenses, and make the best of it, and no
one could say but that she-Lyddy-had behaved mag-
nificently, and like a wife in a thousand. Yes; but the
question was, how she would have behaved if the newly
discovered step-daughter had been fat and vulgar-if she
had had a cast in her eye, or dropped her h's-and, above
all, if she had had no prospective coronet in the background ?
And the other side had called in counsel also. Mrs. Casson
decided to efface herself, and Juliet wept on her neck when
her adviser assured her that she must study appearance, and
travel about for a little while withher new-found relations-
carrying Gerald in her train as an alleviation. 
Mr. and Mrs. Carwithen determined to make Lucknow 
their head-quarters, and to take short trips therefrom to,
Agra, Delhi, and Benares. So that Juliet did not lose sight
of Sophy, who remained on at the hotel, having numerous
acquaintances in the neighbourhood.   Mrs. Carwithen
enacted her new part to perfection; was elaborately
amiable to her step-daughter, drove with her, sat beside



<pb n="301"/>
BY SPECIAL LICENCE.               301
her, embraced her-morning and evening-and always
called her "dear."
As to Mr. Carwithen, he dropped into the role of father to
a handsome girl quite easily, and seemed totally to ignore
his former attitude towards the same young lady. Fortune
had been indulgent to him. Who would have thought he
had such a trump in his hand as this picture-card so long
discarded?  He beamed; he boasted; he button-holed
Gerald, and patronized him, and seemed to take immense
credit to himself for giving him his peerless daughter. He
monopolized her society, and shouldered poor Gerald into
the cold. Alas I there were no more pleasant moonlight
pacings in the garden, no whisperings in the verandah, no
strolls together, whilst the band played at Mahomed BAgh.
No; these delights were all appropriated by Mr. Carwithen,
in the character of the proud and devoted parent. He
summoned Juliet to his side, and kept her there, utterly
insensible to her lover's claims. He took her arm, and
liked the other people in the hotel to witness the touching
sight as they strolled up and down in full view of the
community, whilst Romilly surveyed the spectacle with
angry eyes, and nearly chewed the ends off his moustache.
Yes; Romilly detested his future father-in-law, and resolved
to see nothing of him once Juliet was his wife; but just for
the present he must bear and forbear.
Dolly calmly ignored young Romilly's thinly veiled dislike,
his terrible politeness, and endeavoured to carry off matters
with a high hand-offering him cigarettes, and patting him
on the back and calling him "his dear boy "-but in more
than one small passage-at-arms he had been severely worsted;
and, after that notable little encounter across the table at
Benares, Mr. Carwithen shrank into himself, and left his
young friend alone. Dolly was bragging to the company of
his own wide experience, and drawing unfavourable com-
parisons between the young men of the present day and his
particular achievements in years gone by.
" I was not a lazy chap-like some I" and he glanced at
Romilly. "' I was up to every mortal dodge, and was always
well posted up in everything."
"I don't mind not being posted up, as you call it,"



<pb n="302"/>
302a              FAMILY LIKENESS.
rejoined Gerald, with complete equanimity, "so long as I'm
not posted, after a race "  And he looked straight at 
Mr. Oarwithen.
Mr. Carwithen evidently read something in his future  t
son-in-law's eyes. He became livid.  "Yes," he said to 
himself, "the Romillys were an old Indian family, and, ten
to one, young Romilly knew I" In fact, it was evident that
he was acquainted with the particulars of a certain unpleasant
episode in his own past.
He grinned a ghastly smile, and buried his face in a peg
tumbler; and for the remainder of the meal it was noticed
that old Carwithen was extraordinarily " choop I " This was
ever his demeanour in Gerald Romilly's presence from that 
day forth.                                             ;
Before the Carwithens and party left Lucknow, Juliet
received two visits. The first was a state call from Mrs.
Manders, in a splendid barouche drawn by a pair of valuable
walers.
Gerald was present during the early part of the visit, and 
he and his friend compared notes and news from home; but
presently he was called out, and Mrs. Manders turned to
Juliet and said- 
"Ah, my dear, I knew all about you-I knew of your
father's first marriage, and I heard that you were out here. 
My dear old friend Susan Romilly was most inquisitive about
your father's past. She pressed me very much, but I would
not tell her; and now his secret-and a very pretty secret-
is going to be her own daughter-in-law I Is it not odd ? "
Juliet coloured, and admitted that it was strange. 
" Gerald is a dear boy," continued her visitor, "and just
like my own son. Mind you make him a good wife."
Then, as she rose and said good-bye, she drew Juliet towards
her and whispered, " I must write to-morrow to Susan, and 
tell her I have seen you, and you must allow me to give you
a kiss for her; she and I are like sisters."
" It is evident that Mrs. Manders approves of you, Ju,"
said Gerald, as he re-entered the hotel drawing-room, after 
putting that lady into her carriage.
"I'll give something to see her letter to my motherI 
though. no doubt. the mater will show it to me when she  '    |



<pb n="303"/>

goes home; but I don't think it would be good for you to
read."
Juliet's next visitor was not quite such a success as the
collector's lady, with her imposing turn-out and smart gown.
Mr. and Mrs. Carwithen, Lady Castle Blarney, the marquis,
and Sir Augustus, were all sitting at the shady end of the
verandah, lazily awaiting their afternoon tea, when " Some
one to see Miss Carwithen " was announced. Some one who
had no card. Visions of another imposing acquaintance
filled Mr. Carwithen's mental eye; but-but-who was this
square, squat person toddling towards them.
It was Captain Noote, who had arrived on foot (vide his
dusty boots), and who still clung fondly to his fur cap and
red shirt, and carried a cotton umbrella, and a gift of
walnuts, tied up in a towel.
As the ancient warrior waddled up the verandah, bundle
in hand, his eyes caught sight of Gerald Romilly, and he
pounced on him, greeting him as a long-lost friend, and
ignoring the cold glances and levelled eye-glasses with which
he was surrounded.
" Ay, last time I saw you, you and me was burying her.
I'll never forget all you did for me that time-never I
Where's Miss Judy ? " he inquired, after a pause, still shaking
Gerald's arm like a pump-handle.
" She will be here directly; we will send for her at once.
This is Mr. Carwithen, her father," presenting himself to
the horror-stricken Dolly.
"Proud and delighted, sir, to make your acquaintance,"
tendering a hairy paw. "I am the gentleman as your
daughter lived with in the hills. Noote-Captain Noote-
at your service; you and I ought to know one another pretty
well."
And all his friends were looking and listening. What a
story for the clubs I A damp dew of perspiration broke out
on Mr. Carwithen's brow, but there was no escape for him.
Gerald Romilly took excellent care of that-yes, the young
brute-and stood beside this horrible, hideous intruder, all
polite attention and animation.
"I kept her very retired, sir, according to your orders;
so did my Eliza; but, all the same, this 'ere gentleman found

her out," and indicating Romilly with his thumb, he grinned 
and chuckled facetiously. 
"Yes, Captain Noote," admitted the young man; "I
rather pride myself on my discovery."
"Mrs. Noote didn't like it a bit, your discovery, as you
call it. She'd laid out her son William John for Miss Judy.
She was awful mad," he continued, in an explanatory tone,
now addressing himself principally to Lady Castle Blarney,
"when this young lady would not look at him, ay, and gave 
him his walking papers, and nigh sent him flying over a
khud. He is a fine, whacking young chap, and assistant
station-master at Kutchapore, drawing his hundred and
twenty a month; but no doubt Miss Judy has done
better I"
This imbecile remark seemed to call for no verbal reply,
and was answered by an icy affirmative silence. Lady,Castle
Blarney's face was a most amusing study, as she slowly
raised her long-handled glasses, and surveyed the speaker
with an air of pensive curiosity.-
The captain was in one of his garrulous moods, and
thoroughly enjoyed the attention he was receiving from an
unusually distinguished audience.
"That time we had the cholera," he proceeded, " and all
the servants ran, and the bearer was took, and Mrs. Noote,
both in the same hour, Miss Judy was just an angel-and
talk of an angel, here she comesI Hullo, my dear, I've
dropped in to say good-bye to you," seizing and wringing
her hand; "for you was very good to me, and her that's
gone-that you was; and I've come to wish you every luck
and happiness." 
"Perhaps, Juliet, you would like to take your friend into
my private sitting-room? " said Mrs. Carwithen, with a
determined smile upon her thin lips-Mrs. Carwithen, who 
was nearly as much upset as her husband.
"No, no " rejoined the visitor, hurriedly; "I've no
time for that. No; but I would not say anything against
a split whisky peg, with one of you gents," looking round
appealingly at Mr. Carwithen, the marquis, and Sir Augustus 
in turn. "I only came here to say a word with the young
lady," continued Captain Noote, who talked at the top of

his voice, and was standing close to the marchioness, and
smelt powerfully of raw spirits.
"I found her savings," he went on confidentially. " Lord I
how she got all that coin together beats me; but she was a
tight housekeeper, as you and I know," with a sly wink at
Juliet. "I mean to cut the farm, and go and live in some
big garrison, where I can hear the bugles, and be near the
canteen, and see the red-coats, and, maybe, some old pals."
"You will like that, I am sure," said his former inmate.
"Well, yes, the hills is lonely. Who'd a-thought of my
burying Eliza ?"  (Not Eliza, certainly 1) "She was a fine
figure of a woman, in her Sunday clothes. You remember
the green bonnet she had ? And what a manager I But
you were good in your way, too-a first-class hand at
turning my coats, and keeping the butter accounts."
"Oh, it was something to do, and I liked it," rejoined
Juliet, who actually began to pity her father.
Would the old man, with his awkward reminiscences,
never depart ? No, not yet,-not till he had had a special
word with Dolly.
," Mr. Carwithen, sir I" he said, " I've an explanation to
make. If you hear people talking, as you will, no doubt,
and saying that Miss here is a relation of mine" (pointing
a horny thumb at Juliet), "it wasn't me as started it, as
I told the captain there.  There ain't a word of truth
in it."
"You teed not tell me that I " exploded Dolly, almost
suffocated with rage.
" No, I know; but Mrs. Noote, you see-now she's gone,
I'm free to speak-thought it sounded better to give out as
Juliet was her niece, as she seemed to have no respectable
belongings, and she let on to Skippers the agents as Smith-
son and I was step-brothers. It made them keener about
sending the young lady to us, you see I Smithson and me
was brother sergeants, that was all; and Smithson was a
gentleman ranker. I mind his joining.  There was not
much of the gentleman about him when you saw him, Mr.
Carwithen," with a chuckle; "but drink is a terrible thing I

Dolly could not trust himself to speak; but Gerald came 
forward and said, in his most genial manner-
" Yes, we thoroughly understand. You explained it to
me, you know, long ago, up at Kala Dara. You can make
your mind easy."
"Very well, then.  And now I must be going; and
wishing you and Miss Judy here every luck, and wishing
all this grand company good-bye."  He wrung Gerald's and
Juliet's and the marchioness's hands, and, with various
shakings and chucklings, so took leave.

Juliet and iher fiance, the Cassons, and Lord and Lady
Castle Blarney, went home early in March in the same
steamer; Lady Castle Blarney having shaken off the bride
elect's parents in some mysterious but efficient manner, the
details of which she kept entirely to herself. In these days
-indeed, in all his days-Dolly bore a great deal, with
meekness and long-suffering, from Constantia, Marchioness
of Castle Blarney.
The voyage home was smooth in every sense; there was
not even a breeze between the ladies, much less between
Miss Carwithen and her intended. And a sea-voyage, with
its long, idle days, often proves, in more ways than one, a
trial trip."
Lady Egremont was enchanted with her daughter-in-law,
and admired her immensely, even although she proved to be
the facsimile of the picture that had originally bewitched
Gerald.
The wedding took place, with great Aclat, early in July.
There was hardly standing-room in St. Paul's, Knightsbridge,
-notwithstanding that admission was by ticket; and the
list of presents filled two columns in the Morning Post, for 
Juliet's pretty face and brilliant prospects-not to speak of  .;
Lady Castle Blarney's and Lady Egremont's trumpet-
tongued praises-ensured her many friends.
Mr. Carwithen presented his daughter with a tiara of
diamonds, and gave her away as if he had ever been the best
and proudest of fathers. His emotion during the ceremony
was really touching, and his studied pose of dignified abne-
gation quite a sublime spectacle in its way I

Mr. Hodder, who had asked for a ticket, was among the
crowd, and heaved an enormous sigh as he saw the bride and
bridegroom pass down the aisle. Well, every one said they
were a handsome couple, and that such a beautiful bride had
not been seen for three seasons ; he hoped she would never
repent her choice I As far as his experience went, the
Honourable Gerald Romilly had a sharp tongue and a hot
temper.
Mr. Hodder had contributed to the wedding gifts a
hideous but expensive clock, and received a pretty little note
of thanks in reply, which he displayed to all his acquaint-
ances with much pride, invariably adding, when they had
perused it, " She'll be Lady Egremont some day, you know."
And to his intimates, in expansive moments, on his own
hearthrug, with his coat-tails under his arms, he mysteriously
alluded to a "certain young lady who did all she could to
catch him when he was in India, but was now married to a
sprig of nobility in his stead I "
His friends the Honourable Gerald and Mrs. Romilly, are
well known to his circle by description; their names are
household words. The happy pair would no doubt be
astonished to hear how veryfond they had been of him out
in India, and how he had taught the young lady to play
tennis, and the young man to shoot big game (he had read
up the names and species of animals in a book of travels-
his own book is as yet unknown to fame.
The Romillys spent their honeymoon in Switzerland,
where, in Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, Juliet endeavoured
to recall her old friends and confidants, Trisul and Nanda-
devi. Mr. Carwithen has now no reluctance to be seen in
company with Lord Egremont, no fault to find with his
boots and appearance. He is as anxious to pursue and
accost him as he was formerly eager to escape from his
society; he buttonholes him, and talks effusively of "our
young people," and secretly hugs himself with satisfaction
when he speculates upon the future, and thinks that in
the course of time-in his own lifetime, he trusts-his once
ignored and neglected daughter will be what he grandilo-
quently calls a peeress of the realm.

" She certainly is very like me, or, rather, I am very like
her," said Juliet, complacently, as she and her husband
stood before the portrait of her double and namesake.
" However, picture or no picture, you would have discovered
me, all the same; it did not make much difference."
"All the difference in the world," he rejoined. "She
was my first love; it was your extraordinary resemblance to
her that attracted me. Only for Lady Juliet, I should never
have known who you were.     She introduced us to one
another, Mrs. Romilly; and, as far as I am concerned, I
must confess that I wish for no better introduction than a
speaking family likeness."

^'rH child Judith panted
as she lay on her bed. Her father
and mother slept near her, drowned
in the heavy slumber of workers
after their day's labour. Some
people in the next flat were quar-
relling, irritated probably by the
appalling heat and their miserable
helplessness against it. All the
hot emanations of the sun-baked

U -- 
city streets seemed to combine with
their clamour and unrest, and rise
to the flat in which the child lay
gazing at the darkness. It was situ-
ated but a few feet from the track of
the Elevated Railroad and existence
seemed to pulsate to the rush and
roar of the demon which swept
past the windows every few min-
utes. No one knew that Judith held
the thing in horror, but it was a
truth that she did. She was only
seven years old, and at that age it
is not easy to explain one's self so
that older people can understand.
4



<pb n="11"/>
She could only have said "I hate it.
It comes so fast. It is always corn- 
ing. It makes a sound as if thun-
der was quite close. I can never get
away from it." The children in the
other flats rather liked it. They
hung out of the window perilously
to watch it thunder past and to see
the people who crowded it pressed
close together in the seats, standing
in the aisles, hanging on to the
straps. Sometimes in the evening
there were people in it who were
going to the theatre, and the women
and girls were dressed in light col-



<pb n="12"/>
wa w
ours and wore hats covered with
white feathers and flowers. At such
times the children were delighted,
and Judith used to hear the three
in the next flat calling out to each
other, "That's my lady! That's
my lady! That one's mine!"
Judith was not like the children
in the other flats. She was a frail,
curious creature, with silent ways
and a soft voice and eyes. She liked
to play by herself in a corner of the
room and to talk to herself as she
played. No one knew what she
talked about, and in fact no one
6



<pb n="13"/>
inquired. Her mother was always
too busy. When she was not mak-
ing men's coats by the score at the
whizzing sewing machine, she was
hurriedly preparing a meal which
was always in danger of being late.
There was the breakfast, which
might not be ready in time for her
husband to reach his "shop" when
the whistle blew; there was the sup-
per, which might not be in time to
be in waiting for him when he re-
turned in the evening. The midday
meal was a trifling matter, needing
no special preparation. One ate



<pb n="14"/>
anything one could find left from
supper or breakfast.
Judith's relation to her father
I>  ~   and mother was not a very intimate
one. They were too hard worked
to have time for domestic intima-
cies, and a feature of their acquain-
tance was that though neither of
them was sufficiently articulate to
have found expression for the fact
-the young man and woman felt
the child vaguely remote. Their
... affection for her was tinged with
something indefinitely like reve-
rence. She had been a lovely baby
8
Is   -_



<pb n="15"/>
with a peculiar magnolia whiteness
of skin and very large, sweetly
smiling eyes of dark blue, fringed
with quite black lashes. She had
exquisite pointed fingers and slen-
der feet, and though Mr. and Mrs.
Foster were-perhaps fortunately
-unaware of it, she had been not
at all the baby one would have ex-
pected to come to life in a corner of
the hive of a workman's flat a few
feet from the Elevated Railroad.
"Seems sometimes as if some-
how she couldn't be mine," Mrs.
Foster said at times. " She ain't like



<pb n="16"/>
me, an' she ain't like Jem Foster,
Lord knows. She ain't like none
of either of our families I've ever
bL  ~   heard of-'ceptin' it might be her
Aunt Hester-but she died long
before I was born. I've only heard
mother tell about her. She was a
awful pretty girl. Mother said she
had that kind of lily-white com-
plexion and long slender fingers
that was so supple she could curl
'em back like they was double-
jointed. Her eyes was big and had
eyelashes that stood out round 'em,
but they was brown. Mother said
10



<pb n="17"/>
she wasn't like any other kind of
girl, and she thinks Judith may
turn out like her. She wasn't but
fifteen when she died. She never
was ill in her life-but one morn-
ing she didn't come down to break-
fast, and when they went up to call
her, there she was sittin' at her win-
dow restin' her chin on her hand,
with her face turned up smilin' as
if she was talkin' to some one. The
doctor said it had happened hours
before, when she had come to the
window to look at the stars. Easy
way to go, wasn't it ?"



<pb n="18"/>
Judith had heard of her Auni
Hester, but she only knew that she
herself had hands like her and that
her life had ended when she was
quite young. Mrs. Foster was too
much occupied by the strenuous-
ness of life to dwell upon the pass-
ing of souls. To her the girl Hes-
ter seemed too remote to appear
quite real. The legends of her
beauty and unlikeness to other
girls seemed rather like a sort of
romance.
As she was not aware that Judith
hated the Elevated Railroad, so she
12



<pb n="19"/>
was not aware that she was fond of
the far away Aunt Hester with the
long-pointed fingers which could
curl backwards. She did not know
that when she was playing in her
corner of the room, where it was
her way to sit on her little chair
with her face turned towards the
wall, she often sat curving her
small long fingers backward and
talking to herself about Aunt Hes-
ter. But this-as well as many
other things-was true. It was
not secretiveness which caused the
child to refrain from speaking of



<pb n="20"/>
certain things. She herself could
not have explained the reasons for
her silence; also it had never oc-
curred to her that explanation and
)W  ~    reasons were necessary. Her men-
~1 ~     tal attitude was that of a child who,
knowing a certain language, does
not speak it to those who have
never heard and are wholly igno-
rant of it. She knew her Aunt
Hester as her mother did not. She
had seen her often in her dreams
and had a secret fancy that she
could dream of her when she wish-
ed to do so. She was very fond

of dreaming of her. The places
where she came upon Aunt Hester
were strange and lovely places
where the air one breathed smelled
like flowers and everything was
lovely in a new way, and when one
moved one felt so light that move-
ment was delightful, and when one
wakened one had not quite got
over the lightness and for a few
moments felt as if one would float
out of bed.
The healthy, vigourous young
couple who were the child's par-
ents were in a healthy, earthly way



<pb n="23"/>
very fond of each other. They had
made a genuine love match and
had found it satisfactory. The
h            young mechanic Jem Foster had
met the young shop-girl Jane Har-
dy, at Coney Island one summer
night and had become at once
enamoured of her shop-girl good
looks and high spirits. They had
married as soon as Jem had had
the "raise" he was anticipating
and had from that time lived with
much harmony in the flat building
by which the Elevated train rushed
and roared every few  minutes

through the day and a greater part
of the night. They themselves did
not object to the "Elavated"; Jem
was habituated to uproar in the
machine shop, in which he spent
his days, and Jane was too much
absorbed in the making of men's
coats by the dozens to observe any-
thing else. The pair had healthy
appetites and slept well after their
day's work, hearty supper, long
cheerful talk, and loud laughter
over simple common joking.
"She's a queer little fish, Judy,"
Jane said to her husband as they

<pb n="25"/>
«y                              w
sat by the open window one night,
Jem's arm curved comfortably
around the young woman's waist
as he smoked his pipe. "What do
you think she says to me to-night
after I put her to bed ?"
"Search mel" said Jem oracu-
larly.
Jane laughed.
"'Why,' she says, 'I wish the
Elavated train would stop.'
"'Why?' says I.
"'I want to go to sleep,' says she.
'I'm going to dream of Aunt Hes-
ter."'
18



<pb n="26"/>
"What does she know about her 
Aunt Hester," said Jem. "Who's 
been talkin' to her ?"
"Not me," Jane said. "She
don't know nothing but what she's
picked up by chance. I don't be-
lieve in talkin' to young ones about
dead folks. 'Tain't healthy."
" That's right," said Jem. " Chil-
dren that's got to hustle about
among live folks for a livin' best
keep their minds out of cemeteries.
But, Hully Gee, what a queer
thing for a young one to say."
"And that ain't all," Jane went
i A\



<pb n="27"/>
on, her giggle half amused, half
nervous. "'But I don't fall asleep
when I see Aunt Hester,' says she.
'I fall awake. It's more awake
there than here.'
"'Where?' says I, laughing a
bit, though it did make me feel
queer.
"'I don't know,' she says in that
soft little quiet way of hers.
'There.' And not another thing
could I get out of her."
K1       On the hot night through whose
first hours Judith lay panting in her
r>     corner of the room, tormented and
20
_   _



<pb n="28"/>
kept awake by the constant roar
and rush and flash of lights, she was
trying to go to sleep in the hope of
leaving all the heat and noise and
discomfort behind, and reaching
Aunt Hester. If she could fall
awake she would feel and hear
none of it. It would all be unreal
and she would know that only the
lightness and the air like flowers
and the lovely brightness were true.
Once, as she tossed on her cot-bed,
she broke into a low little laugh
to think how untrue things really
were and how strange it was that
all



<pb n="29"/>
people did not understand--that
even she felt as she lay in the dark-
ness that she could not get away.
jL     AAnd she could not get away unless
the train would stop just long
enough to let her fall asleep. If
she could fall asleep between the
trains, she would not awaken. But
they came so quickly one after the
other. Her hair was damp as she
pushed it from her forehead, the
bed felt hot against her skin, the
people in the next flat quarrelled
more angrily, Judith heard a loud
slap, and then the woman began

<pb n="30"/>

to cry. She was a young married
woman, scarcely more than a girl.
Her marriage had not been as suc-
cessful as that of Judith's parents.
Both husband and wife had irri-
table tempers. Through the thin
wall Judith could hear the girl sob-
bing angrily as the man flung him-
self out of bed, put on his clothes
and went out, banging the door
after him.
"She doesn't know," the child
whispered eerily, "that it isn't real
at all."
There was in her strange little
OQ



<pb n="31"/>
soul a secret no one knew the ex-
istence of. It was a vague belief
that she herself was not quite real
|       _--or that she did not belong to the
life she had been born into. Her
mother and father loved her and
she loved them, but sometimes she
was on the brink of telling them
that she could not stay long - that
some mistake had been made.
What mistake--or where was she
to go to if she went, she did not
know. She used   to catch her
Ko       breath and stop herself and feel
>'~  ~  frightened when she had been near

-At Aft,



<pb n="32"/>
speaking of this fantastic thing.
But the building full of workmen's
flats, the hot room, the Elevated
Railroad, the quarrelling people,
were all a mistake. Just once or
twice in her life she had seen places
and things which did not seem so
foreign. Once, when she had been
taken to the Park in the Spring,
she had wandered away from
her mother to a sequestered place
among shrubs and trees, all wav-
ing tender, new pale green, with
the leaves a few early hot days had
caused to rush out and tremble un-
Gat



<pb n="33"/>
furled. There had been a still-
ness there and scents and colours
she knew. A bird had come and
1|p     swung upon a twig quite near her
and, looking at her with bright soft
full eyes, had sung gently to her,
as if he were speaking. A squirrel
had crept up onto her lap and had
not moved when she stroked it. Its
eyes had been full and soft also,
and she knew it understood that
she could not hurt it. There was
no mistake in her being among the
new fair greenness, and the wood-
land things who spoke to her. They
26
~~~~A A



<pb n="34"/>
did not use words, but no words
were needed. She knew what they
were saying. When she had push-
ed her way through the greenness
of the shrubbery to the driveway
she had found herself quite near to
an open carriage, which had stop-
ped because the lady who sat in it
was speaking to a friend on the
path. She was a young woman,
dressed in delicate spring colours,
and the little girl at her side was
dressed in white cloth, and it was at
the little girl Judith found herself
gazing. Under her large white hat
now

and feathers her little face seem-
ed like a white flower. She had
ir  ~    a deep dimple near her mouth.
r/.  ~   Her hair was a rich coppery red
and hung heavy and long about her
cheeks and shoulders. She lifted
her head a little when the child in
the common hat and frock pressed
through the greenness of the bushes
and she looked at Judith just as the
bird and the squirrel had looked at
her. They gazed as if they had
It  ~   known each other for ages of years
and were separated by nothing.
Each of them was quite happy at

<pb n="37"/>

being near the other, and there was
not in the mind of either any ques-
tion of their not being near each
other again. The question did not
rise in Judith's mind even when
in a very few minutes the carriage
moved away and was lost in the
crowd of equipages rolling by.
At the hottest hours of the hot
night Judith recalled to herself
the cool of that day. She brought
back the fresh pale greenness of the
nook among the bushes into which
she had forced her way, the scent
of the leaves and grass which she



<pb n="38"/>
had drawn in as she breathed, the
nearness in the eyes of the bird, the
squirrel, and the child. She smiled
as she thought of these things,
/ and as she continued to remember
yet other things, bit by bit, she felt
less hot--she gradually forgot to
listen for the roar of the train - she
smiled still more--she lay quite
still--she was cool--a tiny fresh
breeze fluttered through the win-
dow and played about her fore-
head. She was smiling in soft de-
light as her eyelids drooped and
closed.

<pb n="39"/>
"I am falling awake," she was
murmuring as her lashes touched
her cheek.
Perhaps when her eyes closed
the sultriness of the night had
changed to the momentary fresh-
ness of the turning dawn, and the
next hour or so was really cooler.
She knew no more heat but slept
softly, deeply, long-or it seemed
to her afterwards that she had
slept long - as if she had drifted far
away in dreamless peace.
She remembered no dream, saw
nothing, felt nothing until, as it



<pb n="40"/>
seemed to her, in the early morn-
ing, she opened her eyes. All was
^          quite still and clear- the air of the
V's         room was pure and sweet. There
was no sound anywhere and, curi-
ously enough, she was not sur-
prised by this, nor did she expect
to hear anything disturbing.
She did not look round the room.
Her eyes remained resting upon
what she first saw--and she was
not surprised by this either. A
t\   ~   little girl about her own age was
standing smiling at her. She had
large eyes, a deep dimple near her

mouth, and coppery red hair which
fell about her cheeks and shoulders. 
Judith knew her and smiled back
at her.
She lifted her hand - and it was
a pure white little hand with long
tapering fingers.
"Come and play with me," she
said-though Judith heard no voice
while she knew what she was say-
ing. "Come and play with me."
Then she was gone, and in a few
seconds Judith was awake, the air
of the room had changed, the noise
and clatter of the streets came in



<pb n="42"/>
at the window, and the Elevated
train went thundering by. Judith
did not ask herself how the child
r  ~   had gone or how she had come.
rz  ~   She lay still, feeling undisturbed by
everything and smiling as she had
smiled in her sleep.
While she sat at the breakfast
table she saw her mother looking
at her curiously.
"You look as if you'd slept cool
instead of hot last night," she said.
a       " I"You look better than you did yes-

Judith's smile meant that she
was quite well, but she said noth-
ing about her sleeping.
The heat did not disturb her
through the day, though the hours
grew hotter and hotter as they
passed. Jane Foster, sweltering
at her machine, was obliged to
stop every few minutes to wipe the
beads from her face and neck.
Sometimes she could not remain
seated, but got up panting to drink
water and fan herself with a news-
paper.
"I can't stand much more of



<pb n="45"/>
this," she kept saying. "If there
don't come a thunderstorm to cool
things off I don't know what I'll
i"    ddo. This room's about five hun-
/          dred."
But the heat grew greater and
the Elevated trains went thunder-
ing by.
When Jem came home from his
work his supper was not ready.
Jane was sitting helplessly by the
window, almost livid in her pallor.
The table was but half spread.
"Hullo," said Jem; "it's done
you up, ain't it?"
/jz~~ ~36



<pb n="46"/>
"Well, I guess it has," good-
naturedly, certain of his sympathy.
"But I'll get over it presently, and
then I can get you a cold bite. I
can't stand over the stove and
cook."
"Hully Gee, a cold bite's all a
man wants on a night like this.
Hot chops'd give him the jim-
jams. But I've got good news for
you -it's cheered me up myself."
Jane lifted her head from the
chair back.
"What is it?"
"Well, it came through my boss.



<pb n="47"/>
U                               V
He's always been friendly to me.
He asks a question or so every now
and then and seems to take an in-
o  ~   terest. To-day he was asking me
if it wasn't pretty hot and noisy
down here, and after I told him
how we stood it, he said he believed
he could get us a better place to
stay in through the summer. Some
one he knows has had illness and
trouble in his family and he's
obliged to close his house and take
K4     his wife away into the mountains.
They've got a beautiful big house
in one of them far up streets by the
I.R

Park and he wants to get care- 
takers in that can come well recom- i
mended. The boss said he could
recommend us fast enough. And
there's a big light basement that'll
be as cool as the woods. And we
can move in to-morrow. And all
we've got to do is to see that things
are safe and live happy."
"Oh, Jem!" Jane ejaculated.
"It sounds too good to be true!
Up by the Park! A big cool place
to live!"
"We've none of us ever been in
a house the size of it. You know

I thought the basement would
seem like the Waldorf-Astoria to
us. I tell you I was so glad I
scarcely knew what to say."
Jane drew a long breath.
"A big house up there," she said.
'Al



<pb n="50"/>
"And only one closed room in it.
It's too good to be true!"
"Well, whether it's true or not
we'll move out there to-morrow,"
Jem answered cheerfully. "To-
morrow morning bright and early.
The boss said the sooner the bet-
ter."
A large house left deserted by
those who have filled its rooms
with emotions and life, express-
es a silence, a quality all its own.
A house unfurnished and empty
seems less impressively silent. The
41



<pb n="51"/>
fact of its devoidness of sound is
upon the whole more natural. But
carpets accustomed to the pressure
/J  ~    of constantly passing feet, chairs
/r           and sofas which have held human
warmth, draperies used to the
touch of hands drawing them aside
to let in daylight, pictures which
have smiled back at thinking eyes,
mirrors which have reflected faces
passing hourly in changing moods,
elate or dark or longing, walls
which have echoed back voices-
all these things when left alone
seem to be held in strange arrest,
A.O



<pb n="52"/>
as if by some spell intensifying the
effect of the pause in their exist-
ence. 
The child Judith felt this deep- 
ly throughout the entirety of her 
young being.
"How still it is," she said to her
mother the first time they went
over the place together.
"Well, it seems still up here-
and kind of dead," Jane Foster re-
plied with her habitual sociable
half-laugh. "But seems to me it
always feels that way in a house 
people's left. It's cheerful enough

down in that big basement with all
the windows open. We can sit in
that room they've had fixed to play
hi         billiards in. We shan't hurt noth-
J-   ~   ing. We can keep the table and
things covered up. Tell you, Judy,
this'll be different from last sum-
mer. The Park ain't but a few steps
away an' we can go and sit there
too when we feel like it. Talk about
the country - I don't want no more
country than this is. You'll be made
over the months we stay here."
Judith felt as if this must veri-
tably be a truth. The houses on
44



<pb n="54"/>
either side of the street were closed
for the summer. Their occupants
had gone to the seaside or the
mountains and the windows and
doors were boarded up. The street
was a quiet one at any time, and 
wore now the aspect of a street in 
a city of the dead. The green trees
of the Park were to be seen either
gently stirring or motionless in the
sun at the side of the avenue cross-
ing the end of it. The only token of
the existence of the Elevated Rail-
road was a remote occasional hum 
suggestive of the flying past of a



<pb n="55"/>
giant bee. The thing seemed no
longer a roaring demon, and Jud-
ith scarcely recognized that it was
er  ~   ,,still the centre of the city's rush-
/?         ing, heated life.
The owners of the house had
evidently deserted it suddenly. The
windows had not been boarded up
and the rooms had been left in
their ordinary condition. The fur-
niture was not covered or the
hangings swathed. Jem Foster had
been told that his wife must put
things in order.
\    ~The house was beautiful and
yj ~             46



<pb n="56"/>
spacious, its decorations and ap-
pointments were not mere testi-
monies to freedom of expenditure,
but expressions of a dignified and
cultivated thought. Judith follow- 
ed her mother from room to room
in one of her singular moods. The
loftiness of the walls, the breadth
and space about her made her, at
intervals, draw in her breath with
pleasure. The pictures, the colours,
the rich and beautiful textures she
saw brought to her the free- and at
the same time soothed- feeling she
remembered as the chief feature 
:~~k



<pb n="57"/>
of the dreams in which she "fell
awake." But beyond all other
things she rejoiced in the height
and space, the sweep of view
through one large room into an-
other. She continually paused and
stood with her face lifted looking
up at the pictured things floating
on a ceiling above her. Once,
when she had stood doing this long
enough to forget herself, she was
startled by her mother's laugh,
which broke in upon the silence
^\        about them with a curiously earth-
ly sound which was almost a shock.
48



<pb n="58"/>
"Wake up, Judy; have you gone
off in a dream? You look all the    f
time as if you was walking in your 
sleep." 
"It's so high," said Judy. 
"Those clouds make it look like 
the sky." 
"I've got to set these chairs
straight," said Jane. "Looks like
they'd been havin' a concert here.
All these chairs together an' that
part of the room clear."
She began to move the chairs
and rearrange them, bustling about 
cheerfully and talking the while.   j



<pb n="59"/>
Presently she stooped to pick some-
thing up.
"What's this," she said, and
then uttered a startled exclamation.
"Mercy! they felt so kind of clam-
my they made me jump. They have
had a party. Here's some of the
flowers left fallen on the carpet."
She held up a cluster of wax-
white hyacinths and large heavy
rosebuds, faded to discoloration.
"This has dropped out of some
set piece. It felt like cold flesh when
*4\  ~ I first touched it. I don't like a lot
XY    of white things together. They look
50



<pb n="60"/>
too kind of mournful. Just go and
get the wastepaper basket in the 
library, Judy. We'll carry it around 
to drop things into. Take that with
you."
Judith carried the flowers into 
the library and bent to pick up the
basket as she dropped them into it.
As she raised her head she found
her eyes looking directly into other
eyes which gazed at her from the
wall. They were smiling from the
face of a child in a picture. As soon
as she saw them Judith drew in her
breath and stood still, smiling, too,

in response. The picture was that
of a little girl in a floating white
ffrock. She had a deep dimple at one
s0  ~  corner of her mouth, her hanging
hair was like burnished copper, she
held up a slender hand with point-
ed fingers and Judith knew her.
Oh! she knew her quite well. She
had never felt so near any one else
throughout her life.
"Judy, Judy!" Jane Foster call-
ed out. "Come here with your
basket; what you staying for?"
'\         Judith returned to her.

IN THE CLOSED ROOM
said Jane, "or we sha'n't get noth-
in' done before supper time. What    e:
was you lookin' at?" 
"There's a picture in there of a 
little girl I know," Judith said. "I  ^
don't know her name, but I saw
her in the Park once and--and I
dreamed about her."
"Dreamed about her? If that
ain't queer. Well, we've got to hur-
ry up. Here's some more of them
dropped flowers. Give me the bas-
ket."
They went through the whole
house together, from room to room,  '



<pb n="63"/>
V                                - m
up the many stairs, from floor to
floor, and everywhere Judith felt
iP  ~   the curious stillness and silence.
It can not be doubted that Jane
Foster felt it also.
"It is the stillest house I was
ever in," she said. "I'm glad I've
got you with me, Judy. If I was sole
alone I believe it 'ud give me the
creeps. These big places ought to
have big families in them."
It was on the fourth floor that
they came upon the Closed Room.
Jane had found some of the doors
shut and some open, but a turn of
} i~~~.54



<pb n="64"/>
the handle gave entrance through
all the unopened ones until they
reached this one at the back on the 
fourth floor.
"This one won't open," Jane
said, when she tried the handle.
Then she shook it once or twice.
"No, it's locked," she decided
after an effort or two. "There, I've
just remembered. There's one kept
locked. Folks always has things
they want locked up. I'll make
sure, though."
She shook it, turned the handle,
shook again, pressed her knee



<pb n="65"/>
against the panel. The lock resist-
ed all effort.
"Yes, this is the closed one," she
made up her mind. "It's locked
hard and fast. It's the closed one."
It was logically proved to be the
closed one by the fact that she
found no other one locked as she
finished her round of the chambers.
Judith was a little tired before
they had done their work. But her
wandering pilgrimage through the
large, silent, deserted house had
I^  ~been a revelation of new emotions to
Eb  ~  her. She was always a silent child.
'5             _        56



<pb n="66"/>
Her mind was so full of strange
thoughts that it seemed unneces-
sary to say many words. The things
she thought as she followed her
from room to room, from floor to 
floor, until they reached the locked
door, would have amazed and puz- 
zled Jane Foster if she had known
of their existence. Most of all, per-
haps, she would have been puzzled
by the effect the closed door had
upon the child. It puzzled and be-
wildered Judith herself and made
her feel a little weary.
She wanted so much to go into



<pb n="67"/>
the room. Without in the least un-
derstanding the feeling, she was
quite shaken by it. It seemed as if
the closing of all the other rooms
would have been a small matter in
comparison with the closing of this
one. There was something inside
which she wanted to see -there was
something-somehow there was
something which wanted to see
her. What a pity that the door was
locked! Why had it been done?
She sighed unconsciously several
iq  ~   times during the evening, and Jane
^c  ~  Foster thought she was tired.
58



<pb n="68"/>
"But you'll sleep cool enough
to-night, Judy," she said. "And
get a good rest. Them little breezes
that comes rustling through the
trees in the Park comes right along
the street to us."                       4
She and Jem Foster slept well.
They spent the evening in the
highest spirits and-as it seemed
to them - the most luxurious com-
fort. The space afforded them by
the big basement, with its kitch-
en and laundry and pantry, and,
above all, the specially large room
which had been used for billiard



<pb n="69"/>
U                    -
playing, supplied actual vistas. For
the sake of convenience and cool-
ness they used the billiard room as
a dormitory, sleeping on light cots,
and they slept with all their win-
dows open, the little breezes wan-
dering from among the trees of the
Park to fan them. How they laugh-
ed and enjoyed themselves over
their supper, and how they stretch-
ed themselves out with sighs of joy
in the darkness as they sank into
K^     ethe cool, untroubled waters of deep
sleep.
"This is about the top notch,"

Jem murmured as he lost his hold
on the world of waking life and
work.
But though she was cool, though
she was undisturbed, though her
body rested in absolute repose, 
Judith did not sleep for a long time.
She lay and listened to the quiet-
ness. There was mystery in it. The
footstep of a belated passer-by in
the street woke strange echoes, a
voice heard in the distance in
a riotous shout suggested weird
things. And as she lay and listen-
ed, it was as if she were not only



<pb n="71"/>
listening but waiting for some-
thing. She did not know at all what
she was waiting for, but waiting
she was.
She lay upon her cot with her
arms flung out and her eyes wide
open. What was it that she wanted
--that which was in the closed
room? Why had they locked the
door ? If they had locked the doors
of the big parlours it would not have
mattered. If they had locked the
door of the library--Her mind
paused - as if for a moment, some-
thing held it still. Then she remem-

bered that to have locked the doors
of the library would have been to
lock in the picture of the child with
the greeting look in her eyes and
the fine little uplifted hand. She
was glad the room had been left
open. But the room up-stairs - the
one on the fourth floor-that was
the one that mattered most of all.
She knew that to-morrow she must
go and stand at the door and press
her cheek against the wood and
wait--and listen. Thinking this
and knowing that it must be so,
she fell - at last - asleep.

PART TWO
DITH   climbed
\   J fr   the basement
stairs rather slow-
f     ly. Her mother was
busy rearranging the disorder the
hastily departing servants had left.
Their departure had indeed been
made in sufficient haste to have
left behind the air of its having
been flight. There was a great deal
to be done, and Jane Foster, mov-
ing about with broom and pail and
scrubbing brushes, did not dislike



<pb n="75"/>
the excitement of the work before
her. Judith's certainty that she
would not be missed made all clear
before her. If her absence was
observed her mother would real-
ize that the whole house lay open
to her and that she was an undis-
turbing element wheresoever she
was led either by her fancy or
by circumstance. If she went into
the parlours she would probably
sit and talk to herself or play
quietly with her shabby doll. In
any case she would be finding
pleasure of her own and would
66



<pb n="76"/>
touch nothing which could be
harmed.
When the child found herself in
the entrance hall she stopped a few
moments to look about her. The 
stillness seemed to hold her and she  If
paused to hear and feel it. In leav- 
ing the basement behind, she had     4
left the movement of living behind
also. No one was alive upon this
floor-nor upon the next-nor the
next. It was as if one had entered
a new world -a world in which
something existed which did not
express itself in sound or in things

touched the wall as she went, she
felt the height of the wall as she
looked upward. It was such a large
house and so empty. Where had       j
the people gone and why had they   F
left it all at once as if they were
afraid ? Her father had only heard 
vaguely that they had gone because 
they had had trouble.
She passed the second floor, the
third, and climbed towards the
fourth. She could see the door of
the Closed Room as she went up
step by step, and she found herself
moving more quickly. Yes, she
69



<pb n="80"/>
must get to it -she must put her
hand on it-her chest began to rise
and fall with a quickening of her
breath, and her breath quickened
because her heart fluttered -as if
with her haste. She began to be glad,
and if any one could have seen her
they would have been struck by a
curious expectant smile in her eyes.
She reached the landing and
crossed it, running the last few steps
lightly. She did not wait or stand
still a moment. With the strange
r  J  expectant smile on her lips as well
as in her eyes, she put her hand up-
$;~?~



<pb n="81"/>
on the door - not upon the handle,
but upon the panel. Without any
sound it swung quietly open. And
without any sound she stepped
quietly inside. 
The room was rather large and
the light in it was dim. There were
no shutters, but the blinds were
drawn down. Judith went to one of
the windows and drew its blind up
so that the look of the place might
be clear to her. There were two
windows and they opened upon the
flat roof of an extension, which
suggested somehow that it had

<pb n="82"/>
--_'                         ' -  ~L
been used as a place to walk about
in. This, at least, was what Judith
thought of at once - that some one
who had used the room had been
in the habit of going out upon the
roof and staying there as if it had
been a sort of garden. There were
rows of flower pots with dead flow-
ers in them - there were green tubs
containing large shrubs, which
were dead also- against the low

ing plants which had been trained

Involuntarily she lifted her face to
the blue sky and floating white
clouds. They seemed so near that
she felt almost as if she could touch
them with her hand. The street
seemed so far - so far below - the
whole world seemed far below. If
one stepped off the parapet it would
surely take one a long time to
reach the earth. She knew now why
she had come up here. It was so
that she might feel like this-as
if she was upheld far away from
things-as if she had left every-
thing behind - almost as if she had

fallen awake again. There was no
perfume in the air, but all was
still and sweet and clear.              ?f
Suddenly she turned and went
into the room again, realizing that
she had scarcely seen it at all and 
that she must see and know it. It
was not like any other room she 
had seen. It looked more simple,
though it was a pretty place. The
walls were covered with roses,
there were bright pictures, and
shelves full of books. There was
also a little writing desk and there
were two or three low chairs, and a
75

<pb n="87"/>
low table. A closet in a corner had
its door ajar and Judith could see
that inside toys were piled together.
In another corer a large doll's
house stood, looking as if some one
had just stopped playing with it.
Some toy furniture had been taken
out and left near it upon the car-
pet.
"It was a little girl's room,"
Judith said. "Why did they close
it?"
b :-     Her eye was caught by some-
?~i~   thing lying on a sofa -something
covered with a cloth. It looked al-
As.*^^~~~~~~fl AR



<pb n="88"/>
most like a child lying there asleep
- so fast asleep that it did not stir
at all. Judith moved across to the
sofa and drew the cloth aside. With 
its head upon a cushion was lying
there a very large doll, beautiful-      :
ly dressed in white lace, its eyes
closed, and a little wreath of dead 
flowers in its hair.
" It looks almost as if it had died
too," said Judith.
She did not ask herself why she
said "as if it had died too" - per-
haps it was because the place was
so still-and everything so far

away-that the flowers had died in
it        ethe strange, little deserted garden
on the roof.
She did not hear any footsteps-
in fact, no ghost of a sound stirred
the silence as she stood looking at
the doll's sleep-but quite quickly
she ceased to bend forward, and
turned round to look at something
which she knew was near her.
There she was - and it was quite
Hat     natural she should be there  the
little girl with the face like a white
~'~Z    flower, with the quantity of bur-
nished coppery hair and the smile

<pb n="90"/>
which deepened the already deep
dimple near her mouth.
"You have come to play with
me," she said.
"Yes," answered Judith. "I
wanted to come all night. I could
not stay down-stairs."
"No," said the child; "you can't
stay down-stairs. Lift up the doll."
They began to play as if they
had spent their lives together.
Neither asked the other any ques-
tions. Judith had not played with
other children, but with this one
she played in absolute and lovely
79



<pb n="91"/>
delight. The little girl knew where
all the toys were, and there were
a great many beautiful ones. She
told Judith where to find them
and how to arrange them for their
games. She invented wonderful
things to do-things which were
so unlike anything Judith had ever
seen or heard or thought of that it
was not strange that she realized
afterwards that all her past life and
its belongings had been so forgot-
ten as to be wholly blotted out while
she was in the Closed Room. She
did not know her playmate's name,
.j    :?f              /^



<pb n="92"/>
she did not remember that there
were such things as names. Every
moment was happiness. Every mo-
ment the little girl seemed to grow
more beautiful in the flower white-
ness of her face and hands and 
the strange lightness and freedom
of her movements. There was an 
ecstasy in looking at her-in feel-
ing her near.
Not long before Judith went
down-stairs she found herself
standing with her outside the win-
dow in among the withered flow-
ers.

"It was my garden," the little
girl said. "It has been so hot and
no one has been near to water
them, so they could not live."
She went lightly to one of the
brown rose-bushes and put her
pointed-fingered little hand quite
near it. She did not touch it, but
held her hand near-and the leaves
began to stir and uncurl and be-

roses were nodding, blooming on

plant in turn until all the before

dreary little garden was bright and
full of leaves and flowers.
"It's Life," she said to Judith.
Judith nodded and smiled back at 
her, understanding quite well just as
she had understood the eyes of the
bird who had swung on the twig so
near her cheek the day she had hid-
den among the bushes in the Park.
"Now, you must go," the little
girl said at last. And Judith went
out of the room at once -without
waiting or looking back, though
she knew the white figure did not
stir till she was out of sight.

Closed Room became as far away

was happy-as happy as when she
had fallen awake in her sleep-and
was no more troubled or really
curious than she would have been
if she had had the same experience
every day of her life.
9        " I"Well, you must have been hav-
ing a good time playing up-stairs,"
Jane Foster said when she entered
the big kitchen. "This is going to
do you good, Judy. Looks like
Qe

she'd had a day in the country,
don't she, Jem?"
Through the weeks that followed
her habit of "playing up-stairs"
was accepted as a perfectly natural
thing. No questions were asked
and she knew it was not necessary 
to enter into any explanations. 
Every day she went to the door
of the Closed Room and, finding it
closed, at a touch of her hand upon
the panel it swung softly open.
There she waited--sometimes for
a longer sometimes for a shorter
time-and the child with the cop-
87



<pb n="99"/>
pery hair came to her. The world
below was gone as soon as she en-
tered the room, and through the
hours they played together joy-
ously as happy children play. But
in their playing it was always Ju-
dith who touched the toys-who
held the doll  who set the little
table for their feast. Once as she
went down-stairs she remembered
19  ~  that whshn she had that day made
a wreath of roses from the roof and
~J    had gone to put it on her play-
mate's head, she had drawn back
with deepened dimple and, holding
Aft



<pb n="100"/>
up her hand, had said, laughing:
"No. Do not touch me."
But there was no mystery in it
after all. Judith knew she should
presently understand.
She was so happy that her hap-
piness lived in her face in a sort of
delicate brilliance. Jane Foster ob- 
served the change in her with ex-
ceeding comfort, her view being
that spacious quarters, fresh air,
and sounder sleep had done great
things for her.
"Them big eyes of hers ain't
like no other child's eyes I've ever
89
,,ed, Olh



<pb n="101"/>
seen," she said to her husband with
cheerful self-gratulation. "An' her
skin's that fine an' thin an' fair
you can jest see through it. She
always looks to me as if she was
made out of different stuff from me
an' you, Jem. I've always said it."
"She's going to make a corking
handsome girl," responded Jem
with a chuckle.
They had been in the house two
months, when one afternoon, as
she was slicing potatoes for supper,
Jane looked round to see the child
standing at the kitchen doorway,
90



<pb n="102"/>
looking with a puzzled expression
at some wilted flowers she held in
her hand. Jane's impression was
that she had been coming into the
room and had stopped suddenly to
look at what she held.
"What've you got there, Judy ?"
she asked. 
"They're flowers," said Judith,
her eyes still more puzzled.
"Where'd you get 'em from? I
didn't know you'd been out. I
thought you was up-stairs."
"I was," said Judith quite sim-
ply. "In the Closed Room."
91
109,41



<pb n="103"/>
9-          - 
Jane Foster's knife dropped into
her pan with a splash.
"Well," she gasped.
Judith looked at her with quiet
eyes.
"The Closed Room!" Jane cried
out. "What are you saying? You
couldn't get in?"
"Yes, I can."
Jane was conscious of experienc-
ing a shock. She said afterwards
that suddenly something gave her
the creeps.
"You couldn't open the door,"
she persisted. "I tried it again yes-



<pb n="104"/>
terday as I passed by-turned the
handle and gave it a regular shove
and it wouldn't give an inch." 
"Yes," the child answered; "I
heard you. We were inside then." 
A few days later, when Jane
weepingly related the incident to
awe-stricken  and  sympathizing     L
friends, she described as graphi-
cally as her limited vocabulary
would allow her to do so, the look
in Judith's face as she came nearer
to her.
"Don't tell me there was noth-
ing happening then," she said.
93
'CS ,«^



<pb n="105"/>
"She just came up to me with them
dead flowers in her hand an' a kind
of look in her eyes as if she was
half sorry for me an' didn't know
quite why.
"'The door opens for me,' she
says. 'That's where I play every
day. There's a little girl comes and
plays with me. She comes in at the
window, I think. She is like the pic-
ture in the room where the books
are. Her hair hangs down and she
has a dimple near her mouth.'
"I couldn't never tell any one
what I felt like. It waRs a if I'd ant



<pb n="106"/>
a queer fright that I didn't under-
stand.
"' She must have come over the
roof from the next house,' I says.
'They've got an extension too-but
I thought the people were gone
away.'
"'There are flowers on our
roof,' she said. 'I got these there.'
And that puzzled look came into her
eyes again. 'They were beautiful
when I got them - but as I came
down-stairs they died.'
"'Well, of all the queer things,'
I said. She put out her hand and
95
,,o    POq       'A



<pb n="107"/>
touched my arm sort of lovin' an'
timid.
"'I wanted to tell you to-day,
mother,' she said. 'I had to tell
you to-day. You don't mind if I go
play with her, do you ? You don't
mind ?'
"Perhaps it was because she
touched me that queer little loving
way - or was it the way she looked
- it seemed like something came
over me an' I just grabbed her an'
hugged her up.
"' No,' I says. 'So as you come
back. So as you come back.'



<pb n="108"/>
" And to think!" And Jane rock-
ed herself sobbing.
A point she dwelt on with many
tears was that the child seemed in 
a wistful mood and remained near
her side - bringing her little chair
and sitting by her as she worked,
and rising to follow her from place 
to place as she moved from one
room to the other.
" She wasn't never one as kissed
you much or hung about like some
children do -I always used to say
she was the least bother of any
child I ever knew. Seemed as if she
97
.c, a0O4h        _l



<pb n="109"/>
had company of her own when
she sat in her little chair in the cor-
ner whispering to herself or just
setting quiet." This was a thing
Jane always added during all the
years in which she told the story.
"That was what made me notice.
She kept by me and she kept look-
ing at me different rom any way
I'd seen her look before -not pit-
iful exactly-but something like
it. And once she came up and
kissed me and once or twice she
just kind of touched my dress or
my hand -as I stood bv her. She



<pb n="110"/>
knew. No one need tell me she
didn't."
But this was an error. The child
was conscious only of a tender,
wistful feeling, which caused her
to look at the affectionate healthy
young woman who had always
been good to her and whom she
belonged to, though she remotely
wondered why--the same tender-
ness impelled her to touch her arm,
hand and simple dress, and folding
her arms round her neck to kiss her
softly. It was an expression of
gratitude for all the rough casual
99
vOA^%



<pb n="111"/>
affection of the past. All her life
had been spent at her side - all her
life on earth had sprung from her.
When she went up-stairs to the
Closed Room the next day she told
her mother she was going before
she left the kitchen.
"I'm going up to play with the
little girl, mother," she said. "You
don't mind, do you ?"
Jane had had an evening of com-
fortable domestic gossip and joking
with Jem, had slept, slept soundly
and eaten a hearty breakfast. Life
had reassumed its wholly normal



<pb n="112"/>
/w   I



<pb n="113"/>
aspect. The sun was shining hot
and bright and she was preparing
to scrub the kitchen floor. She
believed that the child was mis-
taken as to the room she had been
in.
"That's all right," she said,
turning the hot water spigot over
the sink so that the boiling water
poured forth at full flow into her
pail, with clouds of steam. "But
when I've done my scrubbing I'm
comin' up to see if it is the Closed
Room you play in. If it is, I guess
you'd better play somewhere else -
101
'als, Aqh



<pb n="114"/>
and I want to find out how you get
that door open. Run along if you
like."
Judith came back to her from
the door. "Yes," she said, "come
and see. But if she is there," put-
ting her hand on Jane's hip gently,
"you mustn't touch her."
Jane turned off the hot water
and stared.
"Her!"
"The little girl who plays. I never
touch her. She says I must not."
Jane lifted her pail from the sink,
laughing outright.



<pb n="115"/>
"Well, that sounds as if she was
a pretty airy young one," she said.
"I guess you're a queer little pair.
Run on. I must get at this floor."
Judith ran up the three flights of
stairs lightly. She was glad she had
told her mother, though she won-
dered vaguely why it had never
seemed right to tell her until last
night, and last night it had seemed
not so much necessary as impera-
tive. Something had obliged her to
tell her. The time had come when
she must know. The Closed Room
door had always shut itself gently
103
f^»^«^~



<pb n="116"/>
after Judith had passed through it,
and yesterday, when her mother
passing by chance, had tried the
handle so vigorously, the two chil-
dren inside the room had stood still
gazing at each other, but neither
had spoken and Judith had not
thought of speaking. She was out
of the realm of speech, and without
any sense of amazement was aware
that she was out of it. People with
voices and words were in that far-
away world below.
The playing to-day was even a
lovelier, happier thing than it had



<pb n="117"/>
ever been before. It seemed to be-
come each minute a thing farther
and farther away from the world
in the streets where the Elevated
Railroad went humming past like
a monster bee. And with the sense
of greater distance came a sense
of greater lightness and freedom.
Judith found that she was moving
about the room and the little roof
garden almost exactly as she had
moved in the waking dreams where
she saw Aunt Hester - almost as if
she was floating and every move-
ment was ecstasy. Once as she
105



<pb n="118"/>
w
thought this she looked at her play-
mate, and the child smiled and
answered her as she always did be-
fore she spoke.
"Yes," she said; "I know her.
She will come. She sent me."
She had this day a special plan
with regard to the arranging of the
Closed Room. She wanted all the
things in it-the doll-the chairs
the toys-the little table and its ser-
vice to be placed in certain posi-
tions. She told Judith what to do.
Various toys were put here or
there-the little table was apt with



<pb n="119"/>
certain dishes in a particular part
of the room. A book was left lying
upon the sofa cushion, the large
doll was put into a chair near the
sofa, with a smaller doll in its arms,
on the small writing desk a letter,
which Judith found in a drawer -
a half-written letter - was laid, the
pen was left in the ink. It was a
strange game to play, but some-
how Judith felt it was very pretty.
When it was all done -and there
were many curious things to do -
the Closed Room looked quite dif-
ferent from the cold, dim, orderly
107 



<pb n="120"/>
place the door had first opened
upon. Then it had looked as if
everything had been swept up and
set away and covered and done
with forever-as if the life in it had
ended and would never begin again.
Now it looked as if some child who
had lived in it and loved and played
with each of its belongings, had just
stepped out from her play-to some
other room quite near-quite near.
The big doll in its chair seemed
waiting-even listening to her voice
as it came from the room she had
run into.



<pb n="121"/>

The child with the burnished
hair stood and looked at it with
her delicious smile.
"That is how it looked," she
said. "They came and hid and
covered everything-as if I had
gone-as if I was Nowhere. I want
her to know I come here. I couldn't
do it myself. You could do it for 
me. Go and bring some roses."
The little garden was a wonder
of strange beauty with its masses of
flowers. Judith brought some roses
from the bush her playmate pointed 
out. She put them into a light 
109                'S



<pb n="122"/>
bowl which was like a bubble of
thin, clear glass and stood on the
desk near the letter.
"If they would look like that,"
the little girl said, "she would see.
But no one sees them like that
when the Life goes away with me."
After that the game was finished
and they went out on the roof gar-
den and stood and looked up into
the blue above their heads. How
blue-how blue-how clear-how
near and real! And how far and un-
real the streets and sounds below.
The two children stood and looked



<pb n="123"/>
Asj IN THE CLOSED ROOM |'
up and laughed at the sweetness
of it.
Then Judith felt a little tired.
"I will go and lie down on the
sofa," she said.
"Yes," the little girl answered. 
"It's time for you to go to sleep."
They went into the Closed Room    '
and Judith lay down. As she did
so, she saw that the door was stand-
ing open and remembered that her
mother was coming up to see her
and her playmate.
The little girl sat down by her. 
She put out her pretty fine hand
111                  /



<pb n="124"/>
and touched Judith for the first
time. She laid her little pointed
fingers on her forehead and Judith
fell asleep.
It seemed only a few minutes
before she wakened again. The
little girl was standing by her.
"Come," she said.
They went out together onto
the roof among the flowers, but a
strange - a beautiful thing had hap-
pened. The garden did not end at
the parapet and the streets and
houses were not below. The little



<pb n="125"/>
,__ -^-  f *  * n r* t X Lu  i I H UU M K   _^y
garden ended in a broad green
pathway-green with thick, soft
grass and moss covered with
trembling white and blue bell-like
flowers. Trees -fresh leaved as if
spring had just awakened them -
shaded it and made it look smiling
fair. Great white blossoms tossed 
on their branches and Judith felt
that the scent in the air came from
them. She forgot the city was be-
low, because it was millions and
millions of miles away, and this
was where it was right to be. There
was no mistake. This was real. All 
113 



<pb n="126"/>
*        --                    U
the rest was unreal - and millions
and millions of miles away.
They held each other's slim-
pointed hands and stepped out up-
on the broad, fresh green pathway.
There was no boundary or end to
its beauty, and it was only another
real thing that coming towards
them from under the white, flower-
ing trees was Aunt Hester.
In the basement Jane Foster was
absorbed in her labours, which were
things whose accustomedness pro-
vided her with pleasure. She was



<pb n="127"/>
^_    ~ IN T E 1 L S E UED R O M 1Ad
fond of her scrubbing, she enjoyed
the washing of her dishes, she defi-
nitely entertained herself with the
splash and soapy foam of her wash-
tubs and the hearty smack and
swing of her ironing. In the days
when she had served at the ribbon
counter in a department store, she 
had not found life as agreeable as
she had found it since the hours
which were not spent at her own
private sewing machine were given
to hearty domestic duties provid-
ing cleanliness, savoury meals, and
comfort for Jem.

<pb n="128"/>
W                -  ::  
She was so busy this particular
afternoon that it was inevitable
that she should forget all else but
the work which kept her on her
knees scrubbing floors or on a
chair polishing windows, and after-
wards hanging before them bits of
clean, spotted muslin.
She was doing this last when her
attention being attracted by wheels
in the street stopping before the
door, she looked out to see a
carriage door open and a young
woman, dressed in exceptionally
deep mourning garb, step onto



<pb n="129"/>
the pavement, cross it, and ascend
the front steps.
"Who's she?" Jane exclaimed
disturbedly. "Does she think the
house is to let because it's shut?" 
A ring at the front door bell called 
her down from her chair. Among 
the duties of a caretaker is natu-
rally included that of answering the
questions of visitors. She turned
down her sleeves, put on a fresh
apron, and ran up-stairs to the en-
trance hall.
When she opened the door, the 
tall, young woman in black stepped
117 



<pb n="130"/>
inside as if there were no reason
for her remaining even for a mo-
ment on the threshold.
"I am Mrs. Haldon," she said.
"I suppose you are the caretaker ?"
Haldon was the name of the
people to whom the house be-
longed. Jem Foster had heard only
the vaguest things of them, but
Jane remembered that the name
was Haldon, and remembering
that they had gone away because
they had had trouble, she recog-
nized at a glance what sort of
trouble it had been. Mrs. Haldon



<pb n="131"/>
- -L._-- ...-.
was tall and young, and to Jane
Foster's mind, expressed from head
to foot the perfection of all that
spoke for wealth and fashion.
Her garments were heavy and rich
with crape, the long black veil,
which she had thrown back, swept
over her shoulder and hung behind 
her, serving to set forth, as it were,
more pitifully the white wornness
of her pretty face, and a sort of
haunting eagerness in her haggard
eyes. She had been a smart, lovely,
laughing and lovable thing, full of
pleasure in the world, and now she
119



<pb n="132"/>
9                 -              w
was so stricken and devastated that
she seemed set apart in an awful
lonely world of her own.
She had no sooner crossed the
threshold than she looked about
her with a quick, smitten glance
and began to tremble. Jane saw her
look shudder away from the open
door of the front room, where the
chairs had seemed left as if set for
some gathering, and the wax-white
flowers had been scattered on the
floor.
She fell into one of the carved
hall seats and dropped her face in-



<pb n="133"/>
to her hands, her elbows resting on
her knees.
"Oh! No! No!" she cried. "I
can't believe it. I can't believe
it!"
Jane Foster's eyes filled with
good-natured ready tears of sym-
pathy.               %
"Won't you   come up-stairs,
ma'am ?" she said. " Wouldn't you
like to set in your own room per-
haps?"
"No! No!" was the answer.
"She was always there! She used
to come into my bed in the morn-

ing. She used to watch me dress to
go out. No! No!"
"I'll open the shutters in the
library," said Jane.
"Oh! No! No! No! She would
be sitting on the big sofa with her
fairy story-book. She's everywhere
-everywhere! How could I come!
Why did I! But I couldn't keep
away! I tried to stay in the moun-
tains. But I couldn't. Something
dragged me day and night. Nobody
knows I am here!" She got up and
looked about her again. "I have
never been in here since I went out



<pb n="135"/>
f      IN THE CLOSED ROOM _  . i
with her," she said. "They would
not let me come back. They said it
would kill me. And now I have
come - and everything is here -all
the things we lived with - and she
is millions and millions- and mil-
lions of miles away!" 
"Who-who-was it?" Jane 
asked timidly in a low voice.
"It was my little girl," the poor
young beauty said. "It was my
little Andrea. Her portrait is in the
library."
Jane began to tremble somewhat 
herself.                            :

"That-?"    she began- and
ended: "She is dead?"
Mrs. Haldon had dragged her-
self almost as if unconsciously to
the stairs. She leaned against the
newel post and her face dropped
upon her hand.
"Oh! I don't know!" she cried.
"I cannot believe it. How could it
be? She was playing in her nur-
sery - laughing and playing - and
she ran into the next room to show
me a flower - and as she looked up
at me-laughing, I tell you -laugh-
ing - she sank slowly down on her

knees -and the flower fell out of her
hand quietly-and everything went
out of her face -everything was
gone away from her, and there was
never anything more -never!" 
Jane Foster's hand had crept up
to her throat. She did not know      i
what made her cold.                 N
"My little girl-" she began,
"her name is Judith- "
"Where is she ?" said Mrs. Hal-
don in a breathless way.
"She is up-stairs," Jane answer-
ed slowly. "She goes--into that
back room--on the fourth floor-" 
125



<pb n="138"/>
Mrs. Haldon turned upon her
with wide eyes.
"It is locked!" she said. "They
put everything away. I have the
key."
"The door opens for her," said
Jane. "She goes to play with a
little girl-who comes to her. I
think she comes over the roof from
the next house."
"There is no child there!" Mrs.
Haldon shuddered. But it was not
with horror. There was actually a
wild dawning bliss in her face.
"What is she like?"



<pb n="139"/>
"She is like the picture." Jane
scarcely knew her own monoto-
nous voice. The world of real
things was being withdrawn from
her and she was standing without
its pale--alone with this woman
and her wild eyes. She began to
shiver because her warm blood was
growing cold. "She is a child with 
red hair--and there is a deep
dimple near her mouth. Judith told
me. You must not touch her."
She heard a wild gasp - a flash
of something at once anguish and
rapture blazed across the haggard,  ^
127
-a      _     



<pb n="140"/>
young face -and with a swerving
as if her slight body had been swept
round by a sudden great wind,
Mrs. Haldon turned and fled up
the stairs.
Jane Foster followed. The great
wind swept her upward too. She
remembered no single intake or
outlet of breath until she was upon
the fourth floor.
The door of the Closed Room
stood wide open and Mrs. Haldon
was swept within.
Jane Foster saw her stand in the
middle of the room a second, a tall,



<pb n="141"/>
swaying figure. She whirled to look
about her and flung up her arms
with an unearthly rapturous, whis-
pered cry:
"It is all as she left it when she 
ran to me and fell. She has been
here  to show me it is not so far!" 
She sank slowly upon her knees,
wild happiness in her face-wild
tears pouring down it.
"She has seen her!" And she
stretched forth yearning arms to-
wards the little figure of Judith,
who lay quiet upon the sofa in the 
corner. "Your little girl has seen
129 



<pb n="142"/>
her-and I dare not waken her.
She is asleep."
Jane stood by the sofa - looking
down. When she bent and touched

PART ONE

<p>IN the fierce airless heat of the small square room the child Judith panted as she lay on her bed. Her father and mother slept near her, drowned in the heavy slumber of workers after their day's labour. Some people in the next flat were quarrelling, irritated probably by the appalling heat and their miserable helplessness against it. All the hot emanations of the sun-baked

<pb n="4     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
city streets seemed to combine with their clamour and unrest, and rise to the flat in which the child lay gazing at the darkness. It was situated but a few feet from the track of the Elevated Railroad and existence seemed to pulsate to the rush and roar of the demon which swept past the windows every few minutes. No one knew that Judith held the thing in horror, but it was a truth that she did. She was only seven years old, and at that age it is not easy to explain one's self so that older people can understand.

<pb n="5     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
She could only have said "I hate it. It comes so fast. It is always coming. It makes a sound as if thunder was quite close. I can never get away from it." The children in the other flats rather liked it. They hung out of the window perilously to watch it thunder past and to see the people who crowded it pressed close together in the seats, standing in the aisles, hanging on to the straps. Sometimes in the evening there were people in it who were going to the theatre, and the women and girls were dressed in light col-

<pb n="6     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
ours and wore hats covered with white feathers and flowers. At such times the children were delighted, and Judith used to hear the three in the next flat calling out to each other, "That's <hi rend="italic">my</hi> lady! That's <hi rend="italic">my</hi> lady! That one's mine!" </p>
<p>Judith was not like the children in the other flats. She was a frail, curious creature, with silent ways and a soft voice and eyes. She liked to play by herself in a corner of the room and to talk to herself as she played. No one knew what she talked about, and in fact no one

<pb n="7     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
inquired. Her mother was always too busy. When she was not making men's coats by the score at the whizzing sewing machine, she was hurriedly preparing a meal which was always in danger of being late. There was the breakfast, which might not be ready in time for her husband to reach his "shop" when the whistle blew; there was the supper, which might not be in time to be in waiting for him when he returned in the evening. The midday meal was a trifling matter, needing no special preparation. One ate

<pb n="8     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
anything one could find left from supper or breakfast. Judith's relation to her father and mother was not a very intimate one. They were too hard worked to have time for domestic intimacies, and a feature of their acquaintance was that though neither of them was sufficiently articulate to have found expression for the fact--the young man and woman felt the child vaguely remote. Their affection for her was tinged with something indefinitely like reverence. She had been a lovely baby

<pb n="9     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
with a peculiar magnolia whiteness of skin and very large, sweetly smiling eyes of dark blue, fringed with quite black lashes. She had exquisite pointed fingers and slender feet, and though Mr. and Mrs. Foster were--perhaps fortunately--unaware of it, she had been not at all the baby one would have expected to come to life in a corner of the hive of a workman's flat a few feet from the Elevated Railroad.</p>
<p>"Seems sometimes as if somehow she couldn't be mine," Mrs. Foster said at times. " She ain't like

<pb n="10     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
me, an' she ain't like Jem Foster, Lord knows. She ain't like none of either of our families I've ever heard of--'ceptin' it might be her Aunt Hester-but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> died long before I was born. I've only heard mother tell about her. She was a awful pretty girl. Mother said she had that kind of lily-white complexion and long slender fingers that was so supple she could curl 'em back like they was double-jointed. Her eyes was big and had eyelashes that stood out round 'em, but they was brown. Mother said

<pb n="11     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
she wasn't like any other kind of girl, and she thinks Judith may turn out like her. She wasn't but fifteen when she died. She never was ill in her life-but one morning she didn't come down to breakfast, and when they went up to call her, there she was sittin' at her window restin' her chin on her hand, with her face turned up smilin' as if she was talkin' to some one. The doctor said it had happened hours before, when she had come to the window to look at the stars. Easy way to go, wasn't it?"</p>

<pb n="12     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>Judith had heard of her Aunt Hester, but she only knew that she herself had hands like her and that her life had ended when she was quite young. Mrs. Foster was too much occupied by the strenuousness of life to dwell upon the passing of souls. To her the girl Hester seemed too remote to appear quite real. The legends of her beauty and unlikeness to other girls seemed rather like a sort of romance.</p>
<p>As she was not aware that Judith hated the Elevated Railroad, so she

<pb n="13     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
was not aware that she was fond of the far away Aunt Hester with the long-pointed fingers which could curl backwards. She did not know that when she was playing in her corner of the room, where it was her way to sit on her little chair with her face turned towards the wall, she often sat curving her small long fingers backward and talking to herself about Aunt Hester. But this--as well as many other things--was true. It was not secretiveness which caused the child to refrain from speaking of

<pb n="14     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
certain things. She herself could not have explained the reasons for her silence; also it had never occurred to her that explanation and reasons were necessary. Her mental attitude was that of a child who, knowing a certain language, does not speak it to those who have never heard and are wholly ignorant of it. She knew her Aunt Hester as her mother did not. She had seen her often in her dreams and had a secret fancy that she could dream of her when she wished to do so. She was very fond

<pb n="15     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
of dreaming of her. The places where she came upon Aunt Hester were strange and lovely places where the air one breathed smelled like flowers and everything was lovely in a new way, and when one moved one felt so light that movement was delightful, and when one wakened one had not quite got over the lightness and for a few moments felt as if one would float out of bed.</p>
<p>The healthy, vigourous young couple who were the child's parents were in a healthy, earthly way

<pb n="16     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
very fond of each other. They had made a genuine love match and had found it satisfactory. The young mechanic Jem Foster had met the young shop-girl Jane Hardy, at Coney Island one summer night and had become at once enamoured of her shop-girl good looks and high spirits. They had married as soon as Jem had had the "raise" he was anticipating and had from that time lived with much harmony in the flat building by which the Elevated train rushed and roared every few  minutes

<pb n="17     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
through the day and a greater part of the night. They themselves did not object to the "Elavated"; Jem was habituated to uproar in the machine shop, in which he spent his days, and Jane was too much absorbed in the making of men's coats by the dozens to observe anything else. The pair had healthy appetites and slept well after their day's work, hearty supper, long cheerful talk, and loud laughter over simple common joking.</p>
<p>"She's a queer little fish, Judy,"Jane said to her husband as they

<pb n="18     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
sat by the open window one night, Jem's arm curved comfortably around the young woman's waist as he smoked his pipe. "What do you think she says to me to-night after I put her to bed?"</p>
<p>"Search <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!" said Jem oracularly.</p>
<p>Jane laughed.</p>
<p>"'Why,' she says, 'I wish the Elavated train would stop.'</p>
<p>"'Why?' says I.</p>
<p>"'I want to go to sleep,' says she. 'I'm going to dream of Aunt Hester."'</p>

<pb n="19     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>"What does she know about her Aunt Hester," said Jem. "Who's been talkin' to her?"</p>
<p>"Not me," Jane said. "She don't know nothing but what she's picked up by chance. I don't believe in talkin' to young ones about dead folks. 'Tain't healthy."</p>
<p>"That's right," said Jem. " Children that's got to hustle about among live folks for a livin' best keep their minds out of cemeteries. But, Hully Gee, what a queer thing for a young one to say."</p>
<p>"And that ain't all," Jane went

<pb n="20     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
on, her giggle half amused, half nervous. "'But I don't fall asleep when I see Aunt Hester,' says she. 'I fall awake. It's more awake there than here.'</p>
<p>"'Where?' says I, laughing a bit, though it did make me feel queer.</p>
<p>"'I don't know,' she says in that soft little quiet way of hers. 'There.' And not another thing could I get out of her."</p>
<p>On the hot night through whose first hours Judith lay panting in her corner of the room, tormented and

<pb n="21     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
kept awake by the constant roar and rush and flash of lights, she was trying to go to sleep in the hope of leaving all the heat and noise and discomfort behind, and reaching Aunt Hester. If she could fall awake she would feel and hear none of it. It would all be unreal and she would know that only the lightness and the air like flowers and the lovely brightness were true. Once, as she tossed on her cot-bed, she broke into a low little laugh to think how untrue things really were and how strange it was that

<pb n="22     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
people did not understand--that even she felt as she lay in the darkness that she could not get away. And she could not get away unless the train would stop just long enough to let her fall asleep. If she could fall asleep between the trains, she would not awaken. But they came so quickly one after the other. Her hair was damp as she pushed it from her forehead, the bed felt hot against her skin, the people in the next flat quarrelled* more angrily, Judith heard a loud slap, and then the woman began

<pb n="23     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
to cry. She was a young married woman, scarcely more than a girl. Her marriage had not been as successful as that of Judith's parents. Both husband and wife had irritable tempers. Through the thin wall Judith could hear the girl sobbing angrily as the man flung himself out of bed, put on his clothes and went out, banging the door after him.</p>
<p>"She doesn't know," the child whispered eerily, "that it isn't real at all."</p>
<p>There was in her strange little

<pb n="24     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
soul a secret no one knew the existence of. It was a vague belief that she herself was not quite real--or that she did not belong to the life she had been born into. Her mother and father loved her and she loved them, but sometimes she was on the brink of telling them that she could not stay long--that some mistake had been made. What mistake--or where was she to go to if she went, she did not know. She used to catch her breath and stop herself and feel frightened when she had been near

<pb n="25     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
speaking of this fantastic thing. But the building full of workmen's flats, the hot room, the Elevated Railroad, the quarrelling people, were all a mistake. Just once or twice in her life she had seen places and things which did not seem so foreign. Once, when she had been taken to the Park in the Spring, she had wandered away from her mother to a sequestered place among shrubs and trees, all waving tender, new pale green, with the leaves a few early hot days had caused to rush out and tremble un-

<pb n="26     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
furled. There had been a stillness there and scents and colours she knew. A bird had come and swung upon a twig quite near her and, looking at her with bright soft full eyes, had sung gently to her, as if he were speaking. A squirrel had crept up onto her lap and had not moved when she stroked it. Its eyes had been full and soft also, and she knew it understood that she could not hurt it. There was no mistake in her being among the new fair greenness, and the woodland things who spoke to her. They

<pb n="27     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
did not use words, but no words were needed. She knew what they were saying. When she had pushed her way through the greenness of the shrubbery to the driveway she had found herself quite near to an open carriage, which had stopped because the lady who sat in it was speaking to a friend on the path. She was a young woman, dressed in delicate spring colours, and the little girl at her side was dressed in white cloth, and it was at the little girl Judith found herself gazing. Under her large white hat

<pb n="28     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
and feathers her little face seemed like a white flower. She had a deep dimple near her mouth. Her hair was a rich coppery red and hung heavy and long about her cheeks and shoulders. She lifted her head a little when the child in the common hat and frock pressed through the greenness of the bushes and she looked at Judith just as the bird and the squirrel had looked at her. They gazed as if they had known each other for ages of years and were separated by nothing. Each of them was quite happy at

<pb n="29     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
being near the other, and there was not in the mind of either any question of their not being near each other again. The question did not rise in Judith's mind even when in a very few minutes the carriage moved away and was lost in the crowd of equipages rolling by.</p>
<p>At the hottest hours of the hot night Judith recalled to herself the cool of that day. She brought back the fresh pale greenness of the nook among the bushes into which she had forced her way, the scent of the leaves and grass which she

<pb n="30     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
had drawn in as she breathed, the nearness in the eyes of the bird, the squirrel, and the child. She smiled as she thought of these things, and as she continued to remember yet other things, bit by bit, she felt less hot--she gradually forgot to listen for the roar of the train--she smiled still more--she lay quite still--she was cool--a tiny fresh breeze fluttered through the window and played about her forehead. She was smiling in soft delight as her eyelids drooped and closed.</p>

<pb n="31     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>"I am falling awake," she was murmuring as her lashes touched her cheek.</p>
<p>Perhaps when her eyes closed the sultriness of the night had changed to the momentary freshness of the turning dawn, and the next hour or so was really cooler. She knew no more heat but slept softly, deeply, long--or it seemed to her afterwards that she had slept long--as if she had drifted far away in dreamless peace.</p>
<p>She remembered no dream, saw nothing, felt nothing until, as it

<pb n="32     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
seemed to her, in the early morning, she opened her eyes. All was quite still and clear--the air of the room was pure and sweet. There was no sound anywhere and, curiously enough, she was not surprised by this, nor did she expect to hear anything disturbing.</p>
<p>She did not look round the room. Her eyes remained resting upon
 what she first saw--and she was not surprised by this either. A
 little girl about her own age was standing smiling at her. She had large eyes, a deep dimple near her

<pb n="33     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
mouth, and coppery red hair which fell about her cheeks and shoulders. Judith knew her and smiled back at her.</p>
<p>She lifted her hand--and it was a pure white little hand with long tapering fingers.</p>
<p>"Come and play with me," she said--though Judith heard no voice while she knew what she was saying. "Come and play with me."</p>
<p>Then she was gone, and in a few seconds Judith was awake, the air of the room had changed, the noise and clatter of the streets came in

<pb n="34     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
at the window, and the Elevated train went thundering by. Judith did not ask herself how the child had gone or how she had come. She lay still, feeling undisturbed by everything and smiling as she had smiled in her sleep.</p>
<p>While she sat at the breakfast table she saw her mother looking at her curiously.</p>
<p>"You look as if you'd slept cool instead of hot last night," she said. "You look better than you did yesterday. You're pretty well, ain't you, Judy?"</p>

<pb n="35     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>Judith's smile meant that she was quite well, but she said nothing about her sleeping.</p>
<p>The heat did not disturb her through the day, though the hours grew hotter and hotter as they passed. Jane Foster, sweltering at her machine, was obliged to stop every few minutes to wipe the beads from her face and neck. Sometimes she could not remain seated, but got up panting to drink water and fan herself with a newspaper.</p>
<p>"I can't stand much more of

<pb n="36     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
this, "she kept saying." If there don't come a thunderstorm to cool things off I don't know what I'll do. This room's about five hundred."</p>
<p>But the heat grew greater and the Elevated trains went thundering by.</p>
<p>When Jem came home from his work his supper was not ready. Jane was sitting helplessly by the window, almost livid in her pallor. The table was but half spread.</p>
<p>"Hullo," said Jem; "it's done you up, ain't it?"</p>

<pb n="37     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>"Well, I guess it has," good-naturedly, certain of his sympathy. "But I'll get over it presently, and then I can get you a cold bite. I can't stand over the stove and cook."</p>
<p>"Hully Gee, a cold bite's all a man wants on a night like this. Hot chops'd give him the jim-jams. But I've got good news for you--it's cheered me up myself."</p>
<p>Jane lifted her head from the chair back.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Well, it came through my boss.

<pb n="38     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
He's always been friendly to me. He asks a question or so every now and then and seems to take an interest. To-day he was asking me if it wasn't pretty hot and noisy down here, and after I told him how we stood it, he said he believed he could get us a better place to stay in through the summer. Someone he knows has had illness and trouble in his family and he's obliged to close his house and take his wife away into the mountains. They've got a beautiful big house in one of them far up streets by the

<pb n="39     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
Park and he wants to get caretakers in that can come well recommended. The boss said he could recommend us fast enough. And there's a big light basement that'll be as cool as the woods. And we can move in to-morrow. And all we've got to do is to see that things are safe and live happy."</p>
<p>"Oh, Jem!" Jane ejaculated. "It sounds too good to be true! Up by the Park! A big cool place to live!"</p>
<p>"We've none of us ever been in a house the size of it. You know

<pb n="40     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
what they look like outside, and they say they're bigger than they look. It's your business to go over the rooms every day or so to see nothing's going wrong in them--moths or dirt, I suppose. It's all left open but just one room they've left locked and don't want interfered with. I told the boss I thought the basement would seem like the Waldorf-Astoria to us. I tell you I was so glad I
 scarcely knew what to say."</p>
<p>Jane drew a long breath.</p>
<p>"A big house up there," she said.

<pb n="41     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
"And only one closed room in it. It's too good to be true!"</p>
<p>"Well, whether it's true or not we'll move out there to-morrow," Jem answered cheerfully. "To-morrow morning bright and early. The boss said the sooner the better."</p>
<p>A large house left deserted by those who have filled its rooms with emotions and life, expresses a silence, a quality all its own. A house unfurnished and empty seems less impressively silent. The

<pb n="42     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
fact of its devoidness of sound is upon the whole more natural. But carpets accustomed to the pressure of constantly passing feet, chairs and sofas which have held human warmth, draperies used to the touch of hands drawing them aside to let in daylight, pictures which have smiled back at thinking eyes, mirrors which have reflected faces passing hourly in changing moods, elate or dark or longing, walls which have echoed back voices--all these things when left alone seem to be held in strange arrest,

<pb n="43     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
as if by some spell intensifying the effect of the pause in their existence.</p>
<p>The child Judith felt this deeply throughout the entirety of her young being.</p>
<p>"How <hi rend="italic">still</hi> it is," she said to her mother the first time they went over the place together.</p>
<p>"Well, it seems still up here--and kind of dead," Jane Foster replied with her habitual sociable half-laugh. "But seems to me it always feels that way in a house people's left. It's cheerful enough 

<pb n="44     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>

down in that big basement with all the windows open. We can sit in that room they've had fixed to play billiards in. We shan't hurt nothing. We can keep the table and things covered up. Tell you, Judy, this'll be different from last summer. The Park ain't but a few steps away an' we can go and sit there too when we feel like it. Talk about the country--I don't want no more country than this is. You'll be made over the months we stay here."</p>
<p>Judith felt as if this must veritably be a truth. The houses on

<pb n="45     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
either side of the street were closed for the summer. Their occupants had gone to the seaside or the mountains and the windows and doors were boarded up. The street was a quiet one at any time, and wore now the aspect of a street in a city of the dead. The green trees of the Park were to be seen either gently stirring or motionless in the sun at the side of the avenue crossing the end of it. The only token of the existence of the Elevated Railroad was a remote occasional hum suggestive of the flying past of a

<pb n="46     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
giant bee. The thing seemed no longer a roaring demon, and Judith scarcely recognized that it was still the centre of the city's rushing, heated life.</p>
<p>The owners of the house had evidently deserted it suddenly. The windows had not been boarded up and the rooms had been left in their ordinary condition. The furniture was not covered or the hangings swathed. Jem Foster had been told that his wife must put things in order.</p>
<p>The house was beautiful and

<pb n="47     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
spacious, its decorations and appointments were not mere testimonies to freedom of expenditure, but expressions of a dignified and cultivated thought. Judith followed her mother from room to room in one of her singular moods. The loftiness of the walls, the breadth and space about her made her, at intervals, draw in her breath with pleasure. The pictures, the colours, the rich and beautiful textures she saw brought to her the free--and at the same time soothed--feeling she remembered as the chief feature 

<pb n="48     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
of the dreams in which she "fell awake." But beyond all other things she rejoiced in the height and space, the sweep of view through one large room into another. She continually paused and stood with her face lifted looking up at the pictured things floating on a ceiling above her. Once, when she had stood doing this long enough to forget herself, she was startled by her mother's laugh, which broke in upon the silence about them with a curiously earthly sound which was almost a shock.</p>

<pb n="49     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>"Wake up, Judy; have you gone off in a dream? You look all the time as if you was walking in your sleep."</p>
<p>"It's so high," said Judy. "Those clouds make it look like the sky."</p>
<p>"I've got to set these chairs straight," said Jane. "Looks like they'd been havin' a concert here. All these chairs together an' that part of the room clear."</p>
<p>She began to move the chairs and rearrange them, bustling about cheerfully and talking the while.
<pb n="50     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
Presently she stooped to pick something up.</p>
<p>"What's this," she said, and then uttered a startled exclamation. "Mercy! they felt so kind of clammy they made me jump. They have had a party. Here's some of the flowers left fallen on the carpet."</p>
<p>She held up a cluster of wax-white hyacinths and large heavy rosebuds, faded to discoloration.</p>
<p>"This has dropped out of some set piece. It felt like cold flesh when I first touched it. I don't like a lot of white things together. They look

<pb n="51     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
too kind of mournful. Just go and get the wastepaper basket in the library, Judy. We'll carry it around to drop things into. Take that with you."</p>
<p>Judith carried the flowers into the library and bent to pick up the basket as she dropped them into it.</p>
<p>As she raised her head she found her eyes looking directly into other eyes which gazed at her from the wall. They were smiling from the face of a child in a picture. As soon as she saw them Judith drew in her breath and stood still, smiling, too,

<pb n="52     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
in response. The picture was that of a little girl in a floating white frock. She had a deep dimple at one corner of her mouth, her hanging hair was like burnished copper, she held up a slender hand with pointed fingers and Judith knew her. Oh! she knew her quite well. She had never felt so near any one else throughout her life.</p>
<p>"Judy, Judy!" Jane Foster called out. "Come here with your basket; what you staying for?"</p>
<p>Judith returned to her.</p>
<p>"We've got to get a move on,"

<pb n="53     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
said Jane, "or we sha'n't get nothin' done before supper time. What was you lookin' at?"</p>
<p>"There's a picture in there of a little girl I know," Judith said. "I don't know her name, but I saw her in the Park once and--and I dreamed about her."</p>
<p>"Dreamed about her? If that ain't queer. Well, we've got to hurry up. Here's some more of them dropped flowers. Give me the basket."</p>
<p>They went through the whole house together, from room to room,

<pb n="54     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
up the many stairs, from floor to floor, and everywhere Judith felt the curious stillness and silence. It can not be doubted that Jane Foster felt it also.</p>
<p>"It is the stillest house I was ever in," she said. "I'm glad I've got you with me, Judy. If I was sole alone I believe it 'ud give me the creeps. These big places ought to have big families in them."</p>
<p>It was on the fourth floor that they came upon the Closed Room. Jane had found some of the doors shut and some open, but a turn of

<pb n="55     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
the handle gave entrance through all the unopened ones until they reached this one at the back on the fourth floor.</p>
<p>"This one won't open," Jane said, when she tried the handle. Then she shook it once or twice. "No, it's locked," she decided after an effort or two. "There, I've just remembered. There's one kept locked. Folks always has things they want locked up. I'll make sure, though."</p>
<p>She shook it, turned the handle, shook again, pressed her knee

<pb n="56     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
against the panel. The lock resisted all effort.</p>
<p>"Yes, this is the closed one," she made up her mind. "It's locked hard and fast. It's the closed one."</p>
<p>It was logically proved to be the closed one by the fact that she found no other one locked as she finished her round of the chambers.</p>
<p>Judith was a little tired before they had done their work. But her wandering pilgrimage through the large, silent, deserted house had been a revelation of new emotions to her. She was always a silent child.

<pb n="57     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
Her mind was so full of strangethoughts that it seemed unnecessary to say many words. The things she thought as she followed her from room to room, from floor to floor, until they reached the locked door, would have amazed and puzzled Jane Foster if she had known of their existence. Most of all, perhaps, she would have been puzzled by the effect the closed door had upon the child. It puzzled and bewildered Judith herself and made her feel a little weary.</p>
<p>She wanted so much to go into

<pb n="58     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
the room. Without in the least understanding the feeling, she was quite shaken by it. It seemed as if the closing of all the other rooms would have been a small matter in comparison with the closing of this one. There was something inside which she wanted to see--there was something--somehow there was something which wanted to see her. What a pity that the door was locked! Why had it been done? She sighed unconsciously several times during the evening, and Jane Foster thought she was tired.</p>

<pb n="59     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
<p>"But you'll sleep cool enough to-night, Judy," she said. "And get a good rest. Them little breezes that comes rustling through the trees in the Park comes right along the street to us."</p>
<p>She and Jem Foster slept well. They spent the evening in the highest spirits and--as it seemed to them--the most luxurious comfort. The space afforded them by the big basement, with its kitchen and laundry and pantry, and, above all, the specially large room which had been used for billiard

<pb n="60     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
playing, supplied actual vistas. For the sake of convenience and coolness they used the billiard room as a dormitory, sleeping on light cots, and they slept with all their windows open, the little breezes wandering from among the trees of the Park to fan them. How they laughed and enjoyed themselves over their supper, and how they stretched themselves out with sighs of joy in the darkness as they sank into the cool, untroubled waters of deep sleep.</p>
<p>"This is about the top notch,"

<pb n="61     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
Jem murmured as he lost his hold on the world of waking life and work.</p>
<p>But though she was cool, though she was undisturbed, though her body rested in absolute repose, Judith did not sleep for a long time. She lay and listened to the quietness. There was mystery in it. The footstep of a belated passer-by in the street woke strange echoes, a voice heard in the distance in a riotous shout suggested weird things. And as she lay and listened, it was as if she were not only

<pb n="62     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
listening but waiting for something. She did not know at all what she was waiting for, but waiting she was. She lay upon her cot with her arms flung out and her eyes wide open. What was it that she wanted--that which was in the closed room? Why had they locked the door ? If they had locked the doors of the big parlours it would not have mattered. If they had locked the door of the library--*Her mind paused--as if for a moment, something held it still. Then she remem-

<pb n="63     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
bered that to have locked the doors of the library would have been to lock in the picture of the child with the greeting look in her eyes and the fine little uplifted hand. She was glad the room had been left open. But the room up-stairs--the one on the fourth floor--that was the one that mattered most of all. She knew that to-morrow she must go and stand at the door and press her cheek against the wood and wait--and listen. Thinking this and knowing that it must be so,she fell--at last--asleep.</p>

PART TWO

<p>JUDITH climbed the basement stairs rather slowly. Her mother was busy rearranging the disorder the hastily departing servants had left. Their departure had indeed been made in sufficient haste to have left behind the air of its having been flight. There was a great deal to be done, and Jane Foster, moving about with broom and pail and scrubbing brushes, did not dislike

<pb n="66"/>
the excitement of the work before her. Judith's certainty that she would not be missed made all clear before her. If her absence was observed her mother would realize that the whole house lay open to her and that she was an undisturbing element wheresoever she was led either by her fancy or by circumstance. If she went into the parlours she would probably sit and talk to herself or play quietly with her shabby doll. In any case she would be finding pleasure of her own and would

<pb n="67     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
touch nothing which could be harmed.</p>
<p>When the child found herself in the entrance hall she stopped a few moments to look about her. The stillness seemed to hold her and she paused to hear and feel it. In leaving the basement behind, she had left the movement of living behind also. No one was alive upon this floor--nor upon the next--nor the next. It was as if one had entered a new world--a world in which something existed which did not express itself in sound or in things

<pb n="68     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
which one could see. Chairs held out their arms to emptiness--cushions were not pressed by living things--only the people in the pictures were looking at something, but one could not tell what they were looking at.</p>
<p>But on the fourth floor was the Closed Room, which she must go to--because she must go to it--that was all she knew.</p>
<p>She began to mount the stairs which led to the upper floors. Her shabby doll was held against her hip by one arm, her right hand

<pb n="69     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
touched the wall as she went, she felt the height of the wall as she looked upward. It was such a large house and so empty. Where had the people gone and why had they left it all at once as if they were afraid? Her father had only heard vaguely that they had gone because they had had trouble.</p>
<p>She passed the second floor, the third, and climbed towards the fourth. She could see the door of the Closed Room as she went up step by step, and she found herself moving more quickly. Yes, she

<pb n="70     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
must get to it--she must put her hand on it--her chest began to rise and fall with a quickening of her breath, and her breath quickened because her heart fluttered--as if with her haste. She began to be glad, and if any one could have seen her they would have been struck by a curious expectant smile in her eyes.</p>
<p>She reached the landing and crossed it, running the last few steps lightly. She did not wait or stand still a moment. With the strange expectant smile on her lips as well as in her eyes, she put her hand up-

<pb n="71     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
on the door--not upon the handle, but upon the panel. Without any sound it swung quietly open. And without any sound she stepped quietly inside.</p>
<p>The room was rather large and the light in it was dim. There were no shutters, but the blinds were drawn down. Judith went to one of the windows and drew its blind up so that the look of the place might be clear to her. There were two windows and they opened upon the flat roof of an extension, which suggested somehow that it had

<pb n="72     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
been used as a place to walk about in. This, at least, was what Judith thought of at once--that some one who had used the room had been in the habit of going out upon the roof and staying there as if it had been a sort of garden. There were rows of flower pots with dead flowers in them--there were green tubs containing large shrubs, which were dead also--against the low parapet certain of them held climbing plants which had been trained upon it. Two had been climbing roses, two were clematis, but Judith

<pb n="73     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
did not know them by name. The ledge of the window was so low that a mere step took her outside. So taking it, she stood among the dried, withered things and looked in tender regret at them.</p>
<p>"I wish they were not dead," she said softly to the silence. "It would be like a garden if they were not dead."</p>
<p>The sun was hot, but a cool, little breeze seemed straying up from among the trees of the Park. It even made the dried leaves of the flowers tremble and rustle a little.

<pb n="74     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
Involuntarily she lifted her face to the blue sky and floating white clouds. They seemed so near that she felt almost as if she could touch them with her hand. The street seemed so far--so far below--the whole world seemed far below. If one stepped off the parapet it would surely take one a long time to reach the earth. She knew now why she had come up here. It was so that she might feel like this--as if she was upheld far away from things--as if she had left everything behind--almost as if she had

<pb n="75     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
fallen awake again. There was no perfume in the air, but all was still and sweet and clear.</p>
<p>Suddenly she turned and went into the room again, realizing that she had scarcely seen it at all and that she must see and know it. It was not like any other room she had seen. It looked more simple, though it was a pretty place. The walls were covered with roses, there were bright pictures, and shelves full of books. There was also a little writing desk and there were two or three low chairs, and a

<pb n="76     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
low table. A closet in a corner had its door ajar and Judith could see that inside toys were piled together. In another corer a large doll's house stood, looking as if some one had just stopped playing with it. Some toy furniture had been taken out and left near it upon the carpet.</p>
<p>"It was a little girl's room," Judith said. "Why did they close it?"</p>
<p>Her eye was caught by something lying on a sofa--something covered with a cloth. It looked al-

<pb n="77     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
most like a child lying there asleep--so fast asleep that it did not stir
at all. Judith moved across to the sofa and drew the cloth aside. With its head upon a cushion was lying there a very large doll, beautifully dressed in white lace, its eyes closed, and a little wreath of dead flowers in its hair.</p>
<p>"It looks almost as if it had died too," said Judith.</p>
<p>She did not ask herself why she said "as if it had died too"--perhaps it was because the place was so still--and everything so far

<pb n="78     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
away--that the flowers had died in the strange, little deserted garden on the roof.</p>
<p>She did not hear any footsteps--in fact, no ghost of a sound stirred the silence as she stood looking at the doll's sleep--but quite quickly she ceased to bend forward, and turned round to look at something which she knew was near her. There she was--and it was quite natural she should be there--the little girl with the face like a white flower, with the quantity of burnished coppery hair and the smile

<pb n="79     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
which deepened the already deep dimple near her mouth.</p>
<p>"You have come to play with me," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Judith. "I wanted to come all night. I could not stay down-stairs."</p>
<p>"No," said the child; "you can't stay down-stairs. Lift up the doll."</p>
<p>They began to play as if they had spent their lives together. Neither asked the other any questions. Judith had not played with other children, but with this one she played in absolute and lovely

<pb n="80     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
delight. The little girl knew where all the toys were, and there were a great many beautiful ones. She told Judith where to find them and how to arrange them for their games. She invented wonderful things to do--things which were so unlike anything Judith had ever seen or heard or thought of that it was not strange that she realized afterwards that all her past life and its belongings had been so forgotten as to be wholly blotted out while she was in the Closed Room. She did not know her playmate's name,

<pb n="81     IN THE CLOSED ROOM"/>
she did not remember that there were such things as names. Every moment was happiness. Every moment the little girl seemed to grow more beautiful in the flower whiteness of her face and hands and the strange lightness and freedom of her movements. There was an ecstasy in looking at her--in feeling her near.</p>
<p>Not long before Judith went down-stairs she found herself standing with her outside the window in among the withered flowers.</p>

dreary little garden was bright and


full of leaves and flowers.


"It's Life," she said to Judith.


Judith nodded and smiled back at 


her, understanding quite well just as


she had understood the eyes of the


bird who had swung on the twig so


near her cheek the day she had hid-


den among the bushes in the Park.


"Now, you must go," the little


girl said at last. And Judith went


out of the room at once -without


waiting or looking back, though


she knew the white figure did not


stir till she was out of sight.

It was not until she had reached


the second floor that the change


came upon her. It was a great


change and a curious one. The

as all other places and things had


seemed when she had stood upon

blueness and the white clouds-as


when she had looked round and


found herself face to face with the

girl spoke to her-she knew that it


had happened, that it was she only


who had lifted the doll-who had


taken out the toys-who had ar-


ranged the low table for their


feast, putting all the small service


upon it-and though they had 


played with such rapturous enjoy-


ment and had laughed and feasted


-what had they feasted on ? That


she could not recall - and not once


had she touched or been touched


by the light hand or white dress -


and though they seemed to express


their thoughts and intentions free-


85


eA_













<pb n="97"/>

ly she had heard no voice at all.


She was suddenly bewildered and


stood rubbing her hand over her


forehead and her eyes-but she


was happy-as happy as when she


had fallen awake in her sleep-and


was no more troubled or really


curious than she would have been


if she had had the same experience


every day of her life.


9        " I"Well, you must have been hav-


ing a good time playing up-stairs,"


Jane Foster said when she entered


the big kitchen. "This is going to


do you good, Judy. Looks like


Qe













<pb n="98"/>

she'd had a day in the country,


don't she, Jem?"


Through the weeks that followed


her habit of "playing up-stairs"


was accepted as a perfectly natural


thing. No questions were asked


and she knew it was not necessary 


to enter into any explanations. 


Every day she went to the door


of the Closed Room and, finding it


closed, at a touch of her hand upon


the panel it swung softly open.


There she waited--sometimes for


a longer sometimes for a shorter


time-and the child with the cop-


87













<pb n="99"/>

pery hair came to her. The world


below was gone as soon as she en-


tered the room, and through the


hours they played together joy-


ously as happy children play. But


in their playing it was always Ju-


dith who touched the toys-who


held the doll  who set the little


table for their feast. Once as she


went down-stairs she remembered


19  ~  that whshn she had that day made


a wreath of roses from the roof and


~J    had gone to put it on her play-


mate's head, she had drawn back


with deepened dimple and, holding


Aft













<pb n="100"/>

up her hand, had said, laughing:


"No. Do not touch me."


But there was no mystery in it


after all. Judith knew she should


presently understand.


She was so happy that her hap-


piness lived in her face in a sort of


delicate brilliance. Jane Foster ob- 


served the change in her with ex-


ceeding comfort, her view being


that spacious quarters, fresh air,


and sounder sleep had done great


things for her.


"Them big eyes of hers ain't


like no other child's eyes I've ever


89


,,ed, Olh













<pb n="101"/>

seen," she said to her husband with


cheerful self-gratulation. "An' her


skin's that fine an' thin an' fair


you can jest see through it. She


always looks to me as if she was


made out of different stuff from me


an' you, Jem. I've always said it."


"She's going to make a corking


handsome girl," responded Jem


with a chuckle.


They had been in the house two


months, when one afternoon, as


she was slicing potatoes for supper,


Jane looked round to see the child


standing at the kitchen doorway,


90













<pb n="102"/>

looking with a puzzled expression


at some wilted flowers she held in


her hand. Jane's impression was


that she had been coming into the


room and had stopped suddenly to


look at what she held.


"What've you got there, Judy ?"


she asked. 


"They're flowers," said Judith,


her eyes still more puzzled.


"Where'd you get 'em from? I


didn't know you'd been out. I


thought you was up-stairs."


"I was," said Judith quite sim-


ply. "In the Closed Room."

<pb n="103"/>

9-          - 


Jane Foster's knife dropped into


her pan with a splash.


"Well," she gasped.


Judith looked at her with quiet


eyes.


"The Closed Room!" Jane cried


out. "What are you saying? You


couldn't get in?"


"Yes, I can."


Jane was conscious of experienc-


ing a shock. She said afterwards


that suddenly something gave her


the creeps.


"You couldn't open the door,"


she persisted. "I tried it again yes-

terday as I passed by-turned the


handle and gave it a regular shove


and it wouldn't give an inch." 


"Yes," the child answered; "I


heard you. We were inside then." 


A few days later, when Jane


weepingly related the incident to


awe-stricken  and  sympathizing     L


friends, she described as graphi-


cally as her limited vocabulary


would allow her to do so, the look


in Judith's face as she came nearer


to her.


"Don't tell me there was noth-


ing happening then," she said.


93


'CS ,"^













<pb n="105"/>

"She just came up to me with them


dead flowers in her hand an' a kind


of look in her eyes as if she was


half sorry for me an' didn't know


quite why.


"'The door opens for me,' she


says. 'That's where I play every


day. There's a little girl comes and


plays with me. She comes in at the


window, I think. She is like the pic-


ture in the room where the books


are. Her hair hangs down and she


has a dimple near her mouth.'


"I couldn't never tell any one


what I felt like. It waRs a if I'd ant













<pb n="106"/>

a queer fright that I didn't under-


stand.


"' She must have come over the


roof from the next house,' I says.


'They've got an extension too-but


I thought the people were gone


away.'


"'There are flowers on our


roof,' she said. 'I got these there.'


And that puzzled look came into her


eyes again. 'They were beautiful


when I got them - but as I came


down-stairs they died.'


"'Well, of all the queer things,'


I said. She put out her hand and


95


,,o    POq       'A













<pb n="107"/>

touched my arm sort of lovin' an'


timid.


"'I wanted to tell you to-day,


mother,' she said. 'I had to tell


you to-day. You don't mind if I go


play with her, do you ? You don't


mind ?'


"Perhaps it was because she


touched me that queer little loving


way - or was it the way she looked


- it seemed like something came


over me an' I just grabbed her an'


hugged her up.


"' No,' I says. 'So as you come


back. So as you come back.'













<pb n="108"/>

" And to think!" And Jane rock-


ed herself sobbing.


A point she dwelt on with many


tears was that the child seemed in 


a wistful mood and remained near


her side - bringing her little chair


and sitting by her as she worked,


and rising to follow her from place 


to place as she moved from one


room to the other.


" She wasn't never one as kissed


you much or hung about like some


children do -I always used to say


she was the least bother of any


child I ever knew. Seemed as if she


97


.c, a0O4h        _l













<pb n="109"/>

had company of her own when


she sat in her little chair in the cor-


ner whispering to herself or just


setting quiet." This was a thing


Jane always added during all the


years in which she told the story.


"That was what made me notice.


She kept by me and she kept look-


ing at me different rom any way


I'd seen her look before -not pit-


iful exactly-but something like


it. And once she came up and


kissed me and once or twice she


just kind of touched my dress or


my hand -as I stood bv her. She













<pb n="110"/>

knew. No one need tell me she


didn't."


But this was an error. The child


was conscious only of a tender,


wistful feeling, which caused her


to look at the affectionate healthy


young woman who had always


been good to her and whom she


belonged to, though she remotely


wondered why--the same tender-


ness impelled her to touch her arm,


hand and simple dress, and folding


her arms round her neck to kiss her


softly. It was an expression of


gratitude for all the rough casual


99


vOA^%













<pb n="111"/>

affection of the past. All her life


had been spent at her side - all her


life on earth had sprung from her.


When she went up-stairs to the


Closed Room the next day she told


her mother she was going before


she left the kitchen.


"I'm going up to play with the


little girl, mother," she said. "You


don't mind, do you ?"


Jane had had an evening of com-


fortable domestic gossip and joking


with Jem, had slept, slept soundly


and eaten a hearty breakfast. Life


had reassumed its wholly normal













<pb n="112"/>

/w   I













<pb n="113"/>

aspect. The sun was shining hot


and bright and she was preparing


to scrub the kitchen floor. She


believed that the child was mis-


taken as to the room she had been


in.


"That's all right," she said,


turning the hot water spigot over


the sink so that the boiling water


poured forth at full flow into her


pail, with clouds of steam. "But


when I've done my scrubbing I'm


comin' up to see if it is the Closed


Room you play in. If it is, I guess


you'd better play somewhere else -


101


'als, Aqh













<pb n="114"/>

and I want to find out how you get


that door open. Run along if you


like."


Judith came back to her from


the door. "Yes," she said, "come


and see. But if she is there," put-


ting her hand on Jane's hip gently,


"you mustn't touch her."


Jane turned off the hot water


and stared.


"Her!"


"The little girl who plays. I never


touch her. She says I must not."


Jane lifted her pail from the sink,


laughing outright.













<pb n="115"/>

"Well, that sounds as if she was


a pretty airy young one," she said.


"I guess you're a queer little pair.


Run on. I must get at this floor."


Judith ran up the three flights of


stairs lightly. She was glad she had


told her mother, though she won-


dered vaguely why it had never


seemed right to tell her until last


night, and last night it had seemed


not so much necessary as impera-


tive. Something had obliged her to


tell her. The time had come when


she must know. The Closed Room


door had always shut itself gently


103


f^"^"^~













<pb n="116"/>

after Judith had passed through it,


and yesterday, when her mother


passing by chance, had tried the


handle so vigorously, the two chil-


dren inside the room had stood still


gazing at each other, but neither


had spoken and Judith had not


thought of speaking. She was out


of the realm of speech, and without


any sense of amazement was aware


that she was out of it. People with


voices and words were in that far-


away world below.


The playing to-day was even a


lovelier, happier thing than it had













<pb n="117"/>

ever been before. It seemed to be-


come each minute a thing farther


and farther away from the world


in the streets where the Elevated


Railroad went humming past like


a monster bee. And with the sense


of greater distance came a sense


of greater lightness and freedom.


Judith found that she was moving


about the room and the little roof


garden almost exactly as she had


moved in the waking dreams where


she saw Aunt Hester - almost as if


she was floating and every move-


ment was ecstasy. Once as she


105













<pb n="118"/>

w


thought this she looked at her play-


mate, and the child smiled and


answered her as she always did be-


fore she spoke.


"Yes," she said; "I know her.


She will come. She sent me."


She had this day a special plan


with regard to the arranging of the


Closed Room. She wanted all the


things in it-the doll-the chairs


the toys-the little table and its ser-


vice to be placed in certain posi-


tions. She told Judith what to do.


Various toys were put here or


there-the little table was apt with













<pb n="119"/>

certain dishes in a particular part


of the room. A book was left lying


upon the sofa cushion, the large


doll was put into a chair near the


sofa, with a smaller doll in its arms,


on the small writing desk a letter,


which Judith found in a drawer -


a half-written letter - was laid, the


pen was left in the ink. It was a


strange game to play, but some-


how Judith felt it was very pretty.


When it was all done -and there


were many curious things to do -


the Closed Room looked quite dif-


ferent from the cold, dim, orderly


107 













<pb n="120"/>

place the door had first opened


upon. Then it had looked as if


everything had been swept up and


set away and covered and done


with forever-as if the life in it had


ended and would never begin again.


Now it looked as if some child who


had lived in it and loved and played


with each of its belongings, had just


stepped out from her play-to some


other room quite near-quite near.


The big doll in its chair seemed


waiting-even listening to her voice


as it came from the room she had


run into.













<pb n="121"/>

The child with the burnished


hair stood and looked at it with


her delicious smile.


"That is how it looked," she


said. "They came and hid and


covered everything-as if I had


gone-as if I was Nowhere. I want


her to know I come here. I couldn't


do it myself. You could do it for 


me. Go and bring some roses."


The little garden was a wonder


of strange beauty with its masses of


flowers. Judith brought some roses


from the bush her playmate pointed 


out. She put them into a light 


109                'S













<pb n="122"/>

bowl which was like a bubble of


thin, clear glass and stood on the


desk near the letter.


"If they would look like that,"


the little girl said, "she would see.


But no one sees them like that


when the Life goes away with me."


After that the game was finished


and they went out on the roof gar-


den and stood and looked up into


the blue above their heads. How


blue-how blue-how clear-how


near and real! And how far and un-


real the streets and sounds below.


The two children stood and looked

up and laughed at the sweetness


of it.


Then Judith felt a little tired.


"I will go and lie down on the


sofa," she said.


"Yes," the little girl answered. 


"It's time for you to go to sleep."


They went into the Closed Room    '


and Judith lay down. As she did


so, she saw that the door was stand-


ing open and remembered that her


mother was coming up to see her


and her playmate.


The little girl sat down by her. 


She put out her pretty fine hand


111                  /













<pb n="124"/>

and touched Judith for the first


time. She laid her little pointed


fingers on her forehead and Judith


fell asleep.


It seemed only a few minutes


before she wakened again. The


little girl was standing by her.


"Come," she said.


They went out together onto


the roof among the flowers, but a


strange - a beautiful thing had hap-


pened. The garden did not end at


the parapet and the streets and


houses were not below. The little













<pb n="125"/>

garden ended in a broad green


pathway-green with thick, soft


grass and moss covered with


trembling white and blue bell-like


flowers. Trees -fresh leaved as if


spring had just awakened them -


shaded it and made it look smiling


fair. Great white blossoms tossed 


on their branches and Judith felt


that the scent in the air came from


them. She forgot the city was be-


low, because it was millions and


millions of miles away, and this


was where it was right to be. There


was no mistake. This was real. All 


113 













<pb n="126"/>

the rest was unreal - and millions


and millions of miles away.


They held each other's slim-


pointed hands and stepped out up-


on the broad, fresh green pathway.


There was no boundary or end to


its beauty, and it was only another


real thing that coming towards


them from under the white, flower-


ing trees was Aunt Hester.


In the basement Jane Foster was


absorbed in her labours, which were


things whose accustomedness pro-


vided her with pleasure. She was

fond of her scrubbing, she enjoyed


the washing of her dishes, she defi-


nitely entertained herself with the


splash and soapy foam of her wash-


tubs and the hearty smack and


swing of her ironing. In the days


when she had served at the ribbon


counter in a department store, she 


had not found life as agreeable as


she had found it since the hours


which were not spent at her own


private sewing machine were given


to hearty domestic duties provid-


ing cleanliness, savoury meals, and


comfort for Jem.

She was so busy this particular


afternoon that it was inevitable


that she should forget all else but


the work which kept her on her


knees scrubbing floors or on a


chair polishing windows, and after-


wards hanging before them bits of


clean, spotted muslin.


She was doing this last when her


attention being attracted by wheels


in the street stopping before the


door, she looked out to see a


carriage door open and a young


woman, dressed in exceptionally


deep mourning garb, step onto













<pb n="129"/>

the pavement, cross it, and ascend


the front steps.


"Who's she?" Jane exclaimed


disturbedly. "Does she think the


house is to let because it's shut?" 


A ring at the front door bell called 


her down from her chair. Among 


the duties of a caretaker is natu-


rally included that of answering the


questions of visitors. She turned


down her sleeves, put on a fresh


apron, and ran up-stairs to the en-


trance hall.


When she opened the door, the 


tall, young woman in black stepped


117 













<pb n="130"/>

inside as if there were no reason


for her remaining even for a mo-


ment on the threshold.


"I am Mrs. Haldon," she said.


"I suppose you are the caretaker ?"


Haldon was the name of the


people to whom the house be-


longed. Jem Foster had heard only


the vaguest things of them, but


Jane remembered that the name


was Haldon, and remembering


that they had gone away because


they had had trouble, she recog-


nized at a glance what sort of


trouble it had been. Mrs. Haldon

was tall and young, and to Jane


Foster's mind, expressed from head


to foot the perfection of all that


spoke for wealth and fashion.


Her garments were heavy and rich


with crape, the long black veil,


which she had thrown back, swept


over her shoulder and hung behind 


her, serving to set forth, as it were,


more pitifully the white wornness


of her pretty face, and a sort of


haunting eagerness in her haggard


eyes. She had been a smart, lovely,


laughing and lovable thing, full of


pleasure in the world, and now she

was so stricken and devastated that


she seemed set apart in an awful


lonely world of her own.


She had no sooner crossed the


threshold than she looked about


her with a quick, smitten glance


and began to tremble. Jane saw her


look shudder away from the open


door of the front room, where the


chairs had seemed left as if set for


some gathering, and the wax-white


flowers had been scattered on the


floor.


She fell into one of the carved


hall seats and dropped her face in-













<pb n="133"/>

to her hands, her elbows resting on


her knees.


"Oh! No! No!" she cried. "I


can't believe it. I can't believe


it!"


Jane Foster's eyes filled with


good-natured ready tears of sym-


pathy.               %


"Won't you   come up-stairs,


ma'am ?" she said. " Wouldn't you


like to set in your own room per-


haps?"


"No! No!" was the answer.


"She was always there! She used


to come into my bed in the morn-

ing. She used to watch me dress to


go out. No! No!"


"I'll open the shutters in the


library," said Jane.


"Oh! No! No! No! She would


be sitting on the big sofa with her


fairy story-book. She's everywhere


-everywhere! How could I come!


Why did I! But I couldn't keep


away! I tried to stay in the moun-


tains. But I couldn't. Something


dragged me day and night. Nobody


knows I am here!" She got up and


looked about her again. "I have


never been in here since I went out

with her," she said. "They would


not let me come back. They said it


would kill me. And now I have


come - and everything is here -all


the things we lived with - and she


is millions and millions- and mil-


lions of miles away!" 


"Who-who-was it?" Jane 


asked timidly in a low voice.


"It was my little girl," the poor


young beauty said. "It was my


little Andrea. Her portrait is in the


library."


Jane began to tremble somewhat 


herself.                            :

<pb n="136"/>

"That-?"    she began- and


ended: "She is dead?"


Mrs. Haldon had dragged her-


self almost as if unconsciously to


the stairs. She leaned against the


newel post and her face dropped


upon her hand.


"Oh! I don't know!" she cried.


"I cannot believe it. How could it


be? She was playing in her nur-


sery - laughing and playing - and


she ran into the next room to show


me a flower - and as she looked up


at me-laughing, I tell you -laugh-


ing - she sank slowly down on her

knees -and the flower fell out of her


hand quietly-and everything went


out of her face -everything was


gone away from her, and there was


never anything more -never!" 


Jane Foster's hand had crept up


to her throat. She did not know      i


what made her cold.                 N


"My little girl-" she began,


"her name is Judith- "


"Where is she ?" said Mrs. Hal-


don in a breathless way.


"She is up-stairs," Jane answer-


ed slowly. "She goes--into that


back room--on the fourth floor-" 


125













<pb n="138"/>

Mrs. Haldon turned upon her


with wide eyes.


"It is locked!" she said. "They


put everything away. I have the


key."


"The door opens for her," said


Jane. "She goes to play with a


little girl-who comes to her. I


think she comes over the roof from


the next house."


"There is no child there!" Mrs.


Haldon shuddered. But it was not


with horror. There was actually a


wild dawning bliss in her face.


"What is she like?"













<pb n="139"/>

"She is like the picture." Jane


scarcely knew her own monoto-


nous voice. The world of real


things was being withdrawn from


her and she was standing without


its pale--alone with this woman


and her wild eyes. She began to


shiver because her warm blood was


growing cold. "She is a child with 


red hair--and there is a deep


dimple near her mouth. Judith told


me. You must not touch her."


She heard a wild gasp - a flash


of something at once anguish and


rapture blazed across the haggard,  ^

young face -and with a swerving


as if her slight body had been swept


round by a sudden great wind,


Mrs. Haldon turned and fled up


the stairs.


Jane Foster followed. The great


wind swept her upward too. She


remembered no single intake or


outlet of breath until she was upon


the fourth floor.


The door of the Closed Room


stood wide open and Mrs. Haldon


was swept within.


Jane Foster saw her stand in the


middle of the room a second, a tall,

swaying figure. She whirled to look


about her and flung up her arms


with an unearthly rapturous, whis-


pered cry:


"It is all as she left it when she 


ran to me and fell. She has been


here  to show me it is not so far!" 


She sank slowly upon her knees,


wild happiness in her face-wild


tears pouring down it.


"She has seen her!" And she


stretched forth yearning arms to-


wards the little figure of Judith,


who lay quiet upon the sofa in the 


corner. "Your little girl has seen


129 













<pb n="142"/>

her-and I dare not waken her.


She is asleep."


Jane stood by the sofa - looking


down. When she bent and touched


the child the stillness of the room


seemed to have got into her blood.


"No," she said, quivering, but


with a strange simplicity. "No!


not asleep! It was this way with


her Aunt Hester."

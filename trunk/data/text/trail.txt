The Trail of the Serpent
CHAPTER I
THE RUINED TOWER AND ITS TENANT

<p>Here, above, around, below,
On mountain or in glen,
Nor tree, nor shrub, nor plant, nor flower,
Nor aught of vegetative power,
  The weary eye may ken;
For all is rock at random thrown,
Black waves, bare rocks and banks of stone.
                          --SIR WALTER SCOTT.</p>
<p>                       Why, what art thou,
So withered and so wild in thy attire,
That lookst not like th' inhabitants of earth,
And yet are on't? Thou shouldst be woman,
And yet thy beard forbids us to interpret
That thou art so.               --SHAKESPEARE.</p>
<p>SOME few years ago, in an ancient family of Cornwall, in England, a series of events occurred of a nature so extraordinary as to seem incredible had not their authenticity been positively proven in the courts of law.</p>
<p>For some time we hesitated to use in fiction these facts, which seemed too marvelous even for a romantic narrative; but now we have decided to give the strange history under the guise of the following story--reminding any
<pb n="4 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

critic who may think the incidents "unreal," "impossible,"
that Shakespeare himself has warned us to</p>
<p>"With caution judge of probability;
Things deemed unnatural, even impossible, 
Experience oft hath proven to be true."</p>
<p>On the wildest part of the coast of Cornwall there is a frightful ravine cloven down through the cliffs, several hundred feet in depth, near the sea, but gradually lessening toward the interior, until half a mile away it disappears on the down.</p>
<p>At high tide this ravine is filled with water to half its depth and length. At low tide it is dry.</p>
<p>The chasm is called by the natives "Demondike," and there is a local tradition that it was fashioned out of the solid rocks by imps of darkness in one night.</p>
<p>But scientists hold that it was riven by some convulsion of nature in one moment.</p>
<p>Both science and tradition agree, however, that it had existed from a period to which the memory of man goes not back.</p>
<p>This portion of the coast belonged to the vast landed estate of the Hawkes, Earls of Hawkewood, whose ancient seat was situated on the edge of a deep forest some three miles back of the sea.</p>
<p>The course of Demondike was due south. On its western bank, near the ocean, were the ruins of an old watchtower, of which nothing remained but the guardroom on the ground floor, and the dungeon cut in the solid rocks below.</p>
<p>No human habitation had ever been raised within a mile of this fearful abyss until about twenty years before the opening of this story, when a strange woman had suddenly appeared there with a child and had taken up her abode in the strong room of the old watchtower.</p>
<p>Who she was, where she came from, how she got there, or when exactly she reached the spot, no one knew or could discover.</p>
<p>All that was ascertained was this:</p>
<p>One bitter-cold morning in February, when the snow
<pb n="5 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

was deep on the ground, the sky cloudless, the atmosphere crisp and clear, and objects could be seen from a long distance, the people of the hamlet of Hawkeville--a fishing village on the coast, some two miles east of Demondike, and also the property of the Earls of Hawkewood-observed smoke issuing from the old watchtower.</p>
<p>They knew it could not be on fire, since there was nothing left of it but stones, and stones do not burn, or if they do, never smoke.</p>
<p>In the dearth of incident in that isolated hamlet, even such an event as this seemed of great interest; and Penn, the locksmith, Tree, the tanner, and Proddy, the cobbler, set out through snow and ice, to walk to Demondike and find out whether a tribe of gypsies or a gang of smugglers had taken possession of the ruined watchtower--or whoever else might be the occupants.</p>
<p>They went for news, and returned, as Proddy, the cobbler declared, with a hornet in each ear.</p>
<p>Over their mugs of ale at the Black Bull Tavern that night they made this report:</p>
<p>That, as they approached the ruined watchtower-of which, be it remembered, nothing was left but the strong guard-room on the ground floor and the crypt, or dungeon, beneath it--they noticed that a rude top had been built of loose stones on the broken chimney, on the side of the tower next to them as they approached it.</p>
<p>Going around, they found the doorway--from which the door had been missing for centuries--hung with a coarse blue blanket.</p>
<p>They pushed aside this blanket and entered the room, into which the light and air came only from loopholes in the walls.</p>
<p>They found here no one but a child sleeping in a poor bed made up in rough deal box for a cradle.</p>
<p>It was a dark-complexioned child of about one year old, they thought, and that was all they could tell about it.</p>
<p>There was a fire of driftwood in the middle of the huge fireplace.</p>
<p>There was a rude wooden bedstead with a very clean bed, and a bright patchwork quilt and white pillows upon it.</p>
<pb n="6 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>There was a rude oaken table and several rough deal chairs and other simple articles of furniture.</p>
<p>The men stared in astonishment. How came all these things here? They had seen no sign of cart or horse, no tracks but their own in the snow.</p>
<p>How, then, came these things here?</p>
<p>It seemed like witchcraft.</p>
<p>Before they could find any clue to the mystery the blanket was pushed aside and the "witch" herself entered the room.</p>
<p>She was certainly not a gypsy.</p>
<p>That they all saw at once.</p>
<p>She was a tall, masculine-looking woman of about fifty years of age, with coarse, red hair of that peculiar shade which fades and turns rusty, but never grows white, and with light-gray eyes, fearful to look upon in their ferocity.</p>
<p>She wore a long, blue-serge gown, and over her uncombed elf locks she had tied a three-cornered red handkerchief.</p>
<p>She had come in from outside, yet, cold as the weather was, she seemed to have had no other garment.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" she demanded in a harsh and strident voice, as she glared upon the intruders.</p>
<p>The three men stood mute with amazement for a moment, and then Tree, the tanner, took his hat off his head, and holding it down before him with both hands, said:</p>
<p>"If you please, mistress, we saw smoke coming outen the tower, and we made so bold as to walk. over and see who had taken possession of the strong room."</p>
<p>"And now that you have seen, you may make 'so bold' as to turn around and go home again," said the Amazon, as she lifted up the blanket with one arm and stretched out the other with a commanding gesture.</p>
<p>"One word, mistress, if you please, before we go. We are his lordship's tenants, and this here property is on his lordship's land; so we would like to know whether you have got a permit from his lordship, Lord Hawkewood, or his lordship's steward, Mr. Traverse, or whether you be trespassing here," inquired Penn, the locksmith.</p>
<p>For all answer the virago strode across the room, seized
<pb n="7 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

up a double-barreled gun, and taking deliberate aim at the speaker, exclaimed:</p>
<p>"If you do not leave the room instantly I will send the whole of one charge through your carcass and the other through your companion's."</p>
<p>The locksmith threw up his hands in deprecation and turned and fled.</p>
<p>The tanner and the cobbler followed suit, for they could not tell for which of them the furious woman intended the second charge, if she should fire the first.</p>
<p>Half in zeal and half in resentment they betook themselves to Mr. Traverse, the Hawkewood steward, and told him of their discovery of smoke at the tower, their visit of investigation, and their meeting with the woman, whom they represented to be a tramp and a trespasser, if no worse.</p>
<p>But, to their surprise, Mr. Traverse advised them to mind their own affairs and leave the woman at the ruined watchtower alone, if they wished to continue in his lordship's favor.</p>
<p>And so the squatter, as she was called, continued to live in the tower and to rear the child she had brought with her.</p>
<p>Nothing more transpired at that time concerning the stranger or the child, except that her name was Nan Crook, and that of the child was Ham Gow.</p>
<p>Mr. Traverse, the steward, had let that much out over a social glass of rum and water with the parish clerk, Mr. Carr, in the parlor of the Black Bull.</p>
<p>Later on, in the early spring, Nan Crook was joined by a handsome young woman of about sixteen years of age, enough like the Amazon to have been her own daughter, and whom the villagers, for want of any other known name, began to speak of as "Young Nan." She was supposed to be the mother of the child; but this was mere conjecture.</p>
<p>In the August following the sudden advent of Nan Crook at the ruined tower, an incident occurred which every one thought must result in that woman's expulsion from the neighborhood.</p>
<pb n="8 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>But here it is necessary to give some little account of the feudal chief of the place.</p>
<p>Roscius Hawke, a cadet of the noble house of Hawkewood, was a captain of hussars, with only his pay and without the remotest probability of succeeding to the title and estates at the time when, at the age of twenty-five, he met and loved, with all the passion of his fiery young heart, the beautiful Isabel Blemiss, the portionless daughter of the Vicar of Hawkewood Parish.</p>
It was while he, Capt. Hawke, was on a visit to his uncle, Lord Hawkewood, at Hawke Hall, that he formed the young lady's acquaintance.</p>
<p>Very soon after that he made her an offer of marriage, which she accepted.</p>
<p>An early day was set for the wedding, and he invited his cousin, Lewis Manton, to come down and be introduced to his bride-elect, so as afterward to officiate as his groomsman.</p>
<p>Fatal confidence!</p>
<p>Lewis Manton joined the captain at Hawke Hall, where the latter was still stopping, and he met Isabel Blemiss.</p>
<p>Lewis Manton was handsome, fascinating, and the heir of an unencumbered estate of twenty thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>A sudden, mutual passion sprang up between the trusted friend and the betrothed bride of Roscius Hawke.</p>
<p>In brief, the selfish and fickle beauty transferred her favor to the richer and handsomer suitor, who did not hesitate to steal his cousin's affianced bride, if that could be said to be stolen which was taken with the knowledge
and connivance of a worldly-minded and unprincipled mother, who so effectually aided and abetted the treacherous friend and fickle sweetheart as to have them married from her house.</p>
<p>Roscius Hawke never got over his disappointment, and never forgave anyone concerned in the wrong that had been done him.</p>
<p>He who had seemed blameless up to that time became totally changed.</p>
<p>He lived the wild life of a reckless bachelor, both when
<pb n="9 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

on duty in the barracks and when on furlough at some fashionable seaside resort, or in some continental city.</p>
<p>Long years afterward, when the gradual failure of the elder branch of the family left the title and estates of Hawkewood to him as heir-at-law, and he, at the age of sixty-five, became fifteenth Earl of Hawkewood, he entered upon his new and unexpected honors with two deep regrets--the first was, that his hated cousin and successful rival, Lewis Manton, was his heir-presumptive, who, failing him, would succeed to the earldom; bringing even an alien name to the ancient title! His second regret was, that he himself had not married earlier in life and provided himself with a long line of sons and daughters to succeed him, and to carry down his name, as well as his title, to remote generations.</p>
<p>He promptly determined to redeem his error by taking a wife, hoping it might not yet be too late to prevent the succession of Lewis Manton.</p>
<p>Thus hatred as well as ambition spurred him on to his late marriage.</p>
<p>He sought health and vigor in his bride, rather than rank, wealth, or even beauty, yet he found all these in a duke's daughter, who accepted his offer of marriage, notwithstanding his sixty-five years.</p>
<p>In the second year of this union his longing was gratified by the birth of an heir; but at a great sacrifice, for in the same hour in which the son came into this world the mother passed out of it.</p>
<p>The calamity was due to a fatal accident, which happened in this way: From her earliest infancy, the countess had suffered from an intense fear and horror of snakes--so that even the sight of a coiled string on the floor, or of a curled twig on the ground, would cause her to start and shriek, or turn pale and faint, as the case might be.</p>
<p>This morbid fear and horror had "grown with her growth and strengthened with her strength."</p>
<p>In her last days it also might have been, and probably was, greatly augmented by the incident to which we have alluded in connection with the wild woman, Nan Crook.</p>
<p>It was about the first of August, six months after the strange woman's arrival in the neighborhood, that Nan
<pb n="10 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

made her way to the Hall and insisted on seeing the countess, who declined to admit her.</p>
<p>Nan, however, succeeded, by following one of the servants, in forcing her way to the presence of the lady, whom without any apparent cause and in pure malignity, she proceeded to upbraid and curse, telling her that she, the countess--was a serpent, and should die by the fangs of a serpent.</p>
<p>The lady, nervous, sensitive, and very morbid, shrieked and fainted with fright. The woman was put out of the room and out of the house, and the lady treated until she recovered consciousness.</p>
<p>But the hag's words dwelt on the countess' mind and depressed her spirits, notwithstanding that her husband and all her attendants assured her that this malignant crone had, doubtless, heard of the countess' dread of snakes, and had taken advantage of it to terrify her.</p>
<p>But it happened unfortunately, on the last day of the same month of August, and some few weeks before she expected to become a mother, Lady Hawkewood was walking alone in a secluded part of the park, when a harmless little grass snake crossed her path.</p>
<p>She screamed and sprang aside, and in doing so inadvertently trod upon its tail.</p>
<p>The reptile, also frightened, and trying to defend itself coiled around her ankle and struck its teeth into her flesh.</p>
<p>And then the lady fell to the ground in a deep swoon, just as one of the under-keepers, who had seen the whole affair from a distance, darted to her rescue.</p>
<p>The snake had made good its escape.</p>
<p>The lady was raised and laid upon a hastily constructed litter, made by a door taken from its hinges and covered with a quantity of pillows and blankets, all brought from the keeper's cottage.</p>
<p>She was borne tenderly and carefully to the Hall, where she arrived in a state of profound unconsciousness, from which she was only aroused by severe illness.</p>
<p>The village doctor was summoned in haste.</p>
<p>The next morning a delicate little baby boy was hurried too soon into the world.</p>
<pb n="11 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>But the same instant that the child drew his first breath of life the mother yielded up her last.</p>
<p>And the baby bore a birthmark that he would surely carry to his grave, even though he should live to the age of Methuselah--it was as if a slender green snake had coiled itself around his tiny ankle and left an indelible
impression there!</p>
<p>The village doctor noticed it, and the nurse shuddered as she saw it.</p>
<p>Four days after this sudden birth and death the mortal remains of the Countess of Hawkewood were laid, with great pomp and ceremony, in the family mausoleum in the park.</p>
<p>The bereaved husband aroused himself from the stupor of grief into which his wife's sudden and shocking death had plunged him, and began to give all his thought and care to the fragile little being who had cost him so dear, and in whose frail life was bound up all his hopes of sending down his ancient name and title to future generations.</p>
<p>A very strong, healthy, cheerful young woman, whose own new-born babe had been taken to heaven, was engaged to nurse the motherless infant.</p>
<p>A young medical man, who had just made his mark in his profession by writing a prize treatise on the health and nurture of children, was specially engaged to reside at the Hall and devote all his care and skill to the preservation of the life of this precious child, in consideration of a salary double the amount of the income he could hope to make in the first years of his practice.</p>
<p>His contract with the earl was for three years, if the child should last so long.</p>
<p>All this involved extraordinary expense, which, however, could be well afforded by an earl with a rent roll of fifty thousand pounds per annum, and with the life of his only son and heir at stake.</p>
<p>In doing all this the Earl of Hawkewood was actuated by three of the strongest passions that could govern the mind of man--love, ambition, and hatred--love for his son of such intensity as can be felt by none save the aged parent of an only child, in whose life is bound up all his affection and all his pride; ambition that this precious son
<pb n="12 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

should live to succeed to the honored and historic name and title that his forefathers had borne with dignity for so many generations; and lastly, hatred--fierce-burning and consuming hatred of the man who had wrought him a bitter, unpardonable wrong, and who, failing this fragile babe, should come into the ancient earldom, bringing even an alien patronymic to the time-honored title.</p>
<p>And well, we know, had Lewis Manton earned that hatred!</p>
<p>The grudge was an old one, dating back to the days of the youth of both, but it had lost nothing by the flight of time. On the contrary, it had grown deeper and fiercer with the passage of years!</p>
<p>Bitter as wormwood was the thought that this detested rival might succeed him.</p>
<p>And thus hatred and ambition as well as paternal love moved the earl to use every ordinary and extraordinary means for the preservation of his heir's life.</p>
<p>Under the intelligent direction of the young physician and the fostering care of the healthy nurse, the fragile baby boy thrived and grew strong, so that at the end of the first twelve months he was as fine a child as any other of his age.</p>
<p>But the earl, who had led a fast life and somewhat impaired his own originally good constitution, began now to fail.</p>
<p>Feeling that he might depart this world at any time, he made his will--not to devise his estate, for that was strictly entailed, every acre of it, and went with the title-but to provide proper guardianship for his heir.</p>
<p>And here he showed the "ruling passion strong," in the presence of the great change which we miscall "death."</p>
<p>He had led a wild and reckless life which had often imperiled his existence, and had finally shortened his days. He was, therefore, "posted" on the effects of such a career as his own had been, and he was resolved that his son should not be exposed to similar perils.</p>
<p>Horace should be "trained up in the way he should go"--the safe way that led through a straight and narrow road to respectability of character and length of days.</p>
<p>So he searched for and found the man he wanted as a guardian for his only son. You can get any sort of a man
<pb n="13 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

you want in London if you have only money enough to seek him and to secure him.</p>
<p>The earl discovered a poor doctor of divinity who loved study better than he did the care of a parish; a man of highest church principles and strictest piety; much of a Pharisee and very much more of a martinet, but, withal, learned and very conscientious.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Laude was "interviewed" by the earl in person, and found competent and willing to undertake the duties proposed to him.</p>
<p>In fact, the prospect of living at Hawke Hall, with a handsome salary, as resident guardian and tutor of the infant heir, passing his days, for twenty years or so, in the richly stored library, surrounded by heights and depths and lengths and breadths of shelves piled with priceless and ancient lore; and with no heavier duties to perform than those of directing the studies and correcting the morals of one little lad--seemed very attractive indeed to the worthy old bachelor.</p>
<p>Associated with him in the guardianship of the child was Mr. Anthony Poinsett, the family solicitor, who would look after the estate and the moneyed interests of the heir, taking all that sort of trouble off the doctor's hands.</p>
<p>But the earl, who had the advantage of the constant presence of Dr. Ellis, the gifted young physician whom he had engaged for his son, lived longer than he had expected to do. He lived to see Horace a robust lad of five years; and then, at the age of seventy-two, he passed away, and the direct heir became, in his infancy, the sixteenth Earl of Hawkewood.</p>
<p>And thus the lad never remembered the time when he had not been "My Lord," and thus also he grew up as indifferent to his title as habit and usage could make him.</p>
<p>But here was this unfortunate heir to an ancient earldom and an immense estate placed in a position so false as to make him a dislocated member of the human family, and to be that is to suffer as much pain as a dislocated limb.</p>
<p>With all the high spirit and elf-will of his father, and all the sensitive delicacy and nervous irritability of his mother, the young Horace required a training that should be at once firm and gentle, conscientious and sympathetic.</p>
<pb n="14 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Instead of having such aids to the repression of his evil and the development of his good, he was placed in just the opposite circumstances--paced in the care of an intensely blinded egotist, Pharisee and martinet, who had much learning without any wisdom, and great piety without any charity.</p>
<p>This is no paradox, as it may seem to be.</p>
<p>Yet Dr. Paul Laude was sincere, earnest, and consistent in all that he thought, said, and did.</p>
<p>He lived at the Hall and devoted himself to his pupil with rigorous conscientiousness.</p>
<p>He took him from the hands of his nursery governess and personally drilled him in the rudimentary branches of an English education, saying that even for these a child required a thoroughly learned man for his teacher; for if the foundation were not perfect the superstructure could not be good.</p>
<p>He grounded his pupil well and solidly in all that he taught him, from the correct spelling of simple English words, on through days and years of hard work for both, up to the proper construction of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew theses.</p>
<p>Very little recreation was allowed the boy. A solemn walk, ride, or drive with his tutor every afternoon, a semiannual visit in the spring to London, and in the autumn to the seaside--where the scene was changed, but not the companion or the habits--these comprised all of variety in the life of the youthful heir--except indeed the annual birthday fe&ecirc;te, given on the first of every September to the tenants and dependants of Hawkewood in honor of their young landlord.</p>
<p>This was not much to the taste of the austere Dr. Laude, who had no sympathy with such vanities; but it was done in accordance with a family custom that had prevailed for centuries at Hawkewood and was held in great favor by the people, who looked forward all the year to the birthday fe&ecirc;te on the first of September, with only less of joyful anticipations than they looked forward to the blessed Christmas.</p>
<p>One alteration the doctor made; he stopped the dancing.</p>
<p>Beef and ale were unlimited, but fiddles and bagpipes
<pb n="15 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

were prohibited. The men and women might eat to satiety and drink to stupidity, but they should not dance!</p>
<p>This gave great dissatisfaction. But the heir promised that, after he should have come of age, they should dance every year.</p>
<p>But just here we should revert to the story of the weird women who had taken undisputed possession of the ruined watchtower at the entrance of Demondike.</p>
<p>All the villagers had wondered much that they had been suffered to remain there, especially after the unprovoked and malignant assault upon the young countess, that might almost be said to have been the remote cause of the lady's death; and much gossip was rife concerning the cause of the earl's forbearance, which gossip took a definite form as years passed and the little vagrant at the dike developed a striking likeness to the little heir at the Hall, and the wild bachelor life of the earl was recalled to memory.</p>
<p>After the death of the earl and the accession of the infant heir, under the guardianship of the austere doctor of divinity, it was thought that the Hag of Demondike-as the woman in the ruined watchtower was popularly called--would, with her reputed daughter and grandchild, certainly be expelled from her lawless home and driven from the estate; but, to the continued wonder of the tenantry, she was suffered to remain, notwithstanding that her reputation was of the very worst description, a quack doctress, a fortune teller, and a witch, a harborer of thieves, poachers and smugglers--all these and worse than these she was said to be!</p>
<p>It was confidently asserted that her mysterious arrival on the coast, which had so puzzled the good people of the locality at the time of its occurrence, was to be explained by the fact that a smuggling craft had brought her over from the coast of France, with all her household goods and with her questionable child.</p>
<p>One day a fishwoman, with a courageous heart and inquiring mind, went to the ruined watchtower to have her fortune told.</p>
<p>After having crossed the witch's hand with a bright sixpence and been fooled to the bent of her humor, she said:</p>
<pb n="16 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"Now I will give you another sixpence if you tell me what that boy's name is."</p>
<p>"Ham," curtly replied the woman.</p>
<p>"Ham? Yes, Ham, I know; but does that mean Hamlet, or Hamden, or Hamilton, or what?"</p>
<p>"It means Ham, the accursed son of Noah. No more nor no less!" cried the hag, with a glare from her gray eyes as terrible as it was unaccountable to the woman, who rose up in a hurry and went off.</p>
<p>How the women and the child managed to live, it is hard to say, for the reputed quack doctress had no patients, the fortune teller few dupes, and the witch no victims; yet they seemed to want nothing.</p>
<p>When the dark-skinned, black-eyed boy was seven years of age, Granny Crook suddenly appeared in the village one Sabbath morning, and led him into the Sabbath-school, saying that she wished him taught to read and write.</p>
<p>If his Satanic majesty had called upon Dr. Paul Laude in person, and expressed an anxiety to learn "how to be saved," it could scarcely have created a greater sensation in the village.</p>
<p>However, the child so brought was in no wise to be cast out.</p>
<p>Little Ham was received into the Sabbath-school and taught to read; he was not taught to write, for they did not teach writing there; but in due time he was entered in the parish day school, which was flourishing under the patronage of the infant Earl of Hawkewood, or rather under that of his guardian, Dr. Paul Laude, in the earl's name.</p>
<p>In these schools little Ham, by his genuine curiosity, quick intelligence, and constant industry, made great progress in knowledge of elementary books, and also in the good opinion of his teachers. He was always neatly dressed and well-behaved.</p>
<p>It has been said that the perish school was supported by the young earl, through his guardian. Now, one of the most frequent goals of the solemn walks the little Lord Hawkewood was in the habit of taking with his tutor, Dr. Laude, happened to be the parish school, where the worthy doctor was accustomed to deliver a short lecture to the pupils.</p>
<pb n="17 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Here Horace first met Ham Gow, and through some instinctive mutual affinity made his acquaintance, and soon inaugurated a surreptitious intimacy with the lad that was destined to affect the lives of both.</p>
<p>But so strictly did the tutor and guardian of the young Lord Hawkewood carry out the instructions of the late Earl, in "training up the boy in the way he should go" and in guarding him from the "evil communications which corrupt good manners," that he seldom or never lost sight of his charge.</p>
<p>The master and pupil read, worked, and took their meals together; they also, as has been said, walked, rode, and drove together.</p>
<p>The only time in the day when Horace could escape from his mentor would be immediately after their early dinner, when the old doctor would fall asleep in his easychair and be safe for a couple of hours at least.</p>
<p>Then the lad would slip off to meet his one humble playmate, Ham Gow, whose school would be let out just about that hour, and they would go off on some boyish adventure together.</p>
<p>Even in those early days the little Earl of Hawkewood envied the freedom of the young vagrant of Demondike.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the careful guardian and tutor never suspected these stolen adventures, or even the acquaintance that had sprung up between his high-born, jealously guarded ward and pupil and the nameless, tameless young vagrant of Demondike who was only known as Ham Gow.</p>
<p>At this time young Gow had not a bad reputation.</p>
<p>Under the eyes of his pastors and masters he was a model pupil for he really had a very bright, inquiring mind, and his progress did them credit.</p>
<p>But out of their sight he was as daring and reckless a boy as you would meet within a year's journey.</p>
<p>It was doubtless this wild element in the young scamp's character that formed his chief attraction for the too strictly guarded little earl.</p>
<p>Many a truant expedition and many a lawless adventure had they together.</p>
<p>In their first intimacy they only met surreptitiously in the daytime while the old doctor would be enjoying his
<pb n="18 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

after-dinner nap; and their worst misdemeanors were then the robbing of birds' nests or apple orchards on the earl's own land.</p>
<p>But later on they grew more reckless, so that Horace would rise from his bed at night and steal out to join Ham, who would be waiting for him in the park, and they would go out poaching in the little lord's own preserves.</p>
<p>Thus the young earl would, in company with his confederate, kill his own game and rob himself-all for a mere "lark" to bother and mystify the gamekeepers and have some "fun" out of them.</p>
<p>One unlucky night, when the keepers were out, armed looking for poachers, the boys were fired at, very slightly wounded with birdshot, and taken prisoners before they were recognized.</p>
<p>Then you may judge of the terrible fright Gubbins, the head keeper, was in at having injured his youthful lordship.</p>
<p>Hanging for himself and all his companions seemed to be the mildest form of punishment he anticipated.</p>
<p>But all he had to do was to convey the two prisoners to the Hall, and wake up the servants, and get the butler to call the Rev. Dr. Laude.</p>
<p>Now, if there was terror among the gamekeepers, there was certainly consternation among the servants.</p>
<p>And when Dr. Laude came down, his shame and horror at discovering his ward and pupil in such a plight was unlimited and utterly indescribable.</p>
<p>His emotions deprived him of the power of speech.</p>
<p>Horace laughed aloud, and Ham joined him.</p>
<p>Then Horace said:</p>
<p>"Doctor, you can't prosecute a fellow for poaching in his own preserves, can you? No, nor his friend for going with him, either," he added, turning and clasping the hand of Ham as if to protect him.</p>
<p>"Leave my presence, sir!" exclaimed the shocked and offended tutor, as soon as he could speak. "As for you," he continued, turning to the terrified keepers, "you did right to shoot. If you had killed them both in the exercise of your duties you would have been blameless. Now turn that young vagabond out of the house, and if you ever
<pb n="19 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

catch him on the premises again put him in the stocks," he concluded, pointing to Ham Gow.</p>
<p>"Thank your reverence very much. You needn't trouble, Gubbins--I can get off without you. Good-by, Horry, I wouldn't be you for all you possess!" exclaimed the young outlaw, as he turned and left the Hall.</p>
<p>The result of this escapade was that the young nobleman went immediately to Eton, and the young vagabond, missing his companion, and weary with solitude and monotony, ran away to sea.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Laude accompanied the young earl to Eton, and took up his abode in lodgings near the college, that he might personally superintend the studies and the conduct of his charge.</p>
<p>After that the young nobleman and his wild companion saw but little of each other, Lord Hawkewood passing his time at college, and Ham Gow coming and going to and from the neighborhood of Demondike at long intervals of time. Later on, when the young earl entered Oxford, Dr. Paul Laude accompanied him thither also, and look lodgings for both in the same house, that he might still assist in the higher and more abstruse studies, as well as watch over the morals and manners of his pupil.</p>
<p>Now, if this constant surveillance had been irksome to the boy and galling to the youth, it had grown to be well-nigh maddening to the young man.</p>
<p>He began to hate his rank, his title, his heavy estates, and, above all, his tutor--to hate him, that is, with a strong antagonism, but not with malice. He did not wish to injure him--he only longed to be rid of him, and rid of him forever.</p>

CHAPTER II
THE FATAL BIRTHDAY FE&ecirc;TE

<p>Ring, joyous chords! Ring out again!
A swifter still and a wilder strain!
They are here, the fair face and the careless heart,
And the stars shall wane ere the mirthful part.
<pb n="20 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

But I met a dimly mournful glance
In a sudden turn of the flying dance.
I heard the tone of a heavy sigh
In a pause of the thrilling melody.
                     --FELICIA HEMANS.</p>
<p>THE young Earl of Hawkewood came down from Oxford, still accompanied by his guardian, to spend the summer vacation at Hawke Hall.</p>
<p>Youthful, handsome, amiable, intellectual, accomplished, wealthy, noble, honored, he was, nevertheless, discontented even to despondency.</p>
<p>He was now approaching his nineteenth birthday, and had rather more than two years yet to live and endure before he should reach his majority and--freedom.</p>
<p>He fretted grievously under the severe restraint imposed upon him, and he began to feel and to say to himself that the two remaining years of such tutelage could not be borne.</p>
<p>He fell into a state of melancholy verging on despair.</p>
<p>It was impossible that his condition should not become manifest to the whole establishment, as it did, long before it reached the obtuse perceptions of the absent-minded bookworm and martinet of routine whom he had for a guardian.</p>
<p>It is even possible that the mental condition of the ward might never have been observed by the guardian had not the fact been brought to his attention by Dr. Ellis, the young physician, who had, at one time, taken the exclusive charge of the young heir's health as resident medical attendant, and who was now following a lucrative and general practice in the village of Hawkewood and the surrounding country.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellis had seen the young earl at church on the first Sunday after his return. He had afterward called at the Hall to pay his respects. On both these occasions the physician had observed his former patient with a professional eye, and feeling the deepest interest in the young man, whose life he had been instrumental in saving, he took an early occasion to seek a private interview with the guardian, and lay the case of the ward before him.</p>
<pb n="21 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"His lordship's life should be changed, or he may fall into melancholy madness," said the doctor, plainly.</p>
<p>"How would you have it changed?" inquired the guardian with ponderous dignity.</p>
<p>"I would have his lordship go more into society, see more company--young company suitable to his age--and I would have him form the acquaintance of eligible young Ladies with a view toward marriage at no very distant day," replied the doctor.</p>
<p>The guardian might have started if he had not been a very ponderous old man, for the words of the physician recalled to his mind a forgotten duty--a piece of instruction left by the late earl for the guidance of the guardian and the benefit of his ward--that the latter, as he grew toward manhood, should be associated with young ladies of his own rank and of suitable age, with a view to an early and advantageous matrimonial union.</p>
<p>He ad not read his late patron's will, or the accompanying letter of instructions, since the day after the deceased earl's funeral; hence, though he had followed every direction that came into force at that time, and had continued up to the present, yet this, which was to affect the later years of the boy's minority, he had ignored and subsequently forgotten.</p>
<p>When the professor's mind was once aroused he could be very prompt in his actions.</p>
<p>He determined to make the approaching birthday fe&ecirc;te of the first of September the occasion of bringing together the country families and introducing his ward to their acquaintance.</p>
<p>He consulted the young earl on the subject, but was met with so much indifference on the part of his lordship as to surprise and discourage him.</p>
<p>"Pray do as you please, and invite whom you please. You have always acted without reference to me. Continue to do so," had been Lord Hawkewood's answer.</p>
<p>So Dr. Laude, in addition to the usual out-of-doors fe&ecirc;te given to the tenantry and retainers, issued cards for a dinner and ball to the gentry and nobility of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>These invitations were generally accepted by the old
<pb n="22 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

friends and neighbors of the Hall family, who had been so long ignored as to have grown cynical over the seclusion of the young earl, and to have ascribed that seclusion to various causes not very complimentary to his lordship.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors thought the young earl might be epileptic, or feeble-minded, from the fright his mother had received on the day before his premature birth; and Lewis Manton, the grandson of Lewis the traitor and of Isabel the fickle, thought that Horace must be very unhealthy in body and mind, and would not be likely to keep him long out of the title and estates to which he--Lewis--was the heir presumptive.</p>
<p>And Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Ball, of Bowling Downs, thought that nothing ailed the young man but want of wholesome amusement and cheerful society.</p>
<p>All these returned acceptances to the invitations.</p>
<p>The first of September, the day of the fe&ecirc;te, was clear and bright.</p>
<p>The old Hall looked grand and festive as it stood a vast dark-red, oblong building, flanked by four towers, and crowning a swelling hill, with a background of dense forest.</p>
<p>The Hall fronted the sea, from which, however, it was three miles distant, with a stretch of undulating downs between it and the coast.</p>
<p>On the day of the fe&ecirc;te flags flew from the tops of the towers, and tents were spread and tables laid throughout the grounds for the accommodation of the tenantry and the agricultural laborers and their families.</p>
<p>All these were assembled at an early hour, for they were to be entertained and feasted all day long, until sunset, when they were to be dismissed to their homes-each man, woman, and child with a small present in money.</p>
<p>In the evening the nobility and gentry of the neighborhood were to be entertained with a dinner and ball.</p>
<p>It was afternoon, and the festivities on the grounds were at their climax.</p>
<p>Crowds of gayly dressed villagers and country people swarmed over the greensward and through the groves; old men and women ate and drank in the tents; young men and girls danced--for this occasion only--on the grass.</p>
<p>The young Earl of Hawkewood, pale, thin, and melan-
<pb n="23 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT "/>

choly, walked among his guests--more like their idea of the ghost of a man than a man--bestowing a warm smile or a kind greeting upon some humble friend or acquaintance.</p>
<p>"Ah! poor young gentleman, he looks not long for this world," said Penn, the little red-haired locksmith.</p>
<p>And then yon Lew Manton will be airl in his place," sighed Proddy, the small, gray-haired cobbler.</p>
<p>"Burn that Lew Manton!" exclaimed Tree, the tall, gaunt, swarthy tanner, of whom the people were accustomed to say that he had soaked his complexion in his own tanning vats.</p>
<p>These three men were cronies, always to be found together, and were now grouped around one end of a long table, filling themselves with bread, beef, and ale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the young man walked on, the saddest human being on the grounds that day.</p>
<p>But presently his worn face lighted up with a smile as he hastened to meet a stranger whom he saw rather hesitatingly approaching from toward the sea.</p>
<p>A stranger! It was a tramp! A tramp of the roughest, rudest, and most disreputable aspect, yet one of a free, handsome, joyous, dare-devil countenance.</p>
<p>Yet the young earl hurried to meet him and held out his hand, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Why, Ham! Dear old fellow! A thousand welcomes! I am so glad to see you!"</p>
<p>The tramp took off his battered hat and bowed low before his feudal chief.</p>
<p>"Ah! you bring with you the very breezes of life, motion, liberty! You come to me as the sea wind comes to the becalmed ship! as the thunderstorm and the rising torrent come to the dried-up stream and the stagnant pool! Your very garments flutter with freedom!" exclaimed the young earl.</p>
<p>The tramp stared at this rhapsody. He did not understand a word of it.</p>
<p>Ah! it is fine to be you, Ham! It is very fine to be you!"</p>
<p>The tramp continued to stare with astonishment, as well he might.</p>
<p>Why, the speaker was the young Earl of Hawkewood, one
<pb n="24 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

of the wealthiest noblemen in the British empire! This was the grand fe&ecirc;te day, when all his tenantry and his retainers were being feasted on the grounds, and all the nobility and gentry of the neighborhood were to be entertained in the Hall--while he, the tramp, was at the best of times but a poor hanger-on to the estate, without a shilling of his own in the world, or the least disposition to earn one.</p>
<p>There could scarcely have been a greater contrast on earth than was shown in the relative positions of these two men.</p>
<p>Yet in their personal appearance they were singularly alike, notwithstanding the great difference in their costume--and gossip said that they were very near of kin.</p>
<p>Both were of the medium height, and of slender, elegant figures. Both had stately heads, broad, full foreheads, straight noses, short upper lips, and projecting chins. Both had dark-brown hair and beautiful dark-gray eyes, with heavy, overhanging eyebrows.</p>
<p>So far they were exactly alike, but here the likeness ended.</p>
<p>The young nobleman had a clear, pale complexion, well-trimmed, short hair, parted on the left side, and a well-clipped, short mustache, and he wore the faultless morning dress of a gentleman--a neatly fitting, closely buttoned black frock coat, gray pantaloons, patent leather boots, perfect gloves, speckless linen, and a white japonica in his buttonhole.</p>
<p>Ham Gow, the tramp, had a complexion so disguised with dust that it would have been difficult to tell its original hue, while he wore his dark hair and beard long and rough, and was clothed in a brown smock frock and loose tweed trousers, all much the worse for wear and tear, and had on his feet heavy boots, so laden with clay from muddy roads and so broken withal that they could scarcely keep their hold.</p>
<p>Surely if there was a very striking likeness in the forms and features of the earl and the tramp, there was an equally striking contrast in their costumes and positions.</p>
<p>"Fine to be me, my lord! That is likely enough!" exclaimed the tramp, with a stare of amazement and a harsh and bitter laugh.</p>
<pb n="25 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"Yes! I repeat, it is fine to be you! You are free! You come and go when and where you like! And there is no one to say to you: 'Do this,' or 'Don't do that,' 'You must,' or 'You must not!'" persisted the young gentleman.</p>
<p>"No, there never has been. Not that ever I knew. Nobody ever cared that much for me," replied the tramp, with the harsh and discordant laugh that grated so unpleasantly on the sensitive ears of the young earl.</p>
<p>"Where do you come from last, Gow?" inquired his lordship.</p>
<p>"How can I tell, my lord? 'From going to and fro on the earth, and walking up and down in it,' like Satan in the history of Job. Last night I slept on the sheltered side of a barn on Farmer Perry's place."</p>
<p>"Have you been out of England since I saw you last?"</p>
<p>"'Since you saw me last!' Let us see. When was that, my lord?"</p>
<p>"About two years ago. Ah! I have a better memory than you have, Gow. I do not enjoy such a constant change of scene to confuse it, you know."</p>
<p>"Two years ago! Why, I have been all over the world in that time. I have dug for silver in Colorado, for gold in Australia, and for diamonds in Cape Colony," replied the tramp, grinning until he showed all his strong, white teeth in contrast to his dark mustache and beard.</p>
<p>"Oh! you happy fellow!" exclaimed the young earl, with a look of admiration and envy.</p>
<p>"Didn't find anything, though. Came back as poor as I went. Worked my passage home on an East Indiaman, from Calcutta, that stopped at the Cape of Good Hope," added the tramp.</p>
<p>"Still, I repeat, you are a happy fellow, to come and go so freely."</p>
<p>"One gets tired of that sort of thing after a while--deuced tired," exclaimed the tramp bitterly, as he eyed the young nobleman with a cynical air.</p>
<p>"See here; I know how tired a man may grow of monotony, but I cannot understand how anyone can weary of perpetual change and variety."</p>
<p>"They can, then. You just try it for yourself, my lord," said the tramp, with an ugly scowl.</p>
<pb n="26 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"I wish I might try it!" exclaimed the young earl.</p>
<p>"I wish so, too," muttered the tramp.</p>
<p>"See here, Gow," said Lord Hawkewood, suddenly, and good-naturedly. "If you really would like to leave your wandering life and settle down, I think I can do something for you. You have a good common education, and--the master of my charity school is about to leave us to take an usher's place in Penzance. You may succeed him, if you like. The salary is fifty pounds a year, with a cottage furnished, and a garden, rent free."</p>
<p>"All under the vicar! No, I thank you, my lord. I will call no man master. The vicar and I would never get on. Besides, I don't like to be tied down to hours, my lord. I thank you all the same," replied Gow, with a disagreeable laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, Gow, I am sorry the suggestion does not suit you, but if there should be anything I could do for you at any time, I hope you will let me know it."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my lord, but I do not think there will be."</p>
<p>"Here, Ham, take this for old acquaintance' sake," said the earl, pressing a five-pound note into the hand of Gow, who closed his fingers upon it with a bow and a growl.</p>
<p>"And-come closer, Ham. Listen!" whispered the earl.</p>
<p>The tramp drew to his side and bent down.</p>
<p>"Stay about here until night--until late at night or early in the morning, and then, when all the guests are gone and all the household is quiet, you come to the servants' entrance and ask for me."</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
<p>"My valet will be there to admit you, and will bring you to my room, and you shall tell me something about your travels, for I know they must have been out of the course of commonplace tours."</p>
<p>"I should think so, my lord," laughed the man.</p>
<p>"Do not forget," added the young gentleman, as he moved off.</p>
<p>"All right, my lord," answered the tramp, pulling his dark elf locks by way of a bow, and snarling as he muttered:</p>
<p>"Fine to be me, is it?--a homeless, friendless, penniless, nameless ragamuffin, who never had a father or a mother
<pb n="27 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

as he knows of, and never can tell where his next meal or bed is to come from! And he, an earl, with a rent roll of fifty thousand pounds a year, and all the beauties of the shire at his feet, no doubt! And yet--and yet--the old woman at Demondike says that we are brothers! Maybe so! 'All men are brethren,' for that matter, though the wealthy and prosperous seem to disallow their relationship
to the poor and unfortunate! Heigh-ho! I shall wait upon my noble brother to-night, and see what he wants of me, and--what I can make out of him!"</p>
<p>With these words Ham Gow moved off to join a set of farm laborers who, with their wives and children, were feasting on bread and cheese, beef and beer, in one of the many tents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the young earl walked toward the house, bowing and smiling, on the right and left, to the men in smock frocks and the women in smart gowns, who bowed or courtesied to him as he passed.</p>
<p>Near the house he met a tall, stout, heavy, gray-haired man, in a long, black frock coat all the way down to his heels, and a black velvet skull cap on his round head.</p>
<p>This was, of course, Dr. Paul Laude.</p>
<p>"Ah, my lord! You should not neglect your guests so long," began the doctor, who usually greeted his pupil with a criticism or a rebuke.</p>
<p>"I have just come from among my guests, sir," retorted the young man, turning and waving his hand toward the multitude of people whom he had left in the grounds.</p>
<p>The doctor followed the indication of his ward's hand, and shrugged his shoulders as he answered:</p>
<p>"Ah! them. That is all very well, as far as it goes; but you have other and more important guests, my lord, who have done us the honor to accept our invitations, and have come here to celebrate your natal day. Your cousin, Lewis Manton, is here in response to my invitation."</p>
<p>"He here! And at your bidding, Dr. Laude! I am very much astonished! You knew, sir, that my late father detested the very name of that false family, as he had every reason to do!" exclaimed the young earl, in a tone of indignant remonstrance such as he had never before ventured to use in speaking to his tutor, for whom the
<pb n="28 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

habit of reverential submission that had been formed in his earliest childhood had clung to him ever since.</p>
<p>"Your father, my young friend, had, or supposed he had, good reason for hating the elder Lewis Manton; but he has followed his foe to the other world. This young man is his grandson, who never did either your father or yourself an injury. He is, besides, your cousin and your heir presumptive. In giving this birthday ball in honor of your nineteenth anniversary, and in bidding the principal county families to the place, I could not in decency omit him, your nearest, I may say your only kinsman, replied the doctor, with great gravity and dignity.</p>
<p>"I do not like him! I do not want him here!" exclaimed the young man, with his fine, pale face flushing.</p>
<p>"It is time this family feud had ceased. I thought so, and I held out the olive branch to Lewis, and he has taken it kindly."</p>
<p>"I am very sorry for it. I wish you had consulted me before taking so important a step."</p>
<p>"Did I not do so, and did you not particularly request me to use my own judgment concerning this fe&ecirc;te?" demanded the doctor.</p>
<p>"It is true; but I could not have supposed that you would ask Lewis Manton here."</p>
<p>"Do you consider, Lord Hawkewood, that although you are the earl and the proprietor, yet that Lewis Manton is your heir presumptive, who, in case of your death, unmarried, would succeed to your title and estates, and in case of your death before your majority would also inherit all your personal property?" severely demanded the doctor.</p>
<p>"I do, but I fail to see why that should be a recommendation of him to my favor or a reason why I should have to receive him here," laughed the young man.</p>
<p>"Not a special recommendation to your favor, perhaps, but a very special reason why you should invite him to your house, when he lives so near. It is a matter of etiquette--a matter of courtesy--that must be observed, my lord! That must be, lest it should be said that you bear your cousin and heir presumptive, Lewis Manton, an unworthy grudge for the position he holds toward you and the bare possibility of his succeeding you. For the reasons stated
<pb n="29 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

I have extended the right hand of fellowship to Lewis Manton and he has received it. He has already arrived. I hope you will welcome him amicably."</p>
<p>"I will meet my guests politely, however I may disapprove of them personally," replied the young earl, as they entered the Hall.</p>
<p>Only the dinner guests--about twenty in all--had yet arrived.</p>
<p>And these were in their dressing rooms.</p>
<p>The earl and the doctor entered the drawing room-a long, lofty apartment, upholstered in light-blue velvet and ivory, with windows draped in lace and satin and walls covered with mirrors and choice pictures.</p>
<p>Open fires of sea coal were burning in the large, steel grates at each end of the room.</p>
<p>No one was present when the two gentlemen entered.</p>
<p>The doctor took up his position on the rug, with his back to the fire, and the earl threw himself languidly into an easy-chair.</p>
<p>The first to join them was a young man of about five-and-twenty years of age, with a tall figure, fair complexion, light-gray eyes, and sandy hair and whiskers, and whom the doctor immediately presented to the earl as "Mr. Lewis Manton, of Manton Manor."</p>
<p>The newcomer bowed low and was received politely by the young earl.</p>
<p>He seemed a very commonplace young gentleman, without any distinctive attributes--though a phrenologist might have viewed the flat, broad shape of the head with much disfavor as indicating a great lack of moral and religious principles and a great preponderance of animal and selfish instincts, and decided that this young gentleman of wealth and reputation, of elegant appearance and accomplished manners, was in himself neither good nor safe.</p>
<p>After a few moments entered the Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors and their beautiful daughter, Lady Volante Belle Isle.</p>
<p>The duke was a tall, stout, florid man of forty years, with fiery-red hair and whiskers and bright, blue eyes.</p>
<p>The duchess was a pretty, plump brunette of medium height, with a rich complexion and dark-brown hair and
<pb n="30 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

dark-gray eyes. She wore a handsome evening dress of garnet-colored velvet, finished with point lace about the low corsage and short sleeves, a diadem of diamonds on her dark hair, and earrings, necklace, brooch, and bracelets of the same peerless jewels.</p>
<p>The Lady Volante was the beauty of Cornwall and the belle of London.</p>
<p>She had been presented to the queen, and then had been brought out into society only during the season which had just closed. She had refused many most eligible offers of marriage, and had returned to the country hand free, if not heart whole.</p>
<p>Not heart whole; yet certainly as heart whole as she had gone. No one in London had disturbed the peace of her</p>
<p>"Maiden meditations, fancy free."</p>
<p>But gossip whispered that her heart, even from childhood, had been given to the melancholy young recluse of Hawke Hall, whom she had never seen except at church, whom she had never spoken to in her life, and who, if the truth, must be told, thought no more of her than he did of her grandfather the archbishop--the young lady came on her mother's side from ecclesiastical ancestry.</p>
<p>She was a lovely brunette, of medium height and perfect form and features, with a rich and blooming complexion, fine, silky, dark-brown hair, curling lightly all around her head, and large, dark-gray eyes full of life and light and mischief! She wore a dress of fine, light, floating, cloud-like lace over a delicate rose-colored silk, made low on the bosom and short in the sleeves, and pearl ornaments on her beautiful neck and arms.</p>
<p>As the ducal party came into the room Dr. Laude advanced with great ceremony and conducted them to a sofa at the upper end.</p>
<p>When they were seated he brought up his ward, the young Earl of Hawkewood, and presented him first to the duchess, then to the Lady Volante, and lastly to the duke.</p>
<p>This presenting the host to the guests was reversing the usual order of things, in honor of age, rank, and womanhood, and it seemed good in the eyes of the worthy doctor.</p>
<pb n="31 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>The duchess received the young earl's bow with great courtesy and friendliness.</p>
<p>The Lady Volante's rich damask cheek deepened in its tint, and her long, thick, black lashes fell over her dark eyes. She returned his deep obeisance with a silent bow.</p>
<p>The duke shook hands with his young host, congratulated him on his natal day, and hoped that they might be better friends and neighbors henceforth than they had been hitherto.</p>
<p>The next arrivals were Mr., Mrs., and Miss Ball, of Bowling Downs; and never were people more appropriately named.</p>
<p>Mr. Ball was a little, round-bodied, bullet-headed, black-haired man of fifty; Mrs. Ball a little, round-bodied, black-haired, rosy-cheeked woman of forty-five.</p>
<p>How this dumpling pair ever came to have such a fine, tall, superb, imperial beauty as Olive Ball for a daughter is a mystery that can only be solved by the supposition that some of their ancestors must have been handsome giants.</p>
<p>Olive Ball was five feet seven inches in stature, and was plump in proportion to her height, with a full, finely rounded form, well-set head, covered with soft, fine, heavy, black hair, too lazy to curl, but lying in thick bands around her low, broad forehead; with a round, cream-colored face, straight, short nose, large, full, well-shaped lips, and full, well-curved chin, throat, and bosom.</p>
<p>She had large, soft, sleepy black eyes, half veiled by long, thick black lashes, and arched by heavy black brows. She wore a rich black velvet dress, with a low bodice and short sleeves--all trimmed with a narrow edge of fine white lace. This dress, though it was rather too matronly for a young, unmarried woman, yet certainly set off the large, well-rounded, beautiful bosom and arms to the best advantage.</p>
<p>The voice belonging to the Ball temperament--the voice that was fat and unctuous in the father and mother, was rich, rolling, and melodious in the daughter--so melodious that there was a sensuous pleasure in hearing her speak--even though she did call father "fawther," and pride, "proide."</p>
<pb n="32 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Enough of Olive Ball. Like Volante Belle Isle, she had her part to play in this strange family history, and that part began this night.</p>
<p>Other guests assembled, and then dinner was announced.</p>
<p>The young earl led the duchess to the table. It was his duty to pay this mark of respect to the lady of the highest rank in the room.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Laude took in Lady Volante. The duke offered his arm to Mrs. Ball, Mr. Manton to Miss Olive Ball, and other guests paired as suited themselves, and so they went in to dinner.</p>
<p>The young host took the head of the table, with the Duchess of Grand Manors on one side and Mrs. Ball on the other side.</p>
<p>He did not care in the least. At that period of his life and experience he would as willingly have been flanked by the dowagers as by anybody else.</p>
<p>The dinner was a long, formal, and tedious affair, but it came to an end at length, and the ladies adjourned to the drawing-room, where, a few minutes later, they were joined by the gentlemen, and tea and coffee were served.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the guests who had been invited to the ball in the evening began to arrive.</p>
<p>A suite of rooms occupying one entire wing of the house had been thrown open and prepared for the music and dancing.</p>
<p>Very soon after the young host took his place the rooms began rapidly to fill.</p>
<p>"You should take Lady Volante out and open the ball with her," whispered Dr. Laude to the young earl, when all the guests were supposed to be assembled and the musicians were tuning up their instruments preparatory to playing a quadrille.</p>
<p>Lord Hawkewood obediently left his tutor's side and went languidly up to the young lady in question, and asked the honor of her hand for the first dance.</p>
<p>She arose and placed the tips of her kid-gloved fingers on his coat sleeves and he led her to the head of a set that was then soon completed.</p>
<p>Mr. Manton and Miss Olive Ball were their <hi rend="italic">vis-a&agrave;-vis</hi>.</p>
<p>Other sets formed and the dancing commenced.</p>
<pb n="33 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Once "in the turn of the flying dance," the young earl glanced at his partner and noticed that she had laughing, dark eyes.</p>
<p>That glance was quite accidental; the next one was on purpose; but it was not so successful as the first--the mischievous eyes were veiled under ivory-white lids fringed with long, black, curly lashes that lay like shadows on the damask cheeks that glowed with consciousness under his gaze.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life the young recluse of Hawke Hall was impressed by the beauty of a young woman.</p>
<p>His glances sought the lovely face in every whirl of the dance, and went sideways toward her while they stood still together waiting their turn.</p>
<p>But whenever she chanced to look up and catch him at this pastime, his eyes fell and his face flushed.</p>
<p>At the end of the quadrille he took her to her mother and stood mutely beside her until the waltz music began, and then he solicited her hand for the round dance and led her out again.</p>
<p>With his arm clasping her waist, with her hand resting on his shoulder, her head so near his breast that his face was brushed by the beautiful, perfumed dark hair--whirling around and around in measured cadences to the time of entrancing music, in that dreamy, bewildering, delicious waltz, Horace felt that he had never imagined the possibility of a heaven on earth like this!</p>
<p>Again, at the end of the dance, he took his partner to her mother, and stood mute and spellbound before her.</p>
<p>Then it was that Dr. Laude came slowly up to them and said,  with dignified courtesy:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, dear duchess, I have a word to say to his lordship."</p>
<p>And with that he drew his ward's arm within his own and walked him off through the crowded rooms, saying, as they went:</p>
<p>"It is all very well, and just as it should be, your attentions to Lady Volante--so far. But there are other ladies in the room-Miss Olive Ball, for one-who have some claim upon you as their host. You must distribute your attentions. You must ask Miss Olive for the next waltz."</p>
<pb n="34 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Horace impatiently shook off the doctor's arm. He was growing furious under this constant tutelage.</p>
<p>"I cannot ask Miss Olive Ball to waltz! I could not hold her up. I am not strong enough," he answered, with a mocking laugh.</p>
<p>"What nonsense! You must be a gentleman in your own house, my lord!" said the doctor, and he recaptured his ward's arm and led him up to Miss Ball.</p>
<p>Horace had nothing else to do but to bow and ask the honor, and so forth.</p>
<p>"Tell them to play 'The Broide's Durream.' It is a beautiful, easy waltz, not too fast," said Olive, in her rich voice, as she lazily arose and passed her plump arm through that of the young earl.</p>
<p>"The Bride's Dream" arose in low, soft, slowly swelling notes, and soon Horace and Olive were gliding around in the delicious melody of motion. He did not feel her weight, though his arm was around her waist and her hand was on his shoulder. Her touch seemed to mesmerize, soothe, and exalt him, and he was almost as happy as he had been in waltzing with Volante--in a different sort of paradise to be sure, but still in a paradise.</p>
<p>So well pleased was he with his new partner that he would gladly have danced with her again had not the officious doctor, at the end of that waltz, marched him off to dance a quadrille with another young lady, who was neither a sparkling and enlivening beauty like Volante nor a sleepy and soothing one like Olive.</p>
<p>At twelve the supper rooms were opened, and continued open all the remainder of the night, so that the elder guests might refresh themselves with feeding and drinking, while the younger ones were dancing and waltzing away the small hours.</p>
<p>Dr. Laude was a free liver, so far as food and drink were concerned. You might know that by his size and complexion.</p>
<p>He spent the night from 12 M. to 2 A. M. in the supper rooms.</p>
<p>He took down successively the Duchess of Grand Manors, Mrs. Olive Ball, and other middle-aged or elderly ladies and he kept each of them company at supper.</p>
<pb n="35 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Lord Hawkewood took advantage of his mentor's absence by confining his attentions, for the remainder of the evening, to Lady Volante.</p>
<p>The ball broke up at half-past two.</p>
<p>All the company departed, except the few guests who had been invited to stay all night; these were the Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors, the Lady Volante Belle Isle, Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Ball, and Miss Olive Ball, and Mr. Lewis Manton.</p>
<p>When these last-mentioned guests had been shown to their several apartments and Dr. Laude had said his solemn good-night and retired, Lord Hawkewood passed into the library, which had not been opened to the inroad of visitors, and, therefore, was in perfect order, and he called a loitering footman and said:</p>
<p>"Send Delaplaine here."</p>
<p>The footman bowed and retired, and the valet entered the room.</p>
<p>"Has Gow been here?" demanded the earl.</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
<p>"Where is he now?"</p>
<p>"In your lordship's dressing-room."</p>
<p>"When did he come?"</p> 
<p>"About midnight, my lord."</p>
<p>"And you took him up to my room?"</p>
<p>"Not immediately, my lord. He made himself useful in the china and glass pantry during supper. I took him up at two o'clock, my lord."</p> 
<p>"Quite right. Come to me in about fifteen minutes. I want you."</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
<p>The earl took his bedroom candle and left the library, and went through the hall, where the footmen were engaged in putting out the lights, and so passed up the grand staircase.</p>
<p>The valet, Delaplaine, gazed after his master. The valet was a little, slender man of about thirty years of age, with a sallow complexion, and black hair and mustache, and small, black eyes. As he gazed, a strange expression came
into his dark face, and he muttered:
<pb n="36 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"<hi rend="italic">Bon!</hi> This night shall be my opportunity, and this tramp shall be my scapegoat! <hi rend="italic">Tres bon!</hi>"</p> 
<p>Meanwhile the young earl reached the head of the stairs, where the short wax candle that he carried dropped out of the socket of the silver bracket, fell to the ground and went out.</p>
<p>"Never mind," said the earl to himself. "I can find my way to my room without a light."</p>
<p>And he walked down the great upper hall, from which several passages diverged.</p>
<p>He entered a lofty archway on his left, and passed into what was called "The Bachelors' Corridor," where were situated his own handsome suite of apartments, Dr. Laude's private rooms, and the guest chambers to be appropriated to any bachelor visitor that might be staying in the house.</p>
<p>Lord Hawkewood, Dr. Laude, and Mr. Lewis Manton were now the only occupants.</p>
<p>As the young earl assed silently along the dark and thickly carpeted corridor a circumstances occurred that seemed singular at the time, and sinister as seen in the light of later events.</p>
<p>There was a dim lamp burning at the upper end of the corridor, and by its aid Lord Hawkewood saw, to his surprise, a man at his door apparently engaged in tampering with the lock.</p>
<p>He hurried to the spot and came suddenly and silently upon his cousin, Lewis Manton, who started and turned around.</p>
<p>Lord Hawkewood merely thought that a mistake had been made.</p>
<p>"This is not your room, Mr. Manton. Yours is two doors above," he said politely.</p>
<p>"Oh--ah--I beg pardon. The doors are all so alike," replied the man.</p>
<p>"They are. Well, two doors above. You will not mistake again. On this same side, of course. Good-night," said Horace pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Good-night," returned the other.</p>
<p>A door opened from the opposite side, and Dr. Laude in nightcap and wrapper, put his head out and inquired:</p>
<p>"What's the matter here?"</p>
<pb n="37 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"Nothing, except that Mr. Manton mistook my room door for his own, and I have set him right."</p>
<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the doctor, as he disappeared and locked himself within his chamber.</p>
<p>Lord Hawkewood also entered his own proper apartment and closed the door.</p>
<p>Half an hour later all the doors and windows in the house were secured, all the lights were put out, and all the household had retired.</p>
<p>They slept the deep sleep of fatigue and repletion. No sound disturbed their profound repose.</p>
<p>Yet, while they slept, that fatal night,</p>
<p>"A deed of dreadful note"</p>
<p>was done in that house--a deed whose discovery in the morning would thrill the whole household and the whole community with its unexampled horror and unfathomable mystery.</p>

CHAPTER III
HORROR AND MYSTERY

<p>The night has been unruly,
And, as they say, lamentings heard i' the air--
Strange signs of death;
And prophesyings, with accents terrible,
Of dire combustion and confused events;
New hatched to the woeful time,
The obscure bird clamor'd the livelong night.
Some say the earth was feverous and did shake.
						---SHAKESPEARE.</p>
<p>THE guests at Hawke Hall slept late on the morning the birthnight ball. It was near noon before any of them were astir.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors were the first to leave their apartment.</p>
<p>At the foot of the grand staircase they found the groom
<pb n="38 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

of the chambers, a gray-haired servant in plain clothes, who respectfully led the way to the west wing of the house, which contained the family parlors, breakfast and dining rooms, library and study.</p>
<p>None of these apartments had been opened to guests on the preceding evening, and they were all, therefore, in a state of perfect order.</p>
<p>The groom of the chambers led the ducal pair to the breakfast room, where a fine sea coal fire took the chill from the September day, and where the table was laid for the morning meal.</p>
<p>"Shall I ring for breakfast, your grace?" inquired Pelton respectfully.</p>
<p>"N-n-o. How long will it be before the others are down, I wonder?" hesitated and inquired the duke.</p>
<p>"I really cannot say, your grace. But I would respectfully advise not to wait, your grace," replied the old man.</p>
<p>"No! Ring for the coffee," exclaimed the duchess peremptorily, for she was always ready for her breakfast or any other refreshment.</p>
<p>Mr. Pelton put his hand on the bell pull, but arrested his intended motion at the sight of Dr. Laude, who came in his long, priestly black robe and his round skull cap.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, duke. Good-morning, madam. I crave your pardon for my late appearance," said the doctor, advancing with a bow, and then turning and standing on the rug, with his back to the fire and his hands clasped behind him.</p>
<p>"Oh, we have just come down, and we are only glad
not to have to apologize for keeping anybody waiting,"
said the duke.</p>
<p>As he spoke the door opened and Mr., Mrs., and Miss
Ball entered, closely followed by Lady Volante Belle Isle.</p>
<p>Mutual morning greetings were exchanged, and then
the doctor said:</p>
<p>"We are all here except the two young gentlemen. I do not think we need wait for them. Times and manners are changed since I was young. It was unknown then for healthy young men to be sluggards. Pelton, ring for the coffee."</p>
<pb n="39 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>The groom of the chambers obeyed, and the old butler, Forbes, himself appeared with the tray.</p>
<p>"Ah! And here is Mr. Manton, also. Good-morning, young sir. I hope you have slept well?" said the doctor, addressing the last-named guest.</p>
<p>Lewis Manton bowed to the ladies present, and then turned and answered the doctor.</p>
<p>"Yes, thanks, I slept very well. Never woke until half an hour ago," said Lewis Manton, smiling.</p>
<p>Yet he did not look as if he had rested. His face was almost ghastly in its pallor.</p>
<p>"These late hours are not good for you, Mr. Manton. Have you seen your cousin this morning?" inquired the doctor, as the party seated themselves at the breakfast table.</p>
<p>"No. Has he not come down yet?" demanded the young gentleman, pausing in the act of taking a cup of coffee from the butler's hand.</p>
<p>"He has not, and it is disgraceful! Pelton!" exclaimed the old gentleman, turning to the groom of the chambers.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," answered the latter, with a bow.</p>
<p>"Go up yourself, or send some one else, to see if Lord Hawkewood is up. Let him know that we are all assembled at breakfast, and would be glad to see his lordship at his earliest convenience," said the doctor, with a touch of sarcasm in his tone.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," submissively replied the old servant, as he bowed and left the room.</p>
<p>"Try a slice of this venison steak on a chafing dish, duke. It is delicious, dressed so with red currant jelly. Forbes, serve his grace with a chafing dish and fresh coal. Well! What on earth is the matter?"</p>
<p>This impatient question was addressed to old Pelton, who had burst into the room with a face full of mute, agonizing horror.</p>
<p>Oh, sir! Oh, sir!" was all that the old man could gasp in reply.</p>
<p>Speak, idiot!" cried the doctor, while his companions at the breakfast table gazed on the panic-stricken old man in surprise and curiosity.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir! My lord! my lord!" groaned Pelton, wringing
<pb n="40 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

his hands and tottering back until he fell and leaned against the wall of the room.</p>
<p>"What about my lord, you blockhead? Is he ill from last night's doings? I shouldn't wonder at all if he were. What ails him?" impatiently demanded the doctor.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir! Oh, sir! It is worse than that! Worse than ill! Oh! oh! Oh, Heaven!" cried the old servant, as the tears now burst forth and streamed down his ashen face.</p>
<p>"Worse--worse than that! What do you mean? Speak at once!" exclaimed the doctor, now thoroughly alarmed, as he started up from his chair.</p>
<p>But the old servant sank, sobbing convulsively, to the floor.</p>
<p>All the party at the breakfast table now arose and gathered around the collapsed figure on the floor.</p>
<p>The duke, who alone of all the company seemed to have his wits about him, went to the sideboard, poured out a glass of cognac brandy and brought it to the prostrate man, saying:</p>
<p>"Here! Take and drink this, and try to collect your faculties."</p>
<p>The poor old man obeyed, took the glass in his shaking hands and put it to his lips and emptied it at a gulp. That was the way of his class in drinking.</p>
<p>"Now, then, tell us what is amiss with your master," said the duke, as he handed the empty glass to the butler, who stood there staring with wonder.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with his lordship?" demanded the doctor.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir! Oh, your grace!" cried the unhappy man, recovering his voice under the influence of the stimulant, but still weeping and wringing his hands in mortal anguish.</p>
<p>"Speak, you intolerable fool! What has happened to Lord Hawkewood?" abruptly demanded Mr. Ball, who now opened his mouth for the first time.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir--oh, your grace! He is dead! dead! dead!" gasped the old man, dropping his head and wringing his hands.</p>
<p>The silence of a sudden, stupefying panic fell on the company for an instant, and then every voice echoed the fatal word in different tone:</p>
<pb n="41 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"Dead!" "Dead!" "Dead!"</p>
<p>"Murdered, gentlemen--murdered!" shrieked the old man, beside himself with horror and despair.</p>
<p>"Murdered!" roared the men in chorus, as, with one accord they turned and hurried toward the great hall and up the grand staircase.</p>
<p>"Murdered!" whispered the ladies present, in hushed tones, with pallid cheeks and sickening hearts, as they sank, each one, upon the nearest seat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the gentlemen, led by the duke, hastened up to the bedchamber of the young earl, threw open the door and entered the room.</p>
<p>What did they see?</p>
<p>Only at first a dimly lighted, spacious chamber, upholstered in black walnut and crimson satin, with heavy crimson curtains at the lofty windows and around the canopied bed.</p>
<p>Dr. Laude, with a pale face and a slight, muttered apology, pushed past the others and hurried to the bed, parted the curtains, looked upon the still form lying there, and shrank back, white as a sheet, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"Great Heaven! It is true!"</p>
<p>The Duke of Grand Manors, Mr. Ball, Lewis Manton, and several of the upper servants of the house, who had followed the doctor to the chamber of death, now crowded around the bed, with exclamations of astonishment.</p>
<p>There lay the rigid form of the young man, cold, white, and still, with a ghastly wound across his forehead.</p>
<p>"Gracious Heaven! Who could have done this?" cried the duke.</p>
<p>"Have the doors of the house closed, Dr. Laude. Suffer no one to leave the premises until there is an investigation of this atrocious crime! The house must be put into the hands of the police!" said Mr. Ball, who was in the commission of the peace.</p>
<p>"We must send immediately for Dr. Ellis. Life may not yet be extinct," replied the doctor, as soon as he could recover from his panic; and he bent again over the body and laid his hand upon the icy brow.</p>
<p>Oh, my dear sir!" muttered the duke, in a tone of grave expostulation against such an absurd hypothesis.</p>
<pb n="42 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"I must beg, Dr. Laude, that you will not lay a finger on the murdered man until the coroner has seen him," urged Mr. Ball.</p>
<p>"A physician must see him, sir!" groaned the tutor, who was still half stupefied with consternation and anguish, and he turned to the groom of the chambers and said hurriedly:</p>
<p>"Pelton, send a messenger on horseback for Dr. Ellis.
Tell him to follow and find the doctor wherever he may be and bring him here forthwith! Hasten!"</p>
<p>The distracted old servant ran out of the room to do his errand.</p>
<p>Mr. Ball turned around and addressed his companions, saying:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you must really pardon me if I ask you all to withdraw from this room, which, in my official capacity as a justice of the peace, I am about to close and seal until the arrival of the coroner and the police, whom I shall proceed immediately to summon."</p>
<p>The shuddering men withdrew from the chamber.</p>
<p>The magistrate locked the door.</p>
<p>"Forbes," said Lewis Manton, as they went downstairs, "be good enough to bring me a glass of brandy into the breakfast room."</p>
<p>"Yes, my lord," answered the butler, touching his forehead respectfully. "What brand does your lordship prefer?"</p>
<p>"Otard; and be quick about it!" answered Lewis Manton.</p>
<p>Dr. Laude had started at hearing the young man addressed as "my lord," and he had stared for an instant; but then he quickly recollected himself, and muttered:</p>
<p>"Good Heaven! it is true! Lewis Manton, the sometime heir presumptive of the title and estates, has succeeded, and he is the seventeenth Earl of Hawkewood; and the servants are quick to remember it, and to give him his new title. Ah, Heaven! the very worst fears of  the late earl are realized, and the earldom has fallen to an alien and an enemy!"</p>
<p>Thus groaning in the spirit, he followed the guests into the breakfast room, but the interrupted breakfast was not resumed.</p>
<pb n="43 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>Lady Volante Belle Isle lay upon the sofa, white and trembling.</p>
<p>The other ladies were near the girl, bathing her temples with cologne, Olive Ball holding a viniagrette to her nostrils.</p>
<p>The confirmation of the terrible news had already reached them through the servants, who had preceded the gentlemen to the breakfast room.</p>
<p>"This shock has been too much for Volante. We must take her home immediately," said the duchess. Then, turning to Lewis Manton, she graciously inquired:</p>
<p>"Will your lordship kindly give directions that my carriage shall be ordered?"</p>
<p>The new earl bowed, and touched the bell; and to the servant who answered it he said:</p>
<p>"See that her grace the Duchess of Grand Manors' carriage is brought around."</p>
<p>The footman bowed and withdrew.</p>
<p>"Ah, Heaven!" sighed the doctor, who felt his "occupation" gone. "How ready is this world to forget the setting in the rising sun! 'The king is dead! Long live the king!' in the same breath. I can give no more orders here."</p>
<p>Mr. Ball had meantime taken a good-sized notebook from his pocket, and was now busily writing in it. When he had finished, he tore out the page, folded and directed it, and turning to Dr. Laude, said:</p>
<p>"Doctor, shall I trouble you to send this by a servant to a police station?"</p>
<p>"Sir," said the doctor, with dignity, "I have no longer the privilege of issuing commands in this house. But Lord Hawkewood here will, no doubt, see that your wishes are carried out."</p>
<p>"By George, they must be carried out! I am a magistrate engaged in the discharge of my official duty," pompously exclaimed the round, little man. "Here is a young nobleman found murdered in his bed--"</p>
<p>At this moment a servant entered the room and announced:</p>
<p>"The Duchess of Grand Manors' carriage."</p>
<p>The duchess assisted Lady Volante Belle Isle to rise, and both ladies turned to leave the room.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ball interrupted them by saying to the former:</p>
<pb n="44 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"Your grace will pardon me, but no one can be permitted to leave the house until the coroner's inquest has sat."</p>
<p>"What, sir? Is it possible that you would detain myself and my daughter here?" demanded the indignant duchess.</p>
<p>"By no means, your grace!" the little, rotund magistrate hastened to say, with his round face as red as a tomato. "By no means; yet it is absolutely required that everyone here present should remain until after the inquest."</p>
<p>"It is true, madam, Mr. Ball is quite right," said the duke gently, as he gave his arm to his half-fainting daughter to support her back to her sofa.</p>
<p>"What a horrid nuisance to have to stay in this awful house! But if we cannot go home we must go to our rooms. Volante must go to bed and be nursed," replied the duchess.</p>
<p>The duke then turned his steps toward the door and led his daughter from the breakfast parlor, up the stairs to her own apartment, followed closely by the duchess.</p>
<p>Lewis Manton, as the new Earl of Hawkewood, took upon himself the direction of all affairs not strictly within the province of the magistrate.</p>
<p>A detachment of police arrived at the hall early in the afternoon and took possession of the house, placing guards at every door to prevent the departure of anyone from the premises.</p>
<p>They were followed by a great crowd from Hawkeville and the surrounding country, who had been drawn to the spot by the news of the murder.</p>
<p>Prominent among the people were Penn, the little, red-haired locksmith; Tree, the long, lank, swarthy tanner, and Proddy, the gray old cobbler.</p>
<p>These were almost overwhelmed with grief and dismay at the sudden and terrible taking off of their young feudal lord.</p>
<p>"And before he had a chance to get married and leave an heir to come after him--and he the last of his line--the last of the Hawkes of Hawkewood!" they said over and over to each other and to their neighbors, with the senseless reiteration of men who have few ideas and much loquacity.</p>
<p>Being without the fear of a libel suit before their eyes, having nothing, indeed, to risk or lose in damages, these
<pb n="45 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

poor men expressed their opinions with much more freedom than their betters would have dared to do.</p>
<p>"Durn it all, it were that there Lewis Manton wot done it! It were him, and none other! Which being of the next heir in case the young airl died unmarried, would come in for the title and all the estates--durn him! It were him wot done it!" said Proddy, the little, gray cobbler, taking his stumpy pipe from his mouth while he spoke.</p>
<p>"I dunnot think so. It might be to his advantage for the young lord to die unmarried, so to speak; but I dunnot think he would risk killing of him, like," objected Tree, the tanner, running his long, rough, brown fingers through his black elf locks.</p>
<p>"Who else could ha' done it, then?" demanded Penn, holding a pipe suspended between his finger and thumb.</p>
<p>The tanner paused and looked from one to the other mysteriously, and then whispered:</p>
<p>"Ham Gow, the tramp--him it were wot done the deed."</p>
<p>"Oh! oh! oh!" cried the two others, in a chorus of dissent. "Ham Gow is an honest a fellow as ever drawed the breath of life! Ham Gow, quotha? Oh!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Ham Gow! And if so be he didn't do it, he'll be hung for it all the same, mind you! Why, just look at it! Don't you mind the young airl made a 'pointment with that wagabone to meet him last night alone in his bedroom arter all the quality had gone to bed? Didn't we hear the 'pointment made with our own years?"</p>
<p>"We did," sighed the old cobbler, shaking his gray head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>"And didn't I hear that wagrant promise to go and keep that 'pointment? And didn't I hear that tramp a-growling to himself, as he walked off, about wot he would get outen the young airl afore he was done with him? I did that! Telly wot, mates! I wouldn't wonder if there wurn't a great robbery committed as well as a murder, and Ham Gow hadn't made off with the booty. There!"</p>
<p>Little Proddy dropped down on a rustic seat under the tree where they stood, and shuffled his feet and shook his head, sighing:</p>
<p>"I'm werry sorry to hear that! I'm uncommon sorry
<pb n="46 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

to hear that! I'd a heap ruther it be Muster Lewis Manton wot killed the airl nor Ham Gow."</p>
<p>"But why?" demanded the locksmith and the tanner in a breath.</p>
<p>The old cobbler took his pipe from  his mouth, into which he had just placed it, stared at the questioners in surprise for a moment, and then answered:</p>
<p>"Why, bekase I like Ham Gow. And let alone that. If the young airl had to be murdered, and it was his fate, I'd a heap ruther a gentleman should be hung for him nor a poor, low wagabone! I think it's jue to the young airl as a gentleman should be hung for him. So I shall just give my v'ice in favor of Muster Lewis Manton being of the murderer. It's a more befitting the quality of the airl," concluded Proddy, replacing the pipe in his mouth and smoking complacently, even while his eyes were still wet with tears for his slaughtered lord.</p>
<p>"There be summat in wot you say, Mr. Proddy--there be," earnestly acknowledged the tanner, nodding his hirsute black head sagaciously.</p>
<p>"Telly wot!" exclaimed the little, red-haired locksmith, in a thin, piping voice. "It's nyther the gentleman nor yet the tramp wot done this bloody deed. The gentleman wouldn't demean hisself to resk sich a thing as hanging, and Ham Gow would no more ha' done it nor me! It wurn't nyther of them two!"</p>
<p>"Who was it, then?" demanded the old cobbler.</p>
<p>"Ay, that's the p'int. Who was it ?" added the tanner.</p>
<p>"It was jest that furring French wally-de-sham. And a great sham he be--that Muster Dillyplin."</p>
<p>"O-h-h !" exclaimed his two hearers, incredulously.</p>
<p>"You don't believe me? Well, who was like to have been the last in the room of the young airl, even after the tramp had tuk his leave? Why, o' course, the wally-de-sham--Dillvplin. There!"</p>
<p>"That's so " murmured his hearers, musingly.</p>
<p>"Ay, it is; and, moreover, mates, I hearn Mr. Moss, the head gardener, say as the wally-de-sham is missing."</p>
<p>"Wot!" cried both the other men in a breath.</p>
<p>"The wally-de-sham, Mr. Dillyplin, is a-missing, and can't be found nowhere," solemnly repeated the locksmith.</p>
<pb n="47 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>"Never!" cried the tanner.</p>
<p>"Who says it?" asked the cobbler.</p>
<p>"Mr. Moss, the gardener, I tell you. And they are a-looking for that wally-de-sham up hill and down dale, and can't find him nowheres," added the locksmith.</p>
<p>"Well, then that settles it!" muttered the tanner.</p>
<p>"I'm feared it does," sighed the cobbler, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"And that wally-de-sham done that bloody deed," added Tree.</p>
<p>"I'm feared he did. I was in hopes, since it were done, as a gentleman might be hung for the airl. It was jue to his rank, so to speak."</p>
<p>"It were," assented both his hearers.</p>
<p>The men were here interrupted by the arrival of a policeman, who said:</p>
<p>"You three must come up to the house. You will be wanted to give evidence before the inquest."</p>
<p>"But we don't know nothing about it!" exclaimed Penn.</p>
<p>"We wa'n't here--none on us!" added Tree.</p>
<p>"But, anyways, I want to give in my evidence, as I believe it were Musther Lewis Manton wot done the dreffle deed, and if it wurn't him it ought to ha' been, for it stands to reason, since the airl was murdered, a gentleman ought to be hung for him. It's no more'n wot's jue to his rank. I'm a-gwine 'long of you, p'liceman," said Proddy, rising with difficulty to follow the officer.</p>
<p>They passed through a crowd of their neighbors, who shrank from them in horror, and whispered among themselves that these men were "had up for the murder."</p>
<p>But the true state of the case was this: One of the first acts of the police, on taking possession of the house, was to make a thorough search of the late Lord Hawkewood's room.</p>
<p>There they found, both in what was present, and from what was absent, certain clues to the supposed murderer.</p>
<p>There had been an extensive robbery; the late earl's watch, pocketbook, diamond studs, and diamond sleeve buttons were missing. The iron safe was open, and its contents gone.</p>
<p>A small quantity of clothing had also disappeared.</p>
<pb n="48 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>And the absence of all these articles seemed to supply the motive for the murder, and that motive, robbery.</p>
<p>In the place of the missing property was found one fatal witness--a woolen scarf known to have been worn by the tramp, Ham Gow, on the afternoon of the preceding day at the fe&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>The servants were called together and closely questioned.</p>
<p>They all identified the red woolen scarf as the property of Ham Gow, the tramp, which was worn by him on the premises.</p>
<p.A footman said that he had admitted Gow to the house at midnight, by the prevoius directions of his master. Another footman said that he had let the ramp out at five o'clock in the morning. A gardener's boy volunteered the information that he had heard the appointment made between his late master and the tramp to meet that night in his lordship's chamber.</p>
<p>Being questioned by the sergeant of police as to who else had heard this appointment made, he answered that he thought Penn, the locksmith; Tree, the tanner, and Proddy, the cobbler, had heard it, because they were all three near at hand.</p>
<p>A policeman was then dispatched to find the three cronies, and after an absence of twenty minutes returned to the house, bringing them.</p>
<p>In answer to the questions of the sergeant, they all three each in his turn, admitted that they had been present in the grounds about sunset on the preceding
afternoon, and had heard the appointment made between Lord Hawkewood and Ham Gow to meet in his lordship's room that night after the guests should have retired. That was all they really knew about the matter.</p>
<p>Old Proddy began to declare his private and individual opinion that Mr. Lewis Manton had committed the crime and ought to be forthwith executed therefor; but the sergeant ordered the old man to be silent.</p>
<p>They were all detained as witnesses before the inquest.</p>
<p>"Where is his lordship's valet, Albert Delaplaine?" next inquired the sergeant.</p>
<p>"If you please, sir, we do not know. Mr. Dillyplin has
<pb n="49 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

not been seen here since last night," answered the groom of the chambers.</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed the sergeant, turning suddenly upon the speaker.</p>
<p>"If you please, sir, his lordship's gentleman, Mr. Dillyplin, has not been seen since last night," repeated Pelton, slowly and emphatically.</p>
<p>"This is a most important fact! Why were we not told of it before?" inquired the sergeant, in as much disturbance as a self-contained police officer ever betrays.</p>
<p>"If you please, sir, you never asked, and I thought we was only here to answer questions."</p>
<p>This conversation, which took place in the upper hall near the sealed bedchamber of the murdered man, was interrupted by the appearance of a messenger, who announced that the coroner had arrived and wished to see
the sergeant of police.</p>
<p>The assembled servants were ordered to remain where they were, and the sergeant went down to see the coroner, whom he found in the lower hall in conversation with Mr. Ball, the magistrate, who was staying in the house, and
Dr. Ellis, the family physician, who had just arrived upon the scene, overcome with the news of the night's mysterious tragedy.</p>
<p>Together the four men went up to the chamber of horror to view the body of the murdered man.</p>
<p>No change had passed over the corpse since the discovery in the morning.</p>
<p>It lay there cold, stiff, white, with the deep, ghastly wound in the forehead and the coagulated blood settled on the pillow around the marble face.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellis, scarcely able to command his emotions, proceeded to make a cursory examination of the case.</p>
<p>With a sponge and basin of hot water, procured from the adjoining dressing-room, he carefully washed the clotted blood from the wound on the forehead, showing a fracture of the skull, which he pronounced to have been produced
by a blow from a blunt instrument and to have been the immediate cause of death.</p>
<p>A further and more careful search was made in the room
<pb n="50 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

and the fatal weapon was found--a blunt hammer, with the letters H. G. rudely cut on the handle.</p>
<p>"Ham Gow," muttered the physician, as he examined the initials.</p>
<p>"The body must be removed to the ground floor. What room can be placed at our disposal for the inquest?" inquired the coroner of the physician.</p>
<p>"I will ask his lordship, and let you know," replied the latter.</p>
<p>The three gentlemen then left the room, locking the door after them and carrying off the most significant witness of the crime that they had yet found--the blunt hammer, stained with blood and bearing on its handle the initials of the luckless tramp.</p>
<p>The magistrate and the physician went to seek the new Lord Hawkewood to consult him concerning the room in which the inquest might be held.</p>
<p>They found his lordship in the library alone, seated by a writing-table with a decanter of brandy and a wineglass before him.</p>
<p>His lordship had evidently been drinking freely--drinking more than was good for him, as the two elder gentlemen saw with as much surprise as regret, for Lewis Manton had never been addicted to intemperance.</p>
<p>However, the magistrate and the physician ascribed this indulgence to the state of excitement into which the young gentleman had been thrown by the suddenness of his cousin's shocking death and of his own unexpected elevation to the title and estates.</p>
<p>"We have come to speak of the inquest, my lord," began Mr. Ball; but he was instantly interrupted by the earl, who lifted his hand deprecatingly, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"I beg you will not speak of it to me at all! If I am to be summoned as a witness I will attend when the time comes--though, in point of fact, I know nothing about the horrible affair. Until then, leave me in peace."</p>
<p>"It is about the room in which the inquest may be held, my lord. It should be some room on the ground floor, suggested Mr. Ball.</p>
<p>"Go to Dr. Laude. Tell him I sent you to ask his ad-
<pb n="51 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

vice. He has been here nearly twenty years, and knows the house. Go to him."</p>
<p>The two gentlemen left the library and went in search of the venerable doctor, whom they at length found in his own den--opposite the chamber of death.</p>
<p>They told him their business.</p>
<p>He roused himself from his lethargy of grief to tell them that the long-disused justice room would be the proper place for the inquest to be held.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen left the chamber to give orders to that effect.</p>

CHAPTER IV
A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE

Lost! Out of my keeping!
Gone, beyond recovery!-KNOWLES.
But what are these grave thoughts to thee?
For restlessly, impatiently,
Thou strivest, strugglest to be free--
Thy only dream is liberty,
Thou carest not how or where!-LONGFELLOW.

<p>THE old justice room then was prepared for the inquest. The body of the murdered earl was laid out in state upon the table in its midst.</p>
<p>Another table, placed at right angles with this one, at the upper end of the hall, and covered with a black cloth, was furnished with writing materials for the accommodation of the coroner and such officers of the law as should attend the inquest.</p>
<p>Benches on each side the longer table on which the body lay were placed for the jury.</p>
<p>This jury was composed of some of the more intelligent and respectable among the farmers and tradesmen of the neighborhood--all of whom were tenants of the late earl.</p>
<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon, however, before
<pb n="52 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

the coroner took his seat, with a clerk on one side of him and a bailiff on the other.</p>
<p>The jurymen were sworn in and took their places.</p>
<p>Near the table at which the coroner and his assistants were seated stood several comfortable armchairs, which were soon occupied by Mr. Ball and Dr. Laude, and later on by the Duke of Grand Manors and Dr. Ellis.</p>
<p>The new Earl of Hawkewood was not present at the opening of the inquest.</p>
<p>The room was soon filled with an eager crowd, composed of gentlemen from the neighborhood and tenants and laborers from the estate.</p>
<p>The first witness called was the groom of the chambers, who had discovered the murder.</p>
<p>Having been duly sworn, he testified that his name was Adam Pelton and his age fifty years; that he was born on the estate and had been in the service of the family since the age of fifteen, when he had entered it as page to the
then Countess of Bawkewood.</p>
<p>He had last seen his master alive on the night of the first of September, or, to speak more correctly, on the morning of that same second of September, at about three o'clock, going upstairs to bed.</p>
That he himself had neither seen nor heard of his late lordship again until about twelve o'clock that day, when all the guests being assembled at breakfast, he was ordered by Dr. Laude to go up and call the young earl.</p>
<p>That he had gone to his lordship's room and rapped softly; getting no response, rapped loudly; receiving no answer, and finding the door slightly ajar, he had gone in and approached the bed, and called gently; failing to wake his lordship, he had stooped over him to see if he were very sound asleep--and--had--then--discovered--</p>
<p>Here the voice of the witness broke down, and he sobbed convulsively.</p>
<p>Time was given him to recover, and after some minutes he resumed:</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen, but I have knowed my lord since he was--was born, all right along up to this time, and his fate has broke my heart," he said, in a tone of humble apology.</p>
<pb n="53 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>And then he went on to describe the manner in which he had found the murdered earl, and had given the alarm to his friends.</p>
<p>One of the jurors inquired whether the witness knew of any person who had any grudge against his lordship.</p>
<p>The witness answered, extra judicially, as it were:</p>
<p>"Why, law! No, Farmer Perry! I don't believe no one had no more grudge against my lord nor you nor me have! He was that well-beloved as I believed there ain't a man on the estate as wouldn't ha' sooner died for him nor have killed him. Besides which, there was the robbery. That shows what the murder was done for. Some thief from a long distance must ha' got into the house and hid
himself in his lordship's chamber, and killed his lordship to prevent his lordship from giving the alarm, and then gone off with all the waluables."</p>
<p>"You are not here to instruct the jury, witness, but only to tell what you know of this case," said the coroner.</p>
<p>"I know I ain't, Mr. Bucks," replied Pelton, addressing that officer ex-officially, as was his custom. "I know I ain't; but when a man like Farmer Perry asks a foolish  question I am to answer it, ain't I?"</p>
<p>"You may sit down," said the coroner.</p>
<p>And Adam Pelton left the stand.</p>
<p>The next witnesses called in succession were his grace the Duke of Grand Manors, Mr. Ball, and Dr. Laude-all of whom corroborated the latter portion of Adam Pelton's testimony, and described the condition in which the body of
the murdered earl was found.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Ellis testified to having made an examination of the corpse, explaining the cause of death, and said that as the wound was an external one no autopsy was necessary.</p>
<p>The policeman who searched the room described its condition after the murder. The safe, cabinet, and drawers of the late earl had been rifled of their contents; yet no locks had been broken, not even the lock of the chamber door, which was found with its key inside.</p>
<p>Several of the servants testified to the fact that Ham Gow, the tramp, had come to the house at midnight, saying that he did so by the orders of the young lord, and
<pb n="54 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

that he was admitted by his lordship's valet, who had been called into consultation as to whether Gow should be permitted to stay, and who declared that his lordship had commanded that he--Gow--should, on his arrival, be shown up to his lordship's room.</p>
<p>That Gow had made himself useful for a few hours in helping to rinse glasses in the china room during supper, and had then been conducted to the private apartments of the earl to wait.</p>
<p>Adam Pelton, re-called and questioned, said that he did
not hear the late earl say anything about having an appointment with Ham Gow in his lordship's room or elsewhere, and, in truth, he never even heard his lordship mention the name of Ham Gow.</p>
<p>Several other servants testified to having seen Delaplaine, the valet, enter his lordship's room about half-past three o'clock in the morning, as they were going up together to their own sleeping-rooms in the attic, and to having missed him ever since.</p>
<p>Messrs. Penn, Trree, and Proddy were sworn an examined in turn, and testified to having overheard the appointment made between the late Earl of Hawkewood and Ham Gow, the tramp, to meet in his lordship's chamber that night after the ball should be over and the guests departed.</p>
<p>Upon the fact of this appointment all three of the men agreed. In addition to this, however, Tree, the tanner, testified that he overheard the tramp growling to himself that if he kept the appointment he would make something out of that job before all was done.</p>
<p>As for Proddy, the cobbler, he could scarcely be kept in bounds.</p>
<p>After he had described the appointment made in his hearing, he burst forth with these words:</p>
<p>"But, gentlemen and the honorable and worshipful parlyment, don't let wot I have said set you ag'in Ham Gow, wot is as honest a poor man as there is in the world, and wot had no call to up and kill my lord--because why? Because he was like to get more by my lord's life than by his death. No, my lords and gentlemen of the jury; you
<pb n="55 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

must look to the party wot was to be beneficked by his lordship's death. Him it was wot done the deed."</p>
<p>Here Mr. Proddy was rebuked by the coroner, who proceeded to admonish him that he was not on the stand to give his opinion, but to tell the facts within his knowledge.</p>
<p>"W'ich I'm a-doing on, your honors and your worships; for it is my knowledge to know as it is jue to his lordship that a born gentleman should be hung for his lordship My lord wasn't no common man, your reverences! My lord was Airl o' Hawkewood and a Pare o' the Rem! And w'en he's found murdered in his bed it stands to reason a gentleman should be hung for him."</p>
<p>"The man is an idiot! Stand down, witness " said the coroner.</p>
<p>Old Proddy slunk away, muttering:</p>
<p>"I knows wot I knows."</p>
<p>Search was ordered to be made for the missing valet, but it proved unavailing.</p>
<p>All the witnesses having been examined, the room was cleared, that the jury might deliberate on the verdict.</p>
<p>It was now growing dark, so that the great chandelier in the drawing-room was ordered to be lighted.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated in the inquest room with closed doors. The crowd outside gathered into groups and talked over the tragedy while waiting for the verdict.</p>
<p>It was ten o'clock before the verdict was rendered that:</p>
<p>"The deceased, Horace Charles Edward Hawke, sixteenth Earl of Hawkewood, came to his death through a wound in the skull, inflicted by an iron hammer held in
the hands of one Ham Gow, a tramp, who was aided and abetted in his felony by one Henri Delaplaine, the valet of his late lordship."</p>
<p>Mr. Ball, being a justice of the peace, and on the spot, immediately made out two warrants and placed them in the hands of a constable--one was for the arrest of Ham Gow, the tramp, the other for that of Henri Delaplaine, the valet.</p>
<p>The jury then retired to the steward's room, where, by the orders of the new Earl of Hawkewood, they were regaled with a collation of bread and cheese, cold ham and beef, porter and ale.</p>
<pb n="56 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>After partaking heartily of these refreshments, they left the house and dispersed to their homes.</p>
<p>The crowd outside, who had heard of the verdict that had been rendered, and the warrants that had been issued continued to loiter about the grounds in the hope of hearing of some new developments, until they saw the coroner and the jury file out and leave the premises. When giving up all expectations of any fresh intelligence, they slowly wended their ways homeward.</p>
<p>The body of the murdered earl, given up now to the household, awaited only the offices of the undertaker. But as it was nearly eleven o'clock at night, it was, of course, too late for that gloomy functionary to commence his operations.</p>
<p>The body was therefore left where it had been laid out for the inspection of the coroner's jury--on the table in the long justice room. It was covered over with a Marseilles counterpaine, and all the windows were hoisted to admit air, though the Venetian shutters were closed and fastened on the inside for security. Then the doors were locked and left so. No guard was now deemed necessary in the room of death.</p>
<p>By twelve o'clock the very much fatigued household went to rest.</p>
<p>It is to be presumed that notwithstanding the tragic situation they all slept soundly; for when, at eight o'clock the next morning, the Hawkeville undertaker, Jonas Blackstone, made his appearance at the Hall, none of the servants were in readiness to receive him.</p>
<p>He rang and knocked at the principal portal without gaining any response. Then he went around to the servants' entrance, and, after much trouble, succeeded in rousing a footman who slept next to the butler's pantry, and who came half dressed and half asleep to open the door.</p>
<p>"You are a pretty set of lazy villains to be about a nobleman's house! I don'tt wonder murders are committee here! I saw an open window on the ground floor as I came along, and I might have got in and gone through the house and helped myself, had I been so inclined. Couldn't make anybody hear me. Thought you were all murdered this time! Well, I was to be at the Hall at eight o'clock this morning
<pb n="57 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

and I was here sharp. But it is half-past. eight now, through waiting for you to open the door. Now, then, show me in to the dead room," concluded Mr. Blackstone, dropping down on a chair to get his breath.</p>
<p>The footman, who was gaping and rubbing his eyes, at length brought out the words:</p>
<p>"The room wheer my lord's body lies is locked up, and his reverence, the Rev. Dr. Laude, has got the key."</p>
<p>"Well, then, go and get the key or ask the Rev. Dr. Laude to come and unlock the door for me," said the undertaker, impatiently.</p>
<p>The yawning footman nodded his head in compliance, and staggered blindly away on his errand, for he was still half asleep.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes later the doctor came down in his dressing-gown and cap, with the key in his hand.</p>
Immediately on seeing the tutor, the manner of the undertaker changed. He became very humble and very solemn. He arose and bowed with deep gravity, and stood
waiting respectfully for the doctor to speak first.</p>
<p>"Well, Blackstone, it is about fifteen years since the Hall has required your services," began Dr.Laude.</p>
<p>"Yes, your reverence; it is just fifteen years since his late lamented lordship passed away," sighed the undertaker.</p>
<p>"We little thought that your next services would be required for the young earl."</p>
<p>"Very little, indeed, your reverence; but 'we are here to-day and gone to-morrow,' as the saying is."</p>
<p>"Ay, ay; there never was a truer word! But come with me now. I will take you to the death room."</p>
<p>Dr. Laude led the way, followed by the undertaker.</p>
<p>They passed through several narrow back passages until they came at length to the great hall running through the center of the vast structure.</p>
<p>Dr. Laude unlooked the door on the right which led into the justice room, which he entered, closely followed by the undertaker.</p>
<p>"There," said the latter, "that is the window I saw open from the outside! Very careless of the servants to leave it
<pb n="58 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

so unless it was done for ventilation, and then there ought to have been a watch set."</p>
<p>The doctor, who had walked into the center of the room, now suddenly paused, looked around and exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Great Heaven!"</p>
<p>The undertaker then looked around to see what was amiss, but he could detect nothing, wrong. The room, it is true, was in partial obscurity, notwithstanding the one window that was ajar.</p>
<p>"Is anything wrong, your reverence?" he inquired, advancing toward the doctor, who was standing in the middle of the floor near a table on which lay a white object, the whole picture indistinct to the questioner.</p>
<p>"For the Lord's sake, throw open all the windows, Blackstone! Let us have some light! Good Heaven! It cannot be possible!" exclaimed the doctor, who still stood panic-stricken, spellbound, where his footsteps had first been arrested near the table.</p>
<p>The undertaker stared in perpelexity upon the speaker.</p>
<p>"Do you not hear what I say, man ? Have you no ears? I tell you--the body of the earl is gone!" almost screamed the doctor.</p>
<p>"'The--body--gone!'" slowly and incredulously muttered the undertaker. "That cannot be; your reverence! Who would want his lordship's body? We have got
medical colleges or students hereabout; and who else would steal it? Where was the body laid out, your reverence?</p>
<p>"In this room, of course! On this table! Here is the pillow on which the head rested! Here is the counterpane which covered it! Did you not know that this was the room in which the inquest was held? In which the body was left to wait your offices? And in which I expected to find it? Why else should I have brought you here?" demanded the doctor.</p>
<p>"To be sure, of course, I thought it was here; but when I didn't see it, I thought we were going through this room to some other room where it was. But, your reverence, don't be alarmed until you know it is gone. Maybe some of them men folks have moved it back to his bedroom for
<pb n="59 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

some purpose of their own, to dress it for the coffin, or something," suggested the undertaker.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Would they have taken it through the window, even supposing they had dared to meddle with it at all without orders? The door was locked, and I had the key, and the door was found fast as it was left. Would they have taken it through the window?" irascibly demanded the doctor.</p>
<p>"No, to be sure they would not," admitted the undertaker.</p>
<p>"Yet the body has been taken out of the window! The window was found open. We must rouse the house and set inquiry on foot to discover who has been guilty of this most heinous offense!" exclaimed the doctor, hurrying off to put his resolution in execution.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the whole establishment was roused. A thorough search was made of the entire house by the appalled and bewildered servants, but no trace was found either of the stolen body or of the thieves who were supposed to have carried it away.</p>
<p>Detectives were employed, and a reward was offered for its recovery.</p>

CHAPTER V
THE APPARITION OF THE RUINED TOWER

Ha! whence comest thou? Away!
There's blood upon thy hands,
And blood upon thy brow,
And sin upon thy soul.
Go, get thee from the land!
The sleuth-hound dogs thy steps,
Behind thee lurks thy crime,
Before thee looms thy fate!
Begone and leave my sight!

<p>AT about the same hour in which the undertaker arrived at Hawkewood Hall, a rather startling incident occurred at the ruined watchtower at Demondike, on the beach.</p>
<pb n="60 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

<p>The sun had just sparkled up from the sea on the horizon's edge, striking a path of dazzling light across the waters to the land and shining on the desolate rock-bound coast.</p>
<p>The tide was very high, the dike was very full, and the thunder of the waves on the coast and the roaring of the waters in the dike made a din that was almost deafening.</p>
<p>A curling column of white smoke issuing from the rude chimney of the tower showed that the inmates were astir.</p>
<p>Within the strong room two women were busy at work.</p>
<p>They were the Old Nan and the Young Nan.</p>
<p>The former was engaged in hanging a teakettle over the fire she had just kindled, and the latter was making up the rude bed in the bunk that had been the sleeping-berth of both women.</p>
<p>Old Nan had changed but little since the first day of her arrival, twenty years before, unless, as it was often said, that age had hardened and toughened rather than weakened and subdued her.</p>
<p>She had the same tall, gaunt, masculine-looking form, the same large, bony features, dark, florid face, and coarse red hair, rather rusty now, and she wore the same style of clothing--the dark-blue linsey-woolsey gown and the red silk head handkerchief.</p>
<p>Young Nan, a very handsome woman of about thirty-five years, was nearly as tall as her mother, but had a much finer form, features, and complexion than that mother in her youth had ever boasted.</p>
<p>Young Nan had a clear-cut Grecian profile, with its low forehead, straight nose, short upper lip, and round, pointed chin. Her skin was white, her cheeks were rose, and her lips coral, and her stately head was covered with a profusion of rich, dark auburn hair.</p>
<p>She was attired in a crimson serge gown, and had a white muslin handkerchief tucked in about her neck and over her full, rounded bosom.</p>
<p>Her sleeves were rolled up to her elbows and her shapely white arms were shown to the best advantage as she tossed over the mattress, or shook out the sheets in making up the bed.</p>
<p>"'Twere a good landing we made that night, mother,"
<pb n="61 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

said Young Nan, as she shook out the gay patchwork quilt over the outside of the bed and began to tuck it in.</p>
<p>"Ay, it were! Thanks to the fe&ecirc;te at the Hall, and Mosey's ambition to be present at it. It was Mosey'e watch, it were, that night, and I could a-larfed when Red Dennis offered to change wi' him and take it if the lieutenant were agreeable. So good-natured o' Red Dennis to take the watch and let Mosey go up to see the fireworks at the Hall, eh? Listen here! We landed fifty kegs of French brandy and two cases of silk."</p>
<p>"Eh! No!"</p>
<p>"Yes, we did. Red Dennis told me so. Besides, I seen 'em, though I didn't count 'em!"</p>
<p>"I should like to have seen that!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, why didn't you stay here instead of gallivanting over to the Hall to see the fireworks, eh?"</p>
<p>"Mother, I went to take Mosey off. He wouldn't have thought of going if it hadn't been for me. Dennis put me up to ask Mosey to take me to see the fireworks, and I did; and he said it was his watch at Demondike that night
between eight and twelve, so I put him up to change with Red Dennis, who had the morning watch farther up the coast, where it would have been impossible to have found a landing-place. So Mosey asked the lieutenant up at the coastguard station, and the lieutenant, who values Mosey beyond all the force, and would do anything for him--was agreeable and allowed the change to be made."</p>
<p>"And so the most knowing smuggler on the coast guarded her majesty's revenue interests that night, and we run in a cargo worth two hundred pounds. Ah! if Red
Dennis could be put on this beat altogether, or if we could win over Mosey to our cause! We would soon make money enough to retire. I say, lass! Mosey dotes on thee! Why canst not win him to thy will?" demanded Old Nan slyly.</p>
<p>"Mosey is a saintly milksop, mother. Mosev is trying to coax me to join his church, and marry and settle down, as he calls it! As if I was not 'down' enough already."</p>
<p>"He wants to marry thee, does he?"</p>
<p>"Ay! and I old enough to be his mother!"</p>
<p>"Nay,, nay, lass! Thee is thirty-five and he is thirty.
<pb n="62 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>
62     THE TRAIL OF, THE SERPENT

And the wretch! to lift his eyes to thee, who should have been a--"</p>
<p>"Hush, mother! I cannot bear that!--And here is someone coming! Who is here?" exclaimed Young Nan, starting back.</p>
<p>She might well ask, for the figure that staggered in at the doorway and reeled and fell prone upon the floor might have startled and appalled a woman with even firmer nerves than Young Nan possessed--could such a woman have been found.</p>
<p>It was a tall, gaunt, pallid young man, clothed only in his shirt and drawers, all of which, together with his matted, black hair and cadaverous face, was stained with blood.</p>
<p>"Who is it? What's all this here?" cried Old Nan, hurrying to the spot where the man had fallen.</p>
<p>"It's--it's--it is-Ham!" cried Young Nan, stooping over the insensible form.</p>
<p>"Ham! How came he here? I did not know he was in the country! When did he get back?" inquired the old woman, bending over the body.</p>
<p>"I don't know, mother! I don't know no more than you do! But he has been--been doing something! Don't you see? He has been wounded--maybe killed. Who knows?" cried Young Nan, as she raised the head of the prostrate man, and, sinking down on the floor, drew it upon her lap.</p>
<p>"No! no! he is not killed! He has only fainted from fatigue, or loss of blood! See! he breathes!" exclaimed Old Nan, hurrying to a rough corner cupboard and pouring out a glass of brandy from a bottle that stood there.</p>
<p>"Here, lass. Pour a little of this down his throat--pure cognac, as never heard tell of a custom house, or got tainted wi' duty," said the old woman, stooping down to hand the younger one the brandy.</p>
<p>The latter seized it eagerly, raised the head of the man higher, and, with some difficulty, poured a few drops of the stimulant into his mouth.</p>
<p>He swallowed it, chokingly, then revived a little, and swallowed more without choking, and finally finished the glass, and drew a long breath.</p>
<p>"Ham," cried the younger woman, as she handed the
<pb n="63 THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT"/>

empty tumbler to her mother, "what'st been up to, lad?"</p>
<p>"Help me to the cave! Hide me! Hide me!" hurriedly exclaimed the tramp.</p>
<p>"Surely, surely, we will! Canst rise? What's the trouble? Hast been poaching? Wast wi' the gamekeepers?" cried Young Nan, as she tried to raise the man to his feet.</p>
<p>"Hurry! Hurry! Hide me! Quick! They will be here!" cried the tramp, in a faint though agitated voice.</p>
<p>"Come, help me, mother! I'm afraid he cannot stand. Canst use thy limbs, lad?"</p>
<p>"Try me! Help me up! Quick!" exclaimed the man.</p>
<p>By the united efforts of the two strong women, the man was raised to his feet, but he could not stand a moment nor could they sustain him.</p>
<p>He sank to the floor again, murmuring:</p>
<p>"It's no good. They'll take me, and the game'll be up."</p>
<p>The two women holding on to him had broken his fall by lowering him to the floor, and now they stood over him in despair.</p>
<p>A noise was heard outside--the noise of swiftly approaching steps.</p>
<p>"Who is that?" exclaimed Young Nan, in alarm.</p>
<p>"The bumbaillies after me! It's no good. I'm a goner! It ain't so bad as they think, however. And I shall get some fun out of it yet," laughed the tramp, in ironical desperation.</p>
<p>"They sha'n't take you out of this room! They sha'n't cross that threshold! Or if they do, they sha'n't go back again alive!" cried Old Nan, running to the corner and seizing a loaded gun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ham Gow, from his lair on the floor, and Young Nan, from her stand above him, glared at the doorway.</p>
<p>"Put up your gun, missus. Don't be afeared, Nan. It's
all right, mate. It's me."</p>
<p>"Red Denais!" exclaimed the three inmates of the ruined tower in one breath, as the false coast guardsman entered the place.</p>
<p>"Right you are! I don't know who you've got here on the floor, but seeing where he is. I takes him to be a friend.

I come to warn you, if Ham is about, to hide him. There be a warrant out agin' him," said Red Dennis, a short, stout man, with a broad, red face and a thick shock of red hair and beard.</p>
<p>"Ham is here!"</p>
<p>"This is Ham!"</p>
<p>"I am Ham " exclaimed three voices in one breath.</p>
<p>"Ham here! ThatHam! You Ham? Why, wot ever have you been doing to yourself? I didn't know you, mate, I swear! But I ain't got no time to talk. There be a warrant out agin' you, Ham. The bumbaillies have it. I run off to tell you, and they are not half a mile behind me!"</p>
<p>"A warrant oat agin' me? Here; lend the women a hand to help me downstairs. What's the warrant out agin' me for?" demanded the tramp, as he gave his hand to his new friend and struggled once more to his feet.</p>
<p>"For the murder of the young Earl of Hawkewood!" exclaimed the informer, as he helped the tramp toward the narrow steps cut in the thickness of the wall, and leading to the crypt below.</p>
<p>"The murder of the young Earl of Hawkewood!" echoed the two women, after a moment's pause of consternation and horror.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it! The murder of the young Earl of Hawkewood--more's the pity," moodily repeated Red Dennis.</p>
<p>"But--is the young Earl of Hawkewood murdered?" inquired Ham Gow, as he slowly descended the dark, steep, and narrow steps in the wall behind the chimney.</p>
<p>"Come, now; that's a good one! Is the young Earl of Hawkewood murdered? Yes; he is murdered; and what call had you to go and murder a harmless young nobleman like he is? That's what we want to know," said Red Dennis.</p>
<p>"But I did not do it. When was he murdered and where?" inquired Ham Gow, with a dazed look.</p>
<p>"Come, now! As if you did not know! In his own bed there in his room at Hawkewood Hall, yesterday morning before day; as you know a great deal better than anybody else--you, who turn up your eyes in horror at a little bit of innercent free trade, yet do not hesitate to beat a sleeping man's brains out with an iron hammer.

me that'd help you to hide yourself from the law."
4'But, great Goliath of Gath I I never did it !"
"Now, Ham Gow, don't you depend on standing here
with that defense. Get down to the cave as fast as you
can, and stay there till you can be took off quiet to the
I coast of France."
"I'm awfully sorry that this has happened to his lord-
ship," exclaimed the tramp, stopping and standing still in
grief.
"You'll be more awfuller sorrier still when ypu're swung
up for it, as you will be if you don't get down into that
cave in double-quick. I tell you there is a warrant out agin'
you !"
"But-upon what ground has a warrant been issued
against me?" inquired the tramp, as Red Dennis hurried
him onward across the crypt to a certan corner, where he
proceeded to dislodge a stone, revealing a secret passage
through the solid rocks.
"Upon the foundation of the coroner's 'quest verdict

"What was the verdict?" inquired Ham   Gow, as he
groped along the passage, held up on one side by Red
Dennis and on the other by the two women, who listened
in silence and with the deepest and most painful interest
to every word that was spoken.
"Why, the verdict was as how the young Earl of Hawke-
wood came to his death by a wound on the head, made with
an iron hammer held in-the hands of one Ham Gow, who
was aided and abetted by one Henri Delaplaine !"
"I begin to see I" exclaimed the unlucky tramp, striking
sforehead with his clinched fist.
"Oh, you do, do you?-Well, here we are in the cave,"
oncluded Red Dennis, as the whole party emerged from

coast guardsman, as he continued to wash the head andface
of the wounded man.
In doing so, he revealed a fearful gash in the.upper part
of the forehead.
"Oh! that was his death blow I" cried Young Nan, in-
anguish.
"No, it wasn't. Twould a-been the death blow o' many
another man, but not o' Ham. Goliath I Ham's got the
hardest head in all Cornwall. George! He must a-had a
hard fight of it  The young Earl of Hawkewood sold his
life high, if so be Ham Gow took it. Why, he looks as if
he had lost all the blood in his body 1"
"Ham never took the young earl's lifel Never! Why,
Ham is incapable of committing a crime! He will not
even countenance smuggling-though for our sakes he will
not betray you 1" fiercely exclajied Young Nan.
" 'Twasn't me that put it on him, Nan. I don't see what
call he had to kill the young earl. They used to be as good
friends as ever a peer and a peasant could be. So it wasn't
for enmity he killed him."
"And he doesn't seem to have brought any valuables
away with him, not even a suit of clothes, so it warn't for
plunder neither," said Old Nan.
"But they do say the earl was robbed-heavily, too-all
his money and jewelry, and much of his clothing, and other
effects, was took," said Red Dennis.
"Well, Ham is certainly above robbery; nothing could
tempt him to that 1" cried Young Nan.
"Besides, he hasn't brought anything, not even a suit of
clothes, away with him," added Old Nan, rather regret-
fully.
"But 'tis said he had a confederate-Henri Delaplaine,
the valet, who might have gone off with the booty, to be
divided at some more convenient time," Red Dennis ex-
plained.
-"That might be," admitted Old Nan,'in a more eheerful
ton...

claimed Young Nan, as soon as her indignation would

"Beg pardon, Nan. I was only trying to get at

"What's where? Is the de'il in the man?" cried
Nan.
"Since when has Ham Gow been wearing 'purple

Dennis Prout, pointing to the delicate fabric of wh

The announcement of this strange fact drew both w

band, and then they drew back, shuddering.
"So you see it looks black for Ham, as to the murde

"Ham never did either i" cried Young Nan, with a
sob, as she covered her face with her hands. "He
did either. I don't understand how he comes to be we
the murdered man's shirt, but he never murdered or 
the earl !"

"No I he never did  But if he had doie it, he had good

"Mother, for mercy's sake, hush I And you, Dennis
Prout, what are you sitting there for, mopping the poor
boy's face and hands?. What good does that do? He will
die while we are waiting for better help 1" cried the young
woman in wild alarm.  ;
"He will be taken and tried and hanged for the earl's
murder, if one of us should leave this cave for the tower,
while the law officers are there," said Prout; "but, how-
x'ever," he added, after a pause, "I'll go and reconnoiter."
"Do, Dennis! Do, and come back quicklyl" pleaded
Young Nan.
The man dried the face of his patient with the red hand-
kerchief Old Nan had taken from her head for the purpose,
and then he aose and left the cave by the secret passage.
He groped his way along its sinuous windings, between
damp walls and under a dripping roof, all in total dark-
aess. There was one sure circumstance about this under-
ground passage: there was no such thing as losing your
way in it. There were no branches. Following it from
the cave, you were sure to reach the hole through which
you could creep into the cellar.
Prout soon reached this hole.
Here he paused and listened; but heard no sound. Then
he ventured to move the stone a little way and peep in.
The cellar was partly lighted through crevices in the
ceiling above. His keen eyes failed to detect anyone near.
!    Then he rolled the stone aside, slipped through the hole
and rolled the stone back again. This stone was precisely
like hundreds of others that formed the foundation of the
.tower. If it was a little loose in its place, why, so were
several others; but this had also another advantage favor-
able for concealment; it was in a pitch-dark corner of the
cellar.
Prout congratulated himself so far. Even if he were
found in the cellar, it would not matter, now that the en-
trance into the secret passage was hidden securely again.
He crossed over to the steps leading up to the strong
room above, rolled aside a second stone, and began to ascend
the steep and narrow stairs cut in the thickness of the wall.

70     THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT 
When he reached the top, he listened again, but
nothing. He opened the iron door that pretended 
face of it to be the door of a Dutch oven adjoini
fireplace-but he only opened it for a few inches to
out. The strong room was in a blaze of light, for
door and window was wide open; but he saw no one
the room was empty.
Emboldened by this view, he pushed the iron gate 
and came out.
Everything about the place was in the utmost con
showing that the officers of the law had been there and
made a thorough search.
Now Dennis Prout felt quite safe. He slid the
trapdoor, that formed the bottom of the Dutch oven,
its place, and he closed the iron door. If, therefore,
officer of the law, or anybody else who was not in
secret, should happen to open that iron door on the 
of the fireplace, they would only see a large old ba
oven, and could never suppose that the bottom of it
a sliding trapdoor, covering the head of a flight of 
leading down through the thickness of the wall to the c
or cellar beneath.
The first thing Dennis Prout did was to go outdoors
reconnoiter.
North, south, east, and west, as far as his eyes c
teach, there was not a living creature to be seen.
Behind him lay the downs, rolling northward to the
woods, against which, as against a dense greenbackgro
stood ,the dark-red walls and towers of Hawkewood Ha
To the east, across the dreadful chasm of Demon
rolled the same downs until they were lost to sight on
horizon.
To the south lay the sandy beaqh and "the multitud
seas," sparkling away until they seemed to meet the
in the vast distance. Not a single sail was to be seen
its rippling blue expanse.
To the west rolled the downs again monotonously,
some miles away they were varied by what seemed at
distance mosaic work, of white and red and gray
yellow, but which was really the hamlet of Hawkevillfe.

"Nobody within a mile of Demondike now      'Spose
they'll be back, though. Shouldn't wonder if they didn't
detail an officer, or maybe two or three, to watch the house.
Must make the best use of the time that is left me, how-
ever. Guess I have got two good hours before anybody can
get back here," muttered Prout, as he reentered the house.
He went to work rapidly.
First he found a small shawl, which he spread out upon
the floor. Then he searched and found the old woman's
physic box, brandy bottle, tea cannister, sugar box, match
box, tin teapot, tin cup, and a bundle of fagots-ll of,
which he tied up together in the shawl.
Then he locked and barred the door and closed and bolted
the window shutters and began his descent into the crypt,
carrying the bundle with him.
His progress in going back was slower than his progress
in coming, for he had to take care of his precious bundle.
At length, however, he had passed laboriously down the
concealed steps, through the crypt, along the secret passage,
and had emerged into the lighted cave.

This window looked inland toward Hawkewood Hall.
It now occurred to Dennis Prout to take down an old
spyglass that hung over the mantelpiece and take an ob-
servation.
He immediately acted on the suggestion. 
Kneeling before the window he rested the spyglass on
the sill, then adjusted the lenses to his sight and swept the
downs that lay between the ruined tower and the Hall
At first there was nothing to be seen; but presently,
miles away, there appeared a-group of men ascending one
of the rolling hills, with their faces toward the tower.
As they reached the top of the hill Dennis Prout recog-
nized them by their uniform to be police officers. He
watched them for a few moments until they sank from view 
in an intervening valley, and then he put down his spy- 
glass, saying:
"They are nearly three miles off and walking leasurely up
hill and down dale. It will 6e an hour and a half before
they are here, and we can be ready to receive them." 
He went immediately to work, and made up a bundle of
bedclothing, and pushed it through the secret passage and
down the narrow steps to the crypt below.
Then he took the mattress from under the feather bed
on the bunk, and, rolling it up lengthways, forced it
through the passage and tumbled it down the steps.
Then he sent two pillows down the same way.
Finally he put a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk in
his capacious pockets and began the descent of the steps.
On reaching the crypt he was forced to leave many of
the articles there, for he had to hurry on and warn the
women of tle approach of the police force.
"I have brought you a pillow andc a blanket for the boy.
The other things are in the crypt, and you can get them 
at your leisure. Now, what I wish to tell you.is thise The

the disordered room to rights.

be discharged or secretly watched; and in either case we
should be ruined. Go!" said the woman, peremptorily,
pointing to the door.
"I go for your sake, Nan," replied the man, picking up
the hat that lay at his feet, and walking out of the tower.
He sauntered slowly to the beach and paced up and down
on the sands.
It was ebb tide, and, indeed, almost low tide now, and
    he paced up and down on the sands, sending an occasional
glance inland toward the party of policemen, who were
coming more and more distinctly into sight.
When they were near the tower, Dennis Prout sauntered
slowly on to meet them.
"Good-afternoon, Upperman I Any news of the murder-
ers yet?" he inquired of the foremost officer, a tall, black-
whiskered, melancholy-looking man.
"None whatever, Proutl We can get not the slightest
clue to the movements of the tramp or the valet. The ser-
geant thinks Gow will certainly come back here some time,
and has detailed us to watch the tower," replied Uppermam,
"So I thought when I saw you coming."
"You have heard of the other outrage?"
"No    What?"
"The stealing of the young earls dead body," whi-
pered the policeman, in an awe-inspiring tone.
"The stealing of the young earls dead. body I echoed
the coast guardsman, under his breath.
"Yes, didn't you hear of it?"
"Hear of it?" again echoed the coast guardsman, in a
tone of amazement. "Why, no I I haven't heard of it, ad
I cannot believe it! The young earl's body stolen? Im-
possible! Who stole it-the medical students?"
"We do not know," replied Upperman.
"But where was it stolen from-the family vault?" in-
quired Prout, still staring in consternation.
"From the family vault I No, it had not been put there,

"Bless my soul alive  Wasn't the body watched?"

"What time was the body stolen?"
"Somewhere after midnight, it is supposed."

"This morning, when the undertaker, Blackstone,

"Seems not. The fastenings on the open window 
all in good order as those of any window that had

"Then what do they think about it?"

covered with a deep-black cloth that hung all the way do

"That sounds very likely. Who do they think it

"No, I didn't. I said they didn't know who it was. But
they do suspect the medieal students, because there is no-
body else to suspect."
"That is really so. Bless my old grandmother  Bless
all my old forefathers, if I ever had any I I never heard
of such doings in the whole course of my long and useful
life I Why, the stealing of the murdered man's body beats
the murder all out!" exclaimed Dennis.
"Well, it does, and that is a fact. Murders are com-
mon enough-too common-though it is not often you hear
of a peer of the realm being found murdered in his bed
but the theft of the body under the circumstances is un-
paralleled."
"You said there was no clue to the murderers yet?"
"There's no clue to the retreat of Gow and Delaplaine,
and there is no doubt that they were the murderers, and
that their object was plunder. Why, the amount of the
money and jewels stolen is estimated at fifteen thousand
pounds 1"
"Fif-teen-thou-sand-pounds !      Whe-ew      They
risked their necks for something. However could they
have got away with all that?"
"Easily, because the most valuable part of the booty was
in small compass. Why, Castor and Pollux could have
been carried in a man's mouth I"
"Castor and Pollurl" repeated the coast guardsman, with

a long, blue'stocking drawn over her hand, busily en
in darning and seemingly absorbed in her work.
"Good-afternoon, missus " said the officer, as he en
the room.
"Good-afternoon," returned Nan, looking up for an

"Didn't find you here when we paid our visit to the tower
this morning," he continued, cooly taking a seat and put-
ting his hat down between his feet.
"I didn't know you owed the tower a visit," returned
Nan, scrutinizing the hole in the stocking she was darning.
"Didn't you? Well, we did, then  Your-relation, Mr.
Ham Gow, made quite an interesting visit to the young Earl
of Hawkewood one night, and as his lordship is not in a
condition to respond to it, his friends have deputed me to
return it, and urged me-in case of his absence from the 
tower-to remain here until his return. So I may pay
my respects to Mr. Gow in person," said the inspector,
pleasantly, and with a bow.
"I know what you mean, you cruel wretch! You de-
mon 1" cried Young Nan, losing all her hardly sustained
self-control-"I know there is a warrant out against our
poor boy for the murder of Lord Hawkewood  But he was
no more like to do a murder than you, no, nor half as

The inspector bowed godd-humoredly.
"Do you mean to say that you are going to stop here
day and night?" demanded Nan.
"Until further orders, missus," evasively'replied the in-
spector.
"Then you will starve to death, that is one comfort, for
I have got nothing to give you to eat or to drink."
The inspector carefully drew from one capacious pocket
a good-sized loaf of bread and from the other a big chunk
of cheese and a flask of spirits, all of which he placed on
the floor at his feet, saying coolly:
"The garrison is provisioned for several days, missus."
"Are you going to intrude here day and night, I ask
you, in this place, where there are only women living, and
where there is but this one room for eating and sleepingr"
indignantly screamed Nan.

she had never possessed.

As for the young man, soothed into delicious repose by
the sedative and cooling herb teas and decoctions applied
inwardly and outwardly by his doctress, he lay in a state
of blissful unconsciousness of all the evils of life.
The officers on guard at the ruined tower were relieved
morning and evening by others, but the guard was kept up
for a week.
Young Nan protested in vain against this invasion of
her privacy; but she had no sort or right to a residence
in the ruined tower. She and her mother were but tol-
erated squatters on the estate of the Earl of Hawkewood,
paying no rent for their tenement, and holding no permit
to occupy it.
The successor of Inspector Upperman who relieved that
good-humored officer of his guard, was a rude, plain-spoken
man, who told Young Nan that if she did not approve of
'his company, not being under arrest herself, she was at
liberty to leave the tower, but that he should obey orders
and stay there.
The only concession he made was to permit the poor
woman to curtain off a portion of the room with quilts and
blankets around her bed to construct a private sleeping
ompartment. And, of course, Nan went in and out of
the tower as she pleased.
One of her greatest anxieties was that possibly Ham
OW might suffer for some medicine or food that was not
at hand, or that Old Nan might be tempeted by weariness
f confinement, or the want of something, to come out of
te cave, and through the secret passage to the ruined tower,
hile the police remained in possession of it. Such a pro-
ing she knew must lead to the discovery of the unier-
round passage, the arrest of Ham Gow, the seizure of the
uggled goods contained in the cavern, and the breaking
P of their contraband trade.
But as we have shown, Nan's fears were groundless; for

On the first day, however, on which she was able to con-
verse, she startled the duke, her father, very considerably,
by saying:
"If you please, papa, I wish you to send for Mr. Ball, or
some other magistrate, to come here and take my deposition.
I have most important testimony to give in relation to the
murder of the Earl of Hawkewood."
CHAPTER VII
WHAT LADY VOLANTE SAW
With caution judge of probability;
Things deemed unnatural, e'en impossible,
Experience oft hath shown us to be true.
-SHAKESPEAE.
"MY dear Volante! My dear child! You have im-
portant testimony to give in relation to the murder of the
Earl of Hawkewood! What on earth can you know of it,
my girl ?" inquired the duke, in amazement.
"I know that the two men-the poor vagrant, Ham Gow,
and the valet, Henri Delaplaine, who, as I am informed,
have been accused of the murder, are not guilty."
"Volante I"
"I speak the truth, papa! But I would rather not utter
another word until I make a deposition under oath, in the
presence of a magistrate. I wish you would send for Mr.
Ball  I shall feel easier, and recover sooner, for having
this burden off my mind," said the young lady.
"Volante! Is it possible that you can know who com-
mitted that murder? If so, how in the world came you to
know it?  Through your maid, Melanie Labb6?"
"No, papa I I have not seen nor heard of Melanie since
I came here to the Hall. They tell me she has fled."
"In company of the valet, who is accused of participa-m
tion in the murder of the earl; yes."
"She may have gone away to marry Delaplaine, for I
know she was engaged to him. She told me so, and gave

the duke, rather impatiently.

"Are you able to do that, my dear? Will not the

the young lady.

"Very well, dear."
The duke left the room.

THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                  85
Lady Volante, with the help of the nurse, got out of
bed, donned a dark-blue cashmere wrapper, lined and faced
with dark-blue satin, and passed into the adjoining boudoir,
where she sank into an easy-chair near the crimson-cur-
tained window.
It was a rich, arm-hued room, upholstered in crimson
and gold, and lined with mirrors and choice pictures.
The nurse placed a footstool under the lady's feet and
a stand by her side.
These arrangements were scarcely completed when there
came a rap at the door. 
The nurse went to it, and admitted the Duke of Grand
Manors and Mr. Ball, of Bowling Downs.
The latter advanced with a bow, saying:
"I am happy to see you up again, my dear young lady."
"I thank you, Mr. Ball. Pray be seated. Nurse, you
can retire," said the invalid.
The woman drew forth two chairs for Lady Volante's
visitors, and then withdrew.
When she had closed the door behind her, the duke
turned to the magistrate, and said:
" As I informed you, sir, my daughter has some important 
testimony to give in relation to the lamentable death of
the young Earl of Hawkewood."
The magistrate bowed to the duke, and addressed the
young lady:
"Yes, I understand from his grace that your ladyship
wishes to make a deposition under oath as to some facts
that have come to your knowledge touching that deplorable
event."
"I do. Administer the oath to me, and I will state all
I know," replied Lady Volante.
"Do you reflect, my dear young lady, that the statement
you are about to make to me may subject you to the in-
convenience of being subpoenaed as a witness on the trial,
should anyone be tried for this murder?" inquired the
magistrate, rather overstepping his official duty in giving
this warning.
"I know that, sir, and I know, also, it is my bounden
duty to give any information within my knowledge that
may tend to vindicate the innocent and discover the guilty,

at whatever inconvenience to myself," firmly replied
Volante. 
The duke nodded approval of his daughter's words.'
The magistrate bowed, drew from his pocket a di
edition of the'New Testament, and, holding it out t
young lady, dictated the formula of the oath.
She repeated the words after him in a grave and
solemn tone, and then reverently took the book in her 
and pressed it to her lips.
"UNow, then, my dear, go on; but speak slowly, 
must take down your testimony, and I am not quit
quick at that work as is my absent clerk," said the ma
trate, as he drew a notebook, bottle of ink, and a
pen from his pocket, and drew the little stand before
and prepared to write.
"You appear to carry your office about with you,
Ball," said the duke, with a slight smile.
"I have carried this much of it about with me ever
the terrible events of last week," replied the mast
"Are you ready, Mr. Ball?" inquired Lady Volante
"Quite ready, your ladyship."
"Listen, then: It was on the evening, or, rather, to

honest person. Neither did I like to rouse the tired house-
hold then-at least, not until I had tried to find it alone.
"I therefore took my bedroom candle, which was half
burned out, and set forth to look for my lost jewel, resolv-
ing that in case I should not find it to rouse the household
to assist in the search.
"The hall clock struck four as I left my room. I passed
along the main upper hall, but I must have taken the
wrong turning in the unfamiliar house, for I entered what
I have since heard was the 'bachelors' corridor.'
"As I was passing along this everything seemed very
quiet, until suddenly a door opened.
"I was so startled and frightened that I immediately
shrank out of sight up one of the dark cross passages,
and shaded my lamp as well as I could.
"Two persons came out of that room, and from the light
that shone out through the open door I recognized both.
One was the valet, Henri Delaplaine; the other was the
tramp, Ham Gow. I knew them both by sight, for I had
seen them frequently in the neighborhood.
"I shrank still farther back into the dark passage, for
I was afraid of being seen in my dishabille.
"But nearly at the same instant in which I saw the men
leave the room and shrank back from them, I heard a voice,
which I recognized as that of the Earl of Hawkewood:
" 'Out by the kitchen door, Delaplaine, and thence out
by the north gate.'
"And immediately the open door was closed and locked
by the earl within the room, while the valet was showing
the tramp out," concluded Lady Volante.
"And you saw and heard all this?" inquired the magis-
trate in amazement.
"I saw and heard all this while I was shrinking back
in the dark passage, shading my taper with my hand, at
four o'clock in the morning," repeated Lady Volante.
"You say that you saw the chamber door open, the
valet and the tramp come out of the room together, and
you heard the voice of the earl, within the open door, direct-
ing the valet how to take the tramp from the premises, and
their heard the earl close the door and lock himself in the
room ?" demanded the duke.


 
<pb n="90"/>
88     THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT
"Yes, papa, I saw and heard all that; and it all p
in one or two minutes," replied the young lady. 
"But, don't you see, my dear, that what you saw pro
nothing whatever in favor of the accused? You saw 
go out, and you heard the earl lock them out; but later
they might have returned, picked the lock, and perpetra
that murder and that robbery."
"They might have done so, but they did not, papa. La

"My dearest child I"
These exclamations were simultaneously uttered by
duke and the magistrate.
"I saw the murderer," repeated the young lady, gr
ing very pale and speaking very low.
"Under what circumstances?" inquired the magistra
in an almost equally subdued voice.
"Papa, a glass of wine, please-I think you will

"This has been too much for you. You should not

and hastened into his daughter's bedchamber to fetch
glass of wine.
"I should have undertaken it sooner. I should h
given this evidence in at the inquest. It would have chan

proachfully.
"My dear young lady    Who could have possibly 
agined such-an improbable circumstance as that you sho
have known anything connected with the murder? No 
thought of summoning you. Besides, if anyone had d
so, you were much too ill to attend," replied Mr. B
"That is true," sighed Lady Volante.
The duke returned with the glass of wine.
His daughter sipped half of it; then placed the g
on the table and continued her testimony:
"When the valet and the tramp had disappeared, 
the earl had closed and locked his door, I came out of

hiding-place and passed along to the main upper hall and
down the grand staircase, looking for my pendant as I
went.
"I could not find it there, so I passed down into the
lower hall and on into the ballroom, where I looked very
carefully, but in vain.
"I looked for a long time. I think I must have been
two hours engaged in that vain search. Then my candle,
which had burned very low, suddenly sank in its socket and
went out.
"I should have been in total.darkness but for the smol-
dering coal fires in the grates of the front and back chim-
neys. By their faint gleams of light I found my way to
the door, with the intention of having the housekeepers and
the butler roused to inquire for the lost jewel.
"Just as I passed out of the ballroom into the hall,
however, I saw my missing diamond, shining like a glow-
worm, at the foot of the last step of the staircase.
"I picked it up with joy, and began to ascend the stairs,
guiding myself through the darkness by the balusters. Thus
I reached the great hall and felt my way along the walls,
trying to reach the corirdor in which my apartments were
situated.
"As I passed before the archway leading into the 'bache-
lors' corridor,' the moonlight from a painted glass window
at the other end shone down the vista, and shone on the
figure of. a man who was just emerging from the earl's
room."
Here the duke and the magistrate bent with breathless
attention toward the speaker, who paused, reached her hand
toward the glass of wine on the stand, sipped a few drops,
replaced it and continued:
"The man wore a dark dressing-gown, corded around
his waist, and a dark smoking-cap with a tassel at its
side. His face was deadly pale and haggard, or it looked
so in the moonlight. He glanced anxiously, fearfully, as
it seemed to me, up and down the corridor.
"He could not see me, though I saw'him distinctly, for
I was in the deep shadows of the main hall, while he
stood in the direct line of the moonlight from the painted
window at the end of that corridor.

"After looking up and down with that scared expr

"Volante! Did you recognize this man?" inquired

"This man must have been some one who was staying
in the house," suggested the magistrate.
"I do not know," replied the lady.
"Lady Volante  My dear young lady '" began the magis-
trate solemnly. "Remember that you have sworn to speak
'the truth'-which I have no doubt you will speak-and
also 'the whole truth.' Are you telling the whole truth
now, my dear? Are you keeping nothing back?"
"No, nothing whatever, in any manner relating to this
case," firmly replied the lady.
"Not even your possible suspicion of the identity of this
man whom you saw emerge from the earl's door on the
night of the murder?"
"Not even that, for I had no suspicion of his identity,"
answered the lady.
"And yet it would seem that he must have been one of
the guests in the house, and you must have seen him."
"I do not know. I did not recognize him at all as any-
one I had ever seen before."
"Yet the male visitors who remained overnight are easily,
very easily, counted-the duke, myself, and Mr. Lewis Man-
ton, now the Earl of Hawkewood," said Mr. Ball.
Lady Volante Belle Isle smiled slightly, sadly, and an-
swered:
"The man I saw looked like neither of the three."
"Some other one of the guests may have remained sur-
reptitiously in the house, or some outsider may have taken
advantage of the open doors and windows and secreted
himself within it," Auggested the duke.
"It may have been so," answered the magistrate.
"Yes," assented Lady Volante.
"Should your ladyship be able to recognize this man if
you should see him again P'
"I do not know. I saw but little of his face. The collar
of his dressing-gown was turned up around the nape of
his neck and his cheeks. His smoking-cap was pulled down
ever his eyebrows and ears. I saw nothing of his face but
his nose, mouth, and chin, white and smooth."
"You saw no one in the breakfast room that reminded
you of him ?"
"No one."

all our lives," said Nan spitefully.
"No, that they wouldn't. But they say-and stick to it
now-that they took Ham Gow over to the coast of France
on the morning of the murder, before anyone had heard
anything about it."
"Eh!" exclaimed Nan, in unbounded amazement.
"They say, and they evidently believe, that they carried
Ham Gow to the coast of France, and left him there. And
now they have gone up to the Hall to give information. So
your house will be free of the police in a few hours. And
now I must be gone, my girl. Good-by."

"THE Earl of Hawkewood should be informed of this
new testimony," said the duke to the magistrate, as they
left Lady Volante Belle Isle's room.
"I think so," replied the latter. "We will communicate
with him at once."
The two gentlemen went downstairs to the lower hall,
where they found the porter and a footman waiting.
"Where is Lord Hawkewood?" inquired the duke of the
last-mentioned domestic.
"His lordship is in the library, your grace," replied the
footman, touching his forehead with his finger by way of
a bow.
"Show us thither," said the duke.
The footman only pdinted to his forehead this time, as
he turned to lead the way down the lower halL.
He opened a rear door on the left and announced:

The two gentlemen entered the library, and the foo

Manton, Earl of Hawkewood, was lying on a sofa betw
two front windows, smoking a well-browned pipe and
ping brandy and water from a glass that stood on a l
table by his side.
He arose and laid down his pipe as the two gentl
entered.
"Good-morning, my lord! I have ventured to intrudel
your privacy for a little matter of business," said the m
trate.
"Take a seat, Mr. Ball. Duke, here is a comfor

the earl hospitably.
The visitors sat down.
"I hope Lady Volante is still improving, duke,"

"Anything new in regard to the homicide, or the theft,

"Nothing about the body-snatching, but some new

"Indeed? What may this new evidence be? And

evident agitation.

ably, than any other human being in the world, wit

The Earl of Hawkewood turned around and looked out
of the window at the head of the sofa.
"I thought I saw a man coming whom I know," he
explained, as he turned again, keeping his back to the light
and his face in the shade.
"Lady Volante had occasion to leave her room that
night, in search of a lost jewel. In passing the 'bachelors'
corridor,' as she went down to the ballroom, she saw the
Earl of Hawkewood dismiss the valet and the tramp, and
lock his own door after them. This was at about four
o'clock in the morning."
"Lady Volante Belle Isle saw this?" exclaimed the earl,
"She did."
"Then I don't see how they could have committed the
murder."
"She -declares that they did not, and that another person
did the deed."
The new earl started involuntarily; and then, controlling
himself, he inquired:
"Who does she say committed the murder?"
"She does not know who the man was, though she saw
him leaving the earl's room as she was returning to her
own after a long search for her diamond."
"How-was-that ?" inquired the new Lord Hawkewood,
in a quavering tone.
"I had better tell you all about it. It was near four
o'clock, remember, when, in going down to the hall, she
saw the Earl of Hawkewood let out the valet and the tramp,
and lock himself in his room after their departure. Two
hours later, at six o'clock, she had found her jewel, but had
lost her light, for her candle had burned low, sunk down
in the socket and gone out, and she was returning in the
dark, when, in passing the archway leading into the 'bache-
lors' corridor,' she saw, by the light of the moon which shone
through a stained-glass bow window at the end opposite
the archway, a man emerging from the late earl's room."
"What sort of a man?" inquired the new Lord Hawke-
wood, in irrepressible agitation.
"A young, fair man, with smooth, beardless chin, clothed
in a dark dressing-gown, corder around his waist, and a
dark smoking-cap with a gold tassel. He stood for a mo-

The agitation of the new Lord Hawkewood now 
almost uncontrollable. He could scarcely steady his

"Did her ladyship recognize this man?"
"Why, no, my lord-no! I think I said or hinted
much before. She did not recognize him," replied Mr. 
"Would she know him again if she were to see him ?'
"She cannot certainly tell. She says she only saw

At this instant a footman entered the room and said
"If it please my lord, there are three of the Hawk

"Yes."

a state of agitation, two hours after the earl had dismissed

this unknown man had nothing to do with the murder,

if you please, we will have those fishermen in," said the
earl, pulling the bell cordi

authorities have received certain information that he has
fled to the coast of France, and! ' pair of police officer.,
armed with a writ of requistion, have already been dis-
patched in pursuit of him. So, mistress," said Robbins,
looking around and addressing Nan, "you are to be re-
lieved of the, good company which yon did not appreciate
while you enjoyed it."
"A good riddance of bad rubbish I Why don't you go?"
demanded Nan.
"We are going now," said Robbins.
And they went.
Nan arose and bolted the door after the departing men,
and then went to that back window which looked inland
toward the Hall and watched them until, a fall of the downs
hid them from her sight.
Then she dropped down in her chair and gave way to
a long fit of laughter-muttering between her paroxysms:
"Escaped to the coast of Francej has he? Ha! ha! ha I
ha! ha! Two peelers with a warrant sent after. him, eh ?
Ha! ha ha I ha I ha! I wonder who it was that old Abbott
did take over, anyhow? Ha! hal ha! ha! lal Couldn't

Well, I must now go to see Ham. .I have not seen him
for more than a week. , He may be dead, or in a dying
condition. But I do not think so. If he were in such
extremity I know :moo;r would risk anything to let me
know. But I will satisfy myself at once. Stay, though!
I must gather up some.provisions to take with me for them,
for what they had must be well-nigh exhausted by this
time."
So thinking, Young Nan went to her big oaken chest
and brought out a long canvas bag, which she proceeded
to fill with several bundles of fagots and a loaf of bread,
a paper of tea, another of sugar, a bottle of milk, another
of brandy, a couple of candles, a tin box of matches% and
finally, a roll of clean linen.
When all her preparations were completed she secured
the door and window of.the strong room, opened the iron
trap leading to the secret subterranean passage, and took
her way to the cave.

have been arrested. We should all have been imprisoned;

goods seized; the smuggling band brokn up, and-Ham
would have been hanged for a crime he never could have
committed," gravely replied Young Nan.
"Then if there was so much danger from my coming up
into the tower, why didn't you awide the chance of it by
coming down to tell us ?" fiercely demanded Old Nan.
"Because the tower was in the possession of the police,
from the day you left it until this day. A policeman was
on guard in the strong room all the time, and never left
it until he was relieved by another policeman"
"Whatl Night as wellas day?"
"Yes,. night as well as day."

"I could not have left the tower by the secret passage

"A good dodge l" put in Ham.
"Yes, but we couldn't get anybody to do itl Dennis
himself would a done it in a minute, only, you see, he had
already given in his evidence at the crowner's 'quest, as how

"Them canting Wesleyans? Yes, I do."
"Well, then, on the morning of the murder they sailed

"Now, Ham, you know these men wouldn't lie.".

"Blamed if I knowI" said the tramp, lifting his head
with a perfectly helpless and idiotic look. 
"Hlow should'he know? Was he theme to see?. lDot be

he had good reason to be. Now, it might hae been the
Earl of Hawkewood as they took over, only that they sailed
at sunrise, you say, and the young earl was found dead in
his bed at noon the same day I So it ooulnd't 'a' been him,
anyhow 1" concluded Old Nan.
"No, evidently it couldn't 'a' been him I.- He ceuldnt 'a'
been sailing across the seas between England and France
and lying dead in his bed at the very same time, eh ?" said
the tramp.
"Let alone the facts, as, if he'd 'a' been alive and well,
he'd got no cause to go over the seas in a'oncomfortable;
rolling, sickening, little sailboat, bad enough to make the
best sailor heave his stomach overboard,". added Young
Nan.
"Certainly, what call should a nobleman have to put
himself to such il-ceonvenience? Of course, it could not
have been my lord,, even supposing he had been alive, when
we all know that he was dead," said the tramp.
"Who could it have .UeenP" muttered Nan, returning to
the previous question                -
"Since it wasn't nme and couldn't have been my lord,
blamed if I know who it was!" replied Ham, with the
same assumption of imbecility.
"It was a good job ftr you, whoever it was," exclaimed
the old woman.
"Ah, you may say that! !AUd I mean to take advantage
of it by leaving this place by the first of our vessels that

turned the tramp.
"You got that wound on the night or morning you saved 
the young earl's life-for a little while-that was twenty-
four hours before you reeled into this tower and fell faint-
ing on the floor. Now, Ham Gow, where did you pass the
time between the minutes you got hurt and the minute you
stumbled into the tower and fell down on the floor? Tell
me that !" said Nan, in a voice of authority.
"That is another mystery, and the deepest mystery of
all. If I were to tell you that, I should give you the key

dered the Earl of Hawkewood. Now, while they are about
it, why did they not harge me with having walked off with

little more probable than the other 1" exclaimed Ham with
a chuckle. 
Meanwhile Nan was untying the mouth of the canvas

"Fagots! I'm glad of tem, anyway. The old woman
hasn't had a cup of tea for 'two days just because we had
no means of making a fire to boil water," exclaimed Ham,
as Old Nan seized the bundle of chips and the box of
matches and began to kindle a fire on the rocky ground of
the cavern.
"It is well the food held out," said Nan.
"Oh, yes, such as it was. Ship biscuit and smoked beef !

answered quite gravely: "What should we, sure enough?"
While Young Nan said never a word.
Ham Gow then walked off to a remote part of the caverh
to change his "linen." And when this was done Mrs.
Crook made a bundle of his soiled clothing and took it off
with her when she left the cavern for the strong room in
the tower.
Old Nan was very glad to get back to her own home.
On emerging from the opening of the secret passage she
proceeded to strike a light and kindle a fire, and to make
herself generally comfortable.
Then she opened the door and looked out. The sun had
just set, and in the west the sea and sky were both aflame
with the afterglow. Th tide was in, and very high, and
Demondike was roaring and foaming like a cataract. But
not a human being was in sight.
Old Nan seated herself on the doorsill, partly to enjoy
the evening, which was unisually warm for the middle of
September, and partly to watch for any chance appearance
of Red Dennis, whom she wished to question on the subject
of La Belle Fenmme, and the smuggler, Moreau.
She sat there watching until the last faint light died in
the west, and the ihadE w of darkness crept over the earth.
Then feeling the chill of the night air, she turaed into
the house, and locked tHe door.
Finally she made a large mug of strong brandy toddy,
and drank it all, an&d betook herself to bed.
Now, whether it was the brandy, the, fatigue, or the
feather bed, or all together, we cannot tll, but no sooner
had Old Nan settled herbead upon the pillow, and drawn
her blankets up over her shoulders, thaun she fell into a
deep and dreamless sleep, that lasted all night and late into
the next morning..

woman, and she went about her work -more cherfully.

the smugglers' cave, another startling piece of intelligence
was received at the Hall, in direct eontroversion of the
fishermen's statement concerning his escape to France.
On that morning, Mr. Ball, the magistrate, was closeted
with the earl iA the handsome library of Hawkewood.
They were talking on the endless theme of the mysteri-
ous murder of the late earl on the morning after his birth-
night ball and of the still more mysterious theft of the
body on the night after the inquest.
"No clue has as yet been obtained to the bodysnatchers;
If the young medical students were the guilty parties they
have done their work so effectually as to leave no trace of
their action behind them! But, thank Heaven, we have
now a sure clue to the fugitive murderer," the earl was
saying, in a cheerful tone, for his lordship had wonderfully
recovered his spirits within the last few days.
"Yesl Yes, indeed! We shall have him back here in
less than a week! He may have'gone on to Paris in the
hope of losin'g himself and spending his booty in that great,
overcrowded city; but Lord bless you ! the French detectives
would in that case unearth him in twenty-four hours !"
replied Mr. Ball.
"Well! What do you want?" demanded the earl of an
obtrusive footman who entered the library at this moment.
The man advanced respectfully and held out a silver
salver on which lay avisiting-card.
The earl screwed his eyeglass, which he affectedly wore,
into his right eye, and squinted at the card. 
"The Rev. George-no, Paul-'Rev., Paul Traverse'.--
Ah, yes! Your steward's jnephew that used to be curate
here, under old Singleton, ard left him last year to take a
poor charge in Bermondseyt. Let us see, he has written
something here in pencil--Itwis fellows would write with
a pen and ink or a good black pencil, distinctly," continued
the earl, as he squinted more eWlely at the card, and inally
said-" Impertinent'-No!     Important information   to 
communicate in regard to the. fugitive murderer.' Ah,
indeed! Let him ome in! Shot the parson up, Stepney."
The footman bowed and left the room.

that be? I should suppose that you would think it
your bounden duty to assist in bringing that deeply-
criminal to justice?" exclaimed the earl.

the magistrate, drawing writing materials before him to
take down the notes.
"I am coming to that," said the curate. "The murder
was committed on the morning of the second of September,
I believe."
"Yes, in the very early morning, before day," replied
Mr. Ball.
"When was it first discovered, if you please?"
"About one o'clock in the afternoon; for we all slept
late after the birthnight ball, and did not assemble to break-
fast until about noon. Then we waited for the earl some
time before Dr. Laude sent to have him called. Then the
young earl was found dead in his bed."
"At what time was the inquest held, the verdict rendered,
and the warrants issued for the apprehension of Gow and
his accomplice?' Forgive me for troubling you with these
questions, but I have reasons."
"The inquest was held late that afternoon. The verdict
was rendered late at night. The warrants were then im-
mediately issued and placed in the hands of the officers,
who, however, were unable to do much with them until
the next morning."
"The morning of the third of September."
"Exactly."
"Now, then. I had been down in,this neighborhood onu
a visit to my uncle, his lordship's steward, for a week. On
the morning of the second of September-the morning on
which the murder was committed-and probbaly about two
or three hours after it was committed-I took the seven
A. M. train from the Hawkeville station to London. I rode
in the thitd.class carriage as a matter of economy, and--
I sat beside Ham Gow, as a matter of chance, all the way to
town." 
"What!" exclaimed the earl and the magistrate in a
breath, as they stared at the parson and then at each other.
"I say, I rode with Ham Gow and talked with him all
the way from Hawkeville Station to London, on the morn-
ing of the second of September. What is there so mar-
velous in the assertion to make you stare so?" demanded
the curate.

gased at the curate in no less astonishment.
"I do, most distinctly," repeated that gentleman. 
"Do you know Ham Gow?" inquired the earl. 
"Just as well as I know anyone else in the world."
"Are you sure it was he?"
The parson smiled sadly as he answered:
"Why, certainly, it is quite impossible for me to be
taken in him. But what is there so very surprising in,
fact of his escaping on the morning of the murder by 
early train to London and in the chance of my being 
companion on the journey?" inquired the parson, w
curiosity was aroused.
"Oh, nothing, my friend-nothing but what we will
plain presently. Now tell us, however, if you rode
Hawkeville Station to London, on the morning of the 
der, with Gow, why, when you heard of the murder, an
the warrant that was out against Gow-as you must

day morning. Yesterday noon, on looking over the two
weeks' file of papers, I learned for the first time of the
murder of the young Earl of Hawkewood on the morning
of the second of September, and of the verdict of the in-
quest which charged Ham Gow with the crime. I instantly
remembered that it was on the same morning on which I
started with him by the early train from Hawkeville to
London.: Gentlemen, I lost no time.  I hastened to the
station and took the first train to Hawkeville, where I ar-
rived this morning. I came immediately out here. Could
I have done better?"
"No, indeed. Mr. Travers, you could not," replied the
new earl, who had listened with grave respect to the ex-
planation of the minister.
"And I heartily beg your pardon, reverend sir, for my
implied criticism of your conduct. And I ar sure Lord
Hawkewood joins me in earnest sympathy with you," said
the magistrate gravely.
"Indeed, I do," murmured the earl.
The curate bowed deeply, and took his hat from the
floor and arose as if to depart.
"Nay, nay, pray sit a little longer. I have some quese
tions which I would like to ask you," said Mr. Ball.
"And we would like to have you stop and dine and take
a bed here to-night," added the earl. 
"Thanks, but I must return to London to-night," replied
the curate, as he resbiuied his seat.
"Now answer me, 3r. Traverse, for this is a very seri-
ous question: Are you ipoitively certain that you know'
Ham Gow, and that it va himself and no other who sat
by your side and rode wit, you all the way from Hawke-
ille Station to London oQ the morning of the murder ?"
'I am positively certain. I said so before."
."And could you swear .to hat fact?"
"I will swear to it. You are a justice of the peace, Mr.
Ball. Administer the, usual oath. I will take it willingly."
"It is not necessary. I fel .sure that you believe what
you state."
"I feel sure that I know what I state."
"And you say that you saw Gow on board the Aus.

"Of course I know them-good, conscientious C
men, though they do prefer the Wesleyan to the Esta

"You would believe them under oath?"
"I would take the simple word of either of them, as
as I would the oath of any other man."

Gow familiarly all his life, and that at sunrise on the

he could speak. "Ham Gow could not have been

The three gentlemen arose quickly, with questioning
looks.
"Forgive this intrusion, but I have important testimony
to give in relation to the fugitive from justice, Ham Gow,
whom I have met face to face this morning l" exclaimed
the doctor, dropping into the nearest vacant chair.
"Eh !" cried the magistrate, staring.
"What " exclaimed the minister, staring.
"The deuce you say 1" remarked the earl, whistling.
"Yesl you may wonder, but it is a factl I was in the
neighborhood of Stony Fells, where I had been up all night
with a patient. I was on my way home, about sunrise,
when I came suddenly upon Ham Gow l"
"Where? where !" cried the three gentleman, in a breath.
"In the private road leading from the turnpike at Stony
Fells. He recognized me, but tried to pretend he did not;
but when I called upon him, in the name of the queen, to
give himself up to the law, he laughed in my face, and
asked:
" 'How long have you been a bumbailie, doctor, and
where is your warrant?' 
"I then jumped off my horse; but before I was quite
free he turned and fed into the thick woods by the roadside.
"I followed him, bht in vain. He was completely lost
in the wilderness of tree., 
"After along search I came out of the woods, rem6unted
my horse and rode ofto' the police station to lodge the
information. Then I dacie on here." ' 
"Dr. Ellis, are you sure that the man you met was Ham
Gow ?" inquired the magiste:         '
"Absolutely sure. But why do you all look so amazed?"P
"Because there seems to be three Ha;n Gows."'

tramp since his childhood, eid you state that you met him
face to face, on the road from Stony Fells to Demondike,
and you cannot-be mistaken, because you know Ham Gow
as well as you know your own self," concluded the magis-
trate, with a little subtle sarcasm in his tone.
"No, I cannot be mistaken in the man; but the other
two parties are so. Gow is neither an the coast of France
nor on his- way to Australia. He is in this county of Corn-
wall and neighborhood of Havkeville'" replied Dr. Ellis,
ignoring the sarcasm.
"What do you say to this, reverend' sir?" demanded the
magistrate, turning with a smile to the minister.
"I say, with all respect to Dr. Ellis, that he must be in
error. He met some man in the woodland path in the
early morning who may have resembled Gow, and whom he
must have taken for Gow, but who could not have been

"'Lost time and labor!" exclaimed the parson and the
doctor, in a breath.
"Another officer must be sent with a warrant to Aus-
tralia, It is a long way, but such an atrocious murderer
must be brought to justice, emen if he has to be brought
from the uttermost parts of the earth."
"Assuredly," assented the minister.
"A perfect wild-goose chase!" exclaimed the doctor, and
the fisherman nodded agreement with the opinion.
"And, finally, detectives must scour the country around
Demondike and Stony Fells," concluded the magistrate.
"Ah! now you are speaking sensibly at last!" exclaimed
Dr. Ellis. 
'"You won't find him in this country I" cried the minister
and the fisherman in'a breath.
"Because he is on the South Atlantic Ocean by this
time," added the minister.
"For, you see, he is some'rs in France," concluded the
fisherman. 
The magistrate laughed, and the earl turned and in-
quired:
"But what speci4lJusiness brought you here this morn-
iag, Abbott?" 
"It were this red woolen scarf, what belonged to Ham
Gow, your honor, and what I found to-day while I was
overhauling the cabin of my craft. He wore it on board
the vessel, and he must have forgotten and left it there
when he went on shoreW"
"Ahl Gow's scarf 1-Yes!-This is- Corroborative evi-
dence, if it can be identietl as Gow's," said Mr. Ball, as
he took the scarf from the lxhads of the fisherman.
"His name be knit into it,'if you will look, sir. Young
Nan be very clever at kttfing names and 'nitials into
things," explained the fisherman.
"Ay, here it is, sure enough; knit into the pattern," said
the magistrate, examining the scarf.
"And he had it on when he came on board, sir. And he
must have left it when he went on shore, because I found
it when I were overhauling the craft." 
"Very well; we will keep this scarf, in case it should be
wanted. It certainly supports your evidence, Abbott."

But as neither the Church of England cler

The fisherman now bowed himself out, and his
example was soon followed by the minister and it
: "And now, my lord," said the magistrate, as so
was left alone with the earl, "is not this the moti

"Yes," assented his lordship, in a low tone.

"Yes'" breathed the earl faintly.

"But Lady Volante's testimony does not end here. She
saw this transaction at the door of his rkdship's chamber

Nearly two hours later, having found' her jewel, she was

At this moment a deadly pattess overspread the face
of the new earl, his head sank to the back of his chair, and
his hands clutched the arms. 
"You-you are ill, my lord I Let meget you something I"
exclaimed Mr. Ball, in alarm, as he spring lip and walked
over to the beaufet.
"No-no-it is nothing-a spasm of the heart, to which
I am subject. There, it is over. Go on," said the earl,
striving, and not withett gsccess, to recover his calmness.

for a coat, and in other ways improve his toilet, to join his
guests at the luncheon board.
Yes, the Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors and the
Lady Volante Belle Isle were to leave Hawkewood Hall the
next morning.
Since the disclosure made by the young lady to the
magistrate, of the strange scenes witnessed by her in the
bachelors' corridor, before daybreak on the morning of the
murder, she had seemed like one whose mind was relieved
of a heavy burden.
Her spirits rallied and her health and strength returned,
The time for her departure to Castle Belle Isle was fixed.
To-day she was to essay her strength by coming down to
lunch whn the family.
After breakfast to-morrow she would depart with her
parents for their home.
While Lord Hawkewood was dressing in his own room,
Lady Volante Belle Isle was puting the last touches to her
own toilet in her boudoir. She wore black in honor of the
Hall's mourning for its late lord.
Her dress on this occasion was a lusterless black silk,
lightly trimmed with black crape, and finished with narrow
white crep lise l ruches around her throat and wrists. Her
ornaments were jet earrings, brooch,,necklace, and brace-
lets. Her raven black hair was desd high on the crown of 
her head in puffs and braids, and a fringe of silky curls on
the edge of her forhead. A single-white rose on the side
of her head set off the darkness of her tresses.
Having completed her simple toilet, she sat down to 'wtt
for her mother.
When the duchess joined her they walked down together
to the small breakfast parlor, where the dainty luncheon
was laid. 
Here they were soon joined by the duke, who came in
from a stroll in the park, adI by the late tutor, who was
still a guest in the house, and lastly by their host, the new
Lord Hawkewood, who bowed. o his assembled party, and
then went up to Lady Volante Belle Isle, took her hand
and very warmly congratulated her on her convalescence
and expressed his joy at seeing her among them again.
But how anxiously he scanned her face in the nmeentimel

He would gladly have given her his arm to the

The young earl took the head of his own table, with'
duchess on his right hand and the beauty on his left.
to the duchess sat Dr. Laude, and next to the young
sat the duke.
As their host, Lord Hawkewood divided his atte
very equally between the two ladies, but his eyes dwelt
frequently upon the beautiful face of Lady Volante.
Soon after luncheon the young lady retired -to her 
and did not leave it again that day.
No allusion had been made to the morning of the 
edy. It was thought best not to touch upon the agita
subject in her presence, for, though convalescent, she,
not yet restoed to full health and strength; but the

MEIoON has been made, in this story, of Stony Felle,

It was a portion of the vast estate of Hawkewood, though
it was -situated about. fve miles up the coast from Demon-
dike and about eight fromHawke Hall.
The house was an edifi  of immense strength, built of
stone upon the extreme point of a rocky promontory over-
hanging the sea.
It was a much more ancient building than Hawke Hall,
and had been the residence of the Hawkewood family for
centuries before the Hall was erected.
The ground around it is rocky and nearly barren, yield-
ing only a coarse grass and a few hardly evergreen and other
stunted trees.
The chief value of the estate in the olden time had been

its fisheries; but even these had declined in the latter'
through some changes in the coast. 
The old house had remained uninhaited for man 
for, in fact, it was by no means "a deirable faly 
dence"-to use the words of the agents.
.But a few years before the opening of this story it
been leased at a very low rate by a widow lady of aristoc
aspirations and slender means.
-This tenant might undoubtedly have made herself 
comfortable with the same money in some pretty mod
villa or cottage orn6e,, of which there were seven to be
in the beautiful neighborhood of Hawkeville; but-
seemed to prefer the prestige of living in an ance
manor house, once the family seat of a long line of nob
even although it was bare, bleak, uncomfortable, and, fr
its remoteness, solitude, and' isolation, dangerous as a
dence.
Her only introduction to the neighborhood was a ch
letter which she had brought from the Rev. Joseph  ep
son, the pastor of the Yorkshire parish from which
came, to the Rev. James Vincent, rector of Hawkeville.
This letter described her as Mrs. Bernes Irvine,
widow of the late Arthur Irvine, of his parish; commen
her to the care of the rector, and invoked his good f
for her and for her young daughter, her only child, Is
line, or Isola. 
The rector of Hawkeville promptly honored the drau
made upon his courtesy and humanity.
On te day after the receipt of this letter, which
widow had sent to him through the mail, he rode up 
Stony Fells and called upon the stranger.
He was introduced into a large, loty apartment,
had evidently once been the great hall of the manor h
where the walls were hung with ancient tapestry, and
rated with rusty armor and' crumbling stags' antlers, 
wbere the floor was covered by a modern carpet,. alll
variance with the old oaken tables and chairs that 
pleted the furniture.
But the sight of the lady who advanced to receive
mon put all these incongruities out of his head. 
She was a tall, slender woman, looking to bhe

twenty years of age, though she was really twenty-eight.
She had a regular and rather severe profile, with moder-
ately high forehead, small, aquiline nose, short, curled
upper lip, plump under lip, and rounded chin-a beautiful,
resolute face, lighted by a pair of burning black eyes, tem -
pered by long, thick, black eyelashes, and topped by gently .
curved, let-black eyebrows; the whole shaded by rippling
black hair, plainly parted over her forehead, brought down
over her temples and ears, and rolled back in a loose, ripply
mass at the back of her head.
She was dressed in deep mourning, without a scrap of
white to relieve it.
She advanced toward the rector with a smiling face, and
offered her hand, saying, with a voice whose melody lingered
long in the memory of the minister:
"How good you are to me, to come so soon. This is
rather a dilapidated old place in which to welcome you,
however."
"It might be improved-really it might be," admitted
the rector, as he took her offered hand and pressed it cor-
dially, adding, as they both seated themselves on a hard,
high-backed oak settle, "I must call the attention of the
Hawkewood steward to the condition of this place. It is
highly reprehensible for him to have let it to a lady in this
state I"
"Ah, but you see I get it at an almost merely nominal
rent!" replied Mrs. Irvine. And she named the low price
she paid. 
"You could get a very comfortable little villa, or cottage
ornee, for the same money," observed the rector.
"Ah, but neither the villa nor the cottage in question
would be an ancient building, with eight centuries of his-
tory and tradition behind it."
"Oh    If you have the medieval mania, my dear lady,
I have nothing more to say, only that I will see to it the
place be made habitable and wholesome for yc-,," said the
rector.
And his attention was immediately drawn away from
the subject by the entrance of a beautiful child of about
ten years of age, bearing a close resemblance to her mother,
and, like her, dressed in deep mourning.

The first was that she was known, to be a poor widow
incumbered with a daughter. The second was that she was

and for nothing else.         \ 
The curate's widow might have been the daughter of a
duchess, or of a dairy maid, for aught anyone knew.
"For," as one of her most ardent yet most prudent ad.
mirers had observed, "the curates seem to have the utmost
latitude in marriage. *They may run away with a young
lady, or they may marry her maid. And it proves nothing
to say that this lovely widow is refined; for it happens
sometimes that the lady's maid is quite as ladylike as her
lady. And on the other side it is very strange that Mrs.
Irvine has never alluded to her parentage."
No, never had the slightest slip of the tongue, in her
most confiding moods, conveyed the smallest hint in re-
gard to her past life to the ears of her most intimate friendl
As the lovely widow had come into the neighborhood
bearing a church letter from the Yorkshire minister to the
Cornwall rector, that letter had given her a certain status
in the parish. She had, since her arrival; been a regular
attendant upon the church services and an active laborer in
its charities.
She had little or no money to spare, but she had given
her time and labor freely.

sessed. She was beyond all question by far the most gifted
and accomplished musician in the county, and a most skill-

Her voice was a rich, superb, double contralto.  She
was ever ready either to play the organ or to sing in the
church choir, or teach the parish school children-all

"Why does she never allude to her family, or her '

Mrs. Traverse.
"Who, mum?" 
"Oh, you know. The pretty wido* I"
"I cannot say, mum   I am not interested in the queos

"Well, all I know about it, she is trying hard enough to
do it 1" said Mrs. Traverse, just as the entrance of her hu-
band put an end to the conversation. 
And the steward, after bowing to the doctor, led the way
to his little office, where they retired to transact business.
Again the steward's wife had hit upon the truth. Berry
Irvine was trying to catch a husband. Her test friends 
could not deny it.
The duchess defended her. 
"How can you blame her, poor soul! She has evidently
seen better days and' she is now suffering all the evils of
'genteel poverty ' She wants to improve her condition for
her daughter's sake, s well as her own, no doubt. And
what does she do? Nothing unladylike. She dresses her-
self with the greatest taste, and sets off her beauty to the
best advantage, and she makes herself as attractive as pos-
sible to all eligible gentlemen. And why should you criti-
cise her for that? She does no more than every marriage-
able young laly in society does."
Pretty Berry Irvine could not have had a more earnest
and powerful advoctie than she possessed in her grace the
Duchess of Grand MatnOrs.
But a few months after the settlement of the widow at
Stony Fells, an event oceurred which stimulated the gos-
sip, which had been dying out under the damping and de-
pressing influence of the duchess' treatment, itno new life

the steward's wife, putit.
These mysterious journeys of the widow formed the sub-
ject of gossip around many an humble as well as aristo-
cratic tea table, for Bonny Berry Irvine hadea middle posi-
tion between the high and the low; her social relations with
the former and her benevolent.labors among the latter ren-

of midsummer of every year, the people's curiosity subsided
into an apathetic smPm  qt that did not even seek a solu-

And all this time the widow's enemies whispered that
she was trying vainly to "catch" some rich man for a
husband.

into a most beautiful woman. And those same carping

ON the morning after the departure of the' ducal family
from Hawke Hall, Mrs. Irvine and her daughter Isoline
sat together in the antique, three cornered, waincoated par-
lor at Stony Fells. 
In one corer was a fireplace, crosswise, in which burned
a cheerful little fire of driftwood, which the coolness bf
the September morning on this bleak promontory, with the
sea on both sides, rendered agreeable, if not necessary.
The fitting up of his unique, triangular room was simple
enough.            ;              '
The walls and ceiling were oak-paneled; the floor was
bare, and highly polised: the furniture consisted of a cor-
ner cupboard filled  ith old china and battered plate, a
corner clock as high as the cupboard; a round, oaken table
before the fire, and 'Beeal high-backed, oaken chairs.
Mrs. Irvine and her daughter Isolitie sat at the table,
engaged in fancy needlework, in which both were adepts.
As they sat there it would have seemed that the mother
had no just cause to be jealous of the daughter's charms,
for a more beautiful woman could scarcely have been found
in the world than was Berry Irvine at this period of. her
life.
She was one of those lovely, luxurious brunettes whose
beauty seems to be perennial, or immortal rather; and she


 
<pb n="144"/>
142    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPErNT                 .
had led an exceptionally quiet life, fiee from all grie, 
ship or excitement. 
And now she was in the full maturity of her ond
beauty-a luscious tea rose in its perfection.
But ah Berry Irvine knew-none better knew-
swiftly full blooming is followed by fading-a shower or'
breeze will scatter the petals of the full-blown flower 
grief or an illness will quickly change the mature
into an old woman.
Therefore was the mother jealous of the daughte
blooming rose of the half-opened bud. 
Berry's married life hadbeen a short and happy one.     l
She had shed floods of tears over the loss of her h
band, who had fallen a victim to a sharp attack of pne
monia; but in a few days her tears were dried and fo&
gotten like April showers.
She had a sunny, affectionate, but rather shallow an
fickle nature, and so, in a year or two after the loss of 
husband, she wanted to marry again, and to marry a rich
man.
She had been trying, vainly, to do so, from that time
to this; and now that her blooming beauty was so soon
fade, she was more anxious than ever to accomplih h
object.
Therefore also was she jealous of her young and loel1
daughter, and kept her out of company.
If Isoline were seen abroad she might be admired, lo
wooed, and-wedded. And beautiful Berry might be 
verted into a mother-in-law-a grandmother.f  Oh ho
of horrors I !
The daughter must be kept in the background until
mother should be well married.
As has been said, the daughter was wonderfully like
mother. Both had the same perfectly proportioned fo
of the same height; but the mother's was full and roun'
the daughter's slender and delicate; both had the
finely cut, firm, aquiline features, but the mother's
was full, the daughter's thin; both had the same luxur'
raven-blacl hair, and large, tender, deep-fringed dark
and the same creamy complexions and plump red lips,


 
<pb n="145"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT               1i
the mother's complexion was the richer in color and the
daughter's the more dainty.
They were not wearing mourning now, of course; the
elder lady wore a black silk dress with lace ruffles at the
throat and wrists, and scarlet velvet bows on her bosom and
in her black hair.
The younger one wore a plain dress of navy-blue cash-
mere with a white collar and cuffa-a dress that a school-
girl might have worn.
Isoline worked slowly, languidly, and then dropped her 
hands upon her lap and sank into silent thought.
"What is the matter with you, Isa? You are so idle to-
day I If you do not work more diligently those chair covers
will not be finished by Christmas," said Berry Irvine, a
little impatiently.
"And what if they are not finished, mamma? Of what
use are they, anyhow? Of what use is life itself?" de-
manded the girl, in a discontented tone.
"Isal" exclaimed the lady reprovingly.
"Well. yes, mamma'! I repeat: Of what use is life? It
is very dull and stupid and trifling, I think."
"I must get Mr. i'mcent to talk to you, Isa."
"And what good would that do me, mamma? Has he
the power to change my life ?"
"Why are you so disatisfied, Isoline ?"
"I do not know; but I am tired of lifetired of every-
thing. All is so dreary, so monotonous. I.am sick of see-
ing the sun rise every morning in the eat, and set every
evening in the west. I 'im sick of the endless succession
of day and night, a.d of summer and winter; and sickest
of all I am of my own ;beating heart."
"You would prefer that the sun should never rise morn-
ings, and summer never retun; that it should be always
night and always winter, and that your heart should cease
to beat," said the lady repbahflly.
"I would prefer an earthquake or an inundation to this
deadly monotony," exclaimed the young girl.
"You are very unreasonable, Isa."
"Am I, mamma? But what is my life? To rise every
morning in the week, eat my breakfast, take my walk, and
read until noon. Then take luncheon and embroider until

"Yet such a life-so calm, so peaceful, so regular-woul
be perfect bliss to some people," said the lady. 
"I wonder what sort of people ?" murmured the girl, wi
an incredulous smile.
"To those of quiet and contented spirits," replied the
lady.
"But, unfortunately, I am not of such," murmured Iso
line, with a sigh, which her mother echoed; for though
she was jealous she loved the daughter, and appreciated
this discontent.
"If you could only take me with you when you go visit-
ing in the neighborhood, or when you go away on you
periodical journeys, then, mamma, life might not seem
joyless to me." 
"But that is impossible, Isoline. I cannot take you wit
me in my neighborhood visiting because you have neve
been invited to accompany me; nor can I make you
companion of my journeys, because I always go on bus
ness, which your presence would interrupt," replied t
elder lady.
As she spoke the door opened, and the parlor maid, Lon
entered the room, bringing a little note on a small, bi
tered, silver waiter.
"A groom from Castle Belle Isle brought it, mada'
and he is waiting an answer," said the girl, as she
proached her mistress.
The lady took the note and opened' it, saying:
"It is from the Duchess of Grand Manors. She has r'
turned with her party to the castle, it appears."
The note was as follows:

"Give my love to la belle Isoline, and believe me
foolishly fond              ELEANoA BEIA     IL.";
Mrs. Irvine read this note through and then looked ui i
froln its perusal thoughtfully.
Here was a present opportunity of gratifying her da'
ter's wish for a change of scene from dreary Stony Fells I
It was not the first invitation of the kind she had 
ceived for Isoline. She had been uncandid with the
in saying that the reason why she had not taken her
visiting was because Isoline had not been invited. 
reason was, as has been hinted, that she wished to keep h
beautiful daughter in the background while the slight
hope of marriage remained for the handsome mother.
But now at this moment some natural affection and 
ternal sympathy inspired her with the wish to gratify th
lonely recluse, and the occasion seemed a favorable one.
There was to be no company at Castle Belle Isle bu
Cosmo, whom Berry Irvine had never seen, but whom sh
judged-from having heard him talked of by the duche
and the young ladies-to be a naval cadet of fifteen 
sixteen.
There was, then, no objection to taking her lovely daug
ter to Castle Belle Isle. Isoline would be almost as mu
retired there as at Stony Fells.
"What does the duchess say in her note, mamma?" 
quired the girl, when the silence had lasted some minut
"She invites me to go on a few days' visit to Ca
Belle Isle, and to bring you with me," said the lady.
d'Oh, mamma " exclaimed Isoline eagerly.
"Should you like to go?" 
"Oh, very much, indeed I"
"Then that settles it.  Bring my writing-desk 
LOn."
The parlor maid lifted the portable writing-desk
the little stand in the orner and placed it on the
before her mistress.
Mrs. Irvine opened it and wrote a note accepting .
ducbess invitation for herself and her daughter, and

ing the hour of noon the next day as the time when they
would be ready to set out from Stony Fells to Castle Belle
Isle.
She gave this note to Lona Pond to take down and de.
liver to the duchess' messenger.
"And now we must lay aside this embroidery and begin
to make some preparation for our visit," said the lady,
folding up her work.
"I am delighted to go, mammaIl exclaimed Isoline, with
a radiant countenance.
"You poor girl; You have had but little variety in your
life," said the lady, with a momentary feeling of com-
passion.
"Who is Cosmo, mamma?" inquired Isoline, as she put
her embroidery away in one of the table drawers.
"Cosmo? Oh I a little midshipman on leave, I suppose.
A nephew of the duke's. I have never seen him," replied
the lady, as she led the way from the sitting-room, followed
by her daughter.
The remainder of the afternoon and evening was spent
by them in looking over their scanty wardrobe and selecting
the best, to be handed over to Lona Pond, and brushed and
pressed out and re-trimmed for their visit, 
Early the next morning their trunks were'packed, and
they were ready and waiting for the carriage to take them
to Belle Isle.
They had scarcely finished breakfast when it was an-
nounced.
They started on their journey, leaving the house in the
care of Mrs. Pond and her daughter Lona, with'directions
to send their trunks on by the carrier's cart.
The ride from Stony Fells to Belle Isle led along the
seaside until it neared the awful abyss of Demondike;
there it turned up the brink of the dike to an ancient stone
bridge that crossed the chasm.
They passed over this bridge, gazing with awe upon
the roaring torrent below them, and then pursued their
way along the seacoast toward their destination.
Isoline, who, as long as she Jad lived in the neighbor-
hood, had never seen this horrid gorge before, turned pale
as the carriage rolled over the ancient bridge.

CASTLE BELLE ISLE
This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air

hamlet the road diide-the left-hand fork going on alo
the top of the cliff toward the village and the right-ha
fork sloping gradually to the beach below.
When the carriage containing Mrs. Irvine and her 
ter reached this division Isoline made an involuntaryv 
dlamation of surprise and delight at the lovely vision u
arose upon their view.
About half a mile from the shore lay the lovely 
bound island of Belle Isle, with the white towers of
castle rising from its grove of emerald green trees, which
this southern coast had ont yet begun to turn in the
autumn air.
"What a charming place! It is like a vision of 
dis I" said Isoline warmly. 
But the careful coachman now turned his horses' 
to the right and began to tighten his reins to descen:
pas cut through the solid rocks that led to the b
ow, and scarcely a breath was drawn in the carriage 
they reached the sands in safety.

THE TRAIL OF THE SEBPENT                  149
Here stood a substantial boathouse of stone, and here
lay moored a ferryboat to take the earriage and horses, with
their freight, to the island.
Four boatmen manned it.    They were hardy-looking
Cornishmen, in sailors' jackets and trousers, and with tar.
paulin hats, which they took off in respect to the ladies:in
the carriage, which was slowly driven on the boat.
The boat was hoved off from the shore, and in a few
moments landed at the steps of the isle, alongside of which
stood another boathouse, surrounded- by a small fleet of
boats.
The ladies left the carriage and went up the steps, while
the boat was pushed around to a more convenient place
'for driving the horses on shore.
At the head of the steps stood the Duchess of Grand
Manors and several of her younger daughters-all in plain
dresses of dark cashmere and garden hats of dark felt.
The duchess took Berry Irvine by the hand and kissed
her, and then embraced Isoline and presented her to the
young ladies, Victoria, Maude, and Beatrice Belle Isle, and
then drew the arm of Berry through her own and led the
way to the castle.
It was a lovely walk, through a grove of trees of so
many varieties that the eye was charmed with contrasted
shades of pale and dark-green and silver-gray, and no less
charmed with contrasted shapes of trees and foliage, from
the heavy form and shining dark leaves of the oak to the
light and graceful figure and pale, feathery foliage of the
acacia. Through this grove, to a terrace gay with flowers,
thence along a marble walk bordered with shrubs, and up
marble steps to higher terraces adorned with trees and
shrubs, vases and statues, and fnally to the grand entrance
of the castle, which was approached first by marble steps
leading from the highest terrace up to a marbled-pillared
portico, and thence to the double doors of polished black
walnut, inlaid with fine, hard woods of various descriptionas
These regal doors stood open and were attended by a
solemn porter in black clothes and a white wig, and who
looked like a bishop or a judge.
"I will take you where you can lay off your bonnets at

the guests through the portals into the regal hall, whoe s'

add whose lofty ceiling in the roof was illnmiiate4 by win,

Richly carved doors all around this hall led into varig
reception, breakfast, and dining rooms, billiard, smod
and steward's rooms, and finally into the justice's room, 
the duke was lord lieutenant of the county.
A superb staircase arose from the center of this h
and led from  galleries above, with doors opening 
saloons, drawing-rooms, parlors, boudoirs, and bedchamb
Up this staircase the duchess led her guests, and on to
door of ebony and ivory, which a footman in wait
opened. 
"This is your suite of rooms, my dears," said her gra
introducing her guests into an elegant boudoir, upholste
in ebony, ivory, and dark-blue satin and white lace, 
opening into a bedchamber fitted up in the same style.  ]
Berry Irvine sank into a sumptuous chair as if she
been accustomed to such luxuries all her life; but Is
stood and gaed at the elegances around her in si
wonder and delight~ hesitating to sit down and bring
woolen traveling-uit in contact with the glossy satin 
delicate lace.
"I will leave you here, my dears. Greylock will
on you. The lunch bell will ring in fiteen minutes,"
her grace, with a smile, as she left the room.   .
The widow and her daughter passed on into the.l
chamber, where a respectablelookm g, middle-aged

breast bows of rich ribbon, and freh. gloves were all they
needed to effect the change.
When they were ready to go down, the hall footman led
the way to the breakfast room below, where the lunch was
laid.
Here they found the whole family assemblde-the duke
and duchess, and all their sons and daughters.
Those who had not seen the guests on their arrival now
came forward and shook hands with Mrs. Irvine and were
presented to Miss Irvine, whom they each and all cordially
welcomed to the castle.
Lady Volante, aged nineteen, was the eldest child. Next
came the Marquis of Belle Isle, the heir, a lad of seven-
teen. Next to him Lord.Cuthbert, a boy of fifteen. And
following him in succession the three little ladies-Vic-
toria, Maude, and Beatrice, dark-eyed lasses very much
alike, and aged respectively thirteen, eleven, and nine.
Besides thesm there were three babies in the nursery-
Eleanor, aged five; Alberta, three, and Charlotte, one year
old.
In truth, there was no fear of failure in the ducal line of
Grand Manors aid Belle Isle.
The luneheon tablewas surrounded by a merry party.
"But, where is SComoP' inquired the duke. - "A mid-
shipman, accustdoed to discipline on board, should be
more punctual."
"You forget that Cosmo has been promoted," smiled
the duchess.
"I beg the lieutenant's pardon I But his new dignity is
so recent that it is apt to lip my memory."
At this moment a tall and elegant-looking young man,
with a fine Grecian profle, fair complexion, light-gray eyes
and flaxen hair and mustache, entered the room, and see-
ing strangers, stopped and boWed.
"My nephew, Lieut. Bele Isle-Mrs. Berners Irvine-
Miss rvine," said the duke, rising and presenting the new-
comer to his guests.
The young gentleman bowed again and smiled with
pleasure as he took the vacant chair that happened to stand
beside Isoline, and with a "modest assurance," all his own,


 
<pb n="154"/>
152    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT 
immediately began to make himself agreeable to that yongi
lady.
Mrs. Berners Irvine bit her pretty lip until it was redder
than ever before with vexation at this meeting.
The "boy middy" was in fact a very handsome nav?
officer, six feet tall. If she had known this she never,
would have brought Isoline to the castle.
Her fears immediately flew to final consequences. "
that handsome blond man and that beautiful brunette gir
should fall in love with each other I And nothing is mor
likely," said the widow to herself, as she watched them an
listened to the gay sallies of wit and humor that flae
from the young mIan's lips and eyes, and caused the d
pressed young girl to smile and even to laugh with delight
It was too late now; she could not undo the present; b
she resolved, if this acquaintance should seem likely to g
on, that she would make some excuse to shorten her vi
and return to Stony Fells, and-never be caught in such
trap again! 
W in the luncheon was over, the younger members o
the ducal family returned to their schoolroom and th
elders withdrew wit their guests to the pretty drawin
roonm in daily use in the family.
Here, at thb request of the duchess, the mother an
daughter wnt to the piano to sing a duet from the op
of "Norma"
Miss Irvine played the accompaniment.
Lieut. Belle Isle stood behind the young lady, bendi
over her devotedly, under the plea of turning her music. 
Both mother and daughter were such musical enthusia
that neither, at the time, troubled her head to think of 
devoted cavalier who stood in attendance upon them. 
Their audience, too-the duke and duchess, the you
Lord Belle Isle, and the Lady Volante-hung entran
upon the melody of their voices. 
When the duet was over, Lieut. Belle Isle led Miss I
to the sofa and seated himself beside her.
The duchess took possession of Berry Irvine an4 ed
her off to the ttte-4-t8te seat.
"You witch, Berry! Do you tell me that you were
daughter's sole teacher ?" inquired her grace.

/                                                    =
'Certainly," replied the widow. 
"And she never had any other instructor than yourself ?"
"Never    How could she have had? You have known
us ever since we first came here, when she was a little
child, and where in this neighborhood could I have obtained
a music teacher for her ?" inquired the widow.
"Where, indeed ?" laughed the duchess. "Yet she is such 
a very accomplished pianist and singer that I thought she
must have had other instruction than yours."
"But why should she not have gained all her perfection
in the art from me?"
"Because, my dear-I do not mind telling you, for you
are her mother, and mothers are never jealous of their
daughters-because, then, excellent as you yourself may
be as a singer and a pianist, your beautiful daughter excels
you in both accomplishents I Ah what would I not give
to secure a music mistress with half the skill and talent of
yourself and your daughter for my little girls," sighed the
duchess. 
"Have they no music teacher, then?" inquired Berry
Irvine.
"Oh, there is Mademoiselle Millevoye, their governess,
who is a fair specimen; but she is not a gifted artiste, my
love, such as I would like to have for my little girls," said
the duchess, with another sigh.
Berry Irvine understood the drift of all this conversa-
tion. She knew the duchess wished and hinted what deli-
cacy prevented her from proposing in so many words-that
Isoline Irvine should become the music teacher of the young
ladies Belle Isle.
And Berry knew that the salary the duchess would be
.willing to offer would be about three times the amount of
her own slender income. But Berry Irvine would have seen
her friend the duchess sunk into the bottom of the sea
before she would have taken the hint and offered the serv-
ics of her daughter as the salaried teacher of the Duchess
of Grand Manors' young ladies.
While this conversation was going on, Isoline, at the
solicitation of the duke, arose to sing and play a solo from
the new opera of "The Niebelungenlied."
Cosmo Belle Isle led her to the piano, adjusted her stool,


 
<pb n="156"/>
154    THE TRAIL OF THE Sif:PFsNT               :
and opened her music book; then bent over her and turned
the page as she sang.
Mrs. Irvine fidgeted and bit her lip, and confirmed her-  :
self in the resolution to cut her visit short.
When the solo was over the duke warmly thanked the
young singer, and Lieut. Cosmo Belle Isle led-her back to
her sofa, and devoted himelf to her for the rest of the
afternoon.
Lady Volante lay reclining in her easy-chair, taking no
part in the conversation. The young Lord Belle Isle sat 
on a hassock at her feet trying to amuse her with bright 
anecdotes of the boat racing at his college, but failing to
interest her in the least degree.
When the first dinner bell rang the party separated to i
dress.
The widow and her daughter went up to their rooms,
where they found their trunks waiting for them.
Isoline, acting as her mother's maid, unlocked the lady's
trunk, and began to lay out her dresses.
"I shall wear the black damase silk, and the duchess lace
set, with the pearl jewelry," said the widow.
Her daughter obediently laid the dress and decorations
out on the bed, and then proceeded to unpack and hang up'
in the armoires her mother's other dresses.
"You had better leave them and get yourself ready for,
dinner. We have not too much time. We can let Greylockl
put them away, and here she is now," said the widow, as-
the woman made her appearance to offer her services.
"Come and help me to dress," said Mrs. Irvine. 
Mrs. Greylock obeyed, leaving Ioline to unpack her o
trunk and dress herself. 
Isoline wore a white figured orgpdy muslin, with pa
pink ribbons, and no jewelry. It was her mother's wh
still to dress her as a young schoolgirl. 
They went down to the drawingroom, where they fo
the party augmented by the arrival of the Rev. Mr. Yin
The rector advanced to greet Mrs. and Miss Irvine
the most cordial manner. 
The dinner was announced, and the rector gave his ai
to the duchess, the duke conducted Mrs. Irvine, 
Miss Irvine, and Lord Belle Isle Lady Volante


 
<pb n="157"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                  1M
And so they went to dinner.
After that festive meal was over the party spent the
evening quietly in the drawing-room.
The duke, e duchess, the retor, and Mrs. Irvine formed
a rubber of whist-the duke and the widow playing to-
gether against the duchess and the rector.
Cosmo Belle Isle devoted himself to the beautiful Isoline
Irvine, and Lord Belle Isle to his sister, Lady Volante.
An unusually strong and tender tie bound this brother
and sister together.
But from the whist table Berry Irvine watched the cou-
pie on the ttet-d-tte sofa-Cosmo and Isoline-and watch-
ing them, played worse than she had ever done in her life,
returning her adversary's lead, trumping her partner's
tricks, and committing other higher crimes and misde-
meanors against the laws of Boyle, and so provoking the
duke that he heartily wished for the privilege of commit-
ting her for such offenses.
If the duke was provoked, however, the duchess was
pleased, for she-and her partner won the rubber, much to
the discomfiture of their antagonists-the duke and the
'widow.
The rector arose and bade his friends good-night and
L   left.
Soon after his departure the circle broke up and retired.
"Isoline," said the widow, when she found herself alone
with hqr daughter in the bedchamber, "Isoline, I am quite
ashamed of you I"
"Mammal what have I done?" cried the startled girl,
blushing with astonishmevt and mortification.
"What, indeed I I wonder what Lieut. Coemo Belle Isle
thinks of you I" exclaimed the lady.
"; Oh, mamma, what have I done ?" cried the amazed and
abashed girl, beginning to tremble, while the blush deepened
and darkened on her cheek.
"You have been too forward; too familiar-much, very
much too forward and familiar in your manners to that
, young gentleman."
"Oh I mamma, have I really     I did not mean to be so 
I did not know! I spoke and acted as I felt. Oh, I am
so sorry  I feel so humiliated I" said the unsophisticated

tea. t grief and self-abaseent.
"I think I shall take you home to-morrow, and keel
you there until you learA how to behave yourself in com-
pany, said the widow, as she proceeded to undress.
Nothing more was said between the mother and daughter_
Isoline prepared for bed, and they were soon lying sid
by side; but the widow quicldy dropped into a deep an
healthful sleep, while the poor girl was kept awake by t
humiliating thought that she had been too forward an
familiar in her manner to Comso Belle Isle, and that  h
must despise her for having been so, and by the oft-repea
resolution that she would be sufficiently reserved with
persons for the future.
Mrs. Berners Irvine had said that she would take 
daughter back to Stony Falls the next day.
But the next morning brought with it news that sent
jealous thoughts concerning Isoline and her admirer .
of the widow's head.
It was after breakfast, and the gentlemen had gone
the main for a .day's shooting over the Hawkewood p
serves.
The ladies were all assembled in the boudoir of
duchess.
Berry Irvine and her daughter were engaged on th
everlasting embroidery.
Lady Volande was busy with her flower painting in wa
colors-an art in which she was an adept.
The duchess was looking over-the morning papers.. '
Presently her grace glanced up from her imese and
claimed:
"Why, Volante, who do you thini is gone?"
" 'Gone/ mamma?" repeated the young lady ind
ently, as she laid down one camel'shair pencil to se
finer one.                 :
"Dead, I mean, of course. Who do you think is di

"I am sure I do not know, mamma. No one that

"The Princess Maria Zavieskil" answered the dhess,
laying down the paper and looking at her daughter.
It is well that she looked m that direction. If she had
glanced toward Berry Irvine she would have seen that the
beautiful widow had turned pale as marble and wastaring
with fixed, stony eyes on the speaker, forgetful that other
eyes might question her mood.
"Well, mamma, dear, what is there so   urpr'iag in
that? She was very aged, was she not?"
"She was ninety-five, the notice says."
"Then the only wonder is that she should have lived so
long," said Lady Volante.
A lonely and supremely selfish woman like the Princess
Zavieski, who cares for nothing and for nobody but herself,
would be likely to live long. Indeed, I was surprised to
see the notice of her death, for she seemed to be a permanent
institution in Belgravia-one of those persons who seem to
have gotten into a confirmed habit of living."
"She belngs to history, does she not?" inquired Lady
Volante.
"Well, yes, rather," replied the duchess, with a smile.
Then turning to her guests, she said:
"We are speaking of a very remarkable woman, who is
just dead, my dear. You must have heard of her-the
Princess Maria Zavieski."
"I-yesI--think s," replied Berry Irvine, in a low,
tremulous voice, as  shifte her position so as to get her
back to the window and her face in the deep shadow as
she bent over her embroidery.
Had not the duchessbeen so preoccupied with her subject
she must have noticed the!intense agitation of her guest.
"A very remarkable woman, this Princess Zavieski, with
a very remarkable history. Perhaps, if you are not familiar
with it, you would like to hear it," pursued her grace,
without very attentively regarding her guest.
"Yes," faintly responded the pallid widow.
"Well, her maiden name was Mary Smith-about the
commonest name you could find in the London directory,
don't you think so?"
"Yes," responded the widow in a low voice, as she bent
over her embroidery. She did not know what she was

doing, for she was nsbihig off a fair lily-with scarlet flogs
instead of fine white silk.
"And you would wonder how Mary Smith came to 
converted into the Princess Maria Zavieski."
"Yes," breathed the widow, still bending low over her
work, while Isoline dropped hers upon her lap and gavei
her whole attention to the duchess, feeling as eager as 
child for a story.
"Yet, though her name was a very common one, she di
not belong to a very common family, I assure you. There
are Smiths in the landed gentry, and even in the nobili
of Great Britain."
"I remember hearing that the Princess Maria ZavieskF,
father, Ferdinand Smith, was a near relative of the Smi
Barons of Carrington, and also to Sir John James Sm
of- -" began Lady Volante, but her mother cut her sho
"Of no matter where, Volantel Don't interrupt m
Her father, the Rev. Ferdinand Smith, was a clergyman d
the Church of England, with avery large family and a e

"At any rate, he fell violently in love with the beautiful
singer, Mary Smith, and not being free to wed openly, he
persuaded the ambitious girl to elope with him to Germany,
where they were married and where they might have lived
happily if they had had anything to live on. But as they
had not, why, just as soon as their pocket money was ex-
pended, they ventured back to Russia, where all the prince's
possessions lay." 
"A dangerous venture," put in Volante.
"Yes, for as soon as they crossed the line they were both
arrested and thrown into prison. Nothing, I think, but
the great influence of the count, the former patron of Mary
Smith, saved the young couple from the knout and Siberia."
"What savage laws " brke in Lady Volante.
"The affair was finally compromised in this way: The
young husband consented to divorce his beautiful wife,
whether she consented or not, on condition that the czar
would settle on her a sufficiently large fortune to enable
her to live in opulence. This the czar consented to do on
the further condition that the lady would leave the Russian
dominions, never to return. She consented to this arrange-
ment and came to England and to London, bought a hand-
some house in Belgravia, which she christened Zavieski
Palace, and lived there in splendor as the Princess Zavieski.
Whether she had any right to retain the title after her
divorce, I cannot tell you. She had led a very eccentric life,
and I was told has made a very eccentric il-leaving her
whole property to her only surviving relative, one Mary
Smith, her great-grandniece, a maiden lady residing in
Germany, on conditioa .that she, Mary Smith; should not
marry during the prinoess' lifetime. As the old lady lived
to be ninety-five, the conditions were 'rather hard on her
heiress, who must now be about forty years of age-"
The duchess was interrupted by a sudden movement of
Lady Volante and Isola IrvIe, who both simultaneoual-
sprang toward the window.
"What is the matter?" demanded her grace rising.
"Mrs. Irvine has fainted," replied Lady Volant

drooping head that had fallen on the left arm of the e

Grand Manors, who hastened to the side of the faini

she might. 
Lady Volante followed her instructions.
"Send Greylock here," said the duchess to the footm
who answered the bell.
But before the lady's maid could repnd to the smmom
Mrs. Irvine had recovered her coeiousness, and with
deep sigh opened her eyes and looked about her.  i
"You are better, my dear. Here, smell this salts
Take a deep inhalation of it," said Lady Volante, off
her viniagrette.
But Berry Irvine looked around in a bewildered ma'
and put her hand to her brow, without speaking. 
"You have scarcely recovered yet, dear. e Pep rps
had better get you to bed for a while. Do you think,,
can walk so far as your room?".inquired the duchess '^?.
"Yes," murmured Berry scarcely conscious of what 
was saying, as she passed her hand back and forth
her forehead. 


 
<pb n="163"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                 161
"Greylock, come here," said her grace to the waiting-
woman, who had just entered the room. "Give Mrs. Irvine
your arm, while I support her on the other side. We must
get her to her chamber."
And the duchess, with tenderest care, assisted her guest
to rise, and would have sustained her, but that the latter
said:
"Thanks, thanks, dear duchess. I can do very well with
the help of Greylock."
And leaning on the strong arm of the lady's maid, Berry
Irvine walked up to her chamber, followed by the duchess
and by Isoline.
When she reached that elegant bower she dropped into
a resting-chair, and desired everyone except her, hostess to
leave the apartment. 
"Had you not better lie down for a little while, my
dear?" inquired her grace. 
"No, no; I will sit here. Send them out, please," re- ';,
plied Berry, referring to her daughter and the maid.
Isola and Greylock left the room, closing the door behind
them.
The duchess stepped to the door and turned the key.. ...
Then coming back to her guest, she drew a chair and   ''
sat down beside the latter, saying:
"You have something to confide in me."
"Yes, I have something to confide in you," admitted the
widow, passing her hand m a perplexed manner to and fro
across her brow.
"Then speak out freely, my love. You know you may
trust me," said her grace.
But Berry only looked the more perplexed and answered
by a moan.
"Let me help you. Were you affected by anything I read
in the paper?"
Mrs. Irvine started and stared in terror upon her ques-
tioner.
"I was reading the obituary notice of the Princess Zavie-
ski when you suddenly fainted. Is it anything in relation
to that lady that you wish to confide in me ?"
But Berry Irvine only stared at her questioner.
..


 
<pb n="164"/>
162    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT
"Were you in any manner whatever connected with
late princess?"
Berry strove to recover her lost faculties and answe
slowly:
"Why, no-I-did not know the-princess. Who w
she?" 
"Zavieski."
"I really do not think I ever heard of her in all my
before. Oh, no! My fainting had nothing to do wi
what you were reading. If the subject had been the ma
riage of a peasant instead of the death of a princess, I m
have fainted all the same," said the widow, with a sigh, bu
with perfect calmness, for she had recovered her self
control.
"Was it the heat of the room, my love?"
"No, dear duchess, it was-and this is what I have
confide in you-it was heart disease."
" 'Heart disease!' Oh, my dear Berry, no  You m
be mistaken," said the duchess, scarcely able to conceal h
dismay.
"Ah, no! I wish there were room for doubt. I h

"Have you ever fainted before, Berry?"
"Ah I yes, several times lately, but never in her presence.
I have sometimes fainted alone in my chamber, and re-
covered without assistance; but never until to-day in mS
child's sight. Poor girl I It alarmed her so much! It will
make her so anxious I I did not wish her to know I I did
not! And for her only am I troubled."
"Can I do anything to relieve you of this anxiety,
Berry ?"
"Yes, dear duchess. Yesterday you mentioned your
great desire to procure a music mistress for your daughters
with half the ability of Isoline."
"I did, most earnestly."
"Well, then, dear duchess, Isoline is quite at your service,
if you will take her " said the widow.
"What do you tell me? Are you really sincere? Should
you indeed be willing that your daughter should take such
a position in my family?" inquired the duchess, in half-
doubtful pleasure.
"Indeed, dear friend, I should," replied the widow em-
phatically.
"Yet only yesterday when I ventured to hint at such an
arrangement, you made me feel by your manner that my
wish was a presumptuous one," smiled the duchess.
"Yesterday I had not this grave warning of the pre-
carious tenure of my life. Other fainting fits I have had,
but nothing so serious as this. Yesterday I cherished hopes
of living a few years longer, for I meant to be very quiet
and prudent; but to-day, without excitement, without im-
prudence, without any assignable cause, I fainted away
while sitting still in my chair. This circumstance assures
me that, live as calmly as I may, I cannot live long."
"Oh, Berry I"
"Let that pass. I think now only of my child, who
would be left destitute by my death. You asked me if I
should be willing that she should take the position of a
music teacher in your family. Had you asked me that
D'   question yesterday I should have answered-No; that I

Supporting the invalid, the duches led her to the eofs
and laid her on it.
At that moment there came a knock at the door.
"Come in," said Berry languidly.
Greylock entered, with a card on a waiter, which she
brought to the duchess, saying that the porter had just sent
it up.
"The Earl of Hawkewood," read the duchess; then turn-

"Yes, dear mamma, I did; but my dress was not tight,

of our lives at Stony Fells," truthfully replied Isoline.
"Well, my dear girl, that Si all over now," said the lady,
with a smile.
"Oh, mamma, what do you mean?" inquired the girl, as
her dark eyes beamed with hope.

"The good duchess herself showed the way, for she,

yourself, could not bear the thought of having me left
alone."
"No, no,"'murmured Isoline.
"So she proposes that you shall return with me to Stony
Fells and remain there as in your permanent home. And
that she shall send the carriage for you, three mornings
out of every week-say Mondays, Wednesdays, andFri-
days-and bring you to the castle here to give music lessons
to her daughters in the forenoon and send you back to me
in the afternoon, so.that you shall never sleep a night away
from me. What do you think of that plan, Isola? Is it
agreeable to you ?"
"Perfectly agreeable, dear mamma !" eagerly replied the
girl.
"Just the answer I made to the duchess when she first
proposed the plan, my dear."
"Oh, how good of her! No one but the good duchess-
no. one but herself would have thought of such a com-
promise!" exclaimed the girl, with enthusiastic gratitude.
"Almost the exact comment I made myself, dear girl,"
smiled the lady.
"You think the matter may be considered as settled, dear
mamma?" rather anxiously inquired Isoline, for the pros-
pect opening before her seemed too pleasant to be real.
"I know it may be considered settled, my love. I know
you may enter upon your duties as soon, after we return
home, as you please."
"We are in no hurry to return, however, dear mamma.
I think the duchess expects us to stay at least a week. And
the visit is doing you good, notwithstanding the unpleasant
episode of your fainting fit. You have got over that now.
You feel much better, do you not, mamma?"
"Much better, my dear. You will help me to dress. I
will go down to luncheon, if only to reassure our friends,
and because it is our last day here."
"Our last day, mamma?"
"Yes, love, for I have business tat requires my atten-

here on Monday, so you will be interested and occupied."
"I was only thinking of you, mamma."

"Oh, I shall be quite satisfied, love. Come now; help

WHEN the luncheon bell rang Mrs. Irvine and Miss Irvi

There they found only the duchess, Lady Volante, an
the Earl of Hawkewood. The little ladies Belle Isle we

As Mrs. Irvine entered the room the duchess went

"I am so glad to see you are well enough to join us.
"You are so good to me," murmured Berry Irvine.
"Lord Hawkewood-Mrs. Irvine, of Stony Fells," s
the duchess, turning and presenting the young earl to

The gentleman and the lady bowed simultaneously. 
"Most happy to meet Mrs. Irvine," said his lordship.
"Lord Hawkewood-Miss Irvine," continued the d
ess, presenting the young earl to the young lady.
"Very happy to know Miss'Irvine," said his lor
with a bow that Isoline returned by a slight bend of

The small party of five took their places at the ro
table, and formed a very social little circle. 
Every repast served on the board of Castle Belle 1

possessed its own peculiar excellence; but the lunhes-wer  -
considered the most attractive and appetizing of any in the
county.
The latest guest, the young Earl of Hawkewood, had cer-
tainly come on a special visit to the Lady Volante Belle
Isle; but being the only gentleman at the. table he was too
much a man of society to confine his attentions to one
beauty. He distributed his small services and smaller talk
very equally between the four ladies present; and-wonder-
ful success !-managed to please them all I
He had been really disappointed at missing the duke,
with whom he had intended to have that interview of which
he had spoken at Hawkewood Hall, "on a subject intimately
connected with his whole life's hope and happiness;" but
now he seemed amply compensated for the duke's absence,
especially as he had accepted an invitation from the duchess
not only to lunch but to dine at the castle.
When the elegant little repast was over the party went
out to the lawn-for a game of croquet, the duchess and the
earl playing against Lady Volante Belle Isle and Isoline
Irvine, while Mrs. Irvine, seated in a garden-chair, looked
on, and stitched at her embroidery.
An hour before.the dressing or first dinner bell rang the
Duke of Grand Manors and the Marquis of Belle Isle re-
turned from their shooting tramp in the preserves of Bowl-
ing Green, and after cordially greeting the young earl,
paused in their picturesque shooting-suits to look on at the'
game of croquet. But when the game then in progress came
to an end, and the two young ladies were declared victors
over the duchess and the earl, the whole party went into
the house to dress for dinner.
On their way in, the young earl managed to get beside
the duke for a few moments, and then asked his grace if
at any time during the evening he could give him a private
interview.
"Yes, surely. Now, if you wisH.' There is plenty of
time before the bell rings," replied the duke, as he opened
the door of a small reception room, and led his visitor in.
"Now then, my lad," said the duke, as soon as they were
seated, "speak out. Perhaps it will help you if I say that
I know all about it beforehand, for I had to go through the

"Your grace is very good. I came, then, to say-say
- " the young earl hesitated for a moment, and then con-
tinned-"that I love your fair daughter, the Lady Volante 
Belle Isle-and-and-and--"
"Have you spoken to Volly?" abruptly demanded the
duke.
"No, your grace. I was about to ask your---"
"Then how in the deuce am I to give you an answer 
until I know her mind?" again interrupted the duke.
"I was about to ask your grace's sanction to my ad-;
dresses," replied the young earl.
"Oh, ho I That is it! You begin at the right end I An
unusual proceeding in a country where, instead of asking 
papa's leave to address the daughter, the young fellows in-
variably ask the daughter's leave to 'speak to papa,"' 
Jsughed the duke.
"Am I to understand, then, that your grace kindly per-
mits me to   "

"Seriously, my dear Hawkewood, you have my full ap-.
probation to your suit and my warmest wishes for its suci,

prospective son-in-law.
The young earl pressed it earnestly, as he said: 
"Your grace has made me a very happy and a very gra
ful man."
"Nay, nay, Volly must do that  And now be off wil
you to learn your fate from her lips, and leave me to 
myself ready for dinner." 
The young earl bowed and left the room. 
The duke hurlied up to his dressing-room, but befit
beginning his toilet he looked in upon the duchess, i
was Fiiting before her looking-glass, having her nair'
ranged bv the hands of her maid. 
'e


 
<pb n="175"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                 173
"Send your woman away, my dear; I wish to speak to
you," said the duke.
"You may leave the room," said the duchess.
The maid courtesied and retired.
"Now, then, you tiresome person, what is itP" inquired
the duchess, with a smile.
"Hawkewood has proposed for Volly," said the duke.
"Yes! I presumed that he had come to do that."
"But he has not yet spoken to her. Rather an odd way
of proceeding, eh ?"
"It strikes me as the proper way, however."
"Well, what I wish to say to you, my dear, is just this:
Tell Volly she had better accept Hawkewood."
"I will advise her to do so; but, of course, she must be
permitted to act as she pleases in a matter so entirely, and
so vitally concerning herself."
"She will be a great fool is she does not take him."
"That is a mere matter of opinion. And now, please
ring the bell to recall my maid, and go and change your
dress, or you will be late for dinner," said the duchess.
The duke complied with her request and then left the
room.
Half an hour later the family and the guests were as-
sembled around the dinner table.
By the radiant looks of the young earl the duke imagined
that he had already laid his coronet at the feet of Lady
Volante, and that she had accepted it.
But the duchess knew that this was not the case, as
Lady Volante had remained in her dressing-room until the
last dinner bell rang and had then gone directly to the
drawing-room, where, the whole party was assembled, so
that the earl could have had no opportunity of speaking to
the lady in private.
That opportunity was toabe afforded him after dinner.
When the three courses and the dessert that composed
the dinner had been discussed, the ladies arose, and, leaving
the gentlemen to their wine, retired to the drawing-room.
Here they divided. Mrs. Irvine took her daughter's arm 
and led her away for a tete--tite, leaving the duchess and
Lady Volante together.


 
<pb n="176"/>
174   T'tE TRAIL OF THE          SERPENT
"Sit down here, my love; I have something to ask you,
said the duchess.
Lady Volante seated herself beside her mother an
looked up with a questioning, attentive face.
"Do you know, my love, what motive brought LorI
Hawkewood here to-day ?" inquired the duchess.
"I think I do, mamma."
"Ah! then he has found an opportunity of proposing t
you! What was your answer, my dear? I hope it was
favorable one."
"Lord Hawkewood has not yet distinctly proposed to me
mamma."
"He has not! Then how came you to know the objeo
of his visit?"
"I judged by the calculus of probabilities, mamma," sai
the young lady, smiling.
"Then you have judged that you yourself are the obje
of his lordship's visit?"
"Yes, mamma."
"He has been with your father this' afternoon. He h
asked permission to address you."
"Yes, mamma."
"Your father has given him that permission."
"I supposed he would."
"And the earl will propose for you this evening. Now
Volante, what do you intend to do ?"
"I shall accept the earl," said the young lady.
A look of surprise and pleasure came into the face-
the duchess.
She had believed her daughter's attachment to the l
earl would interfere with any thoughts of marriage wi
the present one.
She had anticipated some difficulty in persuading
Volante to accept Lord Hawkewood.
Now the young beauty had coolly announced her in
tion of marrying the earl. 
"Do you really like him ?" inquired the duchess.
"I really like Hawkewood Hall and its rent roll. It:
near Belle Isle, so that I need not be separated from 
own people. and it yields fifty thousand pounds a years'l
that I shall have enough to live upon myself, and en

to help my sisters and brothers," quietly replied the young
lady.
"But, my dear child, do you like him?" inquired the
mother in a troubled tone, for her own marriage with the
duke had been a love match.
"I do not like him as well as I could have liked his
cousin, the late earl, who was really very attractive and in-
teresting; but I do not dislike the present Lord Hawkewood.
And, as I said before, mamma, he is an earl, he has fifty
thousand pounds a year, and his seat, Hawkewood Hall, is
near Belle Isle. You see, mamma, there are good reasons
why I should accept him when he offers."
"Good reasons m my eyes and your father's, my dear;
but hardly good reasons in a young bride's. I wish you
cared more for him."
"Dear mamma, one cannot have everything they would
like in this imperfect world. I dare say, now, if I got to
eare so much for any young gentlemna as to render him
essential to my happpness, he would be poor, or of humble
position, or his home would be in some distant part of the
country, and you and papa would oppose the match, and so
on, and so on," said Lady Volante.
The duchess sigted.
"And such beg the case, mamma, I have decided to
take the goods :tb  gods provide by taking the Earl of
Hawkewood, country seat, town house, and revenues."
"I am glad you will marry him," said the duchess; but
she sighed.
The entrance of the gentlemen broke up the tteo-t&te.
Tea was brought in. 
After that was serv*d Mrs. Irvine and Miss Irvine, at the
request of the duke, went to the piano and sang and played
several fine selections from popular operas.
The drawing-room was a long one. While the music
maniacs were gathered around the piano at one end of the
room, the Earl of Hawkewood, standing beside Lady Vo-
ante Belle Isle at a booktable at the other end, improved
the opportunity by making an offer of his heart and hand,
which was frankly accepted by her ladyship.
Then, as the music ceased, the polite young hypocrites,
who had not heard one word of the songs or duets, went

forward and thanked the fair mutsiign   for the pleas
they had given them.
And, finally, the earl took leave of the family, and w
home the happiest man in the three kingdoms.
The circle broke up for the night.
Early the next morning Mrs. and Miss Irvine left Ca
'Belle Isle for Stony Fells, with the understanding that
latter should returi on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Frida
to give music lessons to the young ladies.

Cosmo Belle Isle started up and caught her and placed
her in a chair. 
The whole party left the table and gathered around her.
"My dear child, what has happened?" inquired the
duchess, while the duke poured out a glass of wine and
made her drink it.
"What has happened, Isoline?" again inquired the
duchess.
"Oh, madam I Mamma I mamma " cried the girl, burst-
ing into a paroxysm of tears.
"What ails her, my dear child? Speak, Isolinel Is she
ill? Is she-"   The duchess did not finish her question.
"Oh, madam, she is gone I gone I gone I Mamma is gone PI
sobbed the girl, wildly wringing her hands.
"Dead?" inquired the duke, in a sympathetic tone.
"Oh, sir  I don't know  But she is gone gone  Oh,

"My poor child, 'try to compose yourself sufficiently to

"Oh, yes   She is gone! gone gone " exclaimed the
girl, wringing and twisting her fingers in an agony of
grief.
"But where has she gone, my dear?" asked the duke. 
"Oh,. I don't knowl I don't know! I did hope that
she might be here, but the porter told me she was not

"Come with me," said the duchess tenderly, taking the
girl's hand and leading her out of the breakfast room and
across the hall into a coay little reception room, where she
made her lie down on the lounge.
Then the duchess closed and locked the door and drew
a chair to the sofa and seated herself beside the grieving
girl, saying:
"Now that we are quite alone, my dear, try to compose
your mind and collect your faculties so as to give me an
intelligible account of what has happened. You say your
mamma has gone?"
"Oh, yes, yes!" sobbed Isoline.

"When she kissed me good-night at ten o'clock. We,

down by me and asked me if I loved her, and she askedc

cannot tell you! I cannot tell you  How we waited for
her, thinking that maybe she had gone for a walk-though
she was rot in the habit of doing so. And then how we
searched and inquired, first around the house and then
around the neighborhood. Only one person gave any in-
formation."
"Then you did get some information," hastily inter-
rupted the duchess.
"Ah, yes-alarming information! It was from one of
the coast-guardsman-Dennis Prout-who said that when
he was going down to the coast to take his morning watch
at four o'clock in the morning, long before daylight, he met
a woman on the banks of the Demondike. She was walking
alone at that hour, and seemed to try to avoid observation.
So he flashed the bull's-eye of his lantern into her face, as
he said it was his duty as a coast guardsman to do to all
suspicious persons, and then he saw that it was Mrs. Irvine
of Stony Fells I That made me hope with a forlorn hope
that she had started out before day to walk here! So I
hurried on here as fast as I could to try to find her. But

"My dear child, do you tell me that your poor mother

in consternation.
"Oh, yes, madam! Yes l Oh, where can she be now?
Oh, where is mamma?"
"Where, indeed?" thought the panic-stricken duchess;
but for the afflicted daughter's sake she gave no utterance
to that thought.

CHAPTER XVII
THE MYsTnEY DEEPENS
We are the fools of time.and terror; days
Steal on us, and steal from us; yet we live. 
Wasting our life, and dreading still to die. 
In all the days of this oppressive yoke,
This vital weight, upon the struggling heart,
Which sinks with sorrow, or beats quick with pain,
Or joy that ends in agony, or faintness-
In all the days of past and future, for
In life there is no present, we may number.
How few, how less than few, wherein the soul
Forbears to pant for death, and yet draws back 
As from a stream in winter, though the chill

IsoINB IBVIN   shuddered with terror. 
"You must remain here, my dear girl, until a thorou
search is made for your mamma," said the duchess kindly
"Oh, madam, will you assist me in the search?" inquire
the girl, clasping her hands and lifting her eyes in 
earnestness of her appeal.                  -
"Surely, surely, my dear child; but we must co
our friends as to the best means of proceeding," said t
duchess, as she arose and touched the bell.
A footman answered the summons.
"Give my respects to the gentlemen in the breakf
room, and ask them to be so good as to step hither," 
the duchess.
The footman bowed and disappeared. , 
His exit was almost immediately followed by the entrain
of the duke, the marquis, and the young lieutenant. 
In a low tone, and in a few brief words, the dch
told the duke, in the hearing of the others, the  armf
facts relating to the disappearance of Mrs. Irvine, as th
had been imparted to her by Isoline.  l
"Where have you already inquired?" questioned
duke, turning to the young girl.


 
<pb n="183"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                 181
"Oh, everywhere where it is probable or possible that
she might be. First, at the rectory; but Dr. Vincent had
neither seen nor heard anything of mamma since he met
her at church last Sunday. And then at the cottages of
the poor people she is in the habit of visiting; but nowhere,
nowhere could I hear of her, except from Dennis Prout,
who-in the darkest hours before day-saw her-wandering
--on the brink of Demondike," answered Isoline, her voice
faltering and breaking down at the close of her speech.
The duke put a few more questions, but elicited no more
information in addition to what he had already received
from the duchess.
"Try to be tranquil, my child," said the duke, "and rely
upon me for having proper measures taken for the discovery
of this poor lady."
And with these words he left the room, followed by his
son and his nephew.
The duchess took Isoline upstairs to her own private
apartments, where she made the girl lay off her jacket and
hat, and bathe her head.
Lady Volante came in, showing her sympathy, not in
direct words, but by the kindness and consideration of her
manner.
In the meantime, the duke wrote letters to the chief of
police at the Hawkeville station, and at other stations, noti-
fying them of the mysterious disappearance of the lady of
Stony Fells, and urging them to active measures for the
discovery of her retreat, or of her fate.
The hours passed slowly and heavily with Isoline, and
frith all who by sympathy shared her distress and anxiety.
But the morning glowed into noon and faded into evening
without bringing any intelligence of the missing lady.
Isoline, in the anguish of her suspense, would have
tearted off again to Stony Fells, in the forlorn hope of find-
ing that her mother had returned home,but theduke assured
her that a man was stationed at the old manor house, with
orders to bring the first news of the lady's arrival-should
she return thither-immediately to Castle Belle Isle, and
the duchess would not let her- stir from the place.
The troubled day was followed by a terrible night.
Isoline did not even make a pretense of going to bed or


 
<pb n="184"/>
182    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT
to sleep; but she walked the floor of her chamber all nigh
closely watched by Mrs. Greylock, who had orders fr
the duchess not to leave the young lady.
With the coming of light came also hope that the day
might bring some news.
It did bring news, but not, ah l not of the soft to ch
the spirits.
It was soon after breakfast that Mr. Traverse, th
steward, came to Castle Belle Isle and inquired for t
duke.
Being asked into the library, where the three gentlem
of the castle were seated in council, he entered, bowing, an
baring a parcel tied up in brown paper in his hands.
"Well, Mr. Traverse, you asked to see me! What can
do for you this morning? But pray be seated. You lo
weary," said the duke, pointing to a chair.
"Yes, your grace. I thank your grace, I am a bit spe

sinking into the indicated chair, putting his parcel do
at his feet, drawing a red bandanna handkerchief f
his pocket and beginning to wipe his flushed and moisten
forehead..

"Yes, captain, it is, your honor; and I would not h

The three gentlemen drew near the steward, who 
ceeded to exhibit the contents of his parcel.
"This fragment of black cashmere was found 
in the briars, a few feet below the bank," continued the
ard, exhibiting the remnant that seemed to have 
caught on thorns and violently torn off from its dress.
"It is a portion of a woman's gown, and looks asI
might have been part of Mrs Irvine's. She wore a 


 
<pb n="185"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                  188
dress, I remember," said the duke, taking the piece and
eramining it carefully.
"This came out of the torn pocket of that fragment in
your hand. -Observe, sir, it has a name in the corner,"
cantinued the steward, exhibiting a ragged white linen cam-
brie pocket handkerchief.
"This looks ill! It is Mrs. Irvine's name on the corner I
See  'Berry Irvine!' " exclaimed the duke, in a troubled
tone.
"And nearly on a level with the water at high tide, this
was found, sir," said the steward, taking from the bottom of
the parcel a sodden and battered mass that proved to be a
lady's black felt hat and feather, which was immediately
recognized as the property of Mrs. Irvine.
The duke groaned as he looked at it.
"Who found these articles, and under what circum-
tances?" he then inquired.
"I, myself, and one of the men from the hall, your grace.
The way was this: The report went around that the lady
of Stony Fells was missing, and that she had been last seen
on the banks of the Demondike, near the old stone bridge,
ti the dark hours before day; and the theory was that she
had started to walk to Castle Belle Isle, and the fear was
that in crossing the old stone bridge, where there are no
parapets, she had missed her footing in the dark, and had
fallen into the abysse.
"A natural and terrible conclusion 1. That is a very dan-
gerous bridge to cross either on a dark night or a windy
day; one might easily miss his footing in the night, or be
blown over in the day. That bridge ought to have been at-
tended to long ago," said the duke.
"So it ought, sir! And I went there this morning with
mne of the laborers from the estate, who is a stone mason,
to see about building a parapet to defend passengers from
falling over the bridge.
"An instance of the forethought shown in locking the
stable door after the steed is stolen,' eh, Traverse?"
"Well, your grace, I'i afeared it was something like
that; but your grace mus how that no accident of the
kind had ever happened before, and though people often
said to ni.: 'That bridge is dangerous and somebody will

fall over it and be drowned some of these days,' why,
all thought as it had stood so long and no one lost t h
lives by it yet, it might stand a little longer, so there w
no hurry."
"Until some one should meet with a fatal accident,
this unfortunate lady may have done."
"Well, your grace, it was very unfortunate, and we
feel very much cut up by it, and as soon as ever we her

in the chasm were bent, torn, or broken down. On loo
closer we found this rent and tattered fragment of a wV

handkerchief half out of it. It looked as if the lady h
fallen over the side of the bridge soon after stepping u
it, and that her pocket had been caught by the briar

we could reach it t9 get it up. 'Pears to me, your

"I wish they had been set to work a week earlier, how-
ever," said the implacable duke.
"Had not the dike better. be dragged, uncle?" inquired
the lieutenant.
"'Dragged,' my boy? You might as well 'drag' Niagara
Falls with any hope of finding a body that had fallen over
them! The dike at every high tide becomes a rushing,
roaring, impetuous torrent, carrying everything before it !
That unhappy lady's body has been swept out to sea, and
wherever it may be found, if ever it be found, it will not
be in Demondike."
"Is there, under these circumstances, even a possibility
of its recovery?" inquired the young marquis.
"I think so-a bare possibility. It may be thrown up by
the sea, or washed ashore," replied the duke.
"My lord, the Earl of Hawkewood, seeing that the acci-
dent happened on his estate, has already authorized me to
instruct the police to offer a large reward, in his name, for
the recovery of the body," said the steward, still lingering
near the library door with his hat in his hand.
"And you have done so?"
"Yes, your grace. His lordship being much interested
in the repair. of that dangerous bridge, came down to the
dike while the stone mason and myself were there, and in
fact just after we had recovered these relics, and being coh-
vincd, by seeing them, that a fatal accident had happened
to the poor lady, he told me to stop at the police station
and tell the chief to'offer two hundred pounds for the
recovery of that body. The police station was right on my
wav to the castle, and I stopped there and did as my lord
had .cmmanded. The placards are out by this time, I
dare sav."
"Thanks. That will do, Traverse! We will not detain
you any longer," said the duke.
"Good-day, then, your grace.  Good-day, gentlemen,"
returned the steward, bowing himself out.
"And now, in the name of Heaven, who is to tell the
unhappy daughter of this catastrophe?" demanded the
young lieutenant, in an anxious tone.


 
<pb n="188"/>
186    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT 
"Who could dare do it?" added the ypung marquis.
"Not I, certainly," replied the duke, with a shudde
"The duchess must break the news to Miss Irvine. Womn
by their native tact and delicacy, are fitter for such tas
thian men."
The conclave then broke up, and the duke went to se
his wife.
On inquiry, he learned that she was with Miss Irvine, 
that young lady's room.
He sent a message to ask to see her grace alone for
few moments.
The duchess returned for an answer that she would
to her boudoir and meet him.
And there, as soon as the pair were alone together,
duke told her of the terribly significant discoveries that 
the same morning been made at Demondike.
The duchess was deeply affected.
"Who shall tell Isoline this?" she moaned, with the s
hard question that had troubled the gentlemen below stai
"My love, you must brace yourself to that severe du

"Oh, but this which you call 'hope' is with her an ag

It will hurt her heavily, but it will not kill her  Let

replied the duchess.
"As you will, my dear. In this case, most certain
you know best," said the duke.
"But the body must be put, in a condition to meet
shock," murmured the lady, as she went to a small, eleg
cabinet, where she kept certain cordials and sedatives,
then she prepared a mixture, pleasant to the taste, s
porting and calming to the nerves.
With this, in a beautiful little Bohemian glass, she w
to the bedchamber of Isoline, where she had left the y
girl reclining on a sofa.
Isoline looked up anxiously.
"Any news? Did the duke send for you to give you 
news?" she eagerly inquired.


 
<pb n="189"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SEBPENT '187
"Drink this at once, my love," said her hostess, offeri
the little cordial that was so attractive to the sight and
smell.
"Oh, tell me first, dear duchess, is there any news?"
pleaded Isoline, clasping her hands and raising her eyes to
the face of her friend.
"Yes, my dear, there is.news, not very satisfactiory, how-
ever. But drink this. I will not utter another word until
you obey me."
Thus constrained, Isoline took the beautiful little glass
in her fingers, and smiling faintly, sadi:
"It looks beautiful and smells delicious. It cannot be
hard to take. It has also an exquisite taste and a soothing
effect," she added, when she had drank the cordial and
returned the glass to her friend.
The draught had been compounded to produce a swift
and powerful effect.
"Keep your promise now, dear duchess, and tell me news
of my dear mamma, if you have any," said Isoline earnestly.
But the sharp anxiety had left her face and her voice-
soothed down and soothed away by the potent balm that the
chemists have christened Donum-Dei.
Then the duchess, having prepared her nerves, began to
prepare her mind for the news she was to receive.
"Isoline, do you believe we are all in the hands of an in-
finitely good and wigs Heavenly Father?"
"Surely, I beliee so, duchess."
"Do you believe that everything which happens to us,
no matter what it may be, happens by the absolute pro-
viding, or the permitting of this infinitely wise and loving
Father?"
"Indeed I do   But why do you ask me, duchess? Are
you going to tell me anything terrible?" inquired the girl
in a calm tone.
"Isoline, you remember the coast guardsman, Prout, told
you that he had met Mrs. Irvine, of Stony Fells, wandering
on the brink of the Demondike, in the dark hour before
day, yesterday morning?"
"Yes, I remember."
"It was a very dangerous place for her, or for anyone
to pass at that hour."


 
<pb n="190"/>
188    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT 
"I know it was. I told mamma so when we drove o
the bridge in broad daylight on our way here."
"Anyone attempting to cross the bridge in the dark
easily have fallen into the dike."
"What do you mean, duchess? What do you mean
inquired Isoline quickly, passing her hand to and fro ac
her forehead.
"My dear child-something has been found in the

quickly and anxiously exclaimed the girl; yet without
anguish of pain she must have felt had not her nerves 
under the influence of that balmy sedative.
"Oh! no, no, not your mamma, my dear girl, but 
some proof to show that the coast guardsman's story
true, and that your mamma did wander along the 
of the Demondike, where he says he saw her in th dark
before day, yesterday morning."
"What was found, duchess?" inquired the girl, with
stunned anxiety.
"Some fragments of her'dress, my dear, looking as
had been caught in the briars an  torn offwhen-sh
missed her footing-and fell," said the duchess, brea
down and faltering, until, with the last words, her .
became choked.
Isoline passed her hand once or twice across her 
head in a bewildered manner, and then raised her ey
helpless appeal to her hostess and inquired:
"Do they think-that mamma-dell into the d

"My dear girl-my dear Isoline, if she did, it

.duchess in a broken voice.
Again Isoline passed her hand in a troubled way to'
fro across her brow, and said: 
"I hear you say this as if I heard it not! What
matter with me that I am so unfeeling? I can think
enough, but I cannot feel. I hear you say that,

dead ?" she heavily inquired, raising her eyes, full of stupid
trouble, to the face of the duchess.
"My dear, you must lie down and think all this quietly
over, and nerve your soul to bear it. I do not wish you
to put it away, but to take it and look at it until you can
endure it," said the duchess.
Isoline obeyed mechanically by sinking back on the sofa
and lying still.
Then the duchess, taking advantage of the lethargy into
which she had thrown the girl, began and gave her a de-
tailed account of the discoveries made at Demondike by the
Hawkewood steward and the stone mason, and also in-
formed her of the deductions made by the people from
these discoveries.
She told all these facts to Isoline, so that there might be
nothing left to tell her afterward.
And the girl heard them with a dull pain, but with a
strange apathy that could only have been the effect of the
powerful drug. 
The duchess then left her to the care of Mrs. Greylock,
and went downstairs to join the duke at luncheon.
To all inquiries as to the state of Isoline, she answered
that the poor child had heard the whole truth, and was
resting quietly under the benign influence of 'a powerful
anodyne and sedative.
"But when the reaction comes?" said the duke.
"It will 'be bad, 'but not so bad as the shock would have
been had we not prepared her system to receive it," replied
the lady.
All the remainder of that day Isoline lay calmly on the
sofa, not sleeping, but resting. Toward night she sank
into a deep slumber, aid in that condition she was un-
dressed and put to bed and watched by Mrs. Greylock.
She slept heavily until moiing,-and then awoke to the
horror and anguish of that reaction of which the duke had
spoken, but which, as the dihess had foretold, was much
less keen and bitter than it might have proved had the
patient not been gradually prepared for it.
The news of the finding of those relics spread through-
out the neighborhood and convinced everyone that the
beautiful lady of Stony Fells had met her fate in the dark

hours before day on that fatal morning when she was
missed from her home, by losing her footing and fa
from the bridge into the dread abyss of Demondike,
that her body had been washed out to sea.
The reward offered for its recovery stimulated the
fishermen to incredible vigilance and exertions. Two hIi
dred pounds would have made any one of them rich for,
according to their own estimate, and they all neglected
legitimate business to watch the coast for the lost body, 
CHAPTER XVIII
IN THE PALAOE ZAVIESKI
Around that house there hangs a solemn gloom; 
The step falls timid in each gorgeous room,
Vast, sumptuous, dreary, as some Eastern pile
Where mutes keep watch-a home without a smile. 
Noiseless, as silence reigned there like a law,
And the cold luxury saddens into awe 
Now when the pomp of somber funeral
Jars into life the melancholy hall,
As some chance wind on mournful autumn wing
Discordant sounds, although from music's strings.
-BoL
IN one of the most aristocratic old streets in the
snd of London stood the Palace Zavieski-alone.
Any stranger passing by would have taken the
to be a prison, a hospital, or some other public r
for guilt or for misery.
It was a vast, square edifice of dark, iron-gray,
without any architectural beauty whatever. Five
lofty windows, with dark oaken shutters, always 
faced the street. Four of these rows contained se
dows; but the lowest row contained but six, th
side the great double door of oak and iron that
mittance to the house. A stone wall, surmount
iron railing, surrounded the building.  Two 


 
<pb n="193"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                  191
trees stood in front and darkly shaded the many windows.
An iron gate in the wall admitted to the dark stone steps
that led by three short flights up the terraced yard to the
front door.
The outside of the house was depressing enough with-
out the great fall of heavy black crape that hung from
the handle of the lock and announced that death reigned
within.
Seeing that badge of mourning on a house of such pre-
tensions, in such a neighborhood, one would naturally have
looked up for the hatchment to see what noble of princely
corpse lay within. But there was no hatchment hung out-
side the wall of the Palace Zavieski, even while the dead
body of the Princess Zavieski lay within, for the princess
had no place in the English peerage.
Passing through those gloomy portals into the house, the
stranger visitor might naturally have expected to find the
bare floors and walls and the severely simple furniture of
some public reformatory or asylum, and would be delight-
fully amazed by- the richness of the scene upon which he
would enter.
The forbidding portals led into a vast hall, which was a
perfect wonder of decorative art. The floor was a rich
mosaic of rarest marbles. The walls were lined with paint-
ings of greatet beauty and highest cost. Two mantel-
pieces of gray marble were triumphs of the sculptors skill

the chandelier, stands a sumptuous catafalco, also cov
with black velvet, and canopied with black crape,
crowned with black plumes.
On the stand, under the canopy, rests a casket of eb
inland with pearl and silver, and lined with satin
swan's down and lace. On the lid of this coffin, on a
of silver, in letters of pearl, is this inscription:
MABIA,
PBINOB88 ZAVIBKI,
Born September 20th, 17-,
Died September 20th, 18-,
Aged 95 years.
Within that coffin, dressed splendidly in white v
trimmed with white satin and white lace, adorned
pearls and diamonds and decorated with flowers, lay 
mortal remains of the departed woman-a little, shri
form and wizened face from which all beauty as well s&
vitality had long departed.
Standing near the catafalco were two men-the m
attendant of the late princess, a court physician of
fame, Sir Peter Power, and her solicitor, Mr. An
Poinsett.
Though they were the nearest-friends, I was abo
say, but the princess had no friends-acquaintances 
deceased woman, they had no words of commpndatio
her. 
"Has Miss Smith been heard from?" inquired Sir
"No. She was notified as soon as the death ocou

manner. -I fancy she is on her road hither," answeredl Mr.
Poinsett.
"Was she notified by telegraph or by letter?"
"By letter. The little Gernman hamlet where she keeps
her school is out of the line of the telegraph wires, and
I believe has not more than two mails a week."
"Ah I Of course, that accounts for it. She would not
wait to write, but has set off at once to come hither."
"The death was so sudden that there was not the slight-
est chance of notifying her before it took place," said the
attorney, not as if he were informing the doctor, who ,of
course, knew more of that matter than himself, but rather
as if he were complaining of the fact.
"Yes, it was very sudden  I dined with her highness on
Tuesday night, and was called here on Wednesday morning
to fnd her dead of apoplexy. What is the age of her heiress
-Miss Smith?" 
"Well, not far from forty years, I should think," replied
Mr. Poinsett
"What sort of a woman is she ?" inquired Sir Peter.
"Have you never see nher?"
"Never. The princess never happened to be ill enough
to send for me during any one of Miss Smith's visits- 
though, as I have heard, she made long and frequent calls
on her aged relative."
"No, Sir Peter, it was not exactly so. Miss Smith keeps
a French and Egleh pensionnat, or boarding-school for
girls, in the little hamtlt of Osnik, and can only get away
during the school vacatiopsa  She has been in the habit of
coming here at the h   Brirfas, Easter, and midsummer holi-
days. She was here as i;ual last midsummer, and stayed
until the first of Septemblir, and left just twenty days before
the sudden death of the pricess."  .
"Is it not strange that the late princess should have
chosen to live here in this' ieat house, with her vast rev.
enues, alone, and allowed her only liring relative to toil for
her bread in a foreign land?" inquired the physician.
"Yes, it is strange, but it is in perfect keepng with the
character of the late princess. I have been her solicitor for
the last forty years, and I never knew her to give away a
dollar in charity, or to do one single kindly act."


 
<pb n="196"/>
194    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT
"That is a hard character to give to the deceased, stan
ing here by her body."
"It is a true one! Why, Sir Peter, if she could ha
taken all her wealth down into the grave with her d
she would have done it rather than that any human be
should have had it I Why, look at these jewels that bed
her corpse by her written instructions-pearls and 
monds worth many thousand pounds I-they go down i
the grave with her body l If she had made no will, 
Mary Smith, as her only living relative, would have
her heir-at-law. But she chose to make a will, leaving
her property to Mary Smith, not from any affection for
girl, but because she would rather leave it to one of her 
blood-since she must leave it to somebody-than to'
stranger; but she loaded her bequest with a cruel  di
-you may have heard it-that the legatee should
marry; anl if she should marry, then the whole es
should lapse from her to one Cosmo Belle Isle, a distant
ative of her late husband-Prince Alexander Zavieski."
" Cosmo Belle Isle ? Is he a connection of the ducal h
of Grand Manors?"
"Yes-a nephew of the present duke, whose yo
brother, Lord Bertram Belle Isle, married Vera Zavi
a niece of the late Prince Aleeander. But he will 
come in for this property."
"Why will he not ?"
"Because Miss Smith will accet the conditions 
which she is to get the estate. She will remain
ried."
"How do you know that?"
"Beause if she did not marry in her early youth, 
not the least likely to do so now."
"I inquired of you a while ago what sort of
woman this lady is," said Sir Peter. 
"Oh, she is a lovely brunette-.  most beautiful w
answered the solicitor warmly. 
"What, now at forty years of age?"
"Yes, now at forty years of age! I don't
she manages to be so, but I know she is so." 
"The wonder is all the greater that she has n
persuaded by some fine fellow to forego her

pects of wealth and position in favor of love and matri-
mony," said the physician.
"Yes, it is, and no doubt she has had her good offers of
marriage-could not help having had them with all her
beauty; but as I remarked before, having resisted such
temptations in her youth, she is not apt to yield to them in
her middle age."
"Persuade her to try and set aside the will! It is a
sufficiently eccentric one to warrant a suspicion of the te- -
tator's unsoundness of mind. And if she can set aside the
will, she will inherit as next of kin and heiress-at-law, with
the liberty of marrying if she wishes."
"Your proposal is worth thinking of, Sir Peter, and I
will suggest it to Miss Smith. Come now, shall we leave
this gloomy splendor? You only wished to view the ar-
rangements, I believe," said Mr. Poinsett.
"That's all I I have had enough of it," replied Sir Peter.
And the two gentlemen went out, the solicitor locking
the door after them.
A footman, already in deep mourning for his late mis-
tress, met them in the hall, and addressing the solicitor,
said:
"If you please, sir, Miss Smith has just arrived and she
asks to see you."
"Ah ! at last I Where is Miss Smith ?"
"In the blue parlor, sir." 
"Ah I You will excuse me, Sir Peter," said the solicitor
to the physician. -
"Certainly, Mr. Poinsett.  I am just going, in fact.
Good-morning," replied the latter.
"Will you not stop to luncheon, and see Miss Smith?"
"No; thanks. I have an engagement, and just time to
meet it. Good-morbing."
"Good-morning, then, since you must go."
The two gentlemen parted; the knighted physician to en-
ter his carriage and drive away to the house of some aristo-
cratic patient, and the solicitor to follow the footman to
the presence of the heiress.
The servant opened a door at the rear of the hall on the
right hand, and admitted the attorney into a small but ele-
gant apartment, upholstered in pale-blue velvet on ivory,

and having its one bay window hung with pale-blue  l
and fine white lace.
In the midst of this dainty room stood the stately fo
of a woman, dressed in the deepest mourning. Her lo
black veil of heavy crape was thrown behind her, reveal
a beautiful face, whose marble whiteness bore a "gha
contrast" to the large eyes and luxuriant hair, both as bl
as night.

the lady.
"Miss Smith, I am glad to see you. You got my

"Nay, I did not. The first intimation I received of

"As soon as I saw the notice of the death I set out
once for London, and have just arrived." 
"Strange you did not get my letter; but these contin

"Yes, in such remote places as Osnik."
"We waited to hear from you, Miss Smith, before
the day for the funeral."
"What day have you thought of?"
"Wednesday, the eighth day from the death-the f
from this."
"That will suit me."
"It is the usual interval."
"The obituary said: 'Suddenly, of apoplexy.' Did   B

"Terrible I" exclaimed the lady, shuddering.
"I think not. It was a sudden and perfectly

death. Her physician was called and he came promptly,
but could do no good, of course, for all was over. I was
notified and wrote to you immediately. You can see Sir
Peter Power and question him."
"Yes, I should like to do so; but not now. I must go
to my room."
The attorney rang the bell and sent the footman who
answered it to fetch the housekeeper, who, when she came,
conducted the lady to the sumptuous suite of apartments
that had been prepared for her.
"Well," muttered the lawyer to himself, when he was
left alone, "how utterly she is overcome by this event ! Who
would have imagined that the poor, hard-working school-
mistress, coming into this vast fortune bythe death of an
antediluvian relative who had never shown her the slightest
affection, should have been so prostrated by grief as Miss
Smith appears to be I Truly, the ways of woman are won-
derful and past finding out."
The lawyer would have thought so indeed could he have
seen the new heiress a few minutes after the housekeeper
had left her alone in her sumptuous bedchamber.
Locking her door and throwing off her mantle and hat,
Miss Smith gave herself up to a storm of passion. Walking
up and down the softly-carpeted floor, wringing her hands
and beating her breast, she cried, at intervals:
"Was ever temptation-was ever cruelty and crime like
mine !"
Four days later the funeral of the late Princess Maria
Zavieski was solemnized with great pomp.
After the return of the household from the cemetery
the will was read, which left the whole vast estate to the
teetator's grandniece, Mary Smith, on the sole condition
of her remaining unmarried during the life of the testator,
and, failing that condition, to the nephew by marriage,
Cosmo Belle Isle. 
"I thought that the condition of inheritance was that the
heiress should remain unmarried forever," said the doctor,
after the reading had been finished.
"So did I," replied the solicitor in a low voice, "but I did
not draw up the will, and in fact never, read it or heard it
read until to-day. My father and predecessor prepared it,

and it came into my possession sealed, among other docul
ments relating to the Zavieski estate."
"And Miss Smith may now marry, if she pleases."
"Yes, Sir Peter. There is a chance for you. I am al-
ready married."

ing:
"I f6und this, your mighty grace, behind the dresio g
table in my lady's bedroom when I was a-giving of it a
good cleaning. I think-if I might take the liberty, your
highness-as the paper must have been laid on the top of
the dressing-table for my young lady to see, but as it got
blown behind, and slipped down the back outen sight. I
don't know else how it could 'a' got there."
The duchess took the note, unfolded it, and read:
"BEDRoox, 4 A. M., Saturday.
"MY DABING IsoSZaB: Do not be alarmed when you

Belle Isle to see the duchess upon a point connected with

turbed my mind so much that it has kept me awake all

to go to the castle on Monday. Do not be anxiou even
though I should not return to-night. I may feel too much
fatigued to do so; in which case come to church on. Sunday

"This settles it. This explains everythingl' The poor
lady, in the morbid and unsound state of mind which we
all noticed, remembered some trifling condition or another
that had not been considered,between us, and attaching
undue importance to it, set out in the darkness before day

bridge, missed her footing, fell into. the dike and was swept

dropped the note upon her lap and leaned her head upon

"Would your worshipful highness allow a faithful

"I regret to refuse you;,but your young lady must

be permitted to see her," kindly explained the duchess.
"Then I won't even wish to 'sturve her, but will

rising.
"Stay, Mrs. Pond. I wish you to tell me who have
at Stony Fells to take care of the house, since the ca

"No one, your worship, except me and my girl,

"Then I will send one of our steady old men over

"I will not send anyone, since it is not necessary to

"Has your majesty any more gracious commands,
inquired the woman.
"No; no more, Mrs. Pond, thanks."
"Then I'll make so bold as to take my humble lea
your highiess," said the visitor, who, having exha
every high title upon the great lady, courtesied dowu:
the floor and turned to depart.
The duchess touched the bell, and to the servant
answered it she gave the order:
"Show Mrs. Pond to the housekeeper's room, and let
have some refreshments before she leaves the castle.", 
The woman courtesied again, even more profoundly 
before, and followed her conductor from the room. 
The duchess, when left alone, took up the poor
letter and read it over once more. Then laid it c
away in the drawer of a little cabinet that stood 
right hand, saying within herself: 


 
<pb n="203"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                R20
"This letter is very important and must be preserved;
for although it certainly betrays a morbid state of mind in
the writer, as setting to much value upon trifles and utterly
ignoring the risk she was about to run in leaving home at
the hour she did to cross the bridge over Demondike, yet
it certainly affords conclusive evidence that no suicide could
have been meditated or committed, and that her death was
due to accident. Yes, this letter will be an invaluable wit-
ness for the poor lady, should her body ever be found to
be subjected to an inquest."
So meditating, the duchess left the boudoir to sit an
hour by the bedside of her suffering young guest. 
At this very time a singular conference was being held
in the Ruined Tower, between Old Nan and Young Nan,
over their dinner of ham and eggs and claret wine-as
fine claret as could be found in the cellars of the hall or
the castle-but, then, it had never paid any duty.
"Yes I two hunder pound a-going a-begging for the want
of a bold stroke to win it. Two hunder pound as would
help us away from this demon's den to some decent place
where we could live at ease all the rest of our lives," said
Old Nan viciously.
"I don't see how you can say that, mother! The two
hundred pounds, I take it, is at this moment safe in the
vaults of some bank, and cannot be got at by the boldest
stroke, unless the duke will give a check for it, and he
won't do that until.the body is found," replied Young Nan.
"And why ain't the body found, with such a reward
a-waiting for it, I should like to know?" sharply demanded
the old woman.
The young one had just put half a fried egg it her
: handsome mouth, and waited to swallow it and wash it down
with a draught of claret before she answered.
" 'Cause the sea haven't tbrowed it up yet," said Young
Nan.
"And never will," muttered Old Nan:
"I'm sure our men have been neglecting everything else
under the light of the sun and moon to watch and wait
for that body in the hopes of earning that reward, and
haven't succeeded"

,"I don't know what you mean, mother."
"I s'pose you don't, being a natural fool  Look

intently into the eyes of he rdaughter.
"Well, I'm looking, and listening, tool" exclaimed
latter, after she had bolted a lump of bacom and gulp

shaking her fist at her daughter.
"Mother, I am attending to you. See me," said
young woman, as she pushed away her plate, wiped 
mouth, and gave her undivided attention to the beldam. 
"Well, then, this is what I want to know: if De
Prout and his pal cannot find the body, why don't t
get a body? There l" exclaimed Old Nan, her eyes
ping with cunning.
"Mother!" cried Young Nan, in genuine dismay.
"Eh, 'mother ' What do you mean by speaking in

"I am afraid to think what you mean," muttered
young woman.
"That is because you are a fool and a-coward! A

"Don't, mother, don't!" cried Young Nan, placing her
hands on her ears.
At this moment Red Dennis entered the tower.
"Eh, you've not earned that two hunder pound yet* 
cried Old Nan, snapping her finger and thumb derisiveb
at the newcomer.
"No, I have not," answered Dennis gruffly, throwing
himself into a chair.
"Going to give up the mearch?"
"Yes, I am."
"Glad to hear you say so. You'll never get the body;
but you might get a body and win your two hunder pounds
all the same, and I'd help you to do it to earn my share."
"Eh? What? What in the bottomless pit do you mean,

Nan herself lost no time. It was now only about
o'clock in the afternoon; for Nan, like other people of
class, took her dinner at twelve noon.
Now she arose, and, leaving her daughter to wa4l

dishes, she went to the corner cupboard where she kept
her medicinal dried herbs, roots, and flowers and her infu-
sions, decoctions, and distillations, and she carefully selected
a vial containing a powerful narcotic of the class which is
swift in its action and brief in its duration, and put it into
her pocket.
She slipped a pack of cards in the same depository and
put on her short red cloak and her blue silk head handker-
chief, and took her staff in her hand and turned to leave
the house.
"Where are you going, mother?" inquired Young Nan,
who had not once spoken during the interview between
Old Nan and Red Dennis.
"I am going down to Stony Fells to see them there two
lonesome women and tell their fortunes, as I promised them
I would some day," replied the crone.
"Motherl You are going on a most wicked errand to
get something to help out a most fiendish deception-1" cried
Young Nan.
"Hold your tongue, or I'll brain you, you jade I How
dare you say such tings? I am going to do a pious deed 
I'm going to set a poor young gal's heart at ease by helping
to find the body of her drowned mother and resky it from

you want to hinder me in such a holy duty as that, you
wicked woman, you I'T exclaimed Old Nan, shaking her staff
at her daughter as she left the ruined tower.
She walked down to the coast, and took her way to the
promontory. As the tide was low and still ebbing, she
walked along the sands, keeping a sharp lookout for the
dreadful "treasure trove she was earnestly hoping to find.
"For if it should turn up," she said to herself, "it would
save me all this trouble, and I should get the whole of
the money."
And many a time in the course of her walk she went
to the edge of the surf to poke over a piece of suspicious-

looking driftwood or a rift of seaweed, in hope of discov

In this way she was nearly two hours in reaching Sto
Fells, which stood on the extreme edge of the promonto
overhanging the sea. The end of the promontory helv
out like the ledge of a pulpit, and was therefore 
proachable from the water side.
Old Nan turned from the coast and climbed up the cli
by a winding path and presently stood upon the pla
facing the grim old stone mansion.
Everything around the building was silent, and it seem

The door was opened by Lona Pond, a fair-complexio
rosy-cheeked, blue-eyed and yellow-haired lassie, who
tered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure at seeing 
old woman, for was she not the grandmother of handso
Ham Gow ?

girl, leading the way to the vast old kitchen, which

a dresser on one side and a settle on the other; a rude oak
table and a few rough oak chairs.
Such was the aspect of this old kitchen.
Lona, with a look of great slyness and satisfation upo
her pretty face, drew a chair to the fire and made the si  -
itor sit down.
"Where is Mrs. Pond?" inquired Nan, as she dropped
heavily into the seat and stpod lh  staff up in the chimiey
corner.
"Oh, she's gone to the castle with some sort of a note'
as we found behind the bureau when we was a-cleaning up 
the missus' room, which she thinks may throw some light
on the missus' fate."
"Ay, ay . What was in the note?" inquired Old Nan,
her cunning blue eyes gleaming.
"Dunno. We didn't dare to read it, though it wasn't
sealed. It were only in one of these hre hang wollop."
"When did she go?"
"'Bout an hour ago."
"When will she be back?'
"Oh, not till evening. She wants to call at the Hall and
at the rectory and at the village." 
"Oh, yes, shell hare to talk of her disvery to all he

The girl hesitated and blushed.
"But a bonny lad's as hev gone to sea," suggested
crone.
Lona hung her head in silence.
"Ah I" said Old Nan to herself  "I need not drug a
even if I could get a chance. There is a safer and a 
way of putting her to sleep. Ay I and of learning so
thing from her at the same time. These large-eyed, lii

"Will you tell my fortune now, Mrs. Crook, please
said Lona.
"Yes, my dear child. And I will do better than that.,:
will put you into a sleep in which you shall see your
fortune. How would you like that'?"
"Oh, that would be wonderfull" exclaimed the
whose hopeful nature never imagined the possibility of
ing anything unpleasant in the future of her life.
"Sit in that chair, then, lean back, and fix your eyes
mine," said the crone.
The girl complied with these directions, and the 
was about to begin her passes when Lona interrupted

"Oh, no   You will not sleep more than an hour."
"I'm glad of that, because I have got a task to finiah
before she comes home."
"Oh, you have? Then I will wake you up in an hour."
"That is a good soul! Now begin."
And the girl sat back in her chair and yielded herself
up to the will of this necromancer, otherwise mesmerist,
who immediately began her incantations or "passes."
The girl soon succumbed to the influences and went of
into a deep mesmeric sleep or trance
"Now, then," said the crone, "I must fasten up the doors
to prevent interruption, and go through the house to get
what I want."
She secured the lower part of the house and then went
upstairs and roamed from room to room until she came
to one which, from its superior furniture, she decided must
be that of the late mistress.
Then she drew a large bunch of skeleton keys from her
pocket and went to the bureau drawers and tried one key
after the other until she found one to fit the lock, when
she opened the drawers in succession and took from them
only what she needed for her purpose and nothing else, for
she did not wish a robbery to appear and cause inquiry.
Among the trifles taken from the drawer was an inside
handkerchief or tucker of white linen cambric and lace
which had evidently been used since it had been washed.
This she lifted delicately with the tip of her fingers and
laid apart, muttering:
"It lay next to her bosom  It is full of her magnetism.
It will be useful in the clairvoyant search, but I must not
let it be mixed with other material."
She closed the bureau drawers and locked them and went
to a wardrobe and took from its hooks and shelves a full
suit of woman's clothing, including shoes and stockings.
These she made into a bundle and set upon a chair, while
she carefully closed and locked the doors.
Then she replaced the bunch of skeleton keys in her
pocket, took up the bundle in one hand and the "tucker"
in the other, holding the latter by the tip of her finger and
thumb, and so descended the stairs and passed by a rear
door into the kitchen.

The crone sat down on a chair, muttering:

So saying, she sat back and began making a few

After about ten minutes she drew her chair up

A convulsive shudder passed over the sleeper, and she
exclaimed:
"Oh!I 'm afraid of falling  I am on the bridge  It is
so dark! The torrent roars so! Oh!"
The crone made several passes over the girl's head, face,
and bosom, and said:
"Be quiet. Tell me what you see."
The girl trembled into stillness and answered calmly:
"A woman-walking on the bridge before me."
"Ah I" exclaimed Old Nan. "What woman is it?"
"I don't know. It is so dark."
"Look again," said Old Nan, taking the neck handker-
chief from the lap of the girl and folding it and tying it
around the sleeper's forehead.
"Ah!" exclaimed the girl. "It is my mistressl She is
at the end of the bridge now  She is looking down into
the dike! She is doing something to the side of her
dress  - Ah     It is torn! She is pinning it over, so the
rent may not be seen. There   Now she has thrown her
hat over the bridge I And now-now-what is she doing?
She is taking another soft felt hat from her traveling-bag
and is putting it on her head and wrapping a veil around
it! And now-      She is gone. All is very dark again-
pitch dark," said. the girl, with a deep sigh, as she sank
into the quietude of utter exhaustion.
"That is queer, tool Very queerl" muttered Old Nan
to herself. "There was a shred of a torn dress, and there
was a battered and sodden hat found in the dike, just below
the place where Red Dennis saw Mrs. Irvine walking-
and now this girl in her trance sees the same woman do
something to her dress and afterward pin up the rent to
hide it; then drop her hat over the brink, and afterwards
take another hat, with a veil, from her traveling-bag and
put it on! This looks very like a deep deception, and very
unlike finding the body I  must let my seeress rest a little
and then send her off sight-ieing again."
After a few minutes the' cone placed her hands upon
the handkerchief that was still bound around the girl's
brow, and after holding them theer a few seconds, in-
quired:
"Where are you?"

away in a deep sigh.
"This grows stranger and stranger," muttered the
to herself. "I must let her rest and try her again."
"After fifteen minutes, Old Nan resumed her in
tions and her questions.
"Where are you now?" she inquired, pressing her
upon the handkerchief that bound the brow of the
voyant.
"Oh, in such a grand, grand house I Grander tha

Again the girl's voice quivered into silence, and 
sank upon her bosom.
"This beats all !" exclaimed Old Nan. "I will
think all this over before I can make anything of it.":
She let her subject rest for about ten minutes,

began her "passes" and her questions again, but she could
elicit nothing but sighs, moans, and complaints of weari-
ness from the exhausted girl
"I would like to wait until she rallies and question her
again, but I must not stay here much longer," concluded
Old Nan, as she glanced at the kitchen clock and saw it
was nearly five, and at the kitchen window and saw that
the sun was near its setting.
With a few rapid counterpasses she roused the girl from
her trance.
Lona looked around in a bewildered way.
"Well, don't you remember what has happened to you?"
demanded Old Nan.
Lona stared at the questioner, but made no reply.
"Don't you know I came here to tell your fortune and
put you into a sleep where you could see your lover in a
dream ?"
"Oh I"
"Do you remember?"
"Yes."
"Did you see him in a dream?"
"No I"
"Ohl You stupid! Yes, you didl And you talked in
your sleep and told me all about where he was I Why, it
was my Ham, you shy puss, and me not knowing as who
was his sweetheart until you saw him in your dream and

"Oh " said Lona again, for she was both bewildered
and exhausted.
"Ah I You saw him in a fine ship, on the blue sea, writ-
ing a letter to you to be sent home by the first homeward-
bound craft they should meet  And you don't remember
nothing about this ?"
"No I"

that mag-nif-i-cent palace is standing where my splendid
lady received her grand company. Where--"
In the preoccupation of her mind, Nan Crook did not
look where she was treading, and so she had her mental
soliloquy broken by a stumble and a fall. With as many
oaths as might have served a pirate in a storm, she struggled
to her feet. In doing so, her eyes fell upon something that
looked like a pocketbook lying on the briars on the left
side of the path.
She stooped and picked it up.
It was a memorandum book, bound in dark purple mo-
rocco, and having on its little brass plate the initials
"M. S."
Nan knew the alphabet, but that was the extent of her
knowledge of letters.
" 'M. S.,'" she said to herself. "What does that stand
for, I wonder."
She opened the book and saw that its pages were written
all over. She was filled with curiosity to know the meaning
of the writing.
"This book must have belonged to her. She must have
dropped it on her way to the bridge. I wonder if this will
give any clue to that palace? If it does-if it does, Old
Nan will have an annual income outen my lady for keeping
of her secret."
So saying, the crone hurried onward, walking rapidly
until she reached the ruined tower.
Young Nan was out, but Red Dennis was ,there await-
ing her return.
"Well?" she demanded eagerly. "What news?"
"Good news I Listen ! That poor girl, Nell Thorne, died
a Monday and was buried yesterday," replied the man.

CHAPTER XXI
FOU4D
A  EW days after the events recorded in our last chlo
the Duke of Grand Manors sat alone in his library, l
over the morning papers.
He was reading this item of personal intelligence in 
London Independent:
"The will of the lately deceased Maria, Princess Za
ski, is in perfect accordance with the supreme sefisl
of a woman who, in the whole course of her long natI
life, had never been known to give even so much a
farthing in charity, to do one deed of mercy or to
one word of kindness to any human being. Her vast
tune, made by successful speculation in stocks, and 
mated at ten millions of pounds sterling, has been left 
tirely to her one sole relative, Miss Mary Smith, or 0
Germany, on the sole condition that the inheritrix sho
remain unmarried. Failing this condition, it is to de
to Lieut. the Honorable Cosmo Belle Isle, nephew by        -
mother's side to the deceased husband of the late pr
and also nephew by his father's side to the present 
Grand Manors. No legacy has been left to friend, er
or charity."
"If this maiden lady could have been persuaded to m
now a fine fortune would have come to our Cosmo," 
the duke. "What a monster of selfishness that wo
must have been, to have ignored all the claims of sufe
humanity, and all the impulses of natural affection,'
make such a will as this," he added.
He had scarcely said this to himself, when ai
knock at the door was followed by the entrance of

Overly, his grace's steward, who bowed profoundly,  d
stood at what the drill sergeants call-attention.
"Ah, Overly, what is it?" said the duke. 
"If you please, your grace, there is a coast guardsm n
below, who came to me half an hour ago with the news thtt
the body of a woman had been found last night wished
ashore near the mouth of Demondike, and supposed to be
that of the missing lady, Mr. Berners Irvine," said Overly.
"Ah I" exclaimed the duke, instantly and earnestly inter-
ested. "Where is the man?" 
"If you please, your grace, he is below. He came to me
first, not presuming to come near your grace; but I took
the liberty to think your grace might like to question him
yourself. So I brought him to the castle. He is a most
respectable man in his station, your grace-Dennis Prout,
of the Preventive Service," said the steward.
"Bring him up," said the duke.
The steward bowed himself out and in ten minutes re-
turned, ushering into the presence of the duke a short,
thick-set, broad-shouldered, bull-necked, bullet-headed, red-
bearded ruffan, *hom we know as Red Dennis, the traitor
and smuggler, and thief and body snatcher, but whom the
unsuspecting steward presented to the duke of Grand Man-
ors as::
"Mr. Dennis Prout, of the Preventive Force, your grace."
"Ah II am glad to see you, Mr. Prout, especially if you
have brought news and proof of the recovery of the remains
of the unfortunaae lady who was drowned last week at
Demondike," said the duke.
"I found a body, your grace; but I cannot say if it is
that of the missing lady. That will be for her friends to
decide; but if your grace will permit me, I will tell you
the circumstances," said the coast guardsman respectfully..
"Certainly; I am anxious to hear all you have to tell,"
replied the duke.
"Then, your grace, last night, between sunset and twelve
o'clock, it was my watch on the coast, near Demondike.
About half-past eleven o'cloc, at low tide, I was walking
a little west of the dike, when I noticed something lying
upon the sands pretty well wotud about with sea weeds.
Something in the lay of the-thing proved to my mind that

A page who waited in the hall outside within  e
its sound entered the room. 
"Go down and order the carriage to be at the d
twenty minutes," said the duke. 
The lad touched his short-eropped, red head andei
upon his errand.

"Mr. Prout, I thank you for your zeaL If the bod4
ave found should prove to be that of the lost lady, Aou
receive the stipulated reward," said the duke, risng
with the air of dismissing his visitor.
"I humbly thank your grace," said the coast guardsman,
bowing profoundly, and continuing to bow until he disap.
ared through the door, followed by the steward.
When he was left alone the duke reclined back in his
chair and subsided into thought,
" The coroner must be notified at once. The inquest must
be held to-day. The witnesses must be summoned to view
the body-to identify or deny it-as the remains of Mrs.
Berners Irvine.. Let me see-who should bea ummoned?
hose who know her intimately, of course. Those are-the
duchess, myself, the rector, her own daughter, and the serv-
ants from Stony Fells. These are the persons who knew
her most intimately. The duchess must not be srtonofied.
I will not permit her to be subjected to such annoyance.
Miss Irvine is physically disabled from attendance. There
remains, besides myself-Dr. Vincent, Dr. Ellis; and the
servants from Stony Fells. They must be summoned at
nce."
As the duke came to these conclusions the page entered
and announced the carriage.
"Tell the duchess that I have gone to Hawkevile, but
will be home in time for dinner," was the message left with
Cosmo Belle Isle, whom the duke encountered on his way
o the carriage.
The young man bowed and smiled, without any suspicion
of the ghastly errand that took his uncle to the village.
The duke passed on and entered his coach.
"Drive to the Ruined Tower at the foot of Demondike,"
was the order he gave to his coachman as he took his seat
in the carriage, which immediately turned down the avenue
leading to the ferry.
After crossing the ferry to the main, the duke perceived
that the coast was "alive" witi fishermen, agricultural.la-
brers, loiterers, men, women, and children, discussing the
ews that had already, in some unknown way, got abroad
oncerning the finding of the drowned body.
The duke ordered his coachman to drive fast along the

The house-if it could be called such-was suri
by a mob of people whom the two police officers s
thre on duty found it difficult to keep in order.
Way was made, however, for the duke's carriage,
drew up before the rude door of the strong room.
A policeman on guard there came forward and
the carriage door.
"What is going on in there?" inquired the duke. 
"The crowners 'quest, your grace," replied the
etfully touching his hat.
"WhatI already?" 
Before the policeman could answer, Old Nan,

nizable, even by the nearest friends.
The coroner was seated at a little wooden stand at the
head of the table, around which the jury were standing-
the resources of the Ruined Tower not affording seats for
twelve "good men and true."
A flag-bottomed chair was, however, dragged from some
obscure corner by Old Nan and placed at the stand beside
['the coroner for his "imminence," which was the last title
of distinction bestowed by te crone on the Duke of Grand
Manors.
The inquest had already made some progress.
Old Nan, it seemed, had testified to the bringing of the
body to the Ruined Tower at just past midgight by Mr.
Dennis Prout of the Preventive Service.
'Mr. Dennis Prout was not in the room, not yet having
returned from his mission to Belle Isle Castle--t takes
longer to walk that distance than to drive it-but his testi-
mony could'be taken later. The proceedings were not to be
delayed on his account, for while waiting for him other
witnesses could be heard.
Mrs. Pond, the housekeeper and cook from Stony Fells,
was undergoing an examination at the time the duke took
his seat beside the coroner.
Amid hysterical sobs and tears the woman swore most
positively that this body upon which the inquest was being
held was that of hetr dear, dear, dear, deceased mistress,
Mrs. Berhers Irvine' "
When asked how she could so assuredly identify it, she
declared, with grief and indignation, that "that was her
mistress' black cashmere dress, and that was her Balmoral
skirt, and that her Welsh flannel petticoat, and those were
her mistress' Balmoral boots and Balbriggan stockings"-
indicating the various articles by touch as she spoke of
hem.
Being gently reminded that the identification of the
clothing, though it was strong presumptive evidence, was
not exactly identification of the body, she suddenly caught
p the poor, damp, mutilated left hand and exclaimed,

She was allowed to stand down and was carried off, in
paroxysm of hysterics, by several women.
Dr. Vincent, rector of Hawkeville parish, was called and
testified that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the
remains before them were those of his friend and parish-
ioner, Mrs. Berners Irvine.
"Would your grace mind taking the witness stand ?" def.-
erentially inquired the coorner..
t"Certainly not. Is it not my bounden duty?" inquired
the duke, somewhat disgusted at the toadyism of the public
officer.
The duke formed very decided opinions upon most sub-
jects. He was very seldom in doubt. He was not in doubt
now. He was absolutely convinced in his own mind that
the body under inquest was that of his late friend, Mrs.
Berners Irvine, and he swore to its being so without a
moment's hesitation.                      , 
At this point of time a stir was seen in thoe crowd near
the door, and Dennis Prout entered the room.
He was considered the most important witness in the
case, and was immediately put upon the stand, and ex-
amined by the coroner in person.
In answer to the direct questions put he testified to hav-
ing seen the deceased lady walking on'the bridge. over
Demondike at about three o'clock in the morning of the
day upon which she was missing. Later on he testied to
having discovered the body now under inquest on the pre-
ceding night at low tide on the part of the beach just west
of the mouth of Demondike, and to having lifted it in his
arms and brought it to the Ruined Tower, and left it in the
care of Mrs. Crook, while he went to Castel Belle Isle to
give information to his grace the Duke of Grand Manors
of what had taken place.
After Dennis Prout came John Traverse, the steward
of the Hawkewood estate, who testified to the finding of
the fragment of a black dres, with a pocket attached, and 
a pocket handkerchief within it; also a black felt hat, half-
way down the bank of the Demondike.
The stone mason, who was with him at the time, cort

laughed.
"What a clincher that there wedding ring turned oit

"Why-as to that, Mr Crook, you know I furnished the

"Ay, that you did," asseted the crone, with a sly twin-
de in her eyes. 
"And I have the credit io fnding it."
"So you have."          ,'                   '

CHAPTER XXII
THE RARL AND COUNTEMS AT HOWE.
WHEN the bereaved daughter of Berry Irvine was suf-
ficiently convalescent to hear the subject discussed, the good
duchess went to her chamber, seated herself by her side and
gently informed her of all that had happened during her
illness-suppressing only one hideous item, the mutilated
and disfigured condition in which the "remains" had been
found.
The young girl wept freely as she listened; but her tears
were natural and healthful, and upon the whole, it was
comforting rather than otherwise to think that since her
beloved mother had met so sudden and unprepared a death
by accidental drowning, her remains had been recovered and
now reposed peacefully beneath the turf in the village
churchyard, where her orphan might often visit her grave.
Only one complaint Isoline made-that the funeral had
taken place without her having had the sorrowful privilege
of gazing once more, and for the last time, on the bodily
features of her beloved mother.
But the duchess tenderly reminded Isoline of the im-
practicability that had existed of delaying the burial under
the circumstances '
Isoline humbly assented to this explanation and became
quiet, if not resigned.
Under the care of.'the good duchess and her daughters,
Isoline gradually rei ,ed her health and strength.
On the first day that she was able to go, she begged per.
mission to visit the grfav f her mother, and Lady Volante
drove her thither in her ladyship's own little pony carriage.
Hawkeville Old Church, af it was called, was an ancient
Gothic edifice in the form of a cross, having no steeple,
but a heavy square tower, covered, like all the rest of the
building, with a thick green rantle of ivy.
The churchyard was full of monuments clustering like
a grove around the church, and behind the churchyard was
a comparatively new cemetery, which was entered through
an iron gate in the old stone wall.

m8     THE TRAI OF THE SERPENT
Crowded as the original yard was with graves, ro
been found in a green spot under a broad, spreading 
for the coffin of "the unfortunate Berry Irvine." 
Lady Volante drew up at the front gate, gave the
to her groom, who followed on horseback, assisted I
to alight, and led her into the churchyard and down a'
row, shrub-bordered path to the deeply shaded, ve
nook, where, under the sheltering branches of the ol
tree, arose the slender; white marble obelisk that hadt
placed there by the duke to mark the last bed of Is
mother. 
It bore a very simple inscription, as follows:
MARY,
Widow of the late Rev. Berners Irvine.
Died September 20th, 18-, 
Aged .-.
Isoline sank down on the newly sodded mound an
way to the inevitable burst of sorrow.         '
Lady Volante stood over her, full of sympathy, but
out attempting a word of useless condolement.
When her paroxysm of grief had temporarily e
itself, Isoline arose, drew a deep breath, wiped her 
and gazed upon the obelisk with its inscription. 
"Who put this here?" she at length inquired gentli
"Papa," replied Lady Volante softly; 
"Oh, how kind, how good, how thoughtful he is li

claimed Isoline.

girl," said Lady Volante tenderly. 
"I do believe it is, for you all live to do good. 
is time for me to rouse myself from this weakness of
sorrow and do my duty also in this life. Volante, ^

"I think I can guess that. I know Lord Hawkewood
as not been coming here only to talk political economy

id Isoline with a sigh.
Lady Volante, whose only motive in referring to her
"secret" was the wish to divert the sad thoughts of Isolins
rom dwelling on her bereavement, assented to the fitness of
er friend's remarks by keepin silence on the subject.
A few moments later she said:
"Dear Isoline, I do not wish to hurry you, but the dew
s falling, the place is very damp, and you are still very
elicate and susceptible to cold since your illness. We had
et go home now, love. We can come again,you know."
Isoline arose and took the offered arm of Lady Volante,
and they left the churchyard together.
As they were driving home, Isoline sank again into
mber thought.
To arouse her from this, Lady Volante said;
"As soon as you are able to enter into a discussion of
business, my dear Isoline, papa wishes to talk to you about
tony Fells."
" 'Stony Fells P " echoed Isoline, with an inquiring look.
"Yes, dear-as to what had best be done'with it. You
will make your home with us, you kno*."
"Oh, Lady Volante ! said Isoline depreatingly.
"Did you not know. that mamma had promised your
other, in the event of your being left alone, to take charge
you and keep you here?" inuired Lady Volante.
"No, indeed, I did not know it," replied Isoline.
"But it is true, however, formamma told me so."
"I know my dear mother, for a short time before her
tal accident, had been hiunted with a presentiment of
udden death from heart disease."
"And with that presentiment strong upon her, she con-
ided her anxieties for you to mamma, and fell in with the
rrangement proposed by the duchess, that in the event of
yur mother's death, you should make your home with us.

I hope you have no objection to obey your mothi

"What about Stony Fells, dear Lady Volanteti?

"Then papa thinks that the lease had best be

Isoline.
"That is much better! Very much better! But here
we are at the ferry !-Steady, Pearl  Steady, Beauty I"
This to the little silver-gray pony, who began to be frisky
as she descended to the water side.
The groom came to the head of the horse, took the bit
bridle and led her down the slope to the gangplank and then
across to the ferryboat.
In twenty minutes more the boat had crossed the water
and landed at Belle Isle.
The groom went again to the head of the pony and led
her to the shore.
Then Lady Volante resumed the reins and drove along
the shaded avenue that led to the castle.
They arrived in good time to dress for dinner.
The care of the kind duchess had, during the illness of
Isoline, provided mourning and had it made up for the
orphan girl.
This was the first occasion of her joining the family at
dinner since her bereavement. When she appeared in the
drawing-room, her beautiful pale face seemed still more
beautifully fair in contrast with the darkness of her eyes
and hair and the jet blackness of her lusterless silk dress
and its heavy crape trimmings.
As she glided softly into the room, Cosmo Belle Isle,
tall, fair, handsome, aad attentive, went to meet her, and
with every silent and delicate manifestation of reverential
tenderness and sympathy led her to a seat.
Nor did his attention stop there. When dinner was an-
nounced he led her into the aining-room and placed himself
beside her at the table.
And after dinner he devoted himself to her during the
whole evening.
As she was still somethiai of an invalid and this was
her first evening out of her sick chamber, she was the first
to retire from the circle.
Cosmo Belle Isle took her wax candle in its little gold

and returned to the drawing-room below. 
The Earl of Hawkewood, who, as the affianced 
of a daughter of the house, took the liberty of d'
'down upon the family at any hour of the day or e
that suited his convenience, had just arrived, with
dent intention of taking a bed at the castle.
He was seated beside Lady Volante on one
ttee--tte sofas.
The duke was using his privilege as paterfamil
prospective father-in-law by sitting back in his cha
his handkerchief over his face, dozing.
The duchess was seated alone at a table covered'i
pictures and bijouterie.
As Cosmo Belle Isle entered she beckoned him to
to her.
He came and took a seat at the saine table, facin
and took up a tortoise shell and gold paper knife, and'
fiddling with it awkwardly. He seemed to know.w

my dear," concluded the duches, as she took, up a book
of prints and began to examine them to show that the shqkt
conference was at an end.
The young gentleman, who seemed now to be posed
of a demon of restlessness and mishief-making, just osam  -
tered up to the betrothed pair and interrupted their tetV
tete by asking the Earl of Ha*kewood when, as master of
the Hawkeville fox hounds, be *as going to have the first
meet.
"What is that to you?" laughingly replied the earL
"You are generally supposed to ride to the hounds about
as well as a tailor I But the first meet will be at the head
of the Demondike, on Thusday, as you might have seen by
the IAawkeville Beacon, if you really cared to know."
Cosmo Belle Isle turned on his heel and went and waked
up his uncle to ask him when there would be a sitting of
the county magistracy and whether anything more c  euld be
done toward the detection and arrest of the criminals who
had perpetrated the outrages at Hawke Hall.
The duke, waked from some pleasant dream of his long
past boyhood, perhaps, suppressed a yawn, rubbed his eyes,
and said he thought it was near bedtime.
And the "goodly meeting" being thus broken up, the
members of the circle retired to their several chambers.
After breakfast the next morning the Earl of Hawke-
wood left the castle, and the Duke of Grand Manors had
a business interview With his "ward," as he ihoee to call
and confider Isoline Irvine.
In that interview all the proposals of the duke were
promptly accepted by the orphan, who had, indeed, no idea
of opposing any arrangement recommended by those whose
faithful protection of heself had given them a claim to
her obedience.
In the course of the next week, therefore, in carrying
out the plans of the duke for the benefit of his ward, the
establishment at Stony Fells was broken up, the lease was
resigned, the furniture-witi the exception of the few
trifles reserved by Isoline ian memory of her mother-were
sold at auction, and the two servants were discharged.
Furniture stores are not so many, nor auctions so fre-
quent in the country as in the towns and villages, and

CHAPTER XXIII 
THE MOST IPRT.TTAfTtT MATCH OF THE 8EA801 
IN February the Duke and, Duchess of Grand Manors
with all their family, including the music mistress, went
up to London and took possession of their town hounse
Belle Isle Palace, for the. season.
Lady Volante Belle Isle began her second campaign as an
engaged young lady.
The final preparations for her marriage were to be com-
pleted here; for the ceremony was to be performed at the
most fashionable and aristocratic church in London-the
world-renowned St. George's, Hanover Square. 
The bridegroom-elect, the young Earl of Hawkewood,
came up to town and took apartments at the Alexandra.
His own town house, Hawke Lodge, was then in the

The new Earl ofHawkewood took his seat in the House
of Lords for the first time on the opening of Parliament
this month..
The Duke of Grand Manors introduced him; but the
new peer took no more part in the debates than the chair
on which he sat   -
The duchess gave no parties, and attended no receptions.
She was too much ecwupied in personally superintending
the preparations of bher daughter's wedding, and, apart
from that, she wa reserving herself for that important
occasion.
Lady Volante Belle Isl8 was busy all day long driving
from milliner to mantuimaker; and from dressmaker to
jeweler.
The world of fashion decided that the. forthcoming mar-
riage, which had been dulyBannounced in the Court Journal,
would certainly be the maBo  brilliant of the season.
The settlements were munificent-"most munificent,"
the solicitors of the duke had said among themselves, add-

Her bevy of fair bridesmaids stood around her-, le" 
eyed and golden-haired blaodes; black-eyed and raven        |
haired brunettes, and the charming gray-eyed and brown-
haired mezzotint beauties were all represented here. Their
dress was a uniform conisting of trained princess white
satin robes, with white Brusels veils and wreaths of white
moss rosebuds.
'IThe carriages attend my lady," announced the groom
of the chambers at the door.
And the lovely bride, followed by her fair train of brides-
maids, swept out of the room,
"In sheen of satin and shimmer of pearls,"
and deseended the broad staircase.
In the hall below they were met by the Duke of Grand
Manors and the Marquis of Belle Isle-the father and
brother of the bride.
"Your mother is in the carriage, my love," said the duke,
as he gave his daughter his arm and led her forth.
The Marquis of Belle Isle bowed and conducted the
bridesmaids.     ;
The children; with their governesses, were already seated
in the rear carrge
When' all was ready the procession moved, and in due
season reached the church and drew up before its massive
portals. 
Ushers in "wedding garments," with white wands in their
white kid-gloved hands, kept clear the walk from the pave-
ment to the church-door. This walk was covered with
scarlet cloth and canopied with an arch of flowers. 
The bride's procession pa*ed up that and into the church
and up the middle aisle wider a succession of floral arches,
shedding forth brilliant beauty and exquisite fragrance,
and between rows of pews filled with splendidly arrayed
guests to the altar railings, behind which the chancel seemed
one garden of rare and beautiful exotic plants and flowers.

the side pews on the right hand of the altar?"  ',

"Why, mamma      "
"Because of her strangeness altogether. She had that
side pew against the wall all to herself in the crowded
church. She sat with her back to the window. She never
moved, and never took her eyes off Isoline Irvine."
"What was she like, mamma?"
"I cannot tell you-a tall, elegant woman, in deep
mourning, who sat with her back to the light and her veil
down, and never moved, and never took her eyes from Iso-
line Irvine. That is all I could see of her. When we left
the church we left her there."
"Some unhappy widow, I do suppose, mamma," said the
newly made Countess of Hawkewood, who now, seated in
her dreseingchair resigned herself into the hands of her
new French ma"i, Mademoiselle Millefleurs, who began
daintily to remove the bridal veil and wreath from the
beautiful head of her lady.
The subject was then dismissed, and the duchess and her
daughter talked of other matters.
This was no sad parting between the tenderly attached
mother and child; for, after the short bridal tour should be
over, the Earl and Countess of Hawkewood were to join
the family of the Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors at
Belle Isle Palaee until their own home, Hawke Lodge,
should be ready to receive them.
And whether in town or country, the mother and daugh-
ter were to reside near each other.
Mademoiselle Milefleurs was an artist in her profession,
and she took her thie in making her lady's traveling dress
as perfect in is way aS her bridal toilet had been.
The costume of theacotitee s was now a silver-gray poplin
suit, trimmed with chinchilla fur, and a chinchilla hat with
short, curled, gray mai*bot feathers, gray veil, gray gloves,
and gray parasol.
When the bride's secod toilet was complete, and she was
ready to go downstairs, e stopped to embrace her mother
and take leave of her theIr. Then they both descended the
stairs together.
All the wedding guests awaited the bride in the drawing-
room, whither she went to make her last adieux.

Cordial congratulations, hearty good wishes were 
there.
And, finally, the bride's brother, the Marquis oc
Isle, led her out into the hall, where she bade 
her father and mother, and to all the younger mem
the family who were assembled there to see her off.

March is not a pleasant month for travel in n
latitude, so the bridal pair went to Paris, took apa
at Lea Trois Freres, and settled down there to.spe

They entered into all the gayeties of the fa_
world, where la belle Anglaise-as the young countes
to be called-became the furor of the drawing-r
the clubs.
At the end of the conventional four weeks the
Countess of Hawkewood returned to London and
the guests of the Duke and Duchess of Grand
Belle Isle Palace.
It was now April, and the brilliant London 
near its height.
A drawing-room was to be held by the queen
ingham Palace.. 
The Duchess of Grand Manors waited for that
to present the Countess of. Hawkewood, on her
to the queen, as etiquette demanded, before gi
cepting any invitations in honor of the newly !
pair. 
She had not very long to wait.


 
<pb n="243"/>
THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                   *1
Early in the month the queen held the first drawing-
room of the season at Bnekingram palace. 
Then the most beautifi bride of the season was duly
presented by her mother to their sovereign.
There her beauty became the theme of every male tougue
and the envy of some female minds.
This was the inauguration of a series of splendid social
triumphs, such as have seldom been achieved by any one
reigning beauty.
"If Victoria were only of an age to be brought out now I
She is very like her sister, whose success would greatly facil-
itate'her own advantageous settlement," said the duchess,
referring to her second daughter, who was still in the
schoolroom; but she consoled herself with thinking that on
the next season the lovely Lady Victoria Belle Isle might
begin to win laurels of her own. 
The long and splendid season drew to a close near the
end of June.
Then the Duke and Duchess of Grand Manors and all
their family returned to Castle Belle Isle.
The Earl and Countess of Hawkewood went for a short
time to Scarborough, forthe sea bathing, and afterwards,
about the beginning of August, they made a visit to the
duke and duchesseat their castle.
Here   se"ie 'f dinners and dancing parties were given
in honor of the married pair.
Hawke Hall ehd been in the hands of architects, deco
orators, upholsteers, and landscape gardeners for the last
few months, and was now so much renovated and improved
that the old ted tiaor house seemed transfigured into a
white and shining fair palace, the brickwork of the build-
ing having been coved with white marble slabs, and all
the old casements and lattices transformed into modern
French windows, bow r'an  bay windows. All the decorar"
tions and furniture of 'lWe house had been renewed-the
priceless old tapestry and pictures restored. Nothing that
money, skill or taste couMd do toward making the place a.
perfect home had been   intted.
Yet the house was not quite ready for the reception of
its new lord and lady until the first of September, when
it was arranged that the noble pair should make a grand'

public entrance into the Hall, in accordance with a.
established custom of the Earls of Hawkewood.
The most sumptuous preparations were made for
pageant, which was to come off at noon on the first day
Strange and passing strange that no one remembered,
if they did, no one mentioned the fact that this day was
anniversary of the murder of the late Earl of Hawkew
It is probable that the day was first suggested by 
contractor for the work of renovation, who probably n
the time when that work would be completed, and with
reflecting upon the fact that the first of September m
henceforth be memorable as the date of a murder,
supposed that, being the initial day of the month, it wo
be the most appropriate for the public entrance of the 
and Countess of Hawkewood upon their estate.
The young earl must have remembered the tragic
versary, but probably had not the moral courage to opp
the arrangement, or to explain the grounds of his op
tion, for
"Conscience doth make cowards of us all."
The youthful countess also remembered that 
anniversary and shuddered at the thought that it sho
have been selected as the date of their home-going. B
she reflected,,if other people who knew the facts saw noth
strange, ominous, or objectionable in the arrangement,
was not for her to criticise it.
Not a word, therefore, passed between the young pair
the subject. Indeed, since all necessary discussion of
late earPs tragic and mysterious death had ceased with
investigations that were fruitlessly made at the time,
whole subject had been studiously avoided.
The preparations to celebrate the homecoming of
young married pair were completed.
Triumphal arches stood all along the principal'va
leading from the lodge gates through the park up to
Hall.
Flags flew from the tops of all four of the towers t
flankedthe main building.

day in honor of their lord's and lady's arrival at home.
A music stand was erecWe4 at a' convenient place; for the
country and village lads and lasses were to be indulgel in
their favorite pastime.
There was to be no entrtainment of the nobility and
gentry on this occasion, however.
The festival was to be entirely a domestic and feudal
one given to the dependents of the new earl in honor of
his bride's home-coming.
Early on the morning of the first of September the law
borers, villagers, and tenantry began to assemble and to look
forward impatiently for the arrival of their hereditary
lord and lady, which was to be the signal for the com-
mencement of their music, dancing, eating, and drinking.
The three cronies, Proddy, the little, gray, old cobbler,
Tree, the tall and swarthy tanner, and Penn, the little red-
haired locksmith, were standing together under one of the
grand arches, looking up the avenue for the approach of
the carriage.
"Ah, sonnies 1" said the old man. "It's all very brave
and fine, and noa doobt the beef and beer will be of the
best, and well all have full and plenty to enj'y ourselves;
-but for all that, Dsnnies, it do mind ns of this day last

"I wonder, I don" aqueaked Penn, in a piping little voice,
"why the noble quality should chose sich a day for the
crowniation, anyhow.'.
"Look yer," said the cobbler-"yer not to kittercise the
condict of the roy' nobility. They know what they do-
ay, they know, and it is not for niggerramusses like us to
kittercise 'em."   - 
"Of course, you, are a comprehensive man, Mr. Proddy,
and looked up to by us all; and no doubt you are right, but
we must thenk our thoughts all the same," put in Tree,
in behalf of Penn.

both sides by lines of gayly dressedemen, women, 
dren, and presented a variegated and lovely mosaic

the bridal'train.
Every hat vas instantly doffed and every eye was turned
down the drive in eager expectancy.
First came two mounted groomns-one in the black-and-
red livery of "Hawkewood, the other in the blue-and-white
livery of Belle Isle. They rode in advance of the bridal
train to clear the way, and, finding it clear, rode on toward

CHAPTER XXIV
IN THE OORBRIDOR.
THm carriages came in sight-the open barouche drawn
by four cream-colored horses, and containing the Earl and
Countess of Iawkewpod, was in advance; the bridegroom
wore the faultless morning dress of the period-dark-gray
frock coat and pantaloons; dark-gray felt hat; lighter gray
gloves and cravat. The bride wore a suit of silver-gray,
brocaded silk, with a silver fox fur jacket and hat; gloves,
veil, and parasol to match.
The earl and countess bowed and smiled, and continued
to bow and smile, in response to the ringing hurrahs that
greeted and followed .'em as they passed.
After them, in another open barouche drawn by a fine
pair of black horses, came the Duke and Duchess of Grand
Manors, and the Marquis of Belle Isle, and the Lady Vic-
toria Belle Isle..
The carriages passed up the avenue out of sight of the
people, 4nd halted before the grand entrance of the Hall,
where the servants under the butler and housekeeper were
drawn up in array to welcome their lord and lady, which
they did in a much quieter way that the villagers and ten-
ants had done, by respectful bows and deep courtesies, and
universal smiles.

coiusly forward to wait on her new lady.
"How do you do, Mrs Curran?" kindly inquired
countess of the smiling and courtesying woman.
"In the best of health, thank you, my lady. An
need not fear for your ladyship's good health, you are
blooming, my lady. May I show your ladyship to Y

As they gained the landing the earl opened his

"Where is your dressing-room, Lewis?" inquired the
countess, irrelevantly, but father suggestively.
"Here, next yours, and I am going in now," answered
the earl, taking the hint and passing into his apartment,
The countess entered her own chamber, where the French
maid stood in the midst of an archipelago' of trunks and
an avalanche of finery.
"Oh, dear why is not all this litter cleared away ?" in-
quired the countess, looking around in despair of finding a
vacant chair on which tioseat herself.
"Eef you please, meeladee, I have been travailant all day
with these toilets, with deacu femmes des chambres to as-
seest me," said the woman, apologetically, as she cleared
the dressing-chairs before the toilet table, for her lady's
accommodation. 
"Come and take off my hat and jacket, and do my hair
over," ,id the countess, as she seated herself before the
glass.
"Weel you shange your dress, meeladee?" inquired the
girl.
"No; not until evening. There, that is the lunch bell,"
said the countess, rising as soon as her hair had been
arranged.
"This leetle tea rose on the right side, meeladee," sug-
gested the maid, taking the creamy bloom from a bouquet
on the table.
"Well, put it in. And try to have all this rubbish taken
away before I come up here to dress for dinner," said the
countess, as she again submitted her head to the artistic
fingers of the .Fr   girl
"I weel do so, i'eeadee," replied Mademoiselle Mille-
fleurs, as she fixed the fragrant, creamy tea rose in dark-
brown tendrils of her lidy'S hair and turned her own head
aside to look at the effect with the eye of a connoisseur.
The countess then glaed at the mirror and turned and
left the room to go down to lunch.
A very dainty repast was elegantly served in the room
that was known as the cabiaet parlor-an octagon room,
with its eight sides alternately occupied by windows and
full-length portraits, all ommounted with lambrequins of
crimson satin and gold.

248    THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT
Only six persons at down to lunch-the Dke
Duchess of Grand Manors, the Earl and Countess
Hawkevood, the Marquis of Belle Isle, and the Lady
toria Belle Isle.
It was not the gay party that it should have been on
occasion of a bride's coming home.
The deep shadow of that awful tragedy which had 
enacted in this very house only a year ago, and of w
this very day was the first anniversary, darkened every
and quieted every tongue. No one ventured to spe 
it, though they could think of nothing else.
When lunch was over the whole party walked out
the park to witness, and some of them to take part in,
pastime of the villagers and country people.
It was a "gay and festive" scene. The white tents
orated with bright-colored flags, and the many tables
ered with white cloths, made a pleasant contrast to the
green grass of the ground under foot and the heavy
foliage of the trees overhead, while the groups of
dressed men, women,.and children gave variety to the
eral aspect.
Around the tables under the trees, or within the
the elders of the assembly were still gathered, eating
drinking; in the open spaces the young men and w
were dancing to the music of the fiddle and the bagpi
The party from the house walked among them all
kind words and smiles for everyone with whom they 
in immediate oontact. 
The most threatening part of the program was not
ried out, however. No woman insisted on her prero
of waltzing with her young lord. No man had the au
to claim his privilege on this occasion of dancing wi
countess.
In fact, this old feudal custom, never in good tf
the oldest of times, was now falling into disuse.
The tenantry and laborers had certainly never beeni

ing his birthnight ball, just one year ago, and ceased to
draw evil prognostics from the fact that this fete in honor
of the bride's home;coming should be held on this sad
anniversary.
The people thought of nothing but enjoyment.
The Earl and. Countess of Hawkewood and their party
remained walking about among the merry-makers until
sunset, when they reentered the house to dress for dinner.
The tenantry and laborers outside continued to eat, drink,
dance, and make love, acording to their age, sex, and con-
dition, until it was too dark to do anything but sit down
and talk while waiting for the fireworks to begin.
As soon as tiq Earl and Countess of Hawkewood and
their friends had risen from dinner and come out upon the
front balcony over the principal entrance of the Hall, there
came another shout of welcome from the crowd seated in
the grounds outside.
Then the signal for the fireworks was given, and the first
rocket went up, a flaming messenger, into the murky, black
sky, lighting up all the clouds above and the park below,
and drawing .frm the spectators exclamations of admira-
tion and delith.
And if sue~ was the effect of the first rocket what, what
was that of its Isucessors?
Every succeeding "flaming minister," whether rose,
rocket, wheel, urisl or comet, was more startling, dazzling,
and wonderful thi' its predecessor, and elicited wilder
shouts of astonis'm]  t and rapture.
The exhibition'lated two hours, and was concluded by
the throwing up of a  blazing rocket that resolved itself
into a magnificent meteor that shone like the sun at mid-
day above the Hall, and contained in burning characters
the monogram of the erl. and countess surmounted by a
coronet, and the whole enornled by a motto: "Happiness
to All."               :
This was greeted by deafening acclamations of amaze-
ment and ecstasy by the multitude, who seemed as if they
never could cease applauding.
But presently the young Earl of Hawkewood stood up
i the balcony beneath that blazing, sunlike meteor, to speak
to his people.

grandmother, the Lady Berenice Hawke, had been the

that he was really no alien who had come among them,;

the memory of that tragedy which had occurred just one
year ago in this house and of which this day was the first
anniversary.
She thought of that night-walk she had been led to take,
and of how she had lost her way and strayed into the
bachelors' corridor, and of the man she had seen there steal-
ing away from the room in, which the earl, a few hburs
later, was found murdered.
She had no doubt in her own mind that the man she
had seen was the real murderer.
Should she know him again, she asked herself-should
she know him again if she should meet him in the world?
She could not tel, even though now she seemed to see
his formo and face. as she had dimly seen it then-the rich
crimson silk dressing-gown reaching down to his heels, the
black velvet fez cap with its long golden tassel; the white,
spectral, horrified face, seen dimly in the moonlight that
streamed through the oriel window at the end of the cor-
ridor and struck upon it.
The memory made her shudder and feel sick.    She
dreaded to stay alone. She wondered why the earl did
not come to her room on this night of all nights, on which
he had brought her hdOi. .
She wondered if he were in his smoking-den at the rear of
this hall.
She would not ring for a servant at this late hour of the
night, but she resolved to go and see for herself.
She arose and went out into the hall. The moon, which
had just risen, was Bsining through a bow window in the
rear.
Everything was still and silent, as all should be in a
well-ordered household in the dead of night.
She passed down between rows of closed doors until she
reached the archway of the passage leading to the smoking-
room. She entered this and groped her way along to the
rear, watching for some glimmer of light through crevice
or keyhole.
She reached the door of the smoking-room and knocked.
No one answered.
She tried the handle of the lock, but it was fastened.

his face, revealing all its features distinctly.
The young countess, her eyes dilating with
and extreme horror, gave one long, maddened stare,.

swoon.
She had seen again the man whom, one year ago

that rang through the house, fell down in a deep swoon at
his feet.
When Lady Volante opened her eyes again she was lying
on the bed in her own chamber, with the duke and duchess,
the earl; the village doctor, and the lady's maid anxiously
grouped around her.
"Her ladyship will do very well now," whispered Dr.
Ellis to Lord Hawkewood. "Bqt what occasioned this deep
swoon ?"      -
"Heaven knows I" returned the earl, in the same low'
tone. "I met her half an hour ago in the passage leading
to the smoking-room, and was about to speak to her, when
she started, stared at me with an afrighted look and
piercing scream, and fell to the floor."
"Took your lordship for a ghost, perhaps. But she is
quite conscious now-'I hoje your ladyship is much bet-
ter," said the doctor, turning to his patient.
The young countess started at the questioner without
making any reply.;
"How are you, dear love?" inquired the earl, pushing
his way between the doctor and the duchess, and bending
over his wife until the black velvet ekull cap and gold
tassel were within a few inches of her face.
A look of horror and detestation came into that face!
She averted it quickly and put up both hands in depreca-
tion.
"Will you not speak to me, dear love? What was it that
frightened youI" persisted the earl, taking one of her
hands.
She snatched it fromihiim, while a violent shudder shook
her frame as she tuned herself toward the wall.
"Dear love, dear love, what is this?" persevered the earl,
bending farther over her.
With a low cry of terror and abhorrence, she Shrank and
rolled away to the wall, and turned and buried her face
in the pillows.
"Come away,.my lord. Your presence disturbs her lady-
ship," whispered the doctor. 
"But-good Heaven i-why?" demanded the earl, as he
unwillingly withdrew from the bedside.
"Ah I" replied the doctor, with a smile. "One of the

"He stepped out with the doctor. Shall I call him?"
inquired the duchess, rising and stretching, her hand to-
ward the bell.
"No! No     No " exclaimed her daughter, starting up
in an excess of excitement, and seizing her mother's arm
to arrest her movement.
The elder lady desisted, and sat down much perplexed.

The duchess looked at her daughter in alarm. That the
countess had been suddenly smitten with some fearful fever
that affected her brain was the mildest theory she could
form of the case.
"My dear, dear child, do not talk so wildly. Try to
compose yoiurelf, Volante," she said, laying her cool, soft
hand upon the flushed forehead of the young lady. 
But the countess seized that hand in both hers, and
clung teo -t while sh fixed her frantic eyes on her mother's,
and exelaimed:

her mother could prevent her and beginning to walk the
floor with quick, irregular steps.
The duchess seized the bell and rang it violently, and
then rushed to the side of her daughter just in time to
catch her in her arms and prevent her from falling to the
floor.

"No% your grace. She is as well as can be expected and

"A burglar, you were about to say. Well, she might
have done so, yet that would scarcely account for an ex-

fever. I believe, on the contrary, that if Volante had met
a real burglar, she would have been more indignant than
frightened; she would have given the alarm, not have fallen
into a swoon," said the duchess.

account that her ladyship's present delicate situation modi-

This converqson had been carried on in a very low tone
by the two watchers, so as not to disturb the restless sleeper.
Now, however, the deep moans of the patient drew the
duchess and the doctor silently to the bedside.
The countess was moaning and muttering in low de-

The duchess bent to hear her words, and shrank back

He was received by the duke, who briefly gave him an

The duchess gravely welcomed him, and gave him a brief
history of the case as she led him to the bedside of her

The village doctor, Dr. Ellis, was still seated at the bed-

London physician made his weekly visits.
For many days the countess lay unconscious of all
around her.
At length the hour came when she recovered her con-
sciousness and cast feeble but intelligent glances around her.
Ier rejoicing mother bent over her right side and kissed
her softly.
Her husband bowed over her left side and would have

a wild though half-suppressed cry, covered her eyes with
Ler thin hands, and shook with agitation from head to foot.

is past  The countess will recover. But, my dear lord,
her ladyship must not be subjected to any agitation such
as she suffered this morning. We must be patient, my dear
lord! Wemust be patient."
"What is the cause of the sudden aversion the countess
has taken to me-her husband P I have given her no cause
of offense, as Heaven knowas  What, then, can be the
reason ?" inquired the ear, as he took the arm of the doctor
and they walked up and down the hall.
"Her ladyship's condition, my dear lord, as I hinted be-
fore. It not unfrequently happens so. Why, there was the
Princess-~    But I must not betray professional secrets,
you know. It is enough to say that I have met several
such cases in the course of my practice. Whim, fantasy,
caprice, we might almost call it, but I say it is the con-
dition."
They had now reached the head of the stairs, and the
court physician, turning said:
"Good-day, my lord. I have to catch my train, You
know."
But tie earl went downstairs with the doctor, where
the butler met them and solemnly marshaled them into the
elegant little d-iing-room, where a dainty luncheon was
laid, and where the court physician-as on former occ.-
sions-forgot his hurry in the enjoyment of the luxuries set
before him.
On this occasionthe earl sat down and joined the doctor.
But there was lo more talk on medical or other di.
turbing topic-the experienced physician respected his dL
gestion too much for that sort of conversation at table.
When the lunch was over, Sir James Meriot took a seconi
leave of the earl, entered his carriage and drove off to the 
station.
The earl walked about the house disconsolately. He
only half believed the dotos theory of his wife's aversion.
After a little while be retraced his steps and went'up
to the bedroom door and rappedi.
The duchess opened the door, came out to him, and
closed it after her.
"How is Volante now ?" he inquired in a low voice.

"It is a confounded shame, I think, that a wife

sort of boyish ill temper.

implicated in this illness. You must give the poor

"Yes, certainly," replied the duchess vaguely,

There they parted.

stroll through the park, wondering who was right

antipathy to him.
Meanwhile the duchess returned to the sick r
and bolted the door, and went and seated her
bedside of her daughter.
Lady Hawkewood was lying quietly on her 
her head upon her dainty, laced pillow, her t

folded over her bosom, her eyes closed, and her whole form
composed, like one from which the soul had fled-like one
prepared for the tomb. The rich rose-colored silk and lace-
covered counterpanes that lay over her, the rich white lace
and rose silk-lined curtains that fell around the bedstead,
all lent a delicate bloom to the white face and hands that
they did not otherwise possess.
As the duchess saak into the easy-chair beside the bed
the patient opened her dark eyes and whispered:
"Mamma."
"Yes, dearest."
"Who was that at the door ?"
"Your husband, love, anxiously inquiring for you," ven-
tured the duchess, who was sorry the next moment that
she had done so, for the calm form on the bed shuddered,
and the calm voice trembled as the countess replied:
"Oh, I wish he would not  I wish he would not  Oh,
mamma! never call him my husband againl He is no
husband of mine I There can be nothing between us hence-
forth and forever more I"
"My dearest Volante " exclaimed the duchess, in amaze-
ment and distress, for she certainly thought that the lady's
sudden abhorrence of her leige lord was something greater
than could be accounted for by her "condition."
"Mamma!" said the countess, in an excess of nervous
excitement that  as only partly controlled by the sedative
she had taken.-"Mamma the last thing I remember up
to the time of my illness was my imploring you to take me
away from this demon house and carry me home. And you
promised to do it at once. But you did not. Why did you
not?"
"You were too ill to be moved, Volante. You had to be
put to bed, dearest. And now you are'still too ill to talk.
Compose yourself, my love."
"Mamma, I may refrain from talking, but I cannot re.
frain from thinking-from feeling. It is a relief to talk."
The duchess made no reply.. She thought that if she
herself should speak no more than was strictly necessary,
the conversation would flag and her capricious daughter
subside into silence. , She was mistaken, of course.
Lady Hawkewood suddenly looked up and said:

"I cannot live with him again, mammal I cannot

"Volantel Volante!" cried the duchess, who was
much the more excited of the two.

"Oh, Volante! What is the reason of this sudden,!
hatred you have conceived for Hawkewood?" d
the duchess, in extremity of distress.
The countess did not reply. She was gazing do
her own wan, white fingers as she idly twined and un
them.
A sudden light seemed to break on the duchess'!
She thought she had discovered that the most 
cause of estrangement between husband and wife-j
-was at the root of Lady Hawkewood's deep offe
with a smile she inquired:
"Has he given you any cause for doubting his i
my love ?"

"Oh, I understand. You think I am jealous;

THE TRAIL OP THE SERPENT                 269
"Then you are not jealous of him?" inquired the duchess,
again disturbed in her mind.
The young countess .curled her lovely lip with gentle dis-
dain as she answered contemptuously:
"If my mother had not asked that question I should say
it was a very silly one."
"Then if he has given you no cause to doubt his fidelity
to you, what has been the nature of Lord Hawkewood's
offense ?" demanded the elder lady.
The younger one put her hands over her eyes and shiv-
ered.
"For Heaven's sake tell me what Hawkewood has done
to forfeit your affection? What great crime has he com-
mitted?" demanded the duchess, not dreaming that there
could be any question of crime in the ease, but merely using
the words as a formula of gentle sarcasm.
But the effect on Lady Hawkewood was startling.
She sprang up on her pillow, and, leaning on her elbow,
gazed at her mother with great, dilating, dark eyes and
pallid cheeks, while, with ashen lips, she muttered:
"Who said he had committed a crime? I did notl I
never said sol Never neverl never !"
"My beloved child, I did not mean to speak so strongly.
I should have said indiscretion, misdemeanor, rather than
-crime," replied the duchess.
"I will never tell   I will never, never telll" exclaimed
the countess, dropping back exhausted upon her pillow,
where she lay trembling and gasping for breath.
The duchess, beside herself with alarm and confusion,
went and poured out a dose of the sedative the doctor had
left, and came and raised her daughter's head and placed
the medicine to her lips
Lady Hawkewood drank it obediently and became more
composed.
The duchess did not. dare to venture any other remark,
for fear of provoking an exciting discussion that might be
pernicious or even fatal to her daughter.
But Chat lady herself resumed the conversation, though
. a calmer tone; for the sedative had partly subdued her
 tcitement.

"Then, mamma, listen to me. Bend down your ear to

The duchess did as she requested.

self, at once and forever, from the felon who dares to call

"VoLAT.! Heaven of heavens, Volantel" exclaimed
the duchess, beside herself with amazement.
"I do not overstate the case, mamma," replied the young
bride, with bitter calmness.
"But do you know what you say?"
"I say that I have made a discovery whih renders it a
solemn duty to separate myself at once and forever from
that felmo who daes to call himself the Earl of Hawkewood

"Oh, Volante, your mind must have been deranged from

ings " shuddered the duchess.
"IMy mind may be deranged. But that does not alter
the fact that I have had enough to derange it. My mind
may have been deranged by my late illness, but what caused
that- illness, if not the discovery I made?" sadly inquired
the young lady.
"What was that discovery, Volante ?" earnestly demanded
the duchess.
"Oh, mamma, I cannot tell you ! I can never, never tell
you! Do not ask me, dear mamma. Get my father to
speak to that man about a permanent separation. I do not
want the income he settled on me I I would not touch a
penny of that money if I were starving! I want it all re-

back to the bedside, poured out a composing draug
a bottle that stood on the stand near the head of tl

and offered it to her daughter, whispering:

THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT                  278
"Drink this, my love, and leave all your  airs In my
hands. I will see to them."
Volante obediently emptied the cup and returned it to
her mother.
"Now lie down and shut your eyes, and try to go to
sleep."
"Will you first call Greylock to sit beside me, while you
go and talk to my father about getting me away from here,
and, if necessary, talk to-that felon also, for I will leave
him, if to do so I may have to leave this world l" cried the
countess vehemently.
"Oh, my love, do not talk so madly. Of course, you
shall do as you please. You are no man's slave. Your
father and myself will see that you have your will. Be
quiet now, dear. The quieter you are the sooner you will
recover, and be able to return with us to Belle Isle. Let
that consideration influence you," said the troubled duchess.
Apparently "that consideration," together with the ac-
tion of the dru, did "influence" the agitated invalid.
She turned her face to the wall and composed herself as
if for sleep.
The duchess rang for her maid.
The woman soon came and rapped softly in response.
The duchess arose, opened the door and admitted her,
saying:
"I wish you to lock this door after me and admit no one
at all, except mi elff, or the doctor."
"Certainly, your grace.   And if my lord     should
come ---" began Mrs. Greylock.
"If Lord Hawkewood should come, you are to tell him
. that her ladyship is sleeping under the influence of an
opiate, and the orders are that she must not be disturbed."
"Yes, your grace."
"When you have locked the door after me, seat your-
self beside Lady Hawkewood and watch her carefully until
my return."
"Yes, your grace."
The duchess then passed out of the sick room, and in
walking down the hall came face to face with Dr. Ellis,
who had just arrived.

"A discovery! Of what nature, if I may be permitted
to ask, your grace ?"
"She will not tell me I She declares in the most positive
manner that she will die before she will tell, and that she
will die sooner than continue to live with Lord Hawke-

"Oh    Ah   Ah 1" muttered the doctor to himself, as if
to say that he saw it all now. 
"Speak out, if you please. What do you think of all
this ?" somewhat impatiently demanded her grace.
"May I do so without offense, my dear duchess?" cour-
teously demanded the doctor.
"Most certainly you may. It is just what I wish you
to do. Just why I brought you here. I want your opin-
ion," said the lady firmly.
"Then, your grace, I fear that our beautiful countess may
be-let us say-morbidly jealous! Not an unusual state in
young wives."
"No, doctorl You are mistaken. That was also my
first suspicion, and I taxed her with it; but she laughed the
thought to bitter scorn. Whatever her discovery might
have been, it was not of a nature to make her jealous."
"My dear duchess, jealousy is one of the last foibles
that a young lady would willingly acknowledge! Depend
upon it, the mysterious discovery is simply this: that our
lovely countes, in her walk through the bachelors' corridor
that night, came suddenly upon his lordship amusing him-
self with talking onsense to one of the housemaids I And
with the sensitiveness inseparable from her delicate condi-
tion she mentally exaggerated the circumstance to such an
extent as to make herif ill I Depend upon it, that is the
explanation of her ladyship's conduct, my dear duchess,"
said the doctor.
"I do not think so; but since you have no other thety
to advance, I must proceed to ask your assistance in what
I am forced against my better judgment to do."'
"Your grace may command me in all things," said the
'doctor, with a bow.

"You refer to her ladyship's sudden and unaccountable
aversion to my presence," added the earl, helping the doctor.
"I do, my lord. Yet to a medical eye there is nothing 
very strange or at all unaccountable in the affair. The state
of her ladyship's nervous system explains all to a profes-
sional mind," said the doctor soothingly, for he really
pitied the distress of the young nobleman.
"You think, then, that this sudden and singular antip-
athy is attributable to her ladyship's state of health, and
not to any imaginary cause of offense with me?" inquired
his lordship.
"I certainly think her aversion due to her excessive
nervous irritability, and to nothing else. But, my lord, it
becomes my duty as Lady Hawkewood's medical attendant
to warn you that her wishes on this subject should be in-
dulged and not thwarted," said Dr. Ellis.
"But, my dear sir, the countess cannot endure the sight
of me."
"Then, my dear lord, be patient and forbearing with her
ladyship for a while and refrain from intruding into her
presence," suggested the doctor.
"But she has even expressed a desire to leave my house
and to go to the home of her parents," complained the 
young husband.
"Be magnanimous, my lord. Accede to that desire. It
will soon pass away, and my lady will be glad enough to
return."
The earl arose frwn his seat and walked up and down
the floor uneasily. Then he paused before the physician,
and earnestly said:
"Ellis, I speak to you not only as our medical attendant,
but also as our old and tried friend, when I ask you: Do
you really believe as you say in regard to the merely
physically origin of my lady's strange antipathy, or may
there be a graver cause?" 
"I believe as I say. There is no cause deeper than that
which exists in her ladyship's state of health, as every medi-
cal man might easily understand."
"And you think this intipathy will pass away?"

"Then, my dear doctor, give your own professional

"I heard his lordship say, as I left him, that he was going
to church," replied the latter.
"Ahl yes," remarked the duchess. "I must say that
Hawkewood, for so young a man, is remarkably attentive
to his religious duties-going to every week-day service as
well as to the Sabbath worship."
The young countess curled her lips, and murmured in-
distinctly.
"What did you say, my love?" inquired the elder lady,
bending over her.
"I said there must be some truth in the old proverb,
that 'the greater the sinner the greater the saint,'" replied
Volante.
"Oh ! my love, my love, do not say such dreadful things
in reference to your husband," whispered her mother.
"Mamma, he is not my husband! If you call him so you
will drive me mad. I cannot recall or alter what is past;
but for the future he is nothing to me," said Volante, with
desperate earnestness.
The duchess and the doctor looked at each other in de-
spair.
Then the eyes of the former seemed to ask the question:
"What can be done in such a case?"
And those of the latter to answer:
"Nothing, Do not force the unwelcome subject upon

very serious mistake to have brought her here at all,"
duchess explained.
"We shall certainly be very happy to have our dau

The duke left his seat and, frowning, walked 
and down the floor. He was full of surprise

pointment at this early separation of the young pair, which
seemed ominous of evil.
"I will not have it so l" he said at length, returning to
his seat. &I will not have the whole country set to gos-
siping about my family. Volante must remain here with
her husband, or else Hawkewood must go to Belle Isle with
his wife."
"This forced association will kill heri" groaned the
duchess.           -
"There need be no forced association-no association of
any kind between them. Hawkewood must accompany
Volante to Belle Isle, if she is to go thither. But if our
daughter's mind is in such a morbid condition that she
cannot endure the presence of her husband, and if her
medical ettndant declares that she must be humored, why,
we can see that she is humored. You can easily take Vo-
lante in your carriage and Hawkewood and myself can fol-
low on horseback. She need not even know, while her
caprice lasts, that the earl is in the castle. But he must go,
if she goes,' Birmly concluded the duke.
"I am sure that you are quite right," readily conceded
the duchess. '"Ad I know that Hawkewood will agree
with you; but we muit really keep the fact of his accom-
panying us to Belle Isle and his presence in the castle a
secret from Volante uitil she recovers. There is the din-
ner bell, aid I Im not dressed," added her grace, as she
hastily left the library to repair to her own apartments to
make her evenig toilet.
All was arrange   as had been agreed upon between the
duke and the ducels.
The Earl of Hawkewood, with every appearance of sat-
isfaction, acceded td the plan of accompanying his countess
to Castle Belle Isle, and to having the fact of his presence
there withheld from her knowledge.
The young countess on her part received' the news of
her approaching departure with unconcealed pleasure.
But when the subject of packing came to be discussed
she startled her mother by saying:
"Have all my wedding outfit that came from my own
family and friends packed up and sent off. But do not
put the smallest trife given me by the earl, nor the least

mamma, that I intend to return everything he ever

turn to Hawkewood Hall, as this departure is merel
prelude to a permanent separation."
The duchess sighed deeply. She would have argued 
her daughter on the unreasonableness of her conduct,
she did not dare to do so lest she would excite the in
to hysteria or convulsions.
The good duchess had a difficult duty to do between.:
daughter and her husband and her son-in-law.
As soon as Lady Hawkewood was able to bear the j
she was wrapped up and placed in the comfortable a
with her mother, and so conveyed to the ferryboat,;

bear any more excitement for one day than the jo
self from Hawkewood to Belle Isle afforded.
So they allowed her to pass unnoticed to her
apartments, and consoled themselves by giving a
welcome to their father and their brother-in-law,
rived in the castle half an hour later. 
As soon as Lady Hawkewood reached her own r

and dependents as 'my lady.' And no visitors'o others
will be permitted to intrude upon you."
"I thank you, dear mamma. Now I can rest easy," said
the countess, with another deep inspiration, as she clasped
her hands above her head and stretched out her feet at
ease.
But she did not remain so many minutes. The eager,
restless spirit impelled het to turn and ask:
"Mamma, have yod spoken to my father about taking
the proper steps toward a separation of myself from-that
man ?" 
"No, my dear lore, hot yet; I--" began the dismayed
duchess; but het daughter, with irritable impatience, in-
terrupted her woids.
"If you have not yet done so, mamma, when will you do
it? Or shall I speak to papa on the subject ?"
"Oh, my dear thild, no. It would be inadvisable for
you to move in this matter. Leave it all to me. I will
speak to your papa.in X  od time. Promise me, Volante,
that you will nit brathe this matter to the duke."
"I will promise, dear mamma, on condition that you
undertake the task yourself.  Of course, I would much
rather that you should speak to papa on he subject, than
that I should have to do it."
"Quite so, my love; Leave the affair in my hands,"
replied the duchess, in a non-committal manner that was
not, however, perceived by Volante.
The duchess ias very uneasy. She dreaded above all
things that this subJect of separation should be started be-
tween the duke and his daughter. She knew that the duke
would not for a single instant tolerate the idea of such
a public impropriety as the separation of the Earl and
Countess of Hawkewoo. And she also kne* that his op-
position to this meaSure would seriously injure the health
and endanger the life of her daughter.
All that was possible she would do to prevent an inter-
view between the father aid child on this dreaded subject.
She had already gained the pledge of Volante not to
broach it to the duke.
Later in the day she took occasion to say to his grace:
"I wish you to promise me not even to name the Earl

tured to hint that she could, under any circumstances, be
brought to rejoice in the illness and death of any fellow
creature; yet assuredly she could not regret the event that
took Lord Hawkewood from Castle Belle Isle at this cr1is.
As soon as his lordship had departed she again warned
her husband and her household not to allude to the earl's
existence in the pereence of the countess, and then she be-
gan to decoy the nervous invalid from the seclusion of her
sick chamber to lunch with the family, and to roll in a
wheeled garden hair .through the beautiful grounds imme-
diately around tie  tle.
No one dared 'to speak to Volante of her husband. She
had never qpoken of him to anyone but to her mother. She
had not the least suspicion that he had been at the castle.
One morning, while she was seated in her garden chair
under the shade of a great oak tree on the lawn, attended
by her mother and siste, she sent them all away, retaining
only her mother near her, to whom she said:  ,
"Mamma, I have been here now nearly a month. I have
not lately spokeni to  on on the hateful subject, thinking
that if you had any ery definite news to tell me you would
impart it voluntarily. But you have been silent on this
matter. Tell me now, however, what steps have been taken
toward this legl separation between that man and myslef."
The poor duchessgroaned at her daughter's persistence,
and answered wearfly:
"No steps have been taken as yet, my love. No steps were
possible to be takten  Nothing has been done. Nothing
could be done."
The countess turned and fixed her eyes upon those of
her mother for a full minute; and then inquired:
"Are you trifling with me, mamma? Are you all ply-
ing with me? I will nt bear it I I will not  If you do
not act, I must. It would'be a crime for me to live with
Lord Hawkewood again "
"Oh, my beloved child, have patience  You need not
live with the earl, if you do not wish to do so. But for
us to take any measures toward your legal separation just
at this time would be a public scandal. The earl is absent

The announcement seemed to surprise and q

month, a blank envelope containing a Bank of England
note for one hundred pounds. They began to come about
three months previous to this date. She had now, there-
fore, received three, without a single word accompanying
either of them to give a hint as to whom they came from,
or why they were sent, or how long they would be continued.
She had shown the first one to the duchess, and in much
surprise and perplexity asked her opinion and counsel; but
that grand dame, after having inspected the note, the en-
velope, the superscription, and the postmark, and learned
nothing but that a hundred-pound Bank of England note
had been sent from London in a blank envelope, directed in
a bold, legal hand to Isoline Irvine, and having criticised
the carelessness of persons in sending so considerable a sum
of money in an unregistered letter, took the whole matter
to the duke and submttea the mystery to his Ihasculine wis-
dom for solution.
The duke suspected a bad practical joke with a good
counterfeit note, and in his turn subjected the paper to the
inspection of the Hawkeville banker, who at once pro-
nounced it genuine-a "true bill."
Isoline had never possessed a quarter of such a sum in
her life, except on the occasion of the sale of her mother's
household furniture. Now she was very much "embar-
rassed" with her "riches."
She, however, followed the duke's advice and deposited
the whole sum in the Rawkeville Bank, thereby opening
an account withthat trustworthy institution.
But when, eo the first of October, another hundred-
pound note came in the same mysterious manner and was
found to be genuiie, the great curiosity of the duchess
would have set London dete6tives at work to discover the
sender; but the duke put a stop to that transaction.
"Let the poor girl take the goods the gods provide and
be thankful, but ask no questions, lest the inquiries shoild
stop the supplies, which would be a very great pity, for
her sake, for if they should continue to come, she will soon
lay by a little ideendependece," he said.
The duchess agreed with the justice of his views; the
notes continued to come and to be deposited in the lboal
bank, and the mystery remained unsolved.

and flying into the hall and up the staircase.
Volante came next, at full peed.
The duke seized her arm ana caught her in turn.
"Volante I What does all this mean?" he inquired, more
anxiously than before.
"Oh, papa, dear, somieting has frightened Isoline almost
out of her senses 1" replied his daughter, passing her hand
through his arm and turning with him to enter the hall.
"What could have frightened her in our quiet grounds?"
questioned the duke.
"She says it was some one lurking in the shrubbery."
"Rubbish   Did you see or hear anyone?" 
"No, I did not, papa."
"And there was no one there. A bird rustled in the trees

Mrs. Carraway came promptly.

repeated in agtatd tones the story of the apparition she
had seen in the pk.
The countess frend   and turned away. She felt an-    '

Greylock. It was kot the habit of her house to gossip with
domestics.
"The woman will pread the story all through the neigh-
borhood," she said tohtihelf, as she mentally wondered at
what she termed "Miss frvine's want of dignity."
But poor Isoline, brought up in her mother's small house-
hold at Stony Fells, and accustomed to talk freely to the
two simple, faithful women who were their only servants,
saw no harm in opening her heart to the lady's maid.

What was it? Nothing serious, I am led to believe," said
the duchess.
"Ohl no, mamma, dear, nothing at all," replied the
countess, who dropped into a corner of the sofa and gave
the story of the adventure from her point of view.
"One of the maids, probably. It must not be permitted,"
said the duchess, coming to the same conclusion that had
first been reached by Mrs. Greylock.
An hour later the family circle separated to retire to bed.
The countess, true to her word, looked into her friend's
chamber, and finding the latter sleeping well, she dismissed
the maid, and then withdrew to her own apartment.
Visions that,appall at night often afford subjects of
amusement by 4ay. But morning brought no modification
of Isoline' faith in the reality of the apparition she had

She arose refreshed from her deep and dreamless sleep,
and she joined the fta'ily circle at breakfast looking in her
usual health.
The duke and ducbess attempted to jest with her on the
terrors of the previous night.
But wbh   the sebject was mentoined she grew very pale,
and laid down her fork. After a silence of a few seconds
she said, in the most solemn manner:
"It wras s   iusion. As I live, I saw my mother's face

me-it only we. wse; for heretofore I have only believed in
the life afteir a'now I know it, since I have seen my
dead mother's liwi.g face. I do not expect you to believe,
me, however."
This ended a .wnent on the subject. Reason pre-
cluded the possilb    of agreeing with the speaker, and
politeness prevented Isr hearers from contradicting her.
And, indeed, other p^'ect  o soon came upon the tapia.
Breakfast at Castle Belle Isle was usually a lounging,
lingering, informal me, during which the members of the
family dropped in at intervals, and the mail bag was
brought, and letters and.ewspapers were glanced over.
The duke, with the Times open before him, looked over
the foreign news while he sipped his coffee or nibbled his
toast.

"Not at all; but something that may save him from

decided, by the press at least, that the clause respeting te
marriage only restrained the legatee during the life of the
testator, but not afterward."
"I had not seen those qomments, sighed the duchess
"And you may be sure that this intended marriage be-
tween the aged and impovrished Viscount Seyres and the
middle-aged heiress of Zavieski, is one of pure barter-
wealth for title. Thi being so, I think the old bankrupt
has too long a head to make a mistake as to the inheritance.

a favorable opiioni before his lordship proposed to the

She concealed her money in cunning hiding-places, bUt:

was afraid to take it abroad with her lest some one shouid

She distrusted everyone, even her most intimate friends
and associate--though it is true she had but little reason
to think well of these last-mentioned worthies.

She determined to exercise this spell upon Las:o Pali,
and :draw the girl from her safe home at Hawkewood Hafl
to the Ruined Tower, and throw her into a trance, to disa
cover, through her clairvoyant faculties, the whereabouts
of what might remain of the late Earl of Hawkewood's ma-
terial form.
But to do this successfully it was absolutely necessary
that she should hare something that was magnetically re-
lated to the eirl.a piece of his clothing, a lock of his hair'
-something tlbt he had handled or worn.
Then the fat' flashed upon her memory that Jemmy
Babb, the eoeric village barber, had a museum of human
hair, in which he kept specimens of all the heads upon which
he had ever operated.
laior declared that "Uncle Jemmy," as he was popu-
larly. caed, had hair enough to stuff a mattress; but that
must have been an exaggeration.
Nan resaved to pay a visit to Jemmy's shop and see what
she could et from him.

away an wited until she saw him leave the shop.
Then she' w t inE ,  and finding Uncle Jemmy alone, and
engaged in *X;pag his razors, she first conciliated the old
man by purc     sg eome of his pomades and perfumeries

her real busine:.
"Mr. Babb, do you still keep locks of your customers'

man, reaching down the book which was labeled in wri

ghostly than ever.,;

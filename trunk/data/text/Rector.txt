It is a considerable town, it is true, nowadays, but then there are no alien activities to disturb the place--no manufactures, and not much trade. And there is a very respectable amount of very good society at Carlingford. To begin with, it is a pretty place--mild, sheltered, not far from town; and naturally its very reputation for good society increases the amount of that much-prized article. The advantages of the town in this respect have already put five per cent upon the house-rents; but this, of course, only refers to the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> town, where you can go through an entire street of</p><p>A</p><pb n="2     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>high garden-walls, with houses inside full of the retired exclusive comforts, the dainty economical refinement peculiar to such places; and where the good people consider their own society as a warrant of gentility less splendid, but not less assured, than the favour of Majesty itself. Naturally there are no Dissenters in Carlingford--that is to say, none above the rank ofa greengrocer or milkman; and in bosoms devoted to the Church it may be well imagined that the advent of the new Rector was an event full of importance, and even of excitement.</p><p>He was highly spoken of, everybody knew; but nobody new who had spoken highly of him, nor had been, able to find out, even by inference, what were his views. The Church had been low during the last rector's reign--profoundly low--lost in the deepest abysses of Evangelicalism. A determined inclination to preach to everybody had seized upon that good man's brain; he had half emptied Salem Chapel, there could be no doubt; but, on the other hand, he had more than half filled the Chapel of St Roque, half a mile out of Carlingford, where the perpetual curate, young, handsome, and fervid, was on the very topmost pinnacle of Anglicanism. St Roque's was not more than a pleasant walk from the best quarter of Carlingford, on the north side of the town, thank heaven! which one could get at without the dread passage of</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     3"/>that new horrid suburb, to which young Mr Rider, the young doctor, was devoting himself. But the Evangelical rector was dead, and his reign was over, and nobody could predict what the character of the new administration was to be. The obscurity in which the new Rector had buried his views was the most extraordinary thing about him. He had taken high honours at college, and was "highly spoken of;" but whether he was high, or low, or broad, muscular or sentimental, sermonising or decorative, nobody in the world seemed to be able to tell.</p><p>"Fancy if he were just to be a Mr Bury over again! Fancy him going to the canal, and having sermons to the bargemen, and attending to all sorts of people except to us, whom it is his duty to attend to!" cried one of this much-canvassed clergyman's curious parishoners. "Indeed I do believe he must be one of these people. If he were in society at all, somebody would be sure to know."</p><p>"Lucy dear, Mr Bury christened you," said another not less curious but more tolerant inquirer.</p><p>"Then he did you the greatest of all services," cried the third nmember of the little group which discussed the new Rector under Mr Wodehouse's blossomed apple-trees. "He conferred such a benefit upon you that he deserves all reverence at your hand. Wonderful idea! a man confers this greatest of Christian bless-</p><pb n="4     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>ings on multitudes, and does not himself appreciate the boon he conveys!"</p><p>"Well, for that matter, Mr Wentworth, you know--" said the elder lady; but she got no farther. Though she was verging upon forty, leisurely, pious, and unmarried, that good Miss Wodehouse was not polemical. She had "her own opinions," but few people knew much about them. She was seated on a green garden-bench which surrounded the great May-tree in that large, warm, well-furnished garden. The high brick walls, all clothed with fruit-trees, shut in an, enclosure of which not a morsel except this velvet grass, with its nests of daisies, was not under the highest and most careful cultivation. It was such a scene as is only to be found in an old country town; the walls jealous of intrusion, yet thrusting tall plumes of lilac and stray branches of apple-blossom, like friendly salutations to the world without; within, the blossoms dropping over the light bright head of Lucy Wodehouse underneath the apple-trees, and impertinently flecking the Rev. Cecil Wentworth's Anglican coat. These two last were young people, with that indefinable harmony in their looks which prompts the suggestion of "a handsome couple" to the bystander. It had not even occurred to them to be in love with each other, so far as anybody knew, yet few were the undiscerning persons who saw them together without instinctively</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     5"/>placing the young curate of St Roque's in permanence by Lucy's side. She was twenty, pretty, blue-eyed, and full of dimples, with a broad Leghorn hat thrown carelessly on her head, untied, with broad strings of blue ribbon falling among her fair curls--a blue which was "repeated," according to painter jargon, in ribbons at her throat and waist. She had great gardening gloves on, and a basket and huge pair of scissors on the grass at her feet, which grass, besides, was strewed with a profusion of all the sweetest spring blossoms--the sweet narcissus, most exquisite of flowers, lilies of the valley, white and blue hyacinths, golden ranunculus globes--worlds of sober, deep-breathing wallflower. If Lucy had been doing what her kind elder sister called her "duty," she would have been at this moment arranging her flowers in the drawing-room; but the times were rare when Lucy did her duty according to Miss Wodehouse's estimate; so instead of arranging those clusters of narcissus, she clubbed them together in her hands into a fragrant dazzling sheaf, and discussed the new Rector--not unaware, perhaps, in her secret heart, that the sweet morning, the sunshine and flowers, and exhilarating air, were somehow secretly enhanced by the presence of that black Anglican figure under the apple-trees.</p><p>"But I suppose," said Lucy, with a sigh, "we must wait till we see him; and if I must be very respectful</p><pb n="6     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>of Mr Bury because he christened me, I am heartily glad the new Rector has no claim upon my reverence. I have been christened, I have been confirmed--"</p><p>"But, Lucy, my dear, the chances are he will marry you,' said Miss Wodehouse, calmly; "indeed, there can be no doubt that it is only natural he should, for he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Rector, you know; and though we go so often to St Roque's, Mr Wentworth will excuse me saying that he is a very young man."</p><p>Miss Wodehouse was knitting; she did not see the sudden look of dismay and amazement which the curate of St Roque's darted down upon her, nor the violent sympathetic blush which blazed over both the young faces. How shocking that elderly quiet people should have such a faculty for suggestions! You may be sure Lucy Wodehouse and young Wentworth, had it not been "put into their heads" in such an absurd fashion, would never, all their virtuous lives, have dreamt of anything but friendship. Deep silence ensued after this simple but startling speech. Miss Wodehouse knitted on, and took no notice; Lucy began to gather up the flowers into the basket, unable for her life to think of anything to say. For his part, Mr Wentworth gravely picked the apple-blossoms off his coat, and counted them in his hand. That sweet summer snow kept dropping, dropping, falling here and there as the wind carried it, and with a special attraction to Lucy</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     7"/>and her blue ribbons; while behind, Miss Wodehouse sat calmly on the green bench, under the May-tree just beginning to bloom, without lifting her eyes from her knitting. Not far off, the bright English house, all beaming with open doors and windows, shone in the sunshine. With the white May peeping out among the green overhead, and the sweet narcissus in a great dazzling sheaf upon the grass, making all the air fragrant around them, can anybody fancy a sweeter domestic out-of-door scene? or else it seemed so to the perpetual curate of St Roque's.</p><p>Ah me! and if he was to be perpetual curate, and none of his great friends thought upon him, or had preferment to bestow, how do you suppose he could ever, ever marry Lucy Wodehouse, if they were to wait a hundred years?</p><p>Just then the garden gate--the green gate in the wall--opened to the creaking murmur of Mr Wodehouse's own key. Mr Wodehouse was a man who creaked universally. His boots were a heavy infliction upon the good-humour of his household; and like every other invariable quality of dress, the peculiarity became identified with him in every particular of his life. Everything belonging to him moved with a certain jar, except, indeed, his household, which went on noiseless wheels, thanks to Lucy and love. As he came along the garden path, the gravel started all</p><pb n="8     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>round his unmusical foot. Miss Wodehouse alone turned round to hail her father's approach, but both the young people looked up at her instinctively, and saw her little start, the falling of her knitting-needles the little flutter of colour which surprise brought to her maidenly, middle-aged cheek. How they both divined it I cannot tell, but it certainly was no surprise to either of them when a tall embarrassed figure following the portly one of Mr Wodehouse, stepped suddenly from the noisy gravel to the quiet grass, and stood gravely awkward behind the father of the house.</p><p>"My dear children, here's the Rector--delighted to see him! we're all delighted to see him!" cried Mr Wodehouse. "This is my little girl Lucy, and this is my eldest daughter. They're both as good as curates, though I say it, you know, as shouldn't. I suppose you've got something tidy for lunch, Lucy, eh? To be sure, you ought to know--how can I tell? She might have had only cold mutton, for anything I knew--and that won't do, you know, after, college fare. Hollo, Wentworth! I beg your pardon--who thought of seeing you here? I thought you had morning service, and all that sort of thing. Delighted to make you known to the Rector so soon. Mr Proctor--Mr Wentworth of St Roque's."</p><p>The Rector bowed. He had no time to say anything,</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     9"/>fortunately for him; but a vague sort of colour fluttered over his face. It was his first living; and cloistered in All-Souls for fifteen years of his life, how is a man to know all at once how to accost his parishioners? especially when these curious unknown specimens of natural life happen to be female creatures, doubtless accustomed to compliment and civility. If ever any one was thankful to hear the sound of another man's voice, that person was the new Rector of Carlingford, standing in the bewildering garden-scene into which the green door had so suddenly admitted him, all but treading on the dazzling bundle of narcissus, and turning with embarrassed politeness from the perpetual curate, whose salutation was less cordial than it might have been, to those indefinite flutters of blue ribbon from which Mr Proctor's tall figure divided the ungracious young man.</p><p>"But come along to lunch. Bless me! don't let us be too ceremonious," cried Mr Wodehouse. "Take Lucy, my dear sir--take Lucy. Though she has her garden-gloves on, she's manager indoors for all that. Molly here is the one we coddle up and take care of. Put down your knitting, child, and don't make an old woman of yourself. To be sure, it's your own concern--you should know best; but that's my opinion. Why, Wentworth, where are you off to? 'Tisn't a fast, surely--is it, Mary?--nothing of the sort; it's Thursday--</p><pb n="10     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/><hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>, do you hear? and the Rector newly arrived. Come along."</p><p>"I am much obliged, but I have an appointment," began the curate, with restraint.</p><p>"Why didn't you keep it, then, before <hi rend="italic">we</hi> came in," cried Mr Wodehouse, "chatting with a couple of girls like Lucy and Mary? Come along, come along--an appointment with some old woman or other, who wants to screw flannels and things out of you--well, I suppose so! I don't know anything else you could have to say to them. Come along."</p><p>"Thank you. I shall hope to wait on the Rector shortly," said young Wentworth, more and more stiffly; "but at present I am sorry it is not in my power. Good morning, Miss Wodehouse--good morning; I am happy to have had the opportunity--" and the voice of the perpetual curate died off into vague murmurs of politeness as he made his way towards the green door.</p><p>That green door! what a slight, paltry barrier--one plank and no more; but outside a dusty dry road, nothing to be seen but other high brick walls, with here and there an apple-tree or a lilac, or the half-developed flower-turrets of a chestnut looking over--nothing to be seen but a mean little costermonger's cart, a hapless donkey, and, down in the direction of St Roque's, the long road winding, still drier and dustier.</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     11"/>Ah me! was it paradise inside? or was it only a merely mortal lawn dropped over with apple-blossoms, blue ribbons, and other vanities? Who could tell? The perpetual curate wended sulky on his way. I fear the old woman would have made neither flannel nor tea and sugar out of him in that inhuman frame of mind.</p><p>"Dreadful young prig that young Wentworth," said Mr Wodehouse, "but comes of a great family, you know, and gets greatly taken notice of--to be sure he does, child. I suppose it's for his family's sake: I can't see into people's hearts. It may be higher motives, to be sure, and all that. He's gone off in a huff about something; never mind, luncheon tomes up all the same. Now let's address ourselves to the business of life."</p><p>For when Mr Wodehouse took knife and fork in hand a singular result followed. He was silent--at least he talked no longer: the mystery of carving, of eating, of drinking--all the serious business of the table--engrossed the good man. He had nothing more to say for the moment; and then a dread unbroken silence fell upon the little company. The Rector coloured, faltered, cleared his throat--he had not an idea how to get into conversation with such unknown entities. He looked hard at Lucy, with a bold intention of addressing her; but, having the bad.</p><pb n="12     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>fortune to meet hsr eye, shrank back, and withdrew the venture. Then the good man inclined his profile towards Miss Wentworth. His eyes wandered wildly round the room in search of a suggestion; but, alas! it was a mere dining-room, very comfortable, but not imaginative. In this dreadful dilemma he was infinitely relieved by the sound of somebody's voice.</p><p>"I trust you will like Carlingford, Mr Proctor," said Miss Wodehouse, mildly.</p><p>"Yes--oh yes; I trust so," answered the confused but grateful man; "that is, it will depend very much, of course, on the kind of people I find here."</p><p>"Well, we are a little vain. To tell the truth, indeed, we rather pride ourselves a little on the good society in Carlingford," said his gentle and charitable interlocutor.</p><p>"Ah, yes--ladies ?" said the Rector: "hum--that was not what I was thinking of."</p><p>"But, oh, Mr Proctor," cried Lucy, with a sudden access of fun, "you don't mean to say that you dislike ladies' society, I hope?"</p><p>The Rector gave an uneasy half-frightened glance at her. The creature was dangerous even to a Fellow of All-Souls.</p><p>"I may say I know very little about them," said the bewildered clergyman. As soon as he had said the words he thought they sounded rude; but how could</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     13"/>he help it?--the truth of his speech was indisputable.</p><p>"Come here, and we'll initiate you--come here as often as you can spare us a little of your time," cried Mr Wodehouse, who had come to a pause in his operations. "You couldn't have a better chance. They're head people in Carlingford, though I say it. There's Mary, she's a learned woman; take you up in a false quantity, sir, a deal sooner than I should. And Lucy, she's in another line altogether; but there's quantities of people swear by her. What's the matter, children, eh? I suppose so--people tell me so. If people tell me so all day long, I'm entitled to believe it, I presume?"</p><p>Lucy answered this by a burst of laughter, not loud but cordial, which rang sweet and strange upon the Rector's ears. Miss Wodehouse, on the contrary, looked a little ashamed, blushed a pretty pink old-maidenly blush, and mildly remonstrated with papa. The whole scene was astonishing to the stranger. He had been living out of nature so long that he wondered within himself whether it was common to retain the habits and words of childhood to such an age as that which good Miss Wodehouse put no disguise upon, or if sisters with twenty years of difference between them were usual in ordinary households. He looked at them with looks which to Miss Wodehouse appeared</p><pb n="14     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD."/>disapproving, but which in reality meant only surprise and discomfort. He was exceedingly glad when lunch was over, and he was at liberty to take his leave. With very different feelings from those of young Wentworth the Rector crossed the boundary of that green door. When he saw it closed behind him he drew a long breath of relief, and looked up and down the dusty road, and through those lines of garden walls, where the loads of blossom burst over everywhere, with a sensation of having escaped and got at liberty. After a momentary pause and gaze round him in enjoyment of that liberty, the Rector gave a start and went on again rapidly. A dismayed, discomfited, helpless sensation came over him. These parishioners!--these female parishioners! From out of another of those green doors had just emerged a brilliant group of ladies, the rustle of whose voices he could hear in the genteel half-rural silence. The Rector bolted: he never slackened pace nor drew breath till he was safe in the vacant library of the Rectory, among old Mr Bury's book-shelves. It seemed the only safe place in Carlingford to the languishing transplanted Fellow of All-Souls.</p><pb     n="15"/><p>CHAPTER II.</p>A MONTH later, Mr Proctor had got fairly settled in his new rectory, with a complete modest establishment becoming his means--for Carlingford was a tolerable living. And in the newly furnished sober drawing-room sat a very old lady, lively but infirm, who was the Rector's mother. Nobody knew that this old woman kept the Fellow of All-Souls still a boy at heart, nor that the reserved and inappropriate man forgot his awkwardness in his mother's presence. He was not only a very affectionate son, but a dutiful good child to her. It had been his pet scheme for years to bring her from her Devonshire cottage, and make her mistress of his house. That had been the chief attraction, indeed, which drew him to Carlingford; for had he consulted his own tastes, and kept to his college, who would insure him that at seventy-five his old mother might not glide away out of life without that last gleam of sunshine long intended for her by her grateful son?</p><pb n="16     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/><p>This scene, accordingly, was almost the only one which reconciled him to the extraordinary change in his life. There she sat, the lively old lady; very deaf, as you could almost divine by that vivid inquiring twinkle in her eyes; feeble too, for she had a silver headed cane beside her chair, and even with that assistance seldom moved across the room when she could help it. Feeble in body, but alert in mind, ready to read anything, to hear anything, to deliver her opinions freely; resting in her big chair in the complete repose of age, gratified with her son's attentions, and overjoyed in his company; interested about everything, and as ready to enter into all the domestic concerns of the new people as if she had lived all her life among them. The Rector sighed and smiled as he listened to his mother's questions, and did his best, at the top of his voice, to enlighten her. His mother was, let us say, a hundred years or so younger than the Rector. If she had been his bride, and at the blithe commencement of life, she could not have shown more inclination to know all about Carlingford. Mr Proctor was middle-aged, and preoccupied by right of his years; but his mother had long ago got over that stage of life. She was at that point when some energetic natures, having got to the bottom of the hill, seem to make a fresh start and reascend. Five years</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     17"/>ago, old Mrs Proctor had completed the human term; now she had recommenced her life.</p><p>But, to tell the very truth, the Rector would very fain, had that been possible, have confined her inquiries to books and public affairs. For to make confidential disclosures, either concerning one's self or other people, in a tone of voice perfectly audible in the kitchen, is somewhat trying. He had become acquainted with those dread parishoners of his during this interval. Already they had worn him to death with dinner-parties--dinner-parties very pleasant and friendly, when one got used to them; but to a stranger frightful reproductions of each other, with the same dishes, the same dresses, the same stories, in which the Rector communicated gravely with his next neighbour, and eluded as long as he could those concluding moments in the drawing-room, which were worst of all. It cannot be said that his parishoners made much progress in their knowledge of the Rector. What his "views" were, nobody could divine any more than they could before his arrival. He made no innovations whatever; but he did not pursue Mr Bury's Evangelical ways, and never preached a sermon or a word more than was absolutely necessary. When zealous Churchmen discussed the progress of Dissent, the Rector scarcely looked interested; and nobody could move</p><p>B</p><pb n="18     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>him to express an opinion concerning all that lovely upholstery with which Mr Wentworth had decorated St Roque's. People asked in vain, what was he? He was neither High nor Low, enlightened nor narrow-minded; he was a Fellow of All-Souls.</p><p>"But now tell me, my dear," said old Mrs Proctor, "who's Mr Wodehouse?"</p><p>With despairing calmness, the Rector approached his voice to her ear. "He's a churchwarden!" cried the unfortunate man, in a shrill whisper.</p><p>"He's what?--you forget I don't hear very well. I'm a great deal deafer, Morley, my dear, than I was the last time you were in Devonshire. What did you say Mr Wodehouse was?"</p><p>"He's an ass!" exclaimed the baited Rector.</p><p>Mrs Proctor nodded her head with a great many little satisfied assenting nods.</p><p>"Exactly my own opinion, my dear. What I like in your manner of expressing yourself, Morley, is its conciseness," said the laughing old lady. "Just so--exactly what I imagined; but being an ass, you know, doesn't account for him coming here so often. What is he besides, my dear?"</p><p>The Rector made spasmodic gestures towards the door, to the great amusement of his lively mother; and then produced, with much confusion, and after a long search, his pocketbook, on a leaf of paper in</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     19"/>which he wrote--loudly, in big characters--"He's a churchwarden--they'll hear in the kitchen."</p><p>"He's a churchwarden! And what if they do hear in the kitchen?" cried the old lady, greatly amused; "it isn't a sin. Well, now, let me hear: has he a family, Morely?"</p><p>Again Mr Proctor showed a little discomposure. After a troubled look at the door, and pause, as if he meditated a remonstrance, he changed his mind, and answered, "Two daughters!" shouting sepulchrally into his mother's ear.</p><p>"Oh so!" cried the old lady--<hi rend="italic">"two daughters</hi>--so, so--that explains it all at once. I know now why he comes to the Rectory so often. And, I declare, I never thought of it before. Why, you're always there!--so, so--and he's got <hi rend="italic">two daughters</hi>, has he? To be sure; now I understand it all."</p><p>The Rector looked helpless and puzzled. It was difficult to take the initiative and ask why--but the poor man looked so perplexed and ignorant, and so clearly unaware what the situation was, that the old lady burst into shrill, gay laughter as she looked at him.</p><p>"I don't believe you know anything about it," she said. "Are they old or young? are they pretty or ugly? Tell me all about them, Morley."</p><p>Now Mr Proctor had not the excuse of having for-</p><pb n="20     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>gotten the appearance of the two Miss Wodehouses: on the contrary, though not an imaginative man, he could have fancied he saw them both before him--Lucy lost in noiseless laughter, and her good elder sister deprecating and gentle as usual. We will not even undertake to say that a gleam of something blue did not flash across the mind of the good man, who did not know what ribbons were. He was so much bewildered that Mrs Proctor repeated her question, and, as she did so, tapped him pretty smartly on the arm to recall his wandering thoughts.</p><p>"One's one thing," at last shouted the confused man, "and t'other's another!" An oracular deliverance which surely must have been entirely unintelligible in the kitchen, where we will not deny that an utterance so incomprehensible awoke a laudable curiosity.</p><p>"My dear, you're lucid!" cried the old lady. "I hope you don't preach like that. T'other's another!--is she so? and I suppose that's the one you're wanted to marry--eh ? For shame, Morley, not to tell your mother!"</p><p>The Rector jumped to his feet, thunderstruck. Wanted to marry!--the idea was too overwhelming and dreadful--his mind could not receive it. The air of alarm which immediately diffused itself all over him--his unfeigned horror at the suggestion--capti-</p><pb n="THE RECTOR     21"/>vated his mother. She was amused, but she was pleased at the same time. Just making her cheery outset on this second lifetime, you can't suppose she would have been glad to hear that her son was going to jilt her, and appoint another queen in her stead.</p><p>"Sit down and tell me about them," said Mrs Proctor; "my dear, you're wonderfully afraid of the servants hearing. They don't know who we're speaking of. Aha! and so you didn't know what they meant, didn't you? I don't say you shouldn't marry, my dear--quite the reverse. A man <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to marry, one time or another. Only it's rather soon to lay their plans. I don't doubt there's a great many unmarried ladies in your church, Morley. There always is in a country place."</p><p>To this the alarmed Rector answered only by a groan--a groan so expressive that his quick-witted mother heard it with her eyes.</p><p>"They will come to call on me," said Mrs Proctor, with fun dancing in her bright old eyes. "I'll tell you all about them, and you needn't be afraid of the servants. Trust to me, my dear--I'll find them out. And now, if you wish to take a walk, or go out visiting, don't let me detain you, Morley. I shouldn't wonder but there's something in the papers I would like to see--or I even might close my eyes for a few minutes: the afternoon is always a drowsy time with</p> <pb n="22     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>me. When I was in Devonshire, you know, no one minded what I did. You had better refresh yourself with a nice walk, my dear boy."</p><p>The Rector got up well pleased. The alacrity with which he left the room, however, did not correspond with the horror-stricken and helpless expression of his face, when, after walking very smartly all round the Rectory garden, he paused with his hand on the gate, doubtful whether to retreat into his study, or boldly to face that world which was plotting against him. The question was a profoundly serious one to Mr Proctor. He did not feel by any means sure that he was a free agent, or could assert the ordinary rights of an Englishman, in this most unexpected dilemma. How could he tell how much or how little was necessary to prove that a man had "committed himself?" For anything he could tell, somebody might be calculating upon him as her lover, and settling his future life for him. The Rector was not vain--he did not think himself an Adonis; he did not understand anything about the matter, which indeed was beneath the consideration of a Fellow of All-Souls. But have not women been incomprehensible since ever there was in this world a pen with sufficient command of words to call them so? And is it not certain that, whether it may be to their advantage or disadvantage, every soul of them is plotting to marry somebody? Mr Proctor</p><pb n="THE RECTOR.     23"/>recalled in dim but frightful reminiscences stories which had dropped upon his ear at various times of his life. Never was there a man, however ugly, disagreeable, or penniless, but he could tell of a narrow escape he had, some time or other. The Rector recollected and trembled. No woman was ever so dismayed by the persecutions of a lover as was this helpless middle-aged gentleman under the conviction that Lucy Wodehouse meant to marry him. The remembrance of the curate of St Roque's gave him no comfort: her sweet youth, so totally unlike his sober age, did not strike him as unfavourable to her pursuit of him. Who could fathom the motives of a woman? His mother was wise, and knew the world, and understood what such creatures meant. No doubt it was entirely the case-a dreadful certainty-and what was he to do?</p><p>At the bottom of all this fright and perplexity must be owned that the Rector had a guilty consciousness within himself, that if Lucy drove the matter to extremities, he was not so sure of his own powers of resistance as he ought to be? She might marry him before he knew what she was about; and in such a case the Rector could not have taken his oath at his own private confessional that he would have been so deeply miserable as the circumstances might infer. No wonder he was alarmed at the position in which</p><pb n="24     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>he found himself; nobody could predict how it might end.</p><p>When Mr Proctor saw his mother again at dinner, she was evidently full of some subject which would not bear talking of before the servants. The old lady looked at her son's troubled apprehensive face with smiles and nods and gay hints, which he was much too preoccupied to understand, and which only increased his bewilderment. When the good man was left alone over his glass of wine, he drank it slowly, in funereal silence, with profoundly serious looks; and what between eagerness to understand what the old lady meant, and reluctance to show the extent of his curiosity, had a very heavy half-hour of it in that grave solitary dining-room. He roused himself with an effort from this dismal state into which he was falling. He recalled with a sigh the classic board of All-Souls. Woe for the day when he was seduced to forsake that dear retirement! Really, to suffer himself to fall into a condition so melancholy, was far from being right. He must rouse himself--he must find some other society than parishioners; and with a glimpse of a series of snug little dinner-parties, undisturbed by the presence of women, Mr Proctor rose and hurried after his mother, to hear what new thing she might have to say.</p><p>Nor was he disappointed. The old lady was snugly<pb n="THE RECTOR.     25"/>posted, ready for a conference. She made lively gestures to hasten him when he appeared at the door, and could scarcely delay the utterance of her news till he had taken his seat beside her. She had taken off her spectacles, and laid aside her paper, and cleared off her work into her work-basket. All was ready for the talk in which she delighted.</p><p>"My dear, they've been here," said old Mrs Proctor, rubbing her hands-"both together, and as kind as could be-exactly as I expected. An old woman gets double the attention when she's got an unmarried son. I've always observed that; though in Devonshire, what with your fellowship and seeing you so seldom, nobody took much notice. Yes, they've been here; and I like them a great deal better than I expected, Morley, my dear."</p><p>The Rector, no knowing what else to say, shouted "Indeed, mother!" into the old lady's ear.</p><p>"Quite so," continued that lively observer-"nice young women-not at all like their father, which is a great consolation. That elder one is a very sensible person, I am sure. She would make a nice wife for somebody, especially for a clergyman. She is not in her first youth, but neither are some other people. A very nice creature indeed, I am quite sure."</p><p>During all this speech the Rector's countenance had been falling, falling. If he was helpless before, the</p><pb n="26     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>utter woe of his expression now was a spectacle to behold. The danger of being married by proxy was appalling certainly, yet was not entirely without alleviations; but Miss Wodehouse! who ever thought of Miss Wodehouse? To see the last remains of colour fade out of his cheek, and his very lip fall with disappointment, was deeply edifying to his lively old mother. She perceived it all, but made no sign.</p><p>"And the other is a pretty creature-certainly pretty: shouldn't you say she was pretty, Morley?" said his heartless mother.</p><p>Mr Proctor hesitated, hemmed--felt himself growing red--tried to intimate his sentiments by a nod of assent; but that would not do, for the old lady had presented her ear to him, and was blind to all his gestures.</p><p>"I don't know much about it, mother," he made answer at last.</p><p>"<hi rend="italic">Much</hi> about it! it's to be hoped not.  I never supposed you did; but you don't mean to say you don't think her pretty?" said Mrs Proctor--"but, I don't doubt in the least, a sad flirt. Her sister is a very superior person, my dear."</p><p>The Rector's face lengthened at every word--a vision of these two Miss Wodehouses rose upon him every moment clearer and more distinct as his mother spoke. Considering how ignorant he was of all such female</p><pb n="THE RECTOR.     27"/>paraphernalia, it is extraordinary how correct his recollection was of all the details of their habitual dress and appearance. With a certain dreadful consciousness of the justice of what his mother said, he saw in imagination the mild elder sister in her comely old-maidenhood. Nobody could doubt her good qualities, and could it be questioned that for a man of fifty, if he was to do anything so foolish, a woman not quite forty was a thousand times more eligible than a creature in blue ribbons?  Still the unfortunate Rector did not seem to see it: his face grew longer and longer--he made no answer whatever to his mother's address; while she, with a spice of natural female malice against the common enemy triumphing for the moment over the mother's admiration of her son, sat wickedly enjoying his distress, and aggravating it. His dismay and perplexity amused this wicked old woman beyond measure.</p><p>"I have no doubt that younger girl takes a pleasure in deluding her admirers," said Mrs Proctor; "she's a wicked little flirt, and likes nothing better than to see her power. I know very well how such people do; but, my dear," continued this false old lady, scarcely able to restrain her laughter, "if I were you, I would be very civil to Miss Wodehouse. You may depend upon it, Morley, that's a very superior person. She is not very young, to be sure, but you are not very young yourself. She would make a nice wife--not too foolish,</p><pb n="28     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD."/>you know, nor fanciful. Ah! I like Miss Wodehouse, my dear."</p><p>The Rector stumbled up to his feet hastily, and pointed to a table at a little distance, on which some books were lying. Then he went and brought them to her table. "I've brought you some new books," he shouted into her ear. It was the only way his clumsy ingenuity could fall upon for bringing this most distasteful conversation to an end.</p><p>The old lady's eyes were dancing with fun and a little mischief, but, notwithstanding, she could not be so false to her nature as to show no interest in the books. She turned them over with lively remarks and comment. "But for all that, Morley, I would not have you forget Miss Wodehouse," she said, when her early bedtime came. "Give it a thought now and then, and consider the whole matter. It is not a thing to be done rashly; but still you know you are settled now, and you ought to be thinking of settling for life."</p><p>With this parting shaft she left him. The troubled Rector, instead of sitting up to his beloved studies, went early to bed that night, and was pursued by nightmares through his unquiet slumbers. Settling for life! Alas! there floated before him vain visions of that halcyon world he had left--that sacred soil at All-Souls, where there were no parishioners to break the sweet repose. How different was this discomposing real world!</p><pb n="     29"/><p>CHAPTER III.</p>MATTERS went on quietly for some time without any catastrophe occurring to the Rector. He had shut himself up from all society, and declined the invitations of the parishioners for ten long days at least; but finding that the kind people were only kinder than ever when they understood he was "indisposed," poor Mr Proctor resumed his ordinary life, confiding timidly in some extra precautions which his own ingenuity had invented. He was shyer than ever of addressing the ladies in those parties he was obliged to attend. He was especially embarrassed and uncomfortable in the presence of the two Miss Wodehouses, who, unfortunately, were very popular in Carlingford, and whom he could not help meeting everywhere. Notwithstanding this embarrassment, it is curious how well he knew how they looked, and what they were doing, and all about them. Though he could not for his life have told what these things were called, he knew Miss</p><pb n="30     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>Wodehouse's dove-coloured dress and her French grey; and all those gleams of blue which set off Lucy's fair curls, and floated about her pretty person under various pretences, had a distinct though inarticulate place in the good man's confused remembrance. But neither Lucy nor Miss Wodehouse had brought matters to extremity. He even ventured to go to their house occasionally without any harm coming of it, and lingered in that blooming fragrant garden, where the blossoms had given place to fruit, and ruddy apples hung heavy on the branches which had once scattered their petals, rosy-white, on Cecil Wentworth's Anglican coat. Yet Mr Proctor was not lulled into incaution by this seeming calm. Other people besides his mother had intimated to him that there were expectations current of his "settling in life." He lived not in false security, but wise trembling, never knowing what hour the thunderbolt might fall upon his head.</p><p>It happened one day, while still in this condition of mind, that the Rector was passing through Grove Street on his way home. He was walking on the humbler side of the street, where there is a row of cottages with little gardens in front of them--cheap houses which are contented to be haughtily overlooked by the staircase windows and blank walls of their rich neighbours on the other side of the road. The Rector thought, but could not be sure, that he had seen two</p><pb n="THE RECTOR.     31"/>figures like those of the Miss Wodehouses going into one of these houses, and was making a little haste to escape meeting those enemies of his peace. But as he went hastily on, he heard sobs and screams--sounds which a man who hid a good heart under a shy exterior could not willingly pass by. He made a troubled pause before the door from which these outcries proceeded, and while he stood thus irresolute whether to pass on or to stop and inquire the cause, some one came rushing out and took hold of his arm. "Please, sir, she's dying--oh, please, sir, she thought a deal o' you. Please, will you come in and speak to her?" cried the little servant-girl who had pounced upon him so. The Rector stared at her in amazement. He had not his prayer-book--he was not prepared; he had no idea of being called upon in such an emergency. In the mean time the commotion rather increased in the house, and he could hear in the distance a voice adjuring some one to go for the clergyman. The Rector stood uncertain and perplexed, perhaps in a more serious personal difficulty than had ever happened to him all his life before. For what did he know about deathbeds? or what had he to say to any one on that dread verge? He grew pale with real vexation and distress.</p><p>"Have they gone for a doctor? that would be more to the purpose," he said, unconsciously, aloud.</p><pb n="32     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/><p>"Please, sir, it's no good," said the little maid-servant. "Please, the doctor's been, but he's no good--and she's unhappy in her mind, though she's quite resigned to go: and oh, please, if you would say a word to her, it might do her a deal of good."</p><p>Thus adjured, the Rector had no choice. He went gloomily into the house and up the stair after his little guide. Why did not they send for the minister of Salem Chapel close by? or for Mr Wentworth, who was accustomed to that sort of thing? Why did they resort to him in such an emergency? He would have made his appearance before the highest magnates of the land--before the Queen herself--before the bench of bishops or the Privy Council--with less trepidation than he entered that poor little room.</p><p>The sufferer lay breathing heavily in the poor apartment. She did not look very ill to Mr Proctor's inexperienced eyes. Her colour was bright, and her face full of eagerness. Near the door stood Miss Wodehouse, looking compassionate but helpless, casting wistful glances at the bed, but standing back in a corner as confused and embarrassed as the Rector himself. Lucy was standing by the pillow of the sick woman with a watchful readiness visible to the most unskilled eye--ready to raise her, to change her position, to attend to her wants almost before they were<pb n="THE RECTOR.     33"/>expressed. The contrast was wonderful. She had thrown off her bonnet and shawl, and, appeared, not like a stranger but somehow in her natural place, despite the sweet youthful beauty of her looks, and the gay girlish dress with its floating ribbons. These singular adjuncts notwithstanding, no homely nurse in a cotton gown could have looked more alert or serviceable, or more natural to the position, than Lucy did. The poor Rector, taking the seat which the little maid placed for him directly in the centre of the room, looked at the nurse and the patient with a gasp of perplexity and embarrassment. A deathbed, alas! Was an unknown region to him.</p><p>"Oh, sir, I'm obliged to you for coming--oh, sir, I'm grateful to you," cried the poor woman in the bed. "I've been ill, off and on, for years, but never took thought to it as I ought. I've put off and put off, waiting for a better time--and now, God help me, it's perhaps too late. Oh, sir, tell me, when a person's ill and dying, is it too late?"</p><p>Before the Rector could even imagine what he could answer, the sick woman took up the broken thread of her own words, and continued--</p><p>"I don't feel to trust as I ought to--I don't feel no confidence," she said, in anxious confession. "Oh, sir, do you think it matters if one feels it?--don't you</p><p>C</p><pb n="34     CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:"/>think things might be right all the same though we <hi rend="italic">were</hi> uneasy in our minds? My thinking can't change it one way or another. Ask the good gentleman to speak to me, Miss Lucy, dear--he'll mind what you say."</p><p>A look from Lucy quickened the Rector's speech, but increased his embarrassments. " It--it isn't her doctor she has no confidence in?" he said, eagerly.</p><p>The poor woman gave a little cry. "The doctor--the doctor! what can he do to a poor dying creature? Oh, Lord bless you, it's none of them things I'm thinking of; it's my soul--my soul!"</p><p>"But my poor good woman," said Mr Proctor, "though it is very good and praiseworthy of you to be anxious about your soul, let us hope that there is no such--no such <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> as you seem to suppose."</p><p>The patient opened her eyes wide, and stared, with the anxious look of disease, in his face.</p><p>"I mean," said the good man, faltering under that gaze, "that I see no reason for your making yourself so very anxious. Let us hope it is not so bad as that. You are very ill, but not <hi rend="italic">so</hi> ill--I suppose."</p><p>Here the Rector was interrupted by a groan from the patient, and by a troubled, disapproving, disappointed look from Lucy Wodehouse. This brought him to a sudden standstill. He gazed for a moment helplessly at the poor woman in the bed. If he had</p>"·~n~~~:2<pb n="35"/>rF             THE RECTOR.                 35known anything in the world which would have givenher consolation, he was ready to have made any exer-tion for it; but he knew nothing to say-no medicinefor a mind diseased was in his repositories. He wasdeeply distressed to see the disappointment whichfollowed his words, but his distress only made himmore silent, more helpless, more inefficient than before.After an interval which was disturbed only by thegroans of the patient and the uneasy fidgeting ofgood Miss Wodehouse in her corner, the Rector againbroke silence. The sick woman had turned to thewall, and .closed her eyes in dismay and disappoint-ment-evidently she had ceased to expect anythingfrom him."If there is anything I can do," said poor MrProctor, " I am afraid I have spoken hastily.

The Rector rose abruptly, waving his hand,and went to join Miss Wodehouse in her corner.!!There the two elderly spectators looked on silentat ministrations of which both were incapable; one.watching with wondering yet affectionate envy howLucy laid down the weakened but relieved patientupon her pillows; and one beholding with a surprisehe could not conceal, how a young man, not half hisown age, went softly, with all the confidence yet aweof nature, into those mysteries which he dared nottouch upon. The two young creatures by the death-bed acknowledged that their patient was dying; thewoman stood by her watchful and affectionate-theman held up before her that cross, not of wood ormetal, but of truth and everlasting verity, which isthe only hope of man. The spectators looked on, anddid not interrupt-looked on, awed and wondering-unaware of how it was, but watching as if it werea miracle wrought before their eyes. Perhaps all theyears of his life had not taught the Rector so much asdid that half hour in an unknown poor bed-chamber,where, honest and humble, he stood aside, and, kneel-Jmg down, responded to his young brother's prayer.His young brother-young enough to have been hisson--not half nor a quarter part so learned as he;<pb n="38"/>38        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFOR:D *:  ' '"i but a world further on in that profession which shared-the art of winning souls.When those prayers were over, the Rector, witha word to anybody, stole quietly away. When he into the street, however, he found himself closely flowed by Miss Wodehouse, of whom he was notthis moment afraid. That good creature was cryisoftly under her veil. She was eager to make uphim, to open out her full heart; and indeed the Rectolike herself, in that wonderful sensation of surprisand unenvying discomfiture, was glad at that momeof sympathy too."Oh, Mr Proctor, isn't it wonderful ?" sighed goiMiss Wodehouse.The Rector did not speak, but he answered by very emphatic nod of his head."It did not use to be so when you and I weryoung," said his companion in failure.

The Rector went straight home-straight tohis study, where he shut himself in, and was not to bedisturbed; that night was one long to be rememberedin the good man's history. For the first time in hislife he set himself to inquire what was his supposedbusiness in this world. His treatise on the Greekverb, and his new edition of Sophocles, were highlycreditable to the Fellow of All-Souls; but how aboutthe Rector of Carlingford ? What was he doing here,among that little world of human creatures who weredying, being born, perishing, suffering, falling intomisfortune and anguish, and all manner of humanvicissitudes, every day? ' Young Wentworth knewwhat to say to that woman in her distress; and soE:+r .<pb n="40"/>40        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD.     - ;  '-might the Rector, had her distress concerned aputed translation, or a disused idiom. The good mwas startled in his composure and calm. To-day had visibly failed in a duty which even in All-Souwas certainly known to be one of the duties ofChristian priest. Was he a Christian priest, or whawas he ? He was troubled to the very depths of hisoul. To hold an office the duties of which he couldnot perform, was clearly impossible. The only ques-tion, and that a hard one, was, whether he could learnto discharge those duties, or whether he must ceaseto be Rector of Carlingford. He laboured over this§problem in his solitude, and could find no answer.'"Things were different when we were young," was theonly thought that was any comfort to him, and thatwas poor consolation.For one thing, it is hard upon the most magnani-mous of men to confess that he has undertaken anoffice for which he has not found himself capable.Magnanimity was perhaps too lofty a word to applyto the Rector; but he was honest to the bottom of hissoul. As soon as he became aware of what was in-cluded in the duties of his office, he must performthem, or quit his post. But how to perform them?Can one learn to convey consolation to the dying,to teach the ignorant, to comfort the sorrowful?

The Rector's heart said No.The Rector's imagination unfolded before him, in all itshalcyon blessedness, that ancient paradise of All-Souls,where no such confounding demands ever disturbedhis beatitude. The good man groaned within himselfover the mortification, the labour, the sorrow, whichthis living was bringing upon him. "If I had but letit pass to Morgan, who wanted to marry," he said withself-reproach; and then suddenly bethought himself ofhis own most innocent filial romance, and the pleasurehis mother had taken in her new'house and new begin-ning of life. At that touch the tide flowed back again.Could he dismiss her now to another solitary cottagein Devonshire, her old home there being all dispersedand broken up, while the house she had hoped to diein cast her out from its long-hoped-for shelter? TheRector was quite overwhelmed by this new aggrava-tion. If by any effort of his own, any sacrifice to him-self, he could preserve this bright new home to hismother, would he shrink from that labour of love?Nobody, however, knew anything about those con-flicting thoughts which rent his sober bosom.  Hepreached next Sunday as usual, letting no trace of thedistressed, wistful anxiety to do his duty which nowpossessed him  gleam into his sermon.  He lookeddown upon a crowd of unsympathetic, uninterestedfaces, when he delivered that smooth little sermon,,  wt sif-.                        ..

The ony eyes which in the smallest decomprehended him were those of good Miss W:ohouse, who had been the witness and the participof his humiliation. Lucy was not there. DoubtlLucy was at St Roque's, where the sermons of perpetual curate differed much from those of the Reof Carlingford, Ah me! the rectorship, with all iresponsibilities, was a serious business; and what to become of it yet, Mr Proctor could not see. was not a hasty man-he determined to wait and s'wlit events might make of it; to consider it ripelyto take full counsel with himself  Every time he camqutiof his mother's presence, he came affected and fulof anxiety to preserve to her that home which pleaseier to much.

If there had been no other sickbeds immediately in Carlingford, Mrs Proctor wouldhave won the day.<pb n="43"/>CHAPTER IV.SucH a blessed exemption, however, was not to behoped for. When the Rector was solemnly sent forfrom his very study to visit a poor man who wasnotexpected to live many days, he put his prayer-bookunder his arm, and went off doggedly, feeling thgtnow was the crisis. He went through it in as exem-plary a manner as could have been desired, but if ivatdreadful work to the Rector. If nobody else suspectedhim, he suspected himself. He had no spontaneousword of encouragement or consolation to offer; hewent through it as his duty with a horrible abstract-ness. That night he went home disgusted beyond allpossible power of self-reconciliation.  He could notcontinue this. Good evangelical Mr Bury, who wentbefore him, and by nature loved preaching, had accus-tomed the people to much of such visitations. It wasmurder to the Fellow of All-Souls.That night Mr Proctor wrote a long letter to his dear<pb n="44"/>44        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:cheery old mothe, disclosing all his heart to her. Iwas written with a athos of which the good manwholly unconscious, and finished by asking her adviand her prayers. He sent it up to her next morninon her breakfast tray, which he always furnished wilhis own hands, and went out to occupy himself in paing visits till it should be time to see her, and ascetain her opinion.  At Mr Wodehouse's there wanobody at home but Lucy, who was very friendlyand took no notice of that sad encounter which hachanged his views so entirely. The Rector found, oninquiry, that the woman was dead, but not until MrWentworth had administered to her fully the consola-,tions of the Church. Lucy did not look superior, or:say anything in admiration of Mr Wentworth, but theRector's conscience supplied all that was wanting. Ifgood Miss Wodehouse had been there with her chari-table looks, and her disefficiency so like his own, itwould have been a consolation to the good man. Hewould have turned joyfully from Lucy and her blueribbons to that distressed dove - coloured woman, sogreatly had recent events changed him.  But thetruth was, he cared nothing for either of them nowa-days. He was delivered from those whimsical distress-ing fears.  Something more serious had obliteratedthose lighter apprehensions. He had no leisure now tothink that somebody had planned to marry him; all his<pb n="45"/>THE RECTOR                  45 hts were fixed on matters s a tch more import-fnt that this was entirely forgott            "AMrs Proctor was seated as usual in the place sheloved, with her newspapers, her books, her work-basket,and silver-headed cane at the side of her chair. Theold lady, like her son, looked serious. She beckoned' him to quicken his steps when she saw him appear'atthe drawing-room door, and pointed to the chair placedbeside her, all ready for this solemn conference. Hecame in with a troubled face, scarcely venturing tolook at her, afraid to see the disappointment which hehad brought upon his dearest friend. The old lady a*=divined why it was he did not lift his eyes. She tookhis hand and addressed him with all her characteristicvivacity."Morley, what is this you mean, my dear ? Whendid I ever give my son reason to distrust me? Doyou think I would suffer you to continue in a positionpainful to yourself for my sake ? How dare you thinksuch a thing of me, Morley? Don't say so; you didn'tmean it ? I can see it in your eyes."The Rector shook his head, and dropped into theI chair placed ready for him. He might have had agreat deal to say for himself could she have heard him.But as it was, he could not shout all his reasons andapologies into her deaf ear."As for the change to me," said the old lady, in-c-<pb n="46"/>46        CHRONIOtE- OF CARLINGFORD:stinctively seizin*pn the heart of the dific'"that's nothing- iplaothing.

" His interferenceamong your parishioners, Morley, is really more thanI should be inclined to bear."Once more the good Rector shook his head. Hehad not thought of that aspect of the subject.

Carlingford passed away like a dream fromthe lively old mother's memory, and how could anyreminiscences of that uncongenial locality disturb therecovered beatitude of the Fellow of All-Souls?Yet all was not so satisfactory as it appeared. MrProctor paid for his temporary absence.  All-Soulswas not the Elysium it had been before that brief dis-astrous voyage into the world.

The young man,being but young, aimed at a practice. He was notparticular in the mean time as to the streets in whichhis patients dwelt. A new house, gazing with all itswindows over a brick-field, was as interesting to theyoung surgeon as if it had been one of those exclusivehouses in Grange Lane, where the aristocracy of Car-lingford lived retired within their garden walls. His own establishment, though sufficiently comfortable,was of a kind utterly to shock the feelings of theI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<pb n="56"/>56        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: refined community. A corner house, with a surgeround the corner, throwing the gleam of its red laover all that chaotic district of half-formed streets afull-developed brick-fields, with its night-bell promnent, and young Rider's name on a staring brass plat*   with mysterious initials after it. M.R.C.S. the unhappy young man had been seduced to put after hiname upon that brass plate, though he was reallyRider, a physician, if not an experienced one. Friendhad advised him that in such districts people werafraid of physicians, associating only with dread adumbrations of a guinea a visit that mis-comprehendedname; so, with a pang, the young surgeon had put hidegree in his pocket, and put up with the inferiodistinction.  Of course, Dr Marjoribanks had all thpatronage of Grange Lane. The great people werinfatuated about that snuffy old Scotchman-a manbehind his day, who had rusted and grown old amongthe soft diseases of Carlingford, where sharp practiciwas so seldom necessary; and no openingappeared fotyoung Rider except in the new district, in the snIuwcorner house, with the surgery and the red lamp, andM.R.C.S. on a brass plate on his door. If you can imagine that the young man bowed hisspirit to this without a struggle, you do the poor younfellow injustice.

You don'tsuppose that he did not know in his secret heart, andfeel tingling through every vein, those words whichnobody ever said to his face ? But he could not helpit. He could only make an indignant gulp of his re-sentment and shame, which were shame and resent-ment at himself for wanting the courage to dare every-thing, as well as at other people for finding him out,and go on with his work as he best could. He wasnot a hero nor a martyr; men made of that stuff havelarge compensations. He was an ordinary individual,with no sublimity in him, and no compensation tospeak of for his sufferings-no consciousness of loftyright-doing, or of a course of action superior to theworld.Perhaps you would prefer to go up-stairs and seefor yourself what was the skeleton in Edward Rider'scupboard, rather than have it described to you.

His feet are in slippers, his per-clothed in a greasy old coat, his linen soiled  dntidy. That is the skeleton in young Rider's house.'I The servants, you may be sure, knew all about thisunwelcome visitor. They went with bottles and jugssecretly to bring him what he wanted; they went tothe circulating library for him; they let him in whenhe had been out in the twilight all shabby and slovenly.They would not be human if they did not talk abouthim. They say he is very good-natured, poor gentle-man-always has a pleasant word-is nobody's enemybut his own; and to see how "the doctor do look athim, and he his own brother as was brought up withhim," is dreadful, to be sure.All this young Rider takes silently, never saying aword about it to any human creature. He seems toknow by intuition what all these people say of him, ashe drives about furiously in his drag from patient topatient; and wherever he goes, as plain, nay, far moreisinctly than the actual prospect before him, he seesat sofa, that dusty slow-burning fire-that pipe, withthe little heap of ashes knocked out of it upon the table-that wasted ruined life chafing him to desperation withdismal content.

It was not a much frequentedt,but the young doctor knew instinctively that hissitor had been away in the heart of the town at theooksellers' shops buying cheap novels, and orderinghem magnificently to be sent to Dr Rider's; andnould guess the curious questions and large answerswhich had followed. He sprang to the ground witha painful suppressed indignation, intensified by manymingled feelings, and waited the arrival of the maudlinwanderer. Ah me! one might have had some conso-lation in the burden freely undertaken for love's sake,and by love's self shared and lightened: but this loadof disgrace and ruin which nobody could take partof--which it was misery so much as to think thatanybody knew of--the doctor's fraternal sentiments,blunted by absence and injury, were not strong enoughto bear that weight."So, Fred, you have been out," said Dr Rider, mood-i ly, as he stood aside on his own threshold to let hisbrother pass in-not with the courtesy of a host, butthe precaution of a jailer, to see him safe before he ;  _himself entered and closed the door. "Yes, you can't expect a man to sit in the house forever," said the prodigal, stumbling in to his brother'sfavourite sitting-room, where everything was tidy andcomfortable for the brief leisure of the hard-workingman.

He paused an instant to recoverhimself, and then went boldly and silently into theroom which had become mysterious through its newinmates. They both turned round upon him as he:Jentered. Two young women: one who had been sit-ting at the table, looking faded, plaintive, and anxious,rose up suddenly, and, clasping her hands, as if in en-reaty, fixed two bright but sunken eyes upon his face.he other, a younger, lighter figure, all action and haste,interposed between him and her companion. She putup one hand in warning to the petitioner behind her,and one to call the attention of the bewildered strangerbefore. Evidently the one thing which alarmed thisyoung lady was that somebody would speak beforeher, and the conduct of the situation be taken out ofher hands. She was little, very slight, very pretty,but her prettiness was peculiar. The young doctor,accustomed to the fair Saxon version of beauty givenby Bessie Christian, did not at the first glance believet the wonderful little person before him possessed<pb n="70"/>70        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:any; for she was not only slender but thin, dark, eagimpetuous, with blazing black eyes and red lips,nothing else notable about her.

Something whimsical, odd, andnbarrassing about her position made it all the morequant to the troubled eyes which, in spite of allteir worldly wisdom, were still the eyes of a youngman. He could not tell in the world what to say toher. To order that creature out of his house wassimply impossible; to remain there was equally so;to leave them in possession of the field-what couldthe unfortunate young doctor do ? One thing wascertain, the impatient patient could no longer be ne-glected; and after a few minutes longer of bewildereduncertainty Dr Rider went off in the wildest confu-)sion of mind, leaving his brother's unknown familyumphant in his invaded house.To describe the feelings with which the unfortunatedoctor went fasting about his day's work-the mannerawhich that scene returned to him after every visit' he made-the continual succession in which wrath,dismay, alarm, bitter disgust with the falsehood of thebrother who, no further gone than last night, had pre-tended to confide in him, but never breathed a syllableof this biggest unconcealable secret, swept through themind of the victim; all culminating, however, in thesoftening of that moment, in the tiny figure, indomit-able elf or fairy, shedding back with dainty fingersthose soft abundant locks-would be impossible.

When he was able at last to this horse's head towards his own dwelling, it was wfeelings very different from the usual unexpecting blof sullen displeasure. What he should find there,a curious, exciting, alarming question; perhaps antire nursery with Nettie in charge; perhaps a recusahusband with Nettie mounting guard over him; perha thrilling scene of family explanation and reconciition.

Allthis Dr Rider represented to himself very patheticallyas he wended his homeward way. Yet it is astonish-ing, notwithstanding, with what alacrity he hastenedupon that path, and how much the curiosity, the ex-citement, the dramatic stir and commotion made inhis monotonous life by this entirely new unexpectedincident, occupied his mind. With expectations highlyroused, he drew up once more before his own house.It was surprising to him to see how exactly it lookedlike itself. The blinds half drawn down in the gen-teelest calm as they always were-no faces peeping atthe windows-no marks of an arrival on the pavement,! or in the composed countenance of Mary, who stoodholding the door open for him. He went in with alittle thrill of curiosity; the house was very quiet--dead-quiet in comparison with the commotion of histhoughts; so was the sitting-room where he had leftNettie resolutely planted in the easy-chair; there wasnobody there now; the boxes were out of the hall, nota sound was to be heard in the house. He turnedrather blankly upon Mary, who was going away quitecomposedly, as if there was nothing which she wantedto tell or he to hear."Where is my brother and the ladies?" said theamazed doctor."*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.<pb n="78"/>78        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:      '"They all went off to the 'otel, sir, as soon Rider came down-stairs," said Mary, complace"I assured Miss as it was the best thing she couldsir, for that I was 'most sure you'd never have children here,-as to be sure there wasn't no roneither," said the doctor's factotum.

Aweek before, if Fred had departed, however summarily,;there can be no doubt that his brother's feelings ofrelief and comfort would have been unfeigned; now,however, he began to think the matter over, and to jus-tify to himself his extraordinary sense of disappoint-ment. As he poured out his own coffee with a soberface, his eye rested upon that easy-chair, which hadbeen brought into such prominence in the history ofhe last two days. He kept looking at it as he sippedat gloomy coffee. Fred had faded from the greatair; his big image threw    no shadow   upon it.*here sat a little fairy queen, tiny as Titania, but darkan elf of the East, putting up those two shapely tinyands, brown and beautiful, to push aside the flood ofF<pb n="82"/>82        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: hair, which certainly would have veiled her little all over, the doctor thought, had it been let diWonderful little sprite!

Dr Rider went to his hard day's work vaguelyexpectant, feeling sure he must hear of them somehow,and more interested in hearing of them than was to beexpected from his former low ebb of fraternal affection.When he returned and found still no letter, no message,the blank disappointment of the former night closedstill more blankly upon him. When one is all by one's.self, and has nothing at best but an easy-chair to gohome to, and goes home expecting a letter, or a mes-sage, or a visitor who has not arrived, and has nochance of arriving, the revulsion of feeling is notagreeable. It did not improve the doctor's temper inthe first place. The chill loneliness of that trim room,with its drawn curtains and tidy pretence of being- comfortable, exasperated him  beyond bearing.  Hefelt shut up in it, and yet would not leave it. Some-body certainly might come even to- night.    Fredhimself perhaps, if he could escape from the rigidguardianship he was under; or was that miraculousAustralian Nettie a little witch, who had spirited thlwhole party in a nutshell over the seas ? Never wasman delivered from a burden with a worse grace:thanwas Dr Rider; and the matter had not mended inthese twenty-four hours.Next morning, however, this fever of fraternal sus-pense was assuaged. A three-cornered note, addressedin an odd feminine hand, very thin, small, and rapid,[                                     v        ..~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<pb n="84"/>84        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:came among Dr Rider's letters. He signalledby instinct, and opened it with an impatience wful to behold." SiR,-We are all at the Blue Boar until wget lodgings, which I hope to be to-day.

When he passed the great house whereBessie Christian now reigned, he recalled her imagewith a positive effort. Astonishing what an effect ofdistance had floated over the apparition of that bride.Was it a year since he saw her and gnashed his teethat the thought of his own folly, or was it only lastSunday?   The doctor could not tell. He put Nettie'snote in his pocket-book, and was at the hotel doorpunctually at one o'clock. It was in the principalstreet of Carlingford, George Street, where all the bestshops, and indeed some of the best houses, were.From the corner window of the hotel you could seedown into the bowery seclusion of Grange Lane, andMr Wodehouse's famous apple-trees holding temptingclusters over the high wall. The prospect was verydifferent from that which extended before Dr Rider'swindow. Instinctively he marvelled within himselfwhether, if Dr Marjoribanks were to die-peoplecannot live for ever even in Carlingford-whether itmight not be a disadvantage to a man to live so farout of the world. No doubt it was a temptation ofthe Evil One. Happily the young man did not takesufficient time to answer himself, but walked forwardbriskly through the mazy old passages of the old inn,to a room from which sundry noises issued. Dr Rideralked in with the natural confidence of a man whokW<pb n="86"/>86        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:has an appointment. The room was in undidpossession of three children-three children Inoise enough for six-all very small, very precwith staring round eyes and the most completpendence of speech and manners.

A!minutes afterwards their mother appeared, languidfaded as before.  Perhaps she had been even prthan Nettie in her bright days, if any days had ,been bright for Fred Rider's wife. She was <pb n="87"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.             87larger, smoother than her sister; but these advantageshad lapsed in a general fade, which transformed hercolour into washy pinkness, made her figure stoop,and her footsteps drag. She came remonstrating allthe way in feeble accents.  It was not for her, cer-tainly, that the doctor had taken the trouble to cometo the Blue Boar."Please to sit down," said Mrs Fred, and stoodleaning on the table, looking at her brother-in-lawwith a calm curiosity, not unlike that of her children." Nettie and my husband have gone out together; butnow that we are all so happy and united," she con-tinued, with a sort of feeble spitefulness, " I am sureit is quite a pity to trouble you. You could not takeus in, you know. You said that very plain, Mr Ed-ward.""It was perfectly true, madam," said the doctor."I have not ventured on the step my brother hastaken, and have naturally no accommodation for afamily.

Then they entered the room-thee tiny, bright, dauntless, an intrepid, undiscourage-be little soul; the other with his heavy large limbs,is bemused face, his air of hopeless failure, idleness,content.  Edward Rider gazed involuntarily fromone to another of this two. He saw the sprite placeherself between the husband and wife, a vain littleQuixote, balancing these extremes of helplessness andruin. He could not help looking at her with a certainunconscious admiration and amazement, as he might have looked at a forlorn hope. Thousands of milesaway from her friends, wherever and whatever theymight be, with Fred and his wife and children on herhands, a household of incapables-what was that little creature to do ?" Good morning, Dr Edward," said Nettie.

A dull amount of conversation, ofteninterrupted by that lively little woman, rose in theuncongenial party. Nettie cut up the meat for thosestaring imps of children-did them all up in snowynapkins-kept them silent and in order.

He could notbring himself to speak with ordinary patience to Fred;and Fred, obtuse as he was, perceived his brother's dis-gust and contempt, and resented it sullenly; and be-trayed his resentment to the foolish wife, who sulkedand said spiteful things to Edward.

The shadow ofRt Roque's fell cold over him as he passed. Just fromat spot the light in the parlour window of the cot-age became perceptible to the wayfarer. A shadowrossed the blind as he came in sight-Nettie un-uestionably.

Thedoctor, who was not aware that music was one ofNettie's accomplishments, stopped on the stairs tolisten. And indeed she had not a great deal of voice,and still less science, Nettie's life having been tooentirely occupied to leave much room for such studies.Yet somehow her song touched the doctor's heart.He forgave her entirely that walk with the curate.te went in softly, less impatient than usual with hercrazy Quixotism.

Ah, what a descent itas the moment his foot touched these vulgar flags,was once more the hard-worked doctor at every-dy's command, with a fretful patient waiting forim a mile beyond St Roqu's; and all these dazzlingoments, which had rapt the unfortunate young fellowto another world, were so much time lost to the prosegure that had to help Nettie down and let her go,d betake himself soberly about his own business.erhaps Nettie felt it a little disenchanting too, whene was dropped upon the bare street, and went intohe common shop, and saw the doctor's drag flash offn the red frosty sunshine with a darting movement ofxasperation and impatience on the part of its aggra-aed driver.

That was a step the doctor was nopared for. Some people are compelled to taprose concerns of life into full consideration even lthey are in love, and Edward Rider was one of unfortunate individuals.  The boldness which:everything to the touch to gain or lose was not iyoung man. He had been put to hard encoenough in his day, and had learned to trust litchance or good fortune.

That he despised himself for doing so, didnot make the matter easier.  These were the limits ofhis nature, and beyond them he could not pass.Accordingly matters went on in this dangerousfashion for many weeks longer. The fire smouldered,strengthening its pent-up flames.  Day by day mali-cious sprites of thought went out behind Dr Riderin his drag, leading him into the wildest calculations,the most painful complication of schemes. If Fredand his family could only be persuaded to return toAustralia, his brother thought-if any bribe withinEdward's means could tempt the ruined man to sucha step; and when he was there, why there was Pro-vidence to take care of the helpless unlovely house-hold, and necessity might compel the wretched fatherto work for his children. Such were the vain projects-that revolved and fermented through the doctor's agi-tated brain as he went among his patients.  Luckilyhe had a very favourable and well-disposed lot ofsick people at that crisis-they all got well in spiteof the doctor, and gave their own special cases andhis anxiety all the credit for his grave looks; and allthese half-finished streets and rough new roads in theeast end of Carlingford were sown thick with thebootless suggestions of Dr Rider's love and fears.K<pb n="146"/>146        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:The crop did not show upon the vulgar soil, but  _lurking associations to every half-built street-which he passed in his rounds many a day afterserved at this present momentous era to confuse dthe chaos of his thoughts. At last one night the crisis came.  Spring begun to show faintly in the lengthening days-spthat so often belies itself, and comes with a serptooth. Dr Rider on that particular day had metMajoribanks at some meeting convened in the interof Carlingford.

These twofigures were unquestionably Nettie for one, and MrWentworth for another. Handsome young coxcomb,with all his Puseyitical pretences! Was Lucy Wode-house not enough for him, that he must have Nettietoo? Dr Rider hurried forward to interrupt thatmeeting. He was actually turning with her, walkingslowly back again the very way he had just come !Edward's blood boiled in his impatient veins.  Heswept along in a whirlwind of sudden wrath. Whenhe came up to them Nettie was talking low, and thecurate's lofty head was bent to hear her in a mannerwhich, it is probable, Lucy Wodehouse would no morehave admired than Edward Rider. They came to asudden pause when he joined them, in that particularconversation. The doctor's dread civility did not im-prove matters. Without asking himself what cause hehad, this aimable young man plunged into the wildestjealousy without pause or interval. He bestowed uponNettie the most cutting looks, the most overwhelmingpoliteness.  When the three had marched solemnlyabreast down the road for some few minutes, the cur-ate, perhaps with an intuition of fellow-feeling, per-ceiving how the matter was, stopped short and saidgood-bye. " I will make inquiries, and let you know<pb n="148"/>148       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:next time I pass the cottage," said Mr Wentw:and he and the doctor took off their hats, not witdeadly thoughts on one side at least.

But I am surprised to find MissUnderwood walking so late. This is not a road for alady by herself."" You know I don't mind in the least for the road,"said Nettie, with a little indignation. " How wonder-fully cross you are sometimes ! If you are going asfar as the Cottage," she added, with a little sigh offatigue, "will you please carry some of these thingsfor me? I could not get out sooner, I have been sobusy to-day. It is wonderful how much needlework ittakes to keep three children going, and how many littlejobs there are to do. If you take this parcel, carry itcarefully, please: it is something for my bonnet.There! Don't be absurd. I am quite able to walkby myself, thank you-I'd rather, please !"This remonstrance was called forth by the fact that'the relenting doctor, much moved by having the par-cels confided to his care, had drawn the little handwhich gave them within his arm, a proceeding whichNettie distinctly disapproved of. She withdrew herhand quickly, and walked on with much dignity byhis side."I can carry your parcels," said Edward, after a littlepause, "but you will not let me help yourself. Youtake the heaviest burdens upon your shoulders, andthen will have no assistance in bearing them.

"But you mean it, Dr Edward," she said, a moment after, slightly coaxing tone.  "You are tired and cross your day's work.

He burst forth into a passioutbreak of love and anger, curiously mingled, buwarm and real to leave Nettie much coolness of o°vation under the circumstances.  She took the atage over him which a woman naturally does ina case.

She madeno answer till the whole agitated self-disclosure wascomplete. In the interval she got a little command ofherself, and was able to speak when it came to herturn." Dr Edward," said Nettie, solemnly, "you know itis impossible.  If we cared for each other ever somuch, what could we do ? I am not free to-to makeany change; and I know very well, and so do you,that you never could put up with Fred and Susan andthe children, were things as you say ten times over.I don't mean I don't believe you.

"I don't needto enter into all the business again, and tell you howthings stand; you know as well as I do.

Nettie, with all her nine acuteness, could not divine that this calm treating a business which had wrought her compiinto such a pitch of passion, was the most humiliand mortifying possible to a man in whose bosomand pride were so combined. He tried to speak than once, but could not. Nettie said nothing mdshe was uneasy, but secure in the necessity of her:position. What else could she do or say?"Then, I presume, this is my answer," saiddoctor, at last, gulping an amount of shame andwhich Nettie could not conceive of, and whicfdarkness concealed from her sight."Oh, Dr Edward, what can I say ?" cried the"you know it all as well as I do.

Btime they had almost reached the cottage door. :."Don't take the trouble to be sorry. I'll-get over it!

Neither of the twodared face that sudden gleam.

What smallmatters sometimes bring about that sudden disen-chantment ! Two or three words exchanged withoutmuch thought-one figure disappearing out of thelandscape-and, lo! all the prismatic colours havefaded from the horizon, and blank daylight glares uponstartled eyes ! Nettie had not, up to this time, enter-tained a suspicion of hbw distinct a place the doctorheld in her limited firmament--she was totally un-aware how much exhilaration and support there was inhis troubled, exasperated, impatient admiration. Now,all at once, she found it out. It was the same life,yet it was different. Her occupations were unchanged,her surroundings just what they used to be.  She hadstill to tolerate Fred, to manage Susan, to superintendwith steady economy all the expenditure of the strangelittle household. The very rooms and aspect of every-thing was the same; yet had she been suddenly trans-.<pb n="156"/>156       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: ported back again to the Antipodes, life could _have been more completely changed to Nettie. recognised it at once with some surprise, but wilany struggle.

It was not that shehad ever entered, even in thought, as Edward Riderbad done, into that life, glorified out of common exist-ence, which the two could have lived together. Suchwas not the form which this extraordinary loss took toNettie. It was her personal happiness, wonderfulwine of life, which had suddenly failed to the bravelittle girl.  Ah, the difference it made!  Labours,disgusts, endurances of all kinds: what cannot oneundertake so long as one has that cordial at one'sheart? When the endurance and the labour remain,and the cordial is gone, it is a changed world intowhich the surprised soul enters. This was what hadhappened to Nettie.  Nobody suspected the suddenchange which had passed upon everything.  The onlyindividual in the world who could have divined it, hadpersuaded himself in a flush of anger and mortificationthat she did not care. He consoled himself by ela-borate avoidance of that road which led past St Roque's-by bows of elaborate politeness when he encounteredher anywhere in the streets of Carlingford-by takinga sudden plunge into such society as was open to himin the town, and devoting himself to Miss Marjori-banks, the old physician's daughter.

Misslgarjoribanks, it is true, was over thirty, and by nomeans a Titania. Edward Rider, who had retired fromthe field in Bessie Christian's case, and whom Nettiehad rejected, asked himself savagely why he shouldnot make an advantageous marriage now, when thechance offered. Old Marjoribanks's practice and sav-ings, with a not unagreeable, rather clever, middle-aged wife-why should he not take it into considera-tion? The young doctor thought of that possibilitywith a certain thrill of cruel pleasure. He said tohimself that he would make his fortune, and be re-venged on Nettie. Whenever there was a chance ofNettie hearing of it, he paid the most devoted atten-tions to Miss Marjoribanks. Ready gossips took it upand made the matter public.   Everybody agreed itwould be an admirable arrangement.     "The mostsensible thing I've heard of for years-step into theold fellow's practice, and set himself up for life-eh,don't you think so ?-that's my opinion," said MrWodehouse.

She tried, indeed, to calculate in herself, withforlorn heroism, how long it might be expected to last,and, though she could not fix the period, endeavouredto content herself with the thought that things musteventually fall into their natural condition.  In themean time it was slow and tedious work enough-but they did pass one after another, these inevitabledays.One night Nettie was sitting by herself in theparlour busy over her needlework. Fred and his wife,'she thought, were up-stairs. They had left her earlyin the evening-Susan to lie down, being tired; Fredto his ordinary amusements.   It was a matter ofcourse, and cost Nettie no special thought. After theihildren went to bed, she sat all by herself, with herithread and scissors on the table, working on steadilyand quietly at the little garment she was making.>Her needle flew swift and nimbly; the sleeve of herdress rustled as she moved her arm; her soft breathwent and came: but for that regular monotonousmovement, and those faint steady sounds of life, itmight have been a picture of domestic tranquillity andquiet, and not a living woman with aches in her heart.L<pb n="162"/>162        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:It did not matter what she was thinking.facing life and fortune-indomitable, not to,couraged.

Susancame in stealthy, pale, trembling with cold and fright.I She came forward to the table in her white night-dress like a faded ghost. "Fred has never come in,"said Susan, in a shivering whisper; " is it very late ?He promised he would only be gone an hour. Wherecan he have gone? Nettie, Nettie, don't sit so quietand stare at me.

At last the terrible paledawn came in and took the light out of Nettie's candle.The two looked at each other, and acknowledged witha mutual start that the night was over.

The daylight, after the first shock of find-ing that the night was really over, brought some com-fort to her foolish heart. She thought that as Nettiesaid " no more harm " could come to him, he must besleeping somewhere, the foolish fellow. She thoughtmost likely Nettie was right, and that she had best goto bed to consume the weary time till there could besomething heard of him; and Nettie, of course, wouldfind it all out.Such was the arrangement accordingly.    Susancovered herself up warm, and lay thinking all sheshould say to him when he came home, and how shecertainly never would again let him go out and keepit secret from Nettie. Nettie, for her part, bathed herhot eyes, put on her bonnet, and went out, quietlyundoing all the bolts and bars, into the chill morningworld, where nobody was yet awake.

In her own room, where she had not sleptthat night, little Freddy was still sleeping. In anotherwas the widow, overcome by watching and fretfulanxiety. The other fatherless creatures lay in the littledressing-room.  Nowhere but in the parlour, fromwhich Fred not so very long ago had driven his dis-gusted brother-the only place she had where Nettie'sown feminine niceties could find expression, and wherethe accessories of her own daily life and work were allaccumulated.

She went back, withoutanswering him, to lift the shawl from that dreadfulface, and satisfy herself whether she had done thatlast irremediable wrong to Fred. As she met thedreadful stare of those dead eyes, all the revulsion offeeling which comes to the hearts of the living inpresence of the dead overpowered Nettie.  She gavea little cry of inarticulate momentary anguish.  Thesoul of that confused and tremulous outcry was Par-don! pardon!   What love was ever so true, whattenderness so constant and unfailing, that did notIinstinctively utter that cry when the watched life hadended, and pardon could no longer come from thosesealed lips? Nettie had not loved that shamed andruined man--she had done him the offices of affection,and endured and sometimes scorned him. She stoodremorseful by his side in that first dread hour, whichhad changed Fred's shabby presence into somethingawful; and her generous soul burst forth in that crytof penitence which every human creature owes itsbrother. The tender-hearted bargeman who had asked<pb n="174"/>174       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:leave to fetch a doctor, drew near her with a kitinstinct-" Don't take on, miss-there's the cr'yet-and a deal to look to," said the kind rouglow, who knew Nettie.

We have been watching for him all night, andpoor Susan is sleeping, and does not know.""Know what ?-what has happened ?-he's beenand killed himself? Oh, miss, don't you go for to sayso!" cried Mrs Smith, in natural dismay and terror."No," cried Nettie, with a long sigh that relieved,her breast, "not so bad as that, thank Heaven; buthush, hush! I cannot go and tell Susan just yet-not just yet. Oh, give me a moment to get breath !For he is dead! I tell you, hush!" cried Nettie,lseizing the woman's hand, and wringing it, in the'extremity of her terror for alarming Susan.  "Don'tyou understand me?

Have you no pity for her in your own heart ?"" Lord ha' mercy ! but wait till I call Smith," criedthe alarmed landlady, shrinking, yet eager to knowthe horribly interesting details of that tragedy.

She was brought suddeJa standstill at this terrible moment, and sat t her dauntless little face to the new trial beforpale, but undismayed.  Nettie did not deceiveeven in her thoughts.   She saw, with the inforesight of a keen observer, her sister's violenmentary grief, her indolent acceptance of the poafter a while, the selfish reserve of repining ancontent which Susan would establish in the meof poor Fred: she saw how, with fuller certaintyjever, because now more naturally, she herselmind, her laborious hands, her little fortune,belong to the fatherless family. She did not sig,the prospect, or falter; but she exercised no selsion on the subject.  There was nobody but she<pb n="177"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.            177,it-nobody but she, in her tender maidenhood, toi.anage all the vulgar tragical business which must,this very day, confirm to the knowledge of the littlesurrounding world the event which had happened-nobody but herself to tell the tale to the widow, tobear all the burdens of the time. Nettie did not thinkover these particulars with self-pity, or wonder overher hard lot. She did not imagine herself to havechosen this lot at all. There was nobody else to do it-that was the simple secret of her strength.But this interval of forlorn repose was a very briefone. Smith came down putting on his coat, and look-ing scared and bewildered; his wife, eager, curious,and excited, closely following. Nettie rose when theyapproached her to forestall their questions." My brother-in-law is dead," she said. " He fellinto the canal last night and was drowned. I wentout to look for him, and-and found him, poor fellow!Oh don't cry out or make a noise: remember Susandoes not know!

Smith canfor Dr Marjoribanks; he's nearer nor Dr Rider," the curious excited landlady, with her hand upon,locked door.Nettie made no answer. She took them into?:room in solemn silence, and showed them the and ghastly figure, for which all possibilities had over in the dark midnight waters hours ago. earliest gleam of sunshine came shining in at:,moment through the window which last night Nhad opened that Fred might see the light in itibe guided home. It seemed to strike like a reprupon that quick-throbbing impatient heart, whicfas a sin against the dead its own lack of naturaland affection. She went hurriedly to draw doblinds and close out the unwelcome light. " Nis gone, nobody shall slight or scorn him," said N'to herself, with hot tears ; and she turned the woing dismayed couple-already awakening out of first horror, to think of the injury done to their hand " lodgings," and all the notoriety of an inquout of the room, and locked the door upon the uiing owners, whom nothing but her resolute faceivented from  bursting forth in selfish but nm<pb n="179"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.             179lamentations over their own secondary share in so dis-astrous an event. Nettie sat down again, a silent littlesentinel by the closed door, without her shawl, andwith her tiny chilled feet on the cold tiles. Nettie satsilent, too much occupied even to ascertain the causesof her personal discomfort. She had indeed enough tothink of; and while her little girlish figure, so dainty,so light, so unlike her fortunes, remained in that un-usual stillness, her mind and heart were palpitatingwith thoughts-all kinds of thoughts; not only consi-derations worthy the solemnity and horror of themoment, but every kind of trivial and secondary neces-sity passed through that restless soul, all throbbingwith life and action, more self-conscious than usualfrom the fact of its outward stillness. A hundredrapid conclusions and calculations about the funeral,the mourning, the change of domestic habits involved,darted through Nettie's mind. It was a relief to herto leap forward into these after-matters. The imme-diate necessity before her-the dreadful errand onwhich she must presently go to her sister's bedside-the burst of wailing and reproachful grief which allalone Nettie would have to encounter and subdue, werenot to be thought of. She bent down her little headinto her hands, and once more shed back that hairWhich, never relieved out of its braids through all thislong night, began to droop over her pale cheeks; and<pb n="180"/>180        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:a quick sigh of impatience, of energy restrainesuch powerlessness as her courageous capable sothe very excess-of its courage and capacity, felt iapproaching conflict with the feeble foolish crealwho never could be stimulated out of her own napossibilities, burst from Nettie's breast. But the,was as much physical as mental-the long-dbreath of mingled weariness and restlessness-thestinct to be doing, and the exhaustion of long laand emotion, blended together. Thus she waited the cold spring morning brightened, and Mrs Swent about her early domestic business, retur.often into the little back-parlour with the mulliwindow, of which domestic Gothic treatment had a condemned cell, to re-express her anxietieshorrors. Nettie had an instinctive consciousnessof Mrs Smith's grievance.  She knew this dismalciation would ruin "the lodgings," and felt that was another bond upon her to remain at St Roqhowever much she might long to escape and iaway.All these crowding and breathless thoughts wfew minutes after reduced to absolute momentaryness.

But he stood still, Wi'certain self-reproach, to withdraw his thoughts, icould, from Nettie, and to subdue the thrill-theliving touch of life-which this meeting had stwithin him, before he entered that miserable cha;of death.4'i<pb n="183"/>CHAPTER XI.THAT dreadful day ebbed over slowly-tedious, yet sofull of events and dismal business that it looked like ayear rather than a day. The necessary investigationswere got through without any special call upon Nettie.She spent the most of the day up-stairs with Susan,whose wild refusal to believe at first, and sullen stuporafterwards, were little different from the picture which,Nettie's imagination had already made. The childrenreceived the news with wondering stares and questions.That they did not understand it was little, but thatthey scarcely were interested after the first movementof curiosity, disappointed and wounded the impatient.heart, which unconsciously chafed at its own total in-ability to convey the feelings natural to such a terribleoccasion, into any bosom but its own. Nettie's per-petual activity had hitherto saved her from this disgustand disappointment. She had been bitterly intolerantby moments of Fred's disgraceful content and satisfac-<pb n="184"/>184        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:tion with his own indulgences, but had never pau/fret over what she could not help, nor contrast herhigh youthful honour and sense of duty with thinsensibility around her.  But to-day had rapheroic little girl into a different atmosphere fromshe had been breathing hitherto.  To-day sheaware that her work had been so far taken out ohands, and acknowledged in her heart that itbest it should be so. She heard the heavy femen coming and going, but was not obliged tscend into immediate conflict with all the ci,stances of so horrible a crisis. It was a new sento Nettie. A year ago, perhaps, she would not.relinquished even that dreadful business to any to-day, the thought of having some one else wit for her, and took comfort in relieving her burhands, fell with singular soothing power upoheart which had come to a knowledge of its,weakness in these last tedious months; and as sat up-stairs with all the remorseful thoughts of in her softened heart, the impossibility of impreher own emotions upon those around her strucwith a deeper sense of impatience, disappointand disgust than ever before. When she wentinto the darkened room   where Susan lay igloomy bed, divided between wailings over tjuries which poor Fred had suffered, the hart<pb n="185"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.            185that had driven him out of doors, and the want ofhis brother or somebody to take care of him, whichhad brought the poor fellow to such an end-andcomplaints of the wrong done to herself, the " want offeeling" shown by her sister, the neglect with whichshe was treated, Nettie gazed at the sobbing creaturewith eyes unconsciously wondering, yet but half-sur-prised. She knew very well beforehand that thiswas how her dreadful tidings would be received; yetout of her own softened, awed, compunctious heart-her pity too deep for tears over that lost life-Nettielooked with the unbelief of nature at the widowedwoman, the creature who had loved him, and beenhis wife-yet who could only think of somebody elseto be blamed, and of herself injured, at that terriblemoment when the companion of her life was violentlywithdrawn from her. And to go out of that obsti-nately darkened refuge of fretful sorrow, into theroom where the blind had been drawn up the momenther back was turned, and where these three tearlesschildren, totally unimpressed by the information whichthey had received as a piece of news with mingledcuriosity and scepticism, occupied themselves with theirusual sports, or listened keenly, with sharp remarks,to the sounds below, which only the utmost stretchof Nettie's authority could keep them from descendingto investigate, afforded a wonderful reverse to the<pb n="186"/>186       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD :      ipicture, which startled her in her momentary¢isightedness. The contrast between her own fe-she who had no bonds of natural affection to Iand to whom he had been, by times, a very irkburden-and theirs, who were his very own, anlonged to him, appeared to Nettie as no such conhad ever appeared before. Her heart alone was hiwith regret over the ruined man-the now for::unredeemable life: she only, to whom his deathlno loss, but even, if she could have permitted'cruel thought to intervene, a gain and relief,  hnised with a pang of compassion almost as shagrief, that grievous, miserable fate.  When, a' minutes after, the noise of the children's play:to an outburst, Nettie flushed into a momeneffusion of temper, and silenced the heartless ,with a voice and look which they dared not veto resist. Her rebuke was, however, interrupteda sudden call from their mother. " How can you the heart !-Oh, Nettie, Nettie ! I knew you hagfeeling !-you never had any feeling since you w'baby-but how can you speak so to his poor chilnow that he has left them on the cold world ? " Susan, sobbing from her bed. If Nettie sprangher feet in sudden heat and disgust, and peremptoclosed the doors intervening between the chiland their mother, nobody will much wonder at <pb n="187"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.             187movement of impatience. Perhaps Nettie's eyes hadnever been so entirely opened to the hopeless characterof the charge she had taken upon her, as in the tem-porary seclusion of that day.And meanwhile, down-stairs, Edward Rider wassuperintending all the arrangements of the time forNettie's sake. Not because it was his brother wholay there, no longer a burden to any man; nor becausenatural duty pointed him out as the natural guardianof the orphaned family. The doctor, indeed, wouldhave done his duty in such a hard case, however ithad been required of him; but the circumstances weredifferent now: the melancholy bustle, the shame, theconsciousness that everybody knew what manner ofexistence this lost life had been, the exposure, thepublicity-all that would have wrung with a hundredsharp wounds a spirit so susceptible to public com-ments- came with dulled force upon the doctor'smind to-day. When the people about saw the graveand seemly composure with which he went about thisdismal business, without those starts and flushes ofgrievous irritation and shame which the very mentionof his brother had once brought upon him, they be-lieved, and honoured him in the belief, that death hadawakened the ancient fraternal kindness in EdwardRider's heart. But it was not fraternal kindness thatSmoothed off the rude edges of that burden; it was<pb n="188"/>188       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:the consciousness of doing Nettie's work foitaking her place, sparing that creature, over his heart yearned, the hardest and painfulest busshe had yet been involved in. We cannot takefor the doctor which he did not deserve. He forFred when he saw his motionless figure, never modo evil or offend in this world, laid in pitiful solin that room, which still was Nettie's room,iwhich even in death he grudged to his brother.Edward's distinct apprehension of right and wIand Fred's deserts in this world, were not alterethat diviner compunction which had moved Nettie..;forgave, but did not forget, nor defend with remotenderness his brother's memory. Not for Fred'sbut Nettie's, he held his place in the troubled coand assumed the position of head of the family.certainties of experience prevented the doctor's aginative mind from respecting here the ideal an'of sudden widowhood and bereavement. This conclusion noways unnatural or surprising for'a life as Fred's-and Edward knew, with thattemptuous hardness into which incessant percontact with the world drives most men, that nthe wife nor the children were capable of deep ormanent feeling. "They will only hang upon hithe heavier," he said to himself, bitterly; and for<pb n="189"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.              189with repentant love, Edward Rider exerted himself.In all the house no heart, but Nettie's alone, acknow-ledged an ache of pity for Fred and his ruined life.,"Mrs Rider, to be sure, will feel at first-it's onlynatural," said Mrs Smith; "but there wasn't nothingelse to be looked for ; and if it were not hardheartedto say it, and him lying in his coffin, they'll be a dealbetter off without him  nor with him.    But Smithand me, we have ourselves to look to, and it's aterrible blow, is this, to a house, as was always asrespectable as ere a one in Carlingford.   The lodg-ings is ruined!  The very marks of the feet, if itwas nothing else! " cried the afflicted landlady, con-templating the scratched tiles in the hall with actualtears of vexation and regret. But this was the truestate of the case to every unconcerned spectator.Only Nettie, on whom the burden had fallen, and wasyet to fall heaviest, felt the eyes which were hot andheavy with watching, grow dim with tears of unspeak-able compassion. From the fulness of her youth andstrength-strength so burdened, youth so dauntless anddutiful-Nettie gazed with a pity too deep for wordsat the awful spectacle of that existence lost.  That thelifeless thing in the room below could have been aman, and yet have come and gone so disastrouslythrough the world, was terrible to think of, to that<pb n="190"/>190        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD. living labouring creature, in the depth of histrange toils and responsibilities.

Had he been the prop of his house and theght of their eyes, life would have gone on again afterat interruption, all the same, with a persistencyhich nothing can impair.  As it was, the diminishedousehold resumed its ordinary course of existence,er a very few days, with little more than outwardarks of what had befallen them. It is true thatettie sat down with a repugnance which she scarcelyuld either overcome or conceal, to dispense the°mestic provisions at the table which shortly befored borne so dread a burden. But nobody thought ofat except Nettie; and but for the black dresses andslan's cap, Fred was as if he had never been.<pb n="192"/>192       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:About a week after the funeral, the doctor'solemnly to visit them in one of those lengthspring afternoons. Dr Rider was undeniably neand excited about this interview.

Adashed with agitated haste down Grange Lane, heMiss Wodehouse and her sister Lucy coming froRoque's, where very probably they too had beening a visit of condolence to Nettie; and a little nthat scene of all his cogitations and troubles appea much less welcome sight, Miss Marjoribanks, all Carlingford, a month ago, had declared Dr Ribe "paying his addresses " to.

The experimi<pb n="193"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.            193failed as entirely as it deserved to do; and here wasEdward Rider, coming back wiser and humbler, con-tent to put that question over again, and stand oncemore his chance of what his pride had called a rejec-tion, perhaps content to make still greater sacrifices, ifthe truth were known, and to do anything Nettie askedhim, if Nettie would but condescend to ask or enterinto terms at all.He drew up before St Roque's with a dash, whichwas much more of agitation than display, and, throw-ing the reins at the head of his little groom, leapedout like a man who did not see where he was going.Ee saw Mr Wentworth, however, coming out of thechurch, and turning round amazed to look what vehiclehad come to so sudden a standstill there. All theworld seemed to be on the road to St Roque's Cottage;hat spring afternoon. The doctor made a surly ges-;ure of recognition as he passed the curate, who gazedit him in calm astonishment from the church porch.No other intruder appeared between him and theCottage. He hurried along past the willow-trees withtheir drooping tassels, surrounded by a certain mazef excitement and agitation. As he went up to theloor, it occurred to him suddenly how Nettie had re-rognised his step that dread morning of Fred's death.*he thought came like a stimulus and encouragemento the doctor.

Evidently shedid not interfere with this development of sorrow.Nettie had enough to do besides with her needle work,and to enjoin a moderate amount of quietness uponFreddy and his little sister, who were building woodenbricks into houses and castles on the floor by her side.When the doctor entered the room he saw how it waswith instantaneous insight. Mrs Fred was sitting instate, in the pomp of woe, to receive all the compas-sionate people who might come to condole with her.Nettie, half impatient, half glad that her sister couldamuse herself so, sat in busy toleration, putting upwith it, carrying on her own work through it all-andstill, as always, those bonds of her own making closedhard and tenacious upon the prop of the house. Eventhe chance of speaking with her by herself died off intoextreme distance. Young Rider, who came in withthe fall conviction that anger could never more rise inhis heart against Nettie, grew pale with passion, resent-ment, and impatience before he had been a minute inthe room. Always the same! Not relieved out of herbondage-closer bound and prisoned than ever! Hetook, with an impatient involuntary commotion, thechair placed beside the sofa, and sat down in it abruptlywith the briefest salutations. His hopes and anticipa-tions all went bitterly back upon his heart.

"Nowthat you are left to yourself, Mrs Rider, what do youthink of doing? Of course you must have some plansabout the children and your future life ?"Mrs Fred looked up at him with momentary alarmand dismay.  She did not know what the questionmeant, but a certain vague terror seized her.  Itseemed to imply somehow that she was now to beleft to her own resources. She gave a certain gasp ofappeal to "Nettie !" and took refuge once more in herhandkerchief. The doctor was desperate-he had nomercy in him."Nettie! always Nettie!" cried the young man."And is it true, Nettie-is it all the same ? Are youalways to go on toiling for the miserable comforts ofother people? What is to become of us ? Have yousold yourself to this fate ?"Nettie laid down the little black frock out of herlaborious hands. "You have been up all night, DrEdward," she said, with a certain tenderness, lookingat his agitated face; "you are tired out and sick atthe heart. I know it makes you say things you wouldnot say; but after all, you know, except poor Fred,whom none of you think of, everything is the verySame. I cannot make it different-nothing can makeit different. There is Susan plain enough to be seen<pb n="198"/>198        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:-and there are the children.

He weniNettie's side with a sudden thrill of agitation and sion. He clasped the hand with which Nettiesmoothing out that little frock, and crushed thecate fingers in his inconsiderate grasp.  "Neif you must carry them   always upon your shders, cannot we do it together, at least?" cried;doctor, carried away beyond every boundary of or prudence. He got down on his knees beside,table, not kneeling to her, but only compellingattention-demanding to see the answer of her ethe quiver of her mouth. For that moment Netldefences too fell before this unlooked-for outburst <pb n="199"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.            199love that had forgotten prudence. Her mouth quivered,her eyes filled. If it were possible-if it were onlypossible !--  They had both forgotten the spectatorswho gazed with curious eyes, all unaware how deeplytheir own fate was involved; and that fate was stilltrembling in the breathless interval, when a vulgarfinger touched those delicate balances of possibility,and the crisis was over, perhaps never to return."Nettie!" cried Mrs Fred, "if Edward Rider hasno respect for me, nor for my poor Fred-my poor,dear, injured husband, that helped to bring him up,and gave up his practice to him, and died, as I mightsay, by his neglect-Nettie ! how can you be so cruelto your sister ? How can you go taking his hand, andlooking as if he were your lover ? You never had anyfeeling for me, though everybody thinks so much ofyou. And now I know what I have to expect. Themoment my poor dear Fred's head is laid in the grave-as soon as ever you have me in your own hands, andnobody to protect me !-oh, my Fred! my Fred !-assoon as you are gone, this is how they are using yourpoor helpless family !-and soon, soon I shall die too,and you will not be encumbered with me !"Long before this sobbing speech was concluded, DrRider had risen to his feet, and was pacing throughthe little room with hasty steps of disgust and rage,and an agitation which overwhelmed all his attempts<pb n="200"/>200        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:to master it; while Nettie sat supporting her heaher hands, pressing her fingers upon her hot, eyes,holding that fair impossible vision break and disapfrom before her. Nettie's heart groaned withinand beat against the delicate bosom which, in its der weakness, was mighty as a giant's. She madeanswer to her sister's outcry, nor attempted to conwthe hysterical sobbing into which Susan fell. Ngave up the hopeless business without being deceby those selfish demonstrations. She was notfortunate enough to be able to persuade herselfadmiring love and enthusiasm for those to whom nsity obliged her to give up her own life. She nothing; she knew the sobs would subside, thewould be gained, the insignificant soul lapse into cfort, and with a sigh of compulsory resignation N!yielded once more to her fate."Dr Edward, do not think of me any morej",:said, resolutely, rising and going out to the door him, in her simplicity and courage. "You see well it is impossible. I know you see it as well do. If we could be friends as we once were, I shbe very, very glad, but I don't think it is possible now. Don't say anything. We both know how iand neither of us can help it. If we could get nothink of each other, that would be best," said Net<pb n="201"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.           201with another sigh; "but in the mean time let us saygood-bye, and speak of it no more."If the doctor did not take his dismissal exactly so-if Nettie's identification of her own sentiments withhis, did lead to a warmer tenderness in that farewell,which could not be final while such a bond unitedthem, it was at least with an absolute conviction of theimpossibility of any closer union that they parted. Thedoctor sprang into his drag and dashed away to hispatients, plunging into the work which he had some-what neglected during that exciting day. He was notwithout some comfort as he went about his businesswith Care behind him, but that very comfort embit-tered the pang of the compulsory submission.  Tothink he must leave her there with those burdensupon her delicate shoulders - to believe her his, yetnot his, the victim of an unnatural bondage - droveEdward Rider desperate as he devoured the way. Ahundred times in an hour he made up his mind tohasten back again and snatch her forcibly out of thatthraldom, and yet a hundred times had to fall backconsuming his heart with fiery irritation, and chafingat all that seemed duty and necessity to Nettie. Ashe was proceeding on his troubled way it occurred tohim to meet-surely everybody in Carlingford was outof doors this particular afternoon ! -that prosperouswife, Mrs John Brown, who had once been Bessie<pb n="202"/>202       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:Christian.  She was a very pale apparition now to:doctor, engrossed as he was with an influence nmore imperious and enthralling than hers had been; but the sight of her, on this day of all otwas not without its effect upon Edward Rider.not she too been burdened with responsibilities wthe doctor would not venture to take upon his shders, but which another man, more daring, had taand rendered bearable? As the thought of thatsibility occurred to him, a sudden vision of Mrs Fifaded figure flashed across his eyes. In the exciteof the moment he touched too sharply with histhat horse which had suffered the penalty of mo,his vagaries of temper and imagination for some,:past. The long-suffering beast was aggravated opatience by that unexpected irritation.

Bewith a little palpitation at her heart, could not retfrom a passing wonder whether the sight of hhad anything to do with that sudden conflict.<pb n="203"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.            203Brown knew little about St Roque's Cottage, but hadheard of Miss Marjoribanks, who it was not to be sup-posed could hold a very absolute sway over the doctor.Meanwhile Dr Rider struggled with his horse with allthe intensity of determination with which he wouldhave struggled against his fate had that been practic-able. With set teeth and eyes that blazed with suddenrage and resolution, he subdued the unruly brute, andforced it to acknowledge his mastery. When he drovethe vanquished animal, all quivering with pain andpassion, on its further course, the struggle had re-freshed his mind a little. Ah, if life and adverse for-tune could but be vanquished so!-but all EdwardRider's resolution and courage died into hopeless dis-gust before the recollection of Mrs Fred upon thatsofa. Even with Nettie at one hand, that peevishphantom on the other, those heartless imps in insolentpossession of the wonderful little guardian who wouldnot forsake them, made up a picture which made thedoctor's heart sick. No! Nettie was right. It wasimpossible. Love, patience, charity, after all, are buthuman qualities, when they have to be held againstdaily disgusts, irritations, and miseries. The doctorknew as well as Nettie did that he could not bear it.He knew even, as perhaps Nettie did not know, thather own image would suffer from the association; andthat a man so faulty and imperfect as himself could<pb n="204"/>204        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD not long refrain from resenting upon his 'mal restraints of such a burden.

Thesame Susan whose ceaseless discontents and selfish lovehad driven Nettie across the seas to look for Fred, wasnow reposing on that sofa in her widow's cap, altoge-ther unchanged, as helpless and unabandonable, as de-pendent, as much a fool as ever. The superior wretch-edness of Fred's presence and life had partially veiledSusan's character since they came to Carlingford. Nowshe had the field to herself again, and Nettie recognisedat once the familiar picture. From the moment whenSusan in her mourning came down-stairs, Nettie ac-knowledged the weakness of circumstances, the perti-nacity of nature. What could she do ?-she gave upthe scarcely-formed germ of hope that had begun toappear in her breast. She made up her mind silentlyto what must be. No agonies of martyrdom couldhave made Nettie desert her post and abandon thesehelpless souls. They could do nothing for themselves,old or young of them; and who was there to do it all ?she asked herself, with that perpetual reference tonecessity which was Nettie's sole process of reasoningon the subject. Thus considered, the arguments were<pb n="206"/>206        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:short and telling, the conclusion unmistalkawas this visible piece of business-four hel tures to be supported and provided and thrlife somehow-with nobody in the world bub|tdo it; to bring them daily bread and hourly to keep them alive, and shelter their helplesrefuge and protection.

In that momentary impulseof decision and self-will, a few notes of a song cameunawares from Nettie's lip, as she glanced, light andrapid as a fairy, up-stairs.

Shehad at least come at last to find her life hard, and toacknowledge that this necessity which was laid uponher was grievous by times to flesh and blood; but notthe less for that did she arrange Freddy's little gar-Iments daintily in the drawers, and pause; before she0<pb n="210"/>210       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:went down-stairs again, to cover him up in bed.Susan still sat pondering and crying over Her tears were a great resource to Mrs Freoccupied her when she had nothing else to occself with; and when she cast a weeping gfrom her handkerchief to see Nettie draw hagain to the table, and lay down a little pile fores and tuckers which required supervisiowept still more, and said it was well to be Nenever was overcome by her feelings.

It was now summer, and,warm weather, and the dress of the new-comer was asunusual as the other particulars of his appearance. Inhis broad straw-hat and linen coat he stood cool andlarge in the shady hall of the Blue Boar, with glimpsesof white English linen appearing under his forest ofbeard, and round his brown sun-scorched wrists. Avery small stretch of imagination was necessary to thrustpistols into his belt and a cutlass into his hand, andreveal him as the settler-adventurer of a half-savagedisturbed country, equally ready to work or to' fight,and more at home in the shifts and expedients of thewilderness than among the bonds of civilisation; yetalways retaining, as English adventurers will, certaindainty personal particulars-such, for instance, as thatprejudice in favour of clean linen, which only the highestcivilisation can cultivate into perfection. He went offdown Grange Lane with the swing and poise of a Her-cules, when the admiring waiters directed him to theCottage. Miss Wodehouse, who was standing at thedoor with Lucy, in the long grey cloak and close bon-net lately adopted by the sisterhood of mercy, whichhad timidly, under the auspices of the perpetual curate,set itself a-going at St Roque's, looked after the savageman with an instinct of gentle curiosity, wonderingwhere he was'going and where he came from.

Perhapsthe labours of a sisterhood of mercy require a specialorganisation even of the kind female soul. Miss Wode-house, the most tender-hearted of human creatures, didnot rise to that development; and, with a little pangof unsatisfied wonder, saw the unaccustomed Herculesdisappear in She distance without being able to makeout whither he was bound.Nobody, however, who had been privileged to sharethe advantages of Mrs Fred Rider's conversation forsome time back, could be at a loss to guess who thismessenger from the wilderness was. It was RichardChatham come at last-he with whose name Nettiehad been bored and punctured through and throughfrom the first day of his introduction into Susan's talktill now. Mrs Fred had used largely in the intervalthat all-potent torture of the "continual dropping;"-used it so perpetually as, though without producingany visible effect upon Nettie's resolution, to introduceoften a certain sickness and disgust with everythinginto that steadfast soul. Nor did, she content herselfwith her own exertions, but skilfully managed to in-troduce the idea into the minds of the children-ready,as all children are, for change and novelty. Nettie hadled a hard enough life for these three months. She<pb n="218"/>218       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: could not meet Edward Rider, nor he her, pretence of friendship; and Susan, always and spiteful, and now mistress of the positithe doctor with an amount of angry irritatihis longings for Nettie's society could not qdue.

Not allthe natural generosity of her mind-not that stillstronger argument which she used so often, the merenecessity and inevitableness of the case, could blindher eyes to the fact that she had given up her ownhappiness; and bitter flashes of thought would inter-vene, notwithstanding even the self-contempt and re-proach with which she became aware of them. Thatdoubtful complicated matter, most hard and difficultof mortal problems, pressed hard upon Nettie's mindand heart. In former days, when she scornfully de'niedit to be self-sacrifice, and laboured on, always indomit-able, unconscious that what she did was anything morethan the simplest duty and necessity, all was well withthe dauntless, all-enterprising soul; but growing know-ledge of her own heart, of other hearts, cast dark andperplexing shades upon Nettie, as upon all other way-farers in these complex paths. The effect upon hermind was different from the effect to be expected ac-cording to modern sentimental ethics.   Nettie hadnever doubted of the true duty, the true necessity, ofher position, till she became conscious of her vastsacrifice. Then a hundred doubts appalled her.

It was Christmasagain, and they were wending their way towards StRoque's to assist at the holiday decorations, for whichcartloads of laurel and holly had been already depositedwithin the church. Lucy Wodehouse was chief direct-ress of these important operations. Her sister hadaccompanied her, partly to admire Lucy's work, andpartly to call at the cottage and see how Nettie wasgoing on. Mr Wodehouse himself had come merelyfor the pride and pleasure of seeing how much theywere indebted to his little girl; and the attendanceof the curate was most easily explainable. It was, in-deed, astonishing how many extremely necessary andnatural " calls of duty" should bring Mr Wentworth'spath parallel to that of the Wodehouses.

If that hasty breath was a sigh, there waslittle sound of sorrow in it.  It was a little gust ofimpatience, indignation, intolerance even, and hastyself-assertion. She alone knew what she could do,and must do. Not one other soul in the world be-side could enter into her inevitable work and way.*Nettie did not hear the footstep which she mighthave recognised ringing rapidly down the frosty road.She was too busy rustling about with perpetual motion,folding and refolding, and smoothing into miraculouscompactness all the heterogeneous elements of thatmass.

Nettie, who felt her resolution <pb n="261"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.           261her heart melting, yet knew she dared not give way,clasped her hands tight in each other and stood tremb-ling, yet refusing to tremble; collecting her voice andthoughts. The doctor occupied that moment of sus-pense in a way which might have looked ludicrous inother circumstances, but was a relief to the passionthat possessed him.  He dragged the other vastAustralian box to the same corner where he had setthe first, and piled them one above the other. Thenhe collected with awkward care all the heaps of gar-ments which lay about, and carried them off in theother direction to the stairs, where he laid them care-fully with a clumsy tenderness. When he had sweptaway all these encumbrances, as by a sudden gust ofwind, he came back to Nettie, and once more claspedthe firm hands which held each other fast. She brokeaway from him with a sudden cry-"You acknowledged it was impossible !" cried Nettie."It is not my doing, or anybody's; no one shall takethe world on his shoulders for my sake-I ask nobodyto bear my burdens. Thank you for not believing it-that is a comfort at least. Never, surely, any oneelse-and not you, not you ! Dr Edward, let us makean end of it. I will never consent to put my yokeupon your shoulders, but I-I will never forget you orblame you-any more.

Good-bye-don't make it harder, you, wonly one that-  ; good-bye,-no more--doun'rmore."At this moment the parlour door opened suiNettie's trembling mouth and frame, and thetest and contradiction which were bursting frlips of the doctor, were lost upon the spectasorbed in her own affairs, and full of exciteie!her own account, who looked out.    "PerhEdward will walk in," said Mrs Fred. "Nohere to witness what I mean, I should like to syou, please, Nettie. I did not think I shouappeal to you, Mr Edward, against Nettie's wil-but, really now, we, none of us, can put upany longer. Please to walk in and hear what Ito say."The big Bushman stood before the little fireparlour, extinguishing its tiny glow with his vadow. The lamp burned dimly upon the tabcertain air of confusion was in the room. Perhwas because Nettie had already swept her owticular belongings out of that apartment, whichto the doctor's eyes, had breathed of her presevery corner-but it did not look like Nettie's to-night. Mrs Fred, with the broad white bher cap streaming over her black dress, had jsumed her place on the sofa, which was her d<pb n="263"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.           263throne. Nettie, much startled and taken by surprise,stood by the table, waiting with a certain air of won-dering impatience what was to be said to her-withstill the sleeves turned up from her tiny wrists, andher fingers unconsciously busy expressing her restlessintolerance of this delay by a hundred involuntarytricks and movements. The doctor stood close by her,looking only at Nettie, watching her with eyes intentas if she might suddenly disappear from under his verygaze. As for the Australian, he stood uneasy underNettie's rapid investigating glance, and the slowersurvey which Dr Rider made on entering. He pluckedat his big beard, and spread out his large person witha confusion and embarrassment rather more thanmerely belonged to the stranger in a family party;while Mrs Fred, upon her sofa, took up her handker-chief and once more began to fan her pink cheeks.What was coming? After a moment's pause, uponwhich Nettie could scarcely keep herself from break-ing, Susan spoke."Nettie has always had the upper hand so muchthat she thinks I am  always'to do exactly as shepleases," burst forth Mrs Fred; "and I don't doubtpoor Fred encouraged her in it, because he felt he wasobliged to my family, and always gave in to her; butnow I have somebody to stand by me," added Susan,fanning still more violently, and with a sound in her<pb n="264"/>264       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: voice which betrayed a possibility of tears--have somebody to stand by me-I tell you on°Nettie, I will not go on the 24th." Nettie gazed at her sister in silence withtempting to say anything. Then she lifted hinquiringly to the Australian, in his uneasy spposition before the fire. She was not much posed, evidently, by that sudden assertion ofpossibly Nettie was used to it-but she lookedand roused, and rather eager to know what :now ?"I will not go on the 24th," cried Mrs Fred,hysterical toss of her head. "I will not be like a child, and told to get ready wheneverpleases.

The doctor, too much excited to receivewith ordinary decorum information so important, madea sudden step up to the big embarrassed Australian,who stood before the fire gazing into vacancy, andlooking the very embodiment of conscious awkward-ness.  Dr Rider stretched out both his hands andgrasped the gigantic fist of the Bushman with an effu-sion which took that worthy altogether by surprise."My dear fellow, I wish you joy-I wish you joy.Anything I can be of use to you in, command me!"cried the doctor, with a suppressed shout of half-incredulous triumph.  Then he returned restlesslytowards Nettie-they all turned to her with instinc-tive curiosity. Never in all her troubles had Nettiebeen so pale; she looked in her sister's face with akind of despair."Is this true, Susan ?" she said, with a sorrowfulwonder as different as possible from the doctor's joyfulsurprise-" not something said to vex us-really true ?And this has been going on, and I knew nothing of it;and all this time you have been urging me to go back<pb n="266"/>266        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: to the colony-me-as if you had no otherIf you had made up your mind to this, whatuse of driving me desperate?" cried Nettie, in den outburst of that uncomprehension which acgenerous hearts.

Thework she had meant to do was over. Nettie's occupa-tion was gone. With the next act of the domesticdrama she had nothing to do. For the first time inher life utterly vanquished, with silent promptitudeshe abdicated on the instant. She seemed unable tostrike a blow for the leadership thus snatched from herhands.  With proud surprise and magnanimity shewithdrew, forbearing even the useless reproaches ofwhich she had impatiently asked, "What was thegood ?" Never abdicated emperor laid aside his robeswith more ominous significance, than Nettie, withfingers trembling between haste and agitation, smootheddown round her shapely wrists those turned-up sleeves.The doctor's better genius saved him from drivingthe indignant Titania desperate at that critical momentby any ill-advised rejoicings; and the sight of Nettie'sagitation so far calmed Dr Rider that he made themost sober and decorous congratulations to the sister-in-law, whom for the first time he felt grateful to.Perhaps, had he been less absorbed in his own affairs,he could scarcely have failed to remember how, not yet ayear ago, the shabby form of Fred lay on that same sofafrom which Susan had announced her new prospects;but in this unexampled revolution of affairs no thoughtof Fred disturbed his brother, whose mind was thor-<pb n="268"/>268       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: oughly occupied with the sudden tumult of,:hopes.

Under the blaze of her inquiringeyes the Bushman could go no farther. He looked atSusan for assistance, but Susan was still absorbed inher handkerchief; and while he paused for expression,the little abdicated monarch took up the broken thread."Thank you," said Nettie, rising suddenly; "I knewyou were honest. It is very good of you, too, to beglad to have me with you. You don't know any bet-ter. I'm abdicated, Mr Chatham; but because it'srather startling to have one's business taken out ofone's hands like this, it will be very kind of everybodynot to say anything more to-night.  I don't quiteunderstand it all just at this moment. Good-night,Dr Edward. We can talk to-morrow, please; not to-night. You surely understand me, don't you ? Whenone's life is changed all in a moment, one does notexactly see where one is standing just at once. Good-night.

Nettie was too much overstrainedand excited to speak more. A single sudden sob burst<pb n="270"/>270       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD:from her as she drew her hand out of his, anIpeared like a flying sprite.

He walkedupon air as he went back, at last, cold but joyful,through the blank solitude of Grange Lane. Nothingcould have come amiss to the doctor in that dawn ofhappiness. He could have found it in his heart tomount his drag again arid drive ten miles in celestialpatience at the call of any capricious invalid. He washalf-disappointed to find no summons awaiting himwhen he went home-no outlet for the universalcharity and loving-kindness that possessed him. In-stead, he set his easy-chair tenderly by the side ofthe blazing fire, and, drawing another chair opposite,gazed with secret smiles at the visionary Nettie, whoonce had taken up her position there. Was it byprophetic instinct that the little colonial girl, whosefirst appearance so discomposed the doctor, had as-sumed that place?

Under such beatific circstances closed the evening that had opened amid sUclouds.

As usual, Nettie's thoughts were expressedin things tangible. She had risen from her sleeplessbed while it was still almost dark, and to look at hernow, a stranger might have supposed her to be pro-ceeding with her last night's work with the constancyof a monomaniac. Little Freddy sat up in his cribrubbing his eyes and marvelling what Nettie could beabout, as indeed anybody might have marvelled. Withall those boxes and drawers about, and heaps of per-sonal belongings, what was she going to do? Shecould not have answered the question without pain;but had you waited long enough, Nettie's object wouldhave been apparent. Not entirely free of that air ofagitated haste-not recovered from the excitement ofs<pb n="274"/>274        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: this discovery, she was relieving her restless activi'a significant rearrangement of all the possessions qfamily.

I shan't go anywhere unless you go, Nettie. I'll hold on so fast, you can't put meaway; and, oh, I'll be good !-I'll be so good 1" Net-tie, who was not much given to caresses, came up andput sudden arms round her special nursling. She laidher cheek to his, with a little outbreak of natural emo-tion. " It is I who am to be sent away !" cried Nettie,yielding for a moment to the natural bitterness. Thenshe bethought herself of certain thoughts of comfortwhich had not failed to interject themselves into herheart, and withdrew with a little precipitation, alarmedby the inconsistency-the insincerity of her feelings."Get up, Freddy; you are not going away, excepthome to the colony, where you want to go," she said."Be good, all the same; for you know you must nottrouble mamma. And make haste, and don't be al-ways calling for Nettie. Don't you know you mustdo without Nettie some time? Jump up, and be' aman.""When I am a man, I shan't want you," saidFreddy, getting up with reluctance; " but I can't be aman now. And what am I to do with the buttons ifyou won't help me? I shall not have buttons likethose when I am a man."It was not in human nature to refrain from givingthe little savage an admonitory shake. "That is all <pb n="276"/>276        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFOAD:I am good for-nothing but buttons !" said Netwith whimsical mortification. When they went dto breakfast, she sent the child before her, and clast instead of first, waiting till they were all assebled. Mrs Fred watched her advent with apprehesive eyes. Thinking it over after her first triumpit occurred to Mrs Fred that the loss of Nettie womake a serious difference to her own comfort. was to take charge of the children, and conduct thevulgar affairs for which Susan's feelings disqualifiher?  She did her best to decipher the pale fwhich appeared over the breakfast cups and saucopposite.  What did Nettie mean to do2?    Surevolved the question in considerable panic, seeibut too clearly that the firm little hand no longtrembled, and that Nettie was absorbed by her othoughts-thoughts with which her present copanions had but little to do. Mrs Fred essayed anothstroke."Perhaps I was hasty, Nettie, last night; bRichard, you know, poor fellow," said Susan, "wnot to be put off. It won't make any differencetween you and me, Nettie dear?

One is enough for anybody. Never mindwhat we are talking about, Freddy. It is only yourbuttons-nothing else. As long as you were mybusiness, I should have scorned to complain," saidNettie, with a little quiver of her lip. "Nothingwould have made me forsake you, or leave you toyourself; but now you are somebody else's business;and to speak of it making no difference, and Richardbeing pleased, and so forth, as if I had nothing elseto do in the world, and wanted to go back to thecolony! It is simply not my business any longer,"cried Netty, rising impatiently from her chair-" thatis all that can be said. But I shan't desert you tillI deliver you over to my successor, Susan-don't fear.""Then you don't feel any love for us, Nettie! Itwas only because you could not help it. Children,Nettie is going to leave us," said Mrs Fred, in alamentable voice."Then who is to be instead of Nettie ?

It was a comfortto recollect that, though everything else in the universewas altered, the family must still have some dinner,and that it was as easy to think while walking to thebutcher's as while idling and doing nothing.  Shewent up, accordingly, towards Grange Lane, in a kindof wistful solitude, drifted apart from her former life,and not yet definitely attached to any other, feeling asthough the few passengers she met must perceive inher face that her whole fortune was changed. Itwas hard for Nettie to realise that she could do ab-solutely nothing at this moment, and still harder forher to think that her fate lay undecided in EdwardRider's hands. Though she had not a doubt of him,yet the mere fact that it was he who must take thefirst step was somewhat galling to the pride andtemper of the little autocrat. Before she had reachedthe butcher, or even come near enough to recogniseLucy Wodehouse, where she stood at the garden-gate,setting out for St Roque's, Nettie heard the headlongwheels of something approaching which had not yetcome; in sight.

An irregular patter of hasty little steps, outcries of a childish voice behind, had not caught attention of either in that moment of excitement; bjust as Nettie delivered this cruel outbreak of feminipride and self-assertion, the little pursuing figure maup to them, and plunged at her dress.

The emotion which her pride would not per-mit her to show before, the gathering agitation of thewhole morning broke forth at this irresistible touch.She held Freddy close and supported herself by him,leaning all her troubled heart and trembling frameupon the little figure which clung to her bewildered,suddenly growing silent and afraid in that passionategrasp. Freddy spoke no more, but turned his fright-ened eyes upon the doctor, trembling with the greatthrobs of Nettie's breast. In the early wintry sun-shine, on the quiet rural highroad, that climax of-thegathering emotion of years befell Nettie. She couldexercise no further self-control. She could only hide.her face, that no one might see, and close her quiver-ing lips tight that no one might hear the burstingforth of her heart. 'No one was there either to hearor see-nobody but Edward Rider, who stood bendingwith sorrowful tenderness over the wilful fairy creature,whose words of defiance had scarcely died from herlips. It was Freddy, and not the doctor, who had van-quished Nettie; but the insulted lover came in for'his revenge. Dr Rider raised her up quietly, askingno leave, and lifted her into the drag, where Nettiehad been before, and where Freddy, elated and joyful,took his place beside the groom, convinced that he wasto go now with the only true guardian his little life.<pb n="284"/>284       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD :had known.

Dr Edward, come in. I havething to say to you. We have nowhere to speach other but here," said Nettie, pausing in thehall, from which that childish tumult had died' in sudden awe of her presence; " but we have sto each other here before now. I did not mean<pb n="285"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.          285you then-at least, I did mean to vex you, but nothingmore." Here she paused with a sob, the echo of herpast trouble breaking upon her words, as happenedfrom time to time, like the passion of a child; thenburst forth again a moment after in a sudden question." Will you let me have Freddy ?" she cried, surrender-ing at discretion, and looking eagerly up in the doc-tor's face; "if they will leave him, may I keep himwith me ?"It is unnecessary to record the doctor's answer. Hewould have swallowed not Freddy only, but Mrs Fredand the entire family, had that gulp been needful tosatisfy Nettie, but was not sufficiently blinded to hisown interests to grant this except under certain con-ditions satisfactory to himself.  When the doctormounted the drag again he drove away into Elysium,with a smiling Cupid behind him, instead of the littlegroom who had been his unconscious master's confidantso long, and had watched the fluctuations of his wooingwith such lively curiosity. Those patients who hadpaid for Dr Rider's disappointments in many a violentprescription, got compensation to - day in honeyeddraughts and hopeful prognostications. Wherever thedoctor went he saw a vision of that little droopinghead, reposing, after all the agitation of the morning,in the silence and rest he had enjoined, with brillianteyes half-veiled, shining with thoughts in which he had<pb n="286"/>286       CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD. the greatest share; and, with that pictureeyes, went flashing along the wintry road witsmiles, and carried hope wherever he went. Of iit was the merest fallacy, so far as Nettie's immoccupation was concerned. That restless little had twenty times too much to do to think of more to do than ever in all the suddenly-change:parations which fell upon her busy hands.

It was  Hthe new quarter of Carlingford, a region of half-bstreets, vulgar new roads, and heaps of desolate  '<pb n="289"/>THE DOCTOR'S FAMILY.           289and mortar. If the doctor had- ever hoped to succeedDr Marjoribanks in his bowery retirement in GrangeLane, that hope nowadays had receded into the darkestdistance. The little surgery round the corner still shedtwinkles of red and blue light across that desolate tri-angle of unbuilt ground upon the other corner houseswhere dwelt people unknown to society in Carlingford,and still Dr Rider consented to call himself M.R.C.S.,and cultivate the patients who were afraid of a physi-cian. Miss Wodehouse went in at the invitation ofMary to see the little drawing-room which the masterof the house had provided for his wife. It had beenonly an unfurnished room in Dr Rider's bachelor days,and looked out upon nothing better than these samenew streets-the vulgar suburb which Carlingford dis-owned. Miss Wodehouse lingered at the window witha little sigh over the perversity of circumstances. IfMiss Marjoribanks had only been Nettie, or Nettie MissMarjoribanks! If not only love and happiness, butthe old doctor's practice and savings, could but havebeen brought to heap up the measure of the youngdoctor's good-fortune ! What a pity that one cannothave everything! The friendly visitor said so with areal sigh as she went down-stairs after her inspection.If the young people had but been settling in GrangeLane, in good society, and with Dr Marjoribanks'sT<pb n="290"/>290        CHRONICLES OF CARLINGFORD: practice, this marriage would have been peiindeed!                                  * But when the doctor brought Nettie home, and'her in that easy-chair which her image had posseso long, he saw few drawbacks at that moment tofelicity of his lot. If there was one particular in whis sky threatened clouds, it was not the want ofMarjoribanks's practice, but the presence of that hlinterloper, whom the doctor in his heart was apt tol.by uncomplimentary names, and did not regard unmixed favour. But when Susan and her Austrwere fairly gone, and all fear of any invasion ofother imps, which Dr Rider inly dreaded up to thsmoment, was over, Freddy grew more and more,able.

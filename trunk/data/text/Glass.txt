And Other Problems for Violet Strange
PROBLEM I
THE GOLDEN SLIPPER
<p>"SHE'S here! I thought she would be. She's one of the three young ladies you see in the right-hand box near the proscenium."</p>
<p>The gentleman thus addressed--a man of middle age and a member of the most exclusive clubs--turned his opera glass toward the spot designated, and in some astonishment retorted:</p>
<p>"She? Why those are the Misses Pratt and-"</p>
<p>"Miss Violet Strange; no other."</p>
<p>"And do you mean to say--"</p>
<p>"I do--"</p>
<p>"That yon silly little chit, whose father I know, whose fortune I know, who is seen everywhere, and who is called one of the season's belles is an agent of yours; a--a-- "</p>
<pb n="2     The Golden Slipper">
<p>"No names here, please. You want a mystery solved. It is not a matter for the police--that is, as yet,--and so you come to me, and when I ask for the facts, I find that women and only women are involved, and that these women are not only young but one and all of the highest society. Is it a man's work to go to the bottom of a combination like this? No. Sex against sex, and, if possible, youth against youth. Happily, I know such a person--a girl of gifts and extraordinarily well placed for the purpose. Why she uses her talents in this direction--why, with means enough to play the part natural to her as a successful debutante, she consents to occupy herself with social and other mysteries, you must ask her, not me. Enough that I promise you her aid if you want it. That is, if you can interest her. She will not work
otherwise."</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll again raised his opera glass.</p>
<p>"But it's a comedy face, " he commented. "It's hard to associate intellectuality with such quaintness of expression. Are you sure of her discretion?"</p>
<p>"Whom is she with?"</p>
<p>"Abner Pratt, his wife, and daughters."</p>
<p>"Is he a man to entrust his affairs unadvisedly?"</p>
<p>"Abner Pratt! Do you mean to say that she is anything more to him than his daughters' guest?"</p>
<pb n="3 Problem I for Violet Strange">
<p>"Judge. You see how merry they are. They were in deep trouble yesterday. You are witness to a celebration."</p>
<p>"And she?"</p>
<p>"Don't you observe how they are loading her with attentions? She's too young to rouse such interest in a family of notably unsympathetic temperament for any other reason than that of gratitude."</p>
<p>"It's hard to believe. But if what you hint is true, secure me an opportunity at once of talking to this youthful marvel. My affair is serious. The dinner I have mentioned comes off in three days and--"</p>
<p>"I know. I recognize your need; but I think you had better enter Mr. Pratt's box without my intervention. Miss Strange's value to us will be impaired the moment her connection with us is discovered."</p>
<p>"Ah, there's Ruthven! He will take me to Mr. Pratt's box," remarked Driscoll as the curtain fell on the second act. "Any suggestions before I go?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and an important one. When you make your bow, touch your left shoulder with your right hand. It is a signal. She may respond to it; but if she does not, do not be discouraged. One of her idiosyncrasies is a theoretical dislike of her
<pb n="4 The Golden Slipper">
work. But once she gets interested, nothing will hold her back. That's all, except this. In no event give away her secret. That's part of the compact, you remember."</p>
<p>Driscoll nodded and left his seat for Ruthven's box. When the curtain rose for the third time he could be seen sitting with the Misses Pratt and their vivacious young friend. A widower and still on the right side of fifty, his presence there did not pass unnoted, and curiosity was rife among certain onlookers as to which of the twin belles was responsible for this change in his well-known habits. Unfortunately, no opportunity was given him for showing. Other and younger men had followed his lead into the box, and they saw him forced upon the good graces of the fascinating but inconsequent Miss Strange whose rapid fire of talk he was hardly of a temperament to appreciate.</p>
<p>Did he appear dissatisfied? Yes; but only one person in the opera house knew why. Miss Strange had shown no comprehension of or sympathy with his errand. Though she chatted amiably enough between duets and trios, she gave him no opportunity to express his wishes though she knew them well enough, owing to the signal he had given her.</p>
<pb n="5 Problem I for Violet Strange">
<p>This might be in character but it hardly suited his views; and, being a man of resolution, he took advantage of an absorbing minute on the stage to lean forward and whisper in her ear:</p>
<p>"It's my daughter for whom I request your services; as fine a girl as any in this house. Give me a hearing. You certainly can manage it."</p>
<p>She was a small, slight woman whose naturally quaint appearance was accentuated by the extreme simplicity of her attire. In the tier upon tier of boxes rising before his eyes, no other personality could vie with hers in strangeness, or in the illusive quality of her ever-changing expression. She was vivacity incarnate and, to the ordinary observer, light as thistledown in fibre and in feeling. But not to all. To those who watched her long, there came moments--say when the music rose to heights of greatness--when the mouth so given over to laughter took on curves of the rarest sensibility, and a woman's lofty soul shone through her odd, bewildering features.</p>
<p>Driscoll had noted this, and consequently awaited her reply in secret hope.</p>
<p>It came in the form of a question and only after an instant's display of displeasure or possibly of pure nervous irritability.</p>
<p>"What has she done?"</p>
<pb n="6 The Golden Slipper">
<p>"Nothing. But slander is in the air, and any day it may ripen into public accusation."</p>
<p>"Accusation of what?" Her tone was almost pettish.</p>
<p>"Of--of <hi rend="italic">theft</hi>," he murmured. "On a great scale," he emphasized, as the music rose to a crash.</p>
<p>"Jewels?"</p>
<p>"Inestimable ones. They are always returned by somebody. People say, by me."</p>
<p>"Ah!" The little lady's hands grew steady,--they had been fluttering all over her lap. "I will see you to-morrow morning at my father's house," she presently observed; and turned her full attention to the stage.</p>
<p>Some three days after this Mr. Driscoll opened his house on the Hudson to notable guests. He had not desired the publicity of such an event, nor the opportunity it gave for an increase of the scandal secretly in circulation against his daughter. But the Ambassador and his wife were foreign and any evasion of the promised hospitality would be sure to be misunderstood; so the scheme was carried forward though with less <hi rend="italic">&eacuteclat</hi> than possibly was expected.</p>
<p>Among the lesser guests, who were mostly young and well acquainted with the house and its hospitality, there was one unique figure,--that of
<pb n="7 Problem I for Violet Strange">
the lively Miss Strange, who, if personally unknown to Miss Driscoll, was so gifted with the qualities which tell on an occasion of this kind, that the stately young hostess hailed her presence with very obvious gratitude.</p>
<p>The manner of their first meeting was singular, and of great interest to one of them at least. Miss Strange had come in an automobile and had been shown her room; but there was nobody to accompany her down-stairs afterward, and, finding herself alone in the great hall, she naturally moved toward the library, the door of which stood ajar. She had pushed this door half open before she noticed that the room was already occupied. As a consequence, she was made the unexpected observer of a beautiful picture of youth and love.</p>
<p>A young man and a young woman were standing together in the glow of a blazing wood-fire. No word was to be heard, but in their faces, eloquent with passion, there shone something so deep and true that the chance intruder hesitated on the threshold, eager to lay this picture away in her mind with the other lovely and tragic memories now fast accumulating there. Then she drew back, and readvancing with a less noiseless foot, came into the full presence of Captain Holliday drawn up in all the pride of his military rank beside
<pb n="8 The Golden Slipper">
Alicia, the accomplished daughter of the house, who, if under a shadow as many whispered, wore that shadow as some women wear a crown.</p>
<p>Miss Strange was struck with admiration, and turned upon them the brightest facet of her vivacious nature all the time she was saying to herself: "Does she know why I am here? Or does she look upon me only as an additional guest foisted upon her by a thoughtless parent?"</p>
<p>There was nothing in the manner of her cordial but composed young hostess to show, and Miss Strange, with but one thought in mind since she had caught the light of feeling on the two faces confronting her, took the first opportunity that offered of running over the facts given her by Mr. Driscoll, to see if any reconcilement were possible between them and an innocence in which she must
henceforth believe.</p>
<p>They were certainly of a most damaging nature.</p>
<p>Miss Driscoll and four other young ladies of her own station in life had formed themselves, some two years before, into a coterie of five, called The Inseparables. They lunched together, rode together, visited together. So close was the bond and their mutual dependence so evident, that it came to be the custom to invite the whole five whenever the size of the function warranted it. In
<pb n="9 Problem I for Violet Strange ">
it was far from an uncommon occurrence to
see them grouped at receptions or following one another down the aisles of churches or through the mazes of the dance at balls or assemblies. And no one demurred at this, for they were all handsome and attractive girls, till it began to be noticed that, coincident with their presence, some article of value was found missing from the dressing-room or from the tables where wedding gifts were displayed. Nothing was safe where they went, and though, in the course of time, each article found its way back to its owner in a manner as mysterious as its previous abstraction, the scandal grew and, whether with good reason or bad, finally settled about the person of Miss Driscoll, who was the showiest, least pecuniarily tempted, and most dignified in manner and speech of them all.</p>
<p>Some instances had been given by way of further enlightenment. This is one: A theatre party was in progress. There were twelve in the party, five of whom were Inseparables. In the course of the last act, another lady--in fact, their chaperon--missed her handkerchief, an almost priceless bit of lace. Positive that she had brought it with her into the box, she caused a careful search, but without the least success. Recalling certain whispers
<pb n="10 The Golden Slipper">
she had heard, she noted which of the five girls were with her in the box. They were Miss Driscoll, Miss Hughson, Miss Yates, and Miss Benedict.
Miss West sat in the box adjoining.</p>
<p>A fortnight later this handkerchief reappeared--and where? Among the cushions of a yellow satin couch in her own drawing-room. The Inseparables had just made their call and the three who had sat on the couch were Miss Driscoll, Miss Hughson, and Miss Benedict.</p>
<p>The next instance seemed to point still more insistently toward the lady already named. Miss Yates had an expensive present to buy, and the whole five Inseparables went in an imposing group to Tiffany's. A tray of rings was set before them. All examined and eagerly fingered the stock out of which Miss Yates presently chose a finely set emerald. She was leading her friends away when the clerk suddenly whispered in her ear, "I miss one of the rings." Dismayed beyond speech, she turned and consulted the faces of her four companions who stared back at her with immovable serenity. But one of them was paler than usual, and this lady (it was Miss Driscoll) held her hands in her muff and did not offer to take them out. Miss Yates, whose father had completed a big "deal" the week before, wheeled round upon the
<pb n="11 Problem I for Violet Strange">
clerk. "Charge it! charge it at its full value," said she. "I buy both the rings."</p>
<p>And in three weeks the purloined ring came back to her, in a box of violets with no name attached.</p>
<p>The third instance was a recent one, and had come to Mr. Driscoll's ears directly from the lady suffering the loss. She was a woman of uncompromising integrity, who felt it her duty to make known to this gentleman the following facts: She had just left a studio reception, and was standing at the curb waiting for a taxicab to draw up, when a small boy--a street arab--darted toward her from the other side of the street, and thrusting into her hand something small and hard, cried breathlessly as he slipped away, "It's yours, ma'am; you dropped it." Astonished, for she had not been conscious of any loss, she looked down at her treasure trove and found it to be a small medallion which she sometimes wore on a chain at her belt. But she had not worn it that day, nor any day for weeks. Then she remembered. She had worn it a month before to a similar reception at this same studio. A number of young girls had stood about her admiring it-she remembered well who they were; the Inseparables, of course, and to please them she had slipped it from its chain. Then something had happened,
<pb n="12 The Golden Slipper">
--something which diverted her attention entirely,--and she had gone home without the medallion; had, in fact, forgotten it, only to recall its loss now. Placing it in her bag, she looked hastily about her. A crowd was at her back; nothing to be distinguished there. But in front, on the opposite side of the street, stood a club-house, and in one of its windows she perceived a solitary figure looking out. It was that of Miss Driscoll's father. He could
imagine her conclusion.</p>
<p>In vain he denied all knowledge of the matter. She told him other stories which had come to her ears of thefts as mysterious, followed by restorations as peculiar as this one, finishing with, "It is your daughter, and people are beginning to say so."</p>
<p>And Miss Strange, brooding over these instances, would have said the same, but for Miss Driscoll's absolute serenity of demeanour and complete abandonment to love. These seemed incompatible with guilt; these, whatever the appearances, proclaimed innocence-an innocence she was here to prove if fortune favoured and the really guilty person's madness should again break forth.</p>
<p>For madness it would be and nothing less, for any hand, even the most experienced, to draw attention to itself by a repetition of old tricks on
<pb n="13 Problem I for Violet Strange ">
an occasion so marked. Yet because it would take madness, and madness knows no law, she prepared herself for the contingency under a mask of girlish smiles which made her at once the delight and astonishment of her watchful and uneasy host.</p>
<p>With the exception of the diamonds worn by the Ambassadress, there was but one jewel of consequence to be seen at the dinner that night; but how great was that consequence and with what splendour it invested the snowy neck it adorned!</p>
<p>Miss Strange, in compliment to the noble foreigners, had put on one of her family heirlooms--a filigree pendant of extraordinary sapphires which had once belonged to Marie Antoinette. As its beauty flashed upon the women, and its value ,struck the host, the latter could not restrain himself from casting an anxious eye about the board in search of some token of the cupidity with which one person there must welcome this unexpected sight.</p>
<p>Naturally his first glance fell upon Alicia, seated opposite to him at the other end of the table. But her eyes were elsewhere, and her smile for Captain Holliday, and the father's gaze travelled on, taking up each young girl's face in turn. All were contemplating Miss Strange and her jewels, and the cheeks of one were flushed and those of the others
<pb n="14 The Golden Slipper">
pale, but whether with dread or longing who could tell. Struck with foreboding, but alive to his duty as host, he forced his glances away, and did not even allow himself to question the motive or the
wisdom of the temptation thus offered.</p>
<p>Two hours later and the girls were all in one room. It was a custom of the Inseparables to meet for a chat before retiring, but always alone and in the room of one of their number. But this was a night of innovations; Violet was not only included, but the meeting was held in her room. Her way with girls was even more fruitful of result than her way with men. They might laugh at her, criticize her or even call her names significant of disdain, but they never left her long to herself or missed an opportunity to make the most of her
irrepressible chatter.</p>
<p>Her satisfaction at entering this charmed circle did not take from her piquancy, and story after story fell from her lips, as she fluttered about, now here now there, in her endless preparations for retirement. She had taken off her historic pendant after it had been duly admired and handled by all present, and, with the careless confidence of an assured ownership, thrown it down upon the end of her dresser, which, by the way, projected very close to the open window</p>
<pb n="15 Problem I for Violet Strange">
<p>"Are you going to leave your jewel <hi rend="italic">there</hi>?" whispered a voice in her ear as a burst of laughter rang out in response to one of her sallies.</p>
<p>Turning, with a simulation of round-eyed wonder, she met Miss Hughson's earnest gaze with the careless rejoinder, "What's the harm?" and went on with her story with all the reckless ease of a perfectly thoughtless nature.</p>
<p>Miss Hughson abandoned her protest. How could she explain her reasons for it to one apparently uninitiated in the scandal associated with their especial clique.</p>
<p>Yes, she left the jewel there; but she locked her door and quickly, so that they must all have heard her before reaching their rooms. Then she crossed to the window, which, like all on this side, opened on a balcony running the length of the house. She was aware of this balcony, also of the fact that only young ladies slept in the corridor communicating with it. But she was not quite sure that this one corridor accommodated them all. If one of them  should room  elsewhere! (Miss Driscoll, for instance). But no! the anxiety displayed for the safety of her jewel precluded that supposition. Their hostess, if none of the others, was within access of this room and its open window. But how about the rest? Perhaps the lights would
<pb n="16 The Golden Slipper">
tell. Eagerly the little schemer looked forth, and let her glances travel down the full length of the balcony. Two separate beams of light shot across it as she looked, and presently another, and, after some waiting, a fourth. But the fifth failed to appear. This troubled her, but not seriously. Two of the girls might be sleeping in one bed.</p>
<p>Drawing her shade, she finished her preparations for the night; then with her kimono on, lifted the pendant and thrust it into a small box she had taken from her trunk. A curious smile, very unlike any she had shown to man or woman that day, gave a sarcastic lift to her lips, as with a slow and thoughtful manipulation of her dainty fingers she moved the jewel about in this small receptacle and then returned it, after one quick examining glance, to the very spot on the dresser from which she had taken it. "If only the madness is great enough!" that smile seemed to say. Truly, it was much to hope for, but a chance is a chance; and comforting herself with the thought, Miss Strange put out her light, and, with a hasty raising of the shade she had previously pulled down, took a final look at the prospect.</p>
<p>Its aspect made her shudder. A low fog was rising from the meadows in the far distance, and its ghostliness under the moon woke all sorts of
<pb n="17 Problem I for Violet Strange">
uncanny images in her excited mind. To escape them she crept into bed where she lay with her eyes on the end of her dresser. She had closed that half of the French window over which she had drawn the shade; but she had left ajar the one giving free access to the jewels; and when she was not watching the scintillation of her sapphires in the moonlight, she was dwelling in fixed attention on this narrow opening.</p>
<p>But nothing happened, and two o'clock, then three o'clock struck, without a dimming of the blue scintillations on the end of her dresser. Then she suddenly sat up. Not that she heard anything new, but that a thought had come to her. " If an attempt is made," so she murmured softly to herself, "it will be by--" She did not finish. Something-she could not call it sound--set her heart beating tumultuously, and listening--listening--watching--watching--she followed in her imagination the approach down the balcony of an almost inaudible step, not daring to move herself, it seemed so near, but waiting with eyes fixed, for the shadow which must fall across the shade she had failed to raise over that half of the swinging window she had so carefully left shut.</p>
<p>At length she saw it projecting slowly across the slightly illuminated surface. Formless, save
<pb n="18 The Golden Slipper">
for the outreaching hand, it passed the casement's edge, nearing with pauses and hesitations the open gap beyond through which the neglected sapphires beamed with steady lustre. Would she ever see the hand itself appear between the dresser and the window frame? Yes, there it comes,--small, delicate, and startlingly white, threading that gap--darting with the suddenness of a serpent's tongue toward the dresser and disappearing again with the pendant in its clutch.</p>
<p>As she realizes this,--she is but young, you know,--as she sees her bait taken and the hardly expected event fulfilled, her pent-up breath sped forth in a sigh which sent the intruder flying, and so startled herself that she sank back in terror on her pillow.</p>
<p>The breakfast-call had sounded its musical chimes through the halls. The Ambassador and his wife had responded, so had most of the young gentlemen and ladies, but the daughter of the house was not amongst them, nor Miss Strange, whom one would naturally expect to see down first of all.</p>
<p>These two absences puzzled Mr. Driscoll What might they not portend? But his suspense, at least in one regard, was short.  Before his guests
<pb n="19 Problem I for Violet Strange">
were well seated, Miss Driscoll entered from the terrace in company with Captain Holliday. In her arms she carried a huge bunch of roses and was looking very beautiful. Her father's heart warmed at the sight. No shadow from the night
rested upon her.</p>
<p>But Miss Strange!--where was she? He could not feel quite easy till he knew.</p>
<p>"Have any of you seen Miss Strange?" he asked, as they sat down at table. And his eyes sought the Inseparables.</p>
<p>Five lovely heads were shaken, some carelessly, some wonderingly, and one, with a quick, forced smile. But he was in no mood to discriminate, and he had beckoned one of the servants to him, when a step was heard at the door and the delinquent slid in and took her place, in a shamefaced manner suggestive of a cause deeper than mere tardiness. In fact, she had what might be called a frightened air, and stared into her plate, avoiding every eye, which was certainly not natural to her. What did it mean? and why, as she made a poor attempt at eating, did four of the Inseparables exchange glances of doubt and dismay and then concentrate their looks upon his daughter? That Alicia failed to notice this, but sat abloom above her roses now fastened in a great bunch upon her
<pb n="20 The Golden Slipper">
breast, offered him some comfort, yet, for all the volubility of his chief guests, the meal was a great trial to his patience, as well as a poor preparation for the hour when, the noble pair gone, he stepped into the library to find Miss Strange awaiting him with one hand behind her back and a piteous look on her infantile features.</p>
<p>"0, Mr. Driscoll," she began,-and then he saw that a group of anxious girls hovered in her rear--"my pendant! my beautiful pendant! It is gone! Somebody reached in from the balcony and took it from my dresser in the night. Of course, it was to frighten me; all of the girls told me not to leave it there. But I--I cannot make them give it back, and papa is so particular about this jewel that I'm afraid to go home. Won't you tell them it's no joke, and see that I get it again. I won't be so careless another time."</p>
<p>Hardly believing his eyes, hardly believing his ears,--she was so perfectly the spoiled child detected in a fault--he looked sternly about upon the girls and bade them end the jest and produce the gems at once.</p>
<p>But not one of them spoke, and not one of them moved; only his daughter grew pale until the roses seemed a mockery, and the steady stare of her large eyes was almost too much for him to bear.</p>
<pb n="21 Problem I for Violet Strange">
<p>The anguish of this gave asperity to his manner, and in a strange, hoarse tone he loudly cried:</p>
<p>"One of you did this. Which? If it was you, Alicia, speak. I am in no mood for nonsense. I want to know whose foot traversed the balcony and whose hand abstracted these jewels."</p>
<p>A continued silence, deepening into painful embarrassment for all. Mr. Driscoll eyed them in ill-concealed anguish, then turning to Miss Strange was still further thrown off his balance by seeing her pretty head droop and her gaze fall in confusion. "Oh! it's easy enough to tell whose foot traversed the balcony," she murmured. "It left this behind." And drawing forward her hand, she held out to
view a small gold-coloured slipper. "I found it outside my window," she explained. "I hoped I should not have to show it."</p>
<p>A gasp of uncontrollable feeling from the surrounding group of girls, then absolute stillness.</p>
<p>"I fail to recognize it," observed Mr. Driscoll, taking it in his hand. "Whose slipper is this?" he asked in a manner not to be gainsaid.</p>
<p>Still no reply, then as he continued to eye the girls one after another a voice--the last he expected to hear--spoke and his daughter cried:</p>
<p>"It is mine. But it was not I who walked in it down the balcony."</p>
<pb n="22 The Golden Slipper">
<p>"Alicia!"</p>
<p>A month's apprehension was in that cry. The silence, the pent-up emotion brooding in the air was intolerable. A fresh young laugh broke it.</p>
<p>"Oh," exclaimed a roguish voice, "I knew that you were all in it! But the especial one who wore the slipper and grabbed the pendant cannot hope to hide herself. Her finger-tips will give her away."</p>
<p>Amazement on every face and a convulsive movement in one half-hidden hand.</p>
<p>"You see," the airy little being went on, in her light way, "I have some awfully funny tricks. I am always being scolded for them, but somehow I don't improve. One is to keep my jewelry bright with a strange foreign paste an old Frenchwoman once gave me in Paris. It's of a vivid red, and stains the fingers dreadfully if you don't take care. Not even water will take it off, see mine. I used that paste on my pendant last night just after you left me, and being awfully sleepy I didn't stop to rub it off. If your finger-tips are not red, you never touched the pendant, Miss Driscoll. Oh, see! They are as white as milk.</p>
<p>"But some one took the sapphires, and I owe that person a scolding, as well as myself. Was it you, Miss Hughson? You, Miss Yates? or--"
<pb n="23 Problem I for Violet Strange">
and here she paused before Miss West, "Oh, you have your gloves on! You are the guilty one!" and her laugh rang out like a peal of bells, robbing her next sentence of even a suggestion of sarcasm. "Oh, what a sly-boots!" she cried. "How you have deceived me! Whoever would have thought you to be the one to play the mischief!"</p>
<p>Who indeed! Of all the five, she was the one who was considered absolutely immune from suspicion ever since the night Mrs. Barnum's handkerchief had been taken, and she not in the box. Eyes which had surveyed Miss Driscoll askance now rose in wonder toward hers, and failed to fall again because of the stoniness into which her delicately-carved features had settled.</p>
<p>"Miss West, I know you will be glad to remove your gloves; Miss Strange certainly has a right to know her special tormentor," spoke up her host in as natural a voice as his great relief would allow.</p>
<p>But the cold, half-frozen woman remained without a movement. She was not deceived by the banter of the moment. She knew that to all of the others, if not to Peter Strange's odd little daughter, it was the thief who was being spotted and brought thus hilariously to light. And her eyes grew hard, and her lips grey, and she failed to
<pb n="24 The Golden Slipper">
unglove the hands upon which all glances were concentrated.</p>
<p>"You do not need to see my hands; I confess to taking the pendant."</p>
<p>"Caroline!"</p>
<p>A heart overcome by shock had thrown up this cry. Miss West eyed her bosom-friend disdainfully.</p>
<p>"Miss Strange has called it a jest," she coldly commented. "Why should you suggest anything of a graver character?"</p>
<p>Alicia brought thus to bay, and by one she had trusted most, stepped quickly forward, and quivering with vague doubts, aghast before unheard-of possibilities, she tremulously remarked:</p>
<p>"We did not sleep together last night. You had to come into my room to get my slippers. Why did you do this? What was in your mind, Caroline?"</p>
<p>A steady look, a low laugh choked with many emotions answered her.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to reply, Alicia? Or shall we let it pass?"</p>
<p>"Answer!"</p>
<p>It was Mr. Driscoll who spoke. Alicia had shrunk back, almost to where a little figure was
<pb n="25 Problem I for Violet Strange">
cowering with wide eyes fixed in something like terror on the aroused father's face.</p>
<p>"Then hear me," murmured the girl, entrapped and suddenly desperate. "I wore Alicia's slippers and I took the jewels, because it was time that an end come to your mutual dissimulation.  The love I once felt for her she has herself deliberately killed. I had a lover--she took him. I had faith in life, in honour, and in friendship. She destroyed all. A thief--she has dared to aspire to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>  And <hi rend="italic">you</hi> condoned her fault. You, with your craven restoration of her booty, thought the matter cleared and her a fit mate for a man of highest honour."</p>
<p>"Miss West,"--no one had ever heard that tone in Mr. Driscoll's voice before, "before you say another word calculated to mislead these ladies, let me say that this hand never returned any one's booty or had anything to do with the restoration of any abstracted article. You have been caught in a net, Miss West, from which you cannot escape by slandering my innocent daughter."</p>
<p>"Innocent!" All the tragedy latent in this peculiar girl's nature blazed forth in the word. "Alicia, face me. Are you innocent? Who took the Dempsey corals, and that diamond from the Tiffany tray?"</p>
<pb n="26 The Golden Slipper">
<p>"It is not necessary for Alicia to answer," the father interposed with not unnatural heat. "Miss West stands self-convicted."</p>
<p>"How about Lady Paget's scarf? I was not there that night."</p>
<p>"You are a woman of wiles. That could be managed by one bent on an elaborate scheme of revenge."</p>
<p>"And so could the abstraction of Mrs. Barnum's five-hundred-dollar handkerchief by one who sat in the next box," chimed in Miss Hughson, edging away from the friend to whose honour she would have pinned her faith an hour before. "I remember now seeing her lean over the railing to adjust the old lady's shawl."</p>
<p>With a start, Caroline West turned a tragic gaze upon the speaker.</p>
<p>"You think me guilty of all because of what I did last night?"</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't I."</p>
<p>"And you, Anna?"</p>
<p>"Alicia has my sympathy," murmured Miss Benedict.</p>
<p>Yet the wild girl persisted.</p>
<p>"But I have told you my provocation. You cannot believe that I am guilty of her sin; not if you look at her as I am looking now."</p>
<pb n="27 Problem I for Violet Strange"/>
<p>But their glances hardly followed her pointing finger. Her friends--the comrades of her youth, the Inseparables with their secret oath--one and all held themselves aloof, struck by the perfidy they were only just beginning to take in. Smitten with despair for these girls were her life, she gave one wild leap and sank on her knees before Alicia.</p>
<p>"O speak!" she began. "Forgive me, and--"</p>
<p>A tremble seized her throat; she ceased to speak and let fall her partially uplifted hands. The cheery sound of men's voices had drifted in from the terrace, and the figure of Captain Holliday could be seen passing by. The shudder which shook Caroline West communicated itself to Alicia Driscoll, and the former rising quickly, the two women surveyed each other, possibly for the first time, with open soul and a complete understanding.</p>
<p>"Caroline!" murmured the one.</p>
<p>"Alicia!" pleaded the other.</p>
<p>"Caroline, trust me," said Alicia Driscoll in that moving voice of hers, which more than her beauty caught and retained all hearts. "You have served me ill, but it was not all undeserved. Girls," she went on, eyeing both them and her father with the wistfulness of a breaking heart, "neither Caroline nor myself are worthy of Captain
<pb n="28 The Golden Slipper">
Holliday's love. Caroline has told you her fault, but mine is perhaps a worse one. The ring--the scarf--the diamond pins--I took them all--took them if I did not retain them. A curse has been over my life--the curse of a longing I could not combat. But love was working a change in me. Since I have known Captain Holliday--but that's all over. I was mad to think I could be happy with such memories in my life. I shall never marry now--or touch jewels again--my own or another's. Father, father, you won't go back on your girl! I couldn't see Caroline suffer for what I have done. You will pardon me and help--help--"</p>
<p>Her voice choked. She flung herself into her father's arms; his head bent over hers, and for an instant not a soul in the room moved. Then Miss Hughson gave a spring and caught her by the hand.</p>
<p>"We are inseparable," said she, and kissed the hand, murmuring, "Now is our time to show it."</p>
<p>Then other lips fell upon those cold and trembling fingers, which seemed to warm under these embraces. And then a tear. It came from the hard eye of Caroline, and remained a sacred secret between the two.</p>
<pb n="29 Problem I for Violet Strange"/>
<p>"You have your pendant?"</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll's suffering eye shone down on Violet Strange's uplifted face as she advanced to say good-bye preparatory to departure.</p>
<p>"Yes" she acknowledged, "but hardly, I fear, your gratitude."</p>
<p>And the answer astonished her.</p>
<p>"I am not sure that the real Alicia will not make her father happier than the unreal one has ever done."</p>
<p>"And Captain Holliday?"</p>
<p>"He may come to feel the same."</p>
<p>"Then I do not quit in disgrace?"</p>
<p>"You depart with my thanks."</p>
<p>When a certain personage was told of the success of Miss Strange's latest manoeuvre, he remarked:</p>
<p>"The little one progresses. We shall have to give her a case of prime importance next."</p>

PROBLEM II
THE SECOND BULLET
<p>"You must see her."</p>
<p>"No. No."</p>
<p>"She's a most unhappy woman. Husband and child both taken from her in a moment; and now, all means of living as well, unless some happy thought of yours--some inspiration of your genius--shows us a way of re-establishing her claims to the policy voided by this cry of suicide."</p>
<p>But the small wise head of Violet Strange continued its slow shake of decided refusal.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she protested, "but it's quite out of my province. I'm too young to meddle with so serious a matter."</p>
<p>"Not when you can save a bereaved woman the only possible compensation left her by untoward fate?"</p>
<p>"Let the police try their hand at that."</p>
<p>"They have had no success with the case."</p>
<p>"Or you?"</p>
<pb n="31 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
<p>"Nor I either."</p>
<p>"And you expect--"</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Strange. I expect you to find the missing bullet which will settle the fact that murder and not suicide ended George Hammond's life. If you cannot, then a long litigation awaits this poor widow, ending, as such litigation usually does, in favour of the stronger party. There's the alternative. If you once saw her--"</p>
<p>"But that's what I'm not willing to do. If I once saw her I should yield to her importunities and attempt the seemingly impossible. My instincts bid me say no. Give me something easier."</p>
<p>"Easier things are not so remunerative. There's
money in this affair, if the insurance company is
forced to pay up. I can offer you--"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>There was eagerness in the tone despite her effort at nonchalance. The other smiled imperceptibly, and briefly named the sum. It was larger than she had expected. This her visitor saw by the way her eyelids fell and the peculiar stillness which, for an instant, held her vivacity in check.</p>
<p>"And you think I can earn that?"</p>
<p>Her eyes were fixed on his in an eagerness as honest as it was unrestrained.</p>
<pb n="32 The Second Bullet">
<p>He could hardly conceal his amazement, her desire was so evident and the cause of it so difficult to understand. He knew she wanted money--that was her avowed reason for entering into this uncongenial work. But to want it <hi rend="italic">so much!</hi> He glanced at her person; it was simply clad but very expensively--how expensively it was his business to know. Then he took in the room in which they sat. Simplicity again, but the simplicity of high art--the drawing-room of one rich enough to indulge in the final luxury of a highly cultivated
taste, viz.: unostentatious elegance and the subjection of each carefully chosen ornament to the general effect.</p>
<p>What did this favoured child of fortune lack that she could be reached by such a plea, when her whole being revolted from the nature of the task he offered her? It was a question not new to him; but one he had never heard answered and was not likely to hear answered now. But the fact remained that the consent he had thought dependent upon sympathetic interest could be reached much more readily by the promise of large emolument,--and he owned to a feeling of secret disappointment even while he recognized the value of the discovery.</p>
<p>But his satisfaction in the latter, if satisfaction it
<pb n="33 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
was of very short duration. Almost immediately he observed a change in her. The sparkle which had shone in the eye whose depths he had never been able to penetrate, had dissipated itself in something like a tear and she spoke up in that vigorous tone no one but himself had ever heard, as she said:</p>
<p>"No. The sum is a good one and I could use it; but I will not waste my energy on a case I do not believe in. The man shot himself. He was a speculator and probably had good reason for his act. Even his wife acknowledges that he has lately had more losses than gains."</p>
<p>" See her. She has something to tell you which never got into the papers."</p>
<p>"You say that? You know that?"</p>
<p>"On my honour, Miss Strange."</p>
<p>Violet pondered; then suddenly succumbed,</p>
<p>"Let her come, then. Prompt to the hour. I will receive her at three. Later I have a tea and two party calls to make."</p>
<p>Her visitor rose to leave. He had been able to subdue all evidence of his extreme gratification, and now took on a formal air. In dismissing a guest, Miss Strange was invariably the society belle and that only.  This he had come to recognize.</p>
<pb n="34 The Second Bullet">
<p>The case (well known at the time) was, in the fewest possible words, as follows:</p>
<p>On a sultry night in September, a young couple living in one of the large apartment houses in the extreme upper portion of Manhattan were so annoyed by the incessant crying of a child in the adjoining suite, that they got up, he to smoke, and she to sit in the window for a possible breath of cool air. They were congratulating themselves upon the wisdom they had shown in thus giving up all thought of sleep--for the child's crying had not ceased--when (it may have been two o'clock and it may have been a little later) there came from somewhere near, the sharp and somewhat peculiar detonation of a pistol-shot.</p>
<p>He thought it came from above; she, from the rear, and they were staring at each other in the helpless wonder of the moment, when they were struck by the silence. The baby had ceased to cry. All was as still in the adjoining apartment as in their own--too still--much too still. Their mutual stare turned to one of horror. "It came from there!" whispered the wife. "Some accident has occurred to Mr. or Mrs. Hammond--we ought to go--"</p>
<p>Her words--very tremulous ones--were broken
by a shout from below. They were standing in
<pb n="35 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
their window and had evidently been seen by a passing policeman. "Anything wrong up there?" they heard him cry. Mr. Saunders immediately looked out. "Nothing wrong here," he called down. (They were but two stories from the pavement.) "But I'm not so sure about the rear apartment. We thought we heard a shot. Hadn't you better come up, officer? My wife is nervous about it. I'll meet you at the stair-head and show you the way."</p>
<p>The officer nodded and stepped in. The young couple hastily donned some wraps, and, by the time he appeared on their floor, they were ready to accompany him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no disturbance was apparent anywhere else in the house, until the policeman rang the bell of the Hammond apartment. Then, voices began to be heard, and doors to open above and below, but not the one before which the policeman stood.</p>
<p>Another ring, and this time an insistent one;--and still no response. The officer's hand was rising for the third time when there came a sound of fluttering from behind the panels against which he had laid his ear, and finally a choked voice uttering  unintelligible words. Then a hand began to struggle with the lock, and the door,
<pb n="36 The Second Bullet">
slowly opening, disclosed a woman clad in a
hastily donned wrapper and giving every evidence 
of extreme fright.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, seeing only the compassionate faces of her neighbours. "You heard it, too! a pistol-shot from there--<hi rend="italic">there</hi>--my husband's room. I have not dared to go--I--I--O, have mercy and see if anything is wrong! It is so still--so still, and only a moment ago the baby was crying. Mrs. Saunders, Mrs. Saunders, why is it so still?"</p>
<p>She had fallen into her neighbour's arms. The hand with which she had pointed out a certain door had sunk to her side and she appeared to be on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>The officer eyed her sternly, while noting her appearance, which was that of a woman hastily risen from bed.</p>
<p>"Where were you?" he asked. "Not with your
husband and child, or you would know what had
happened there."</p>
<p>"I was sleeping down the hall," she managed to gasp out. "I'm not well-I-Oh, why do you all stand still and do nothing? My baby's in there. Go! go!" and, with sudden energy, she sprang upright, her eyes wide open and burning, her small well-featured face white as the linen she sought to hide.</p>
<pb n="37 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
<p>The officer demurred no longer. In another instant he was trying the door at which she was again pointing.
<p>It was locked.</p>
<p>Glancing back at the woman, now cowering almost to the floor he pounded at the door and asked the man inside to open.</p>
<p> No answer came back.</p>
<p>With a sharp turn he glanced again at the wife.</p>
<p>"You say that your husband is in this room?"</p>
<p>She nodded, gasping faintly, "And the child!"</p>
<p>He turned back, listened, then beckoned to Mr. Sanders. "We shall have to break our way in," said he. "Put your shoulder well to the door."</p>
<p>The hinges of the door creaked; the lock gave way (this special officer weighed two hundred and seventy-five, as he found out, next day), and a prolonged and sweeping crash told the rest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hammond gave a low cry; and, straining forward from where she crouched in terror on the floor, searched the faces of the two men for some hint of what they saw in the dimly-lighted space beyond.</p>
<p>Something dreadful, something which made Mr. Saunders come rushing back with a shout:</p>
<pb n="38 The Second Bullet">
<p>"Take her away! Take her to our apartment,
Jennie. She must not see--"</p>
<p>Not see! He realized the futility of his words as his gaze fell on the young woman who had risen up at his approach and now stood gazing at him without speech, without movement, but with a glare of terror in her eyes, which gave him his first realization of human misery.</p>
<p>His own glance fell before it. If he had followed his instinct he would have fled the house rather than answer the question of her look and the attitude of her whole frozen body.</p>
<p>Perhaps in mercy to his speechless terror, perhaps in mercy to herself, she was the one who at last found the word which voiced their mutual anguish.</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>No answer. None was needed.</p>
<p>"And my baby?"</p>
<p>0, that cry! It curdled the hearts of all who heard it. It shook the souls of men and women both inside and outside the apartment; then all was forgotten in the wild rush she made. The wife and mother had flung herself upon the scene, and, side by side with the not unmoved policeman, stood looking down upon the desolation made in one fatal instant in her home and heart.</p>
<pb n="39 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
<p>They lay there together, both past help, both quite dead. The child had simply been strangled by the weight of his father's arm which lay directly across the upturned little throat. But the father was a victim of the shot they had heard. There was blood on his breast, and a pistol in his hand.</p>
<p>Suicide! The horrible truth was patent. No wonder they wanted to hold the young widow back. Her neighbour, Mrs. Saunders, crept in on tiptoe and put her arms about the swaying, fainting woman; but there was nothing to say--absolutely nothing.
<p>At least, they thought not. But when they saw her throw herself down, not by her husband, but by the child, and drag it out from under that strangling arm and hug and kiss it and call out wildly for a doctor, the officer endeavoured to interfere and yet could not find the heart to do so, though he knew the child was dead and should not, according to all the rules of the coroner's office, be moved before that official arrived. Yet because no mother could be convinced of a fact like this, he let her sit with it on the floor and try all her little arts to revive it, while he gave orders to the janitor and waited himself for the arrival of doctor and coroner.</p>
<p>She was still sitting there in wide-eyed misery,
<pb n="40 The Second Bullet">
alternately fondling the little body and drawing back to consult its small set features for some sign of life, when the doctor came, and, after one look at the child, drew it softly from her arms and laid it quietly in the crib from which its father had evidently lifted it but a short time before. Then he turned back to her, and found her on her feet, upheld by her two friends. She had understood his action, and without a groan had accepted her fate. Indeed, she seemed incapable of any further speech or action. She was staring down at her husband's body, which she, for the first time, seemed fully to see. Was her look one of grief or of resentment for the part he had played so unintentionally in her child's death? It was hard to tell; and when, with slowly rising finger, she pointed to the pistol so tightly clutched in the other outstretched hand, no one there-and by this time the room was full-could foretell what her words would be when her tongue regained its usage and she could speak.</p>
<p>What she did say was this:</p>
<p>"Is there a bullet gone? Did he fire off that pistol?" A question so manifestly one of delirium that no one answered it, which seemed to surprise her, though she said nothing till her glance had passed all around the walls of the room to where a
<pb n="41 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
window stood open to the night,--its lower sash being entirely raised. "There! look there!" she cried, with a commanding accent, and, throwing up her hands, sank a dead weight into the arms of those supporting her.</p>
<p>No one understood; but naturally more than one rushed to the window. An open space was before them.  Here lay the fields not yet parcelled out into lots and built upon; but it was not upon these they looked, but upon the strong trellis which they found there, which, if it supported no vine, formed a veritable ladder between this window and the ground.</p>
<p>Could she have meant to call attention to this fact; and were her words expressive of another idea than the obvious one of suicide?</p>
<p>If so, to what lengths a woman's imagination can go! Or so their combined looks seemed to proclaim, when to their utter astonishment they saw the officer who had presented a calm appearance up till now, shift his position and with a surprised grunt direct their eyes to a portion of the wall just visible beyond the half-drawn curtains of the bed. The mirror hanging there showed a star-shaped  breakage, such as follows the sharp impact of a bullet or a fiercely projected stone.</p>
<pb n="42 The Second Bullet">
<p>"He fired two shots. One went wild; the other straight home."</p>
<p>It was the officer delivering his opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Saunders, returning from the distant room where he had assisted in carrying Mrs. Hammond, cast a look at the shattered glass, and remarked forcibly:</p>
<p>"I heard but one; and I was sitting up, disturbed by that poor infant. Jennie, did you hear more than one shot?" he asked, turning toward his wife.</p>
<p>"No," she answered, but not with the readiness he had evidently expected. "I heard only one, but that was not quite usual in its tone. I'm used to guns," she explained, turning to the officer. "My father was an army man, and he taught me very early to load and fire a pistol. There was a prolonged sound to this shot; something like an echo of itself, following close upon the first ping. Didn't you notice that, Warren?"</p>
<p>"I remember something of the kind," her husband allowed.</p>
<p>"He shot twice and quickly," interposed the policeman, sententiously. "We shall find a spent bullet back of that mirror."</p>
<p>But when, upon the arrival of the coroner, an investigation was made of the mirror and the wall behind, no bullet was found either there or any-
<pb n="43 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
where else in the room, save in the dead man's breast. Nor had more than one been shot from his pistol, as five ful11 chambers testified. The case which seemed so simple had its mysteries, but the assertion made by Mrs. Saunders no longer carried weight, nor was the evidence offered by the broken mirror considered as indubitably establishing the fact that a second shot had been fired in the room.</p>
<p>Yet it was equally evident that the charge which had entered the dead speculator's breast had not been delivered at the close range of the pistol found clutched in his hand. There were no powder marks to be discerned on his pajama-jacket or on the flesh beneath. Thus anomaly confronted anomaly, leaving open but one other theory: that the bullet found in Mr. Hammond's breast came from the window and the one he shot went out of it. But this would necessitate his having shot his pistol from a point far removed from where he was found; and his wound was such as made it difficult to believe that he would stagger far, if at all, after its infliction.</p>
<p>Yet, because the coroner was both conscientious and alert, he caused a most rigorous search to be made of the ground overlooked by the above mentioned window; a search in which the police joined, but which was without any result save that
<pb n="44 The Second Bullet">
using the attention of people in the neighbourhood and leading to a story being circulated of a man seen some time the night before crossing the fields in a great hurry. But as no further particulars were forthcoming, and not even a description of the man to be had, no emphasis would have been laid upon this story had it not transpired that the moment a report of it had come to Mrs. Hammond's ears (why is there always some one to carry these reports?) she roused from the torpor into which she had fallen, and in wild fashion exclaimed:</p>
<p>"I knew it! I expected it! He was shot
through the window and by that wretch. He never shot himself." Violent declarations which trailed off into the one continuous wail, "0, my baby! my poor baby!"</p>
<p>Such words, even though the fruit of delirium, merited some sort of attention, or so this good coroner thought, and as soon as opportunity offered and she was sufficiently sane and quiet to respond to his questions, he asked her whom she had meant by that wretch, and what reason she had, or thought she had, of attributing her husband's death to any other agency than his own disgust with life.</p>
<p>And then it was that his sympathies, although
<pb n="45 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
greatly roused in her favour began to wane. She met the question with a cold stare followed by a few ambiguous words out of which he could make nothing. Had she said wretch? She did not remember They must not be influenced by anything she might have uttered in her first grief.  She was well-nigh insane at the time. But of one thing they might be sure: her husband had not shot himself; he was too much afraid of death for such an act. Besides, he was too happy. Whatever folks might say he was too fond of his family to wish to leave it.</p>
<p>Nor did the coroner or any other official succeed in eliciting anything further from her. Even when she was asked, with cruel insistence, how she explained the fact that the baby was found lying on the floor instead of in its crib, her only answer was: "His father was trying to soothe it. The child was crying dreadfully, as you have heard from those who were kept awake by him that night, and my husband was carrying him about when the shot came which caused George to fall and overlay the baby in his struggles."</p>
<p>"Carrying a baby about with a loaded pistol in his hand?" came back in stern retort.</p>
<p>She had no answer for this. She admitted when informed that the bullet extracted from her
<pb n="46 The Second Bullet">
husband's body had been found to correspond exactly with those remaining in the five chambers of the pistol taken from his hand, that he was not only the owner of this pistol but was in the habit of sleeping with it under his pillow; but, beyond that, nothing; and this reticence, as well as her manner which was cold and repellent, told against her.</p>
<p>A verdict of suicide was rendered by the coroner's jury, and the life-insurance company, in which Mr. Hammond had but lately insured himself for a large sum, taking advantage of the suicide clause embodied in the policy, announced its determination of not paying the same.</p>
<p>Such was the situation, as known to Violet Strange and the general public, on the day she was asked to see Mrs. Hammond and learn what might alter her opinion as to the justice of this verdict and the stand taken by the Shuler Life Insurance Company.</p>
<p>The clock on the mantel in Miss Strange's rose-coloured boudoir had struck three, and Violet was gazing in some impatience at the door, when there came a gentle knock upon it, and the maid (one of the elderly, not youthful, kind) ushered in her expected visitor.</p>
<pb n="47 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
<p>"You are Mrs. Hammond?" she asked, in natural awe of the too black figure outlined so sharply against the deep pink of the sea-shell room.</p>
<p>The answer was a slow lifting of the veil which shadowed the features she knew only from the cuts she had seen in newspapers.</p>
<p>"You are--Miss Strange?" stammered her visitor; "the young lady who--"</p>
<p>"I am," chimed in a voice as ringing as it was sweet. "I am the person you have come here to see. And this is my home. But that does not make me less interested in the unhappy, or less desirous of serving them. Certainly you have met with the two greatest losses which can come to a woman--I know your story well enough to say that--; but what have you to tell me in proof that you should not use your anticipated income as well? Something vital, I hope, else I cannot help you; something which you should have told the coroner's jury--and did not."</p>
<p>The flush which was the sole answer these words called forth did not take from the refinement of the young widow's expression, but rather added to it; Violet watched it in its ebb and flow and, seriously affected by it (why, she did not know, for Mrs. Hammond had made no other appeal</p>
<pb n="46 The Second Bullet">
either by look or gesture), pushed forward a chair and begged her visitor to be seated.</p>
<p>"We can converse in perfect safety here," she said. "When you feel quite equal to it, let me hear what you have to communicate. It will never go any further. I could not do the work I do if I felt it necessary to have a confidant."</p>
<p>"But you are so young and so--so--"</p>
<p>"So inexperienced you would say and so evidently a member of what New Yorkers call 'society.' Do not let that trouble you. My inexperience is not likely to last long and my social pleasures are more apt to add to my efficiency than to detract from it."</p>
<p>With this Violet's face broke into a smile. It was not the brilliant one so often seen upon her lips, but there was something in its quality which carried encouragement to the widow and led her to say with obvious eagerness:</p>
<p>"You know the facts?"</p>
<p>"I have read all the papers."</p>
<p>"I was not believed on the stand."</p>
<p>"It was your manner--"</p>
<p>"I could not help my manner. I was keeping something back, and, being unused to deceit, I could not act quite naturally."</p>
<p>"Why did you keep something back? When</p>
<pb n="47 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
you saw the unfavourable impression made by your reticence, why did you not speak up and frankly tell your story?"</p>
<p>"Because I was ashamed. Because I thought it would hurt me more to speak than to keep silent. I do not think so now; but I did then--and so made my great mistake. You must remember not only the awful shock of my double loss, but the sense of guilt accompanying it; for my husband and I had quarrelled that night, quarrelled bitterly--that was why I had run away into another room and not because I was feeling ill and impatient of the baby's fretful cries."</p>
<p>"So people have thought." In saying this, Miss Strange was perhaps cruelly emphatic. "You wish to explain that quarrel? You think it will be doing any good to your cause to go into that matter with me now?"</p>
<p>"I cannot say; but I must first clear my conscience and then try to convince you that quarrel or no quarrel, <hi rend="italic"> he</hi>never took his own life. He was not that kind. He had an abnormal fear of death. I do not like to say it but he was a physical coward. I have seen him turn pale at the least hint of danger. He could no more have, turned that muzzle upon his own breast than he could have turned it upon his baby. Some other hand shot</p>
4
<pb n="50 The Second Bullet">
him, Miss Strange. Remember the open window, the shattered mirror; and <hi rend="italic">I think I know that hand</hi>."</p>
<p>Her head had fallen forward on her breast. The emotion she showed was not so eloquent of grief as of deep personal shame.</p>
<p>"You think you know the <hi rend="italic">man?</hi>" In saying this, Violet's voice sunk to a whisper. It was an accusation of murder she had just heard.</p>
<p>"To my great distress, yes. When Mr. Hammond and I were married," the widow now proceeded in a more determined tone, "there was nother man--a very violent one--who vowed even at the church door that George and I should never live out two full years together. We have not. Our second anniversary would have been in November."</p>
<p>"But--"</p>
<p>"Let me say this: the quarrel of which I speak was not serious enough to occasion any such act of despair on his part. A man would be mad to end his life on account of so slight a disagreement. It was not even on account of the person of whom I've just spoken, though that person had been mentioned between us earlier in the evening, Mr.Hammond having come across him face to face that very afternoon in the subway. Up to this</p>
<pb n="47 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
times neither of us had seen or heard of him since our wedding day." </p>
<p>"And you think this person whom you barely mentioned, so mindful of his old grudge that he sought out your domicile, and, with the intention of murder, climbed the trellis leading to your room and turned his pistol upon the shadowy figure which was all he could see in the semi-obscurity of a much lowered gas-jet?"</p>
<p>"A man in the dark does not need a bright light to see his enemy when he is intent upon revenge."</p>
<p>Miss Strange altered her tone.</p>
<p>"And your husband? You must acknowledge that he shot off his pistol whether the other did or not."</p>
<p>"It was in self-defence. He would shoot to save his own life--or the baby's."</p>
<p>"Then he must have heard or seen--"</p>
<p>"A man at the window."</p>
<p>"And would have shot there? "</p>
<p>"Or tried to."</p>
<p>"Tried to?"</p>
<p>"Yes; the other shot first--oh, I've thought it all out--causing my husband's bullet to go wild. It was his which broke the mirror."</p>
<p>Violet's eyes, bright as stars, suddenly narrowed.</p>
<pb n="50 The Second Bullet">
<p>"And what happened then?" she asked. "Why cannot they find the bullet?"</p>
<p>"Because it went out of the window;--glanced off and went out of the window."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hammond's tone was triumphant; her look spirited and intense.</p>
<p>Violet eyed her compassionately.</p>
<p>"Would a bullet glancing off from a mirror, however hung, be apt to reach a window so far on the opposite side?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; I only know that it did," was the contradictory, almost absurd, reply.</p>
<p>"What was the cause of the quarrel you speak of between your husband and yourself? You see, I must know the exact truth and all the truth to be of any assistance to you."</p>
<p>"It was-it was about the care I gave, or didn't give, the baby. I feel awfully to have to say it, but George did not think I did my full duty by the child. He said there was no need of its crying so; that if I gave it the proper attention it would not keep the neighbours and himself awake half the night. And I--II got angry and insiste that I did the best I could; that the child was naturally fretful and that if he wasn't satisfied with my way of looking after it, he might try his. All of which was very wrong and unreason-</p>
<pb n="47 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
able on my part, as witness the awful punishment which followed."</p>
<p>"And what made you get up and leave him?"</p>
<p>"The growl he gave me in reply. When I heard that I bounded out of bed and said I was going to the spare room to sleep; and if the baby cried he might just try what he could do himself to stop it."</p>
<p>"And he answered?"</p>
<p>"This, just this--I shall never forget his words as long as I live--'If you go, you need not expect me to let you in again no matter what happens.'"</p>
<p>"He said that?"</p>
<p>"And locked the door after me. You see I could not tell all that."</p>
<p>"It might have been better if you had. It was such a natural quarrel and so unprovocative of actual tragedy."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hammond was silent. It was not difficult to see that she had no very keen regrets for her husband personally. But then he was not a very estimable man nor in any respect her equal.</p>
<p>"You were not happy with him," Violet ventured to remark.</p>
<p>"I was not a fully contented woman. But for all that he had no cause to complain of me except</p>
<pb n="54 The Second Bullet">
for the reason I have mentioned. I was not a very intelligent mother. But if the baby were living now--O, if he were living now--with what devotion I should care for him."</p>
<p>She was on her feet, her arms were raised, her face impassioned with feeling. Violet, gazing at her, heaved a little sigh. It was perhaps in keeping with the situation, perhaps extraneous to it, but whatever its source, it marked a change in her manner. With no further check upon her sympathy, she said very softly:</p>
<p>"It is well with the child."</p>
<p>The mother stiffened, swayed, and then burst into wild weeping.</p>
<p>"But not with me," she cried, "not with me. I am desolate and bereft. I have not even a home in which to hide my grief and no prospect of one."</p>
<p>"But," interposed Violet, "surely your husband left you something? You cannot be quite penniless?"</p>
<p>"My husband left nothing," was the answer, uttered without bitterness, but with all the hardness of fact. "He had debts. I shall pay those debts. When these and other necessary expenses are liquidated, there will be but little left. He made no secret of the fact that he lived close up</p>
<pb n="47 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
to his means. That is why he was induced to take on a life insurance. Not a friend of his but knows his improvidence. I--I have not even jewels. I have only my determination and an absolute conviction as to the real nature of my husband's death."</p>
<p>"What is the name of the man you secretly believe to have shot your husband from the trellis?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hammond told her.</p>
<p>It was a new one to Violet. She said so and then asked:</p>
<p>"What else can you tell me about him?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, but that he is a very dark man and has a club foot.</p>
<p>"Oh, what a mistake you've made."</p>
<p>"Mistake? Yes, I acknowledge that."</p>
<p>"I mean in not giving this last bit of information the police. A man can be identified by such a defect. Even his footsteps can be traced. He might have been found that very day. Now, what have we to go upon?"</p>
<p>"You are right, but not expecting to have any difficulty about the insurance money I thought it would be generous in me to keep still. Besides, this is only surmise on my part. I feel certain that my husband was shot by another hand than</p>
<pb n="56 The Second Bullet">
his own, but I know of no way of proving it. Do you?"</p>
<p>Then Violet talked seriously with her, explaining how their only hope lay in the discovery of a second bullet in the room which had already been ransacked for this very purpose and without the shadow of a result.</p>

<p>A tea, a musicale, and an evening dance kept Violet Strange in a whirl for the remainder of the day. No brighter eye nor more contagious wit lent brilliance to these occasions, but with the passing of the midnight hour no one who had seen her in the blaze of electric lights would have recognized this favoured child of fortune in the earnest figure sitting in the obscurity of an up-town apartment, studying the walls, the ceilings, and the floors by the dim light of a lowered gas-jet. Violet Strange in society was a very different person from Violet Strange under the tension of her secret and peculiar work.</p>
<p>She had told them at home that she was going to spend the night with a friend; but only her old coachman knew who that friend was. Therefore a very natural sense of guilt mingled with her emotions at finding herself alone on a scene whose gruesome mystery she could solve only by identify-</p>
<pb n="57 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
ing herself with the place and the man who had perished there.</p>
<p>Dismissing from her mind all thought of self, she strove to think as he thought, and act as he acted on the night when he found himself (a man of but little courage) left in this room with an ailing child.</p>
<p>At odds with himself, his wife, and possibly with the child screaming away in its crib, what would he be apt to do in his present emergency? Nothing at first, but as the screaming continued he would remember the old tales of fathers walking the floor at night with crying babies, and hasten to follow suit. Violet, in her anxiety to reach his inmost thought, crossed to where the crib had stood, and, taking that as a start, began pacing the room in search of the spot from which a bullet, if shot, would glance aside from the mirror in the direction of the window. (Not that she was ready to accept this theory of Mrs. Hammond, but that she did not wish to entirely dismiss it without putting it to the test.)</p>
<p>She found it in an unexpected quarter of the room and much nearer the bed-head than where his body was found. This, which might seem to confuse matters, served, on the contrary to remove from the case one of its most serious</p>
<pb n="58 The Second Bullet">
difficulties. Standing here, he was within reach of the pillow under which his pistol lay hidden, and if startled, as his wife believed him to have been by a noise at the other end of the room, had but to crouch and reach behind him in order to find himself armed and ready for a possible intruder.</p>
<p>Imitating his action in this as in other things, she had herself crouched low at the bedside and was on the point of withdrawing her hand from under the pillow, when a new surprise checked her movement and held her fixed in her position, with eyes staring straight at the adjoining wall. She had seen there what he must have seen in making this same turn--the dark bars of the opposite window-frame outlined in the mirror--and understood at once what had happened. In the nervousness and terror of the moment, George Hammond had mistaken this reflection of the window for the window itself, and shot impulsively at the man he undoubtedly saw covering him from the trellis without. But while this explained the shattering of the mirror, how about the other and still more vital question, of where the bullet went afterward? Was the angle at which it had been fired acute enough to send it out of a window diagonally opposed? No; even if the pistol had</p>
<pb n="59 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
been held closer to the man firing it than she had reason to believe, the angle still would be oblique enough to carry it on to the further wall.</p>
<p>But no sign of such impact had been discovered on this wall. Consequently, the force of the bullet had been expended before reaching it, and when it fell--</p>
<p>Here, her glance, slowly travelling along the floor, impetuously paused. It had reached the spot where the two bodies had been found, and unconsciously her eyes rested there, conjuring up the picture of the bleeding father and the strangled child. How piteous and how dreadful it all was. If she could only understand--  Suddenly she rose sbtraight up, staring and immovable in the dim light. Had the idea--the explanation--the only possible explanation covering the whole phenomena come to her at last?</p>
<p>It would seem so, for as she so stood, a look of conviction settled over her features, and with this look, evidences of a horror which for all her fast accumulating knowledge of life and its possibilities made her appear very small and very helpless.</p>
<p>A half-hour later, when Mrs. Hammond, in her anxiety at hearing nothing more from Miss</p>
<pb n="60 The Second Bullet">
Strange, opened the door of her room, it was to find, lying on the edge of the sill, the little detective's card with these words hastily written across it:</p>

<p>I do not feel as well as I could wish, and so have telephoned to my own coachman to come and take me home. I will either see or write you within a few days. But do not allow yourself to hope. I pray you do not allow yourself the least hope; the outcome is still very problematical.</p>

<p>When Violet's employer entered his office the next morning it was to find a veiled figure awaiting him which he at once recognized as that of his little deputy. She was slow in lifting her veil and when it finally came free he felt a momentary doubt as to his wisdom in giving her just such a matter as this to investigate. He was quite sure of his mistake when he saw her face, it was so drawn and pitiful.</p>
<p>"You have failed," said he.</p>
<p>"Of that you must judge," she answered; and drawing near she whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>"No!" he cried in his amazement.</p>
<p>"Think," she murmured, "think. Only so can all the facts be accounted for."</p>
<p>"I will look into it; I will certainly look into it," was his earnest reply. "If you are right--  But never mind that. Go home and take a horseback ride in the Park. When I have news in regard to this </p>
<pb n="61 Problem 2 for Violet Strange">
I will let you know. Till then forget it all. Hear me, I charge you to forget everything but your balls and your parties."</p>
<p>And Violet obeyed him.</p>

<p>Some few days after this, the following statement appeared in all the papers:</p>

<p>"Owing to some remarkable work done by the firm of ----&amp----, the well-known private detective agency, the claim made by Mrs. George Hammond against the Schuler Life Insurance Company is likely to be allowed without further litigation. As our readers will remember, the contestant has insisted from the first that the bullet causing her husband's death came from another pistol than the one found clutched in his own hand. But while reasons were not lacking to substantiate this assertion, the failure to discover more than the disputed track of a second bullet led to a verdict of suicide, and a refusal of the company to pay.</p>
<p>"But now that bullet has been found. And where? In the most startling place in the world, viz.: in larynx of the child found lying dead upon the floor beside his father, strangled as was supposed by the weight of that father's arm. The theory is, and there seems to be none other, that the father, hearing a suspicious noise at the window, set down the child he was endeavouring to soothe and made for the bed and his own pistol, and, mistaking a reflection of the assassin for the assassin himself, sent his shot sidewise at a mirror just as the other let go the trigger which drove a similar bullet into his breast. The course of the</p>
<pb n="62 The Second Bullet">
one was straight and fatal and that of the other deflected. Striking the mirror at an oblique angle,the bullet fell to the floor where it was picked up by the crawling child, and, as was most natural, thrust at once into his mouth. Perhaps it felt hot to the little tongue; perhaps the child was simply frightened by some convulsive movement of the father who evidently spent his last moment in an endeavour to reach the child, but, whatever the cause, in the quick gasp it gave, the bullet was drawn into the larynx, strangling him.</p>
<p>"That the father's arm, in his last struggle, should have fallen directly across the little throat is one of those anomalies which confounds reason and misleads justice by stopping investigation at the very point where truth lies and mystery disappears.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hammond is to be congratulated that there are detectives who do not give too much credence to outward appearances."</p>

<p>We expect soon to hear of the capture of the man who sped home the death-dealing bullet.</p>

PROBLEM III
AN INTANGIBLE CLUB

"HAVE you studied the case?"
<p>"Not I."</p>
<p>"Not studied the case which for the last few days has provided the papers with such conspicuous headlines?"</p>
<p>"I do not read the papers. I have not looked at one in a whole week."</p>
<p>"Miss Strange, your social engagements must be of a very pressing nature just now?"</p>
<p>"They are."</p>
<p>"And your business sense in abeyance?"</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"You would not ask if you had read the papers."</p>
<p>To this she made no reply save by a slight toss of her pretty head. If her employer felt nettled by this show of indifference, he did not betray it save by the rapidity of his tones as, without further preamble and possibly without real excuse, he proceeded to lay before her the case in question.</p>

<pb n="64 An Intangible Clue">
<p>"Last Tuesday night a woman was murdered in this city; an old woman, in a lonely house where she has lived for years. Perhaps you remember this house? It occupies a not inconspicuous site, in Seventeenth Street--a house of the olden time?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not remember."</p>
<p>The extreme carelessness of Miss Strange's tone would have been fatal to her socially; but then, she would never have used it socially. This they both knew, yet he smiled with his customary indulgence.</p>
<p>"Then I will describe it."</p>
<p>She looked around for a chair and sank into it. He did the same.</p>
<p>"It has a fanlight over the front door."</p>
<p>She remained impassive.</p>
<p>"And two old-fashioned strips of parti-coloured glass on either side."</p>
<p>"And a knocker between its panels which may bring money some day."</p>
<p>"Oh, you do remember! I thought you would, Miss Strange."</p>
<p>"Yes. Fanlights over doors are becoming very rare in New York."</p>
<p>"Very well, then. That house was the scene of Tuesday's tragedy. The woman who has lived there in solitude for years was foully murdered. I have since heard that the people who knew her </p>

<pb n="65 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
best have always anticipated some such violent end for her.  She never allowed maid or friend to remain with her after five in the afternoon; yet she had money--some think a great deal--always in the house."</p>
<p>"I am interested in the house, not in her."</p>
<p>"Yet, she was a character--as full of whims and crotchets as a nut is of meat. Her death was horrible. She fought--her dress was torn from her body in rags. This happened, you see, before her hour of retiring; some think as early as six in the afternoon.  And"--here he made a rapid gesture to catch Violet's wandering attention--"in spite of the fact that she was dragged from room to room---that her person was searched--and everything in the house searched--that drawers were pulled out of bureaus--doors wrenched off of cupboards--china smashed upon the floor--whole shelves denuded and not a spot from cellar to garret left unransacked, no direct clue to the perpetrator has been found--nothing that gives any idea of his personality save his display of strength and great cupidity. The police even deigned to consult me,--an unusual procedure--but I could find nothing, either. Evidences of fiendish purpose abound--of relentless search--but no clue to the man him-</p>

<pb n="66 An Intangible Clue">
self. It's uncommon, isn't it, not to have <hi rend="italic">any</hi>clue?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so." Miss Strange hated murders and it was with difficulty she could be brought to discuss them. But she was not going to be let off; not this time.</p>
<p>"You see," he proceeded insistently, "it's not only mortifying to the police but disappointing to the press, especially as few reporters believe in the No-thoroughfare business. They say, and we cannot but agree with them, that no such struggle could take place and no such repeated goings to and fro through the house without some vestige being left by which to connect this crime with its daring perpetrator."</p>
<p>Still she stared down at her hands--those little hands so white and fluttering, so seemingly help-less under the weight of their many rings, and yet so slyly capable.</p>
<p>"She must have queer neighbours," came at last, from Miss Strange's reluctant lips. "Didn't they hear or see anything of all this?" </p>
<p>"She has no neighbours--that is, after half-past five o'clock. There's a printing establishment on one side of her, a deserted mansion on the other side, and nothing but warehouses back and front. There was no one to notice what took place in her </p>

<pb n="67 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
small dwelling after the printing house was closed. She was the most foolish of women to remain there as she did. But nothing except death could budge her. She was born in the room where she died; was married in the one where she worked; saw husband, father, mother, and five sisters carried out in turn to their graves through the door with the fanlight over the top--and these memories held her."</p>
<p>"You are trying to interest me in the woman. Don't."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not trying to interest you in her, only trying to explain her. There was another reason for her remaining where she did so long after all residents lefy the block. She had a business."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>"She embroidered monograms for fine ladies."</p>
<p>"She did? But you needn't look at me like that. She never embroidered any for me."</p>
<p>"No? She did first class work. I saw some of it. Miss Strange, <hi rend="italic">if</hi>I could get you into that house for ten minutes--not to see her but to pick up the loose intangible thread which I am sure is floating around in it somewhere--wouldn't you go?"</p>
<p>Violet slowly rose--a movement which he followed to the letter.</p>

<pb n="68 An Intangible Clue">
<p>"Must I express in words the limit I have set for myself in our affair?" she asked. "When, for reasons I have never thought myself called upon to explain, I consented to help you a little now and then with some matter where a woman's tact and knowledge of the social world might tell without offence to herself or others, I never thought it would be necessary for me to state that temptation must stop with such cases, or that I should not be asked to touch the sordid or the bloody. But it seems I was mistaken, and that I must stoop to be explicit. The woman who was killed on Tuesday might have interested me greatly as an embroiderer, but as a victim, not at all. What do you see in me, or miss in me, that you should drag me into an atmosphere of low-down crime?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, Miss Strange. You are by nature, as well as by breeding, very far removed from everything of the kind. But you will allow me to suggest that no crime is low-down which makes imperative demand upon the intellect and intuitive sense of its investigator. Only the most delicate touch can feel and hold the thread I've just spoken of, and you have the most delicate touch I know."</p>
<p>"Do not attempt to flatter me. I have no fancy for handling befouled spider webs. Besides, if I had--if such elusive filaments fascinated me--</p>

<pb n="69 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
how could I, well-known in person and name, enter upon such a scene without prejudice to our mutual compact?"</p>
<p>"Miss Strange"--she had reseated herself, but so far he had failed to follow her example (an ignoring of the subtle hint that her interest might yet be caught, which seemed to annoy her a trifle), "I should not even have suggested such a possibility had I not seen a way of introducing you there without risk to your position or mine. Among the boxes piled upon Mrs. Doolittle's table--boxes of finished work, most of them addressed and ready for delivery--was one on which could be seen the name of--shall I mention it?"</p>
<p>"Not mine? You don't mean mine? That would be too odd--too ridiculously odd. I should not understand a coincidence of that kind; no, I should not, notwithstanding the fact that I have lately sent out such work to be done."</p>
<p>"Yet it was your name, very clearly and precisely written--your whole name, Miss Strange. I saw and read it myself."</p>
<p>"But I gave the order to Madame Pirot on Fifth Avenue. How came my things to be found in the house of this woman of whose horrible death we have been talking?"</p>
<p>"Did you suppose that Madame Pirot did such</p>

<pb n="70 An Intangible Clue">
work with her own hands?--or even had it done in her own establishment? Mrs. Doolittle was universally employed. She worked for a dozen firms. You will find the biggest names on most of her packages. But on this one--I allude to the one addressed to you--there was more to be seen than the name. These words were written on it in another hand. <hi rend="italic">Send without opening.</hi> This struck the police as suspicious; sufficiently so, at least, for them to desire your presence at the house as soon as you can make it convenient."</p>
<p>"To open the box?"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>The curl of Miss Strange's disdainful lip was a sight to see.</p>
<p>"You wrote those words yourself," she coolly observed. "While someone's back was turned, you whipped out your pencil and----'</p>
<p>"Resorted to a very pardonable subterfuge highly conducive to the public's good. But never mind that. Will you go?"</p>
<p>Miss Strange became suddenly demure.</p>
<p>"I suppose I must," she grudgingly conceded. "However obtained, a summons from the police cannot be ignored even by Peter Strange's daughter."</p>
<p>Another man might have displayed his triumph </p>

<pb n="71 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
by smile or gesture; but this one had learned his r&ocircle too well. He simply ysaid:</p>
<p>"Very good. Shall it be at once? I have a taxi at the door."</p>
<p>But she failed to see the necessity of any such hurry. With sudden dignity she replied:</p>
<p>"That won't do. If I go to this house it must be under suitable conditions. I shall have to ask my brother to accompany me."</p>
<p>"Your brother!"</p>
<p>Oh, he's safe. He--he knows."</p>
<p>"Your <hi rend="italic">brother knows</hi>?" Her visitor, with less control than usual, betrayed very openly his uneasiness.</p>
<p>"He does and--<hi rend="italic">approves</hi>. But that's not what interests us now, only so far as it makes it possible for me to go with propriety to that dreadful house."</p>
<p>A formal bow from the other and the words:</p>
<p>"They may expect you, then. Can you say when?"</p>
<p>"Within the next hour. But it will be a useless concession on my part," she pettishly complained. "A place that has been gone over by a dozen detectives is apt to be brushed clean of its cobwebs, even if such ever existed."</p>
<p>"That's the difficulty," he acknowledged; and</p>

<pb n="72 An Intangible Clue">
did not dare to add another word; she was at that particular moment so very much the great lady, and so little his confidential agent.</p>

<p>He might have been less impressed, however, by this sudden assumption of manner, had he been so fortunate as to have seen how she employed the three quarters of an hour's delay for which she had asked.</p>
<p>She read those neglected newspapers, especially the one containing the following highly coloured narration of this ghastly crime:</p>
<p>"A door ajar--an empty hall--a line of sinister looking blotches marking a guilty step diagonally across the flagging--silence--and an unmistakable odour repugnant to all humanity,--such were the indications which met the eyes of Officer O'Leary on his first round last night, and led to the discovery of a murder which will long thrill the city by its mystery and horror.</p>
<p>"Both the house and the victim are well known." Here followed a description of the same and of Mrs. Doolittle's manner of life in her ancient home, which Violet hurriedly passed over to come to the following:</p>
<p>"As far as one can judge from appearances, the crime happened in this wise: Mrs. Doolittle had</p>

<pb n="73 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
been in her kitchen, as the tea-kettle found singing on the stove goes to prove, and was coming back when the wretch, who had stolen in by the front dorr which, to save steps, she was unfortunately in the habit of leaving on the latch till all possibility of customers for the day was over, sprang upon her from behind and dealt her a swinging blow with the poker he had caught up from the hearthstone.</p>
<p>"Whether the struggle which ensued followed immediately upon this first attack or came later, it will take medical experts to determine. But, whenever it did occur, the fierceness of its character is shown by the grip taken upon her throat and the traces of blood which are to be seen all over the house. If the wretch had lugged her into her workroom and thence to the kitchen, and thence back to the spot of first assault, the evidences could not have been more ghastly. Bits of her clothing torn off by a ruthless hand, lay scattered over all these floors. In her bedroom, where she finally breathed her last, there could be seen mingled with these a number of large but worthless glass beads; and close against one of the baseboards, the string which had held them, as shown by the few remaining beads still clinging to it. If in pulling the string from her neck he had hoped </p>

<pb n="74 An Intangible Clue">
to light upon some valuable booty, his fury at his disappointment is evident. You can almost see the frenzy with which he flung the would-be necklace at the wall, and kicked about and stamped upon its rapidly rolling beads.</p>
<p>"Booty! That was what he was after; to find and carry away the poor needlewoman's supposed hoardings. If the scene baffles description--if, as some believe, he dragged her yet living from spot to spot, demanding information as to her places of concealment under threat of repeated blows, and, finally baffled, dealt the finishing stroke and proceeded on the search alone, no greater devastation could have taken place in this poor woman's house or effects. Yet such was his precaution and care for himself that he left no finger-print behind him nor any other token which could lead to personal identification. Even though his footsteps could be traced in much the order I have mentioned, they were of so indeterminate and shapeless a character as to convey little to the intelligence of the investigator.</p>
<p>"That these smears (they could not be called footprints) not only crossed the hall but appeared in more than one place on the staircase proves that he did not confine his search to the lower **storey**; and perhaps one of the most interesting</p>

<pb n="75 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
features of the case lies in the indications given by these marks if rge raging course he took through these upper rooms. As the accompanying diagram will show [we omit the diagram] he went first into the large front chamber, thence to the rear where we find two rooms, one unfinished and filled with accumulated stuff most of which he left lying loose upon the floor, and the other plastered, and containing a window opening upon an alley-way at the side, but empty of all furniture and without even a carpet on the bare boards.</p>
<p>"Why he should have entered the latter place, and why, having entered he should have crossed to the window, will be plain to those who have studied the conditions. The front chamber windows were tightly shuttered, the attic ones cumbered with boxes and shielded from approach by old bureaus and discarded chairs. This one only was free and, although darkened by the proximity of the house neighbouring it across the alley, was the only spot on the ***storey*** where sufficient light could be had at this late hour for the examination of any object of whose value he was doubtful. That he had come across such an object and had brought it to this window for some such purpose is very satisfactorily demonstrated by the discovery of a worn out wallet of ancient make lying on the floor directly</p>

<pb n="76 An Intangible Clue">
in front of this window--a proof of his cupidity but also proof of his ill-luck. For this wallet, when lifted and opened, was found to contain two hundred or more dollars in old bills, which, if not the full hoard of their industrious owner, was certainly worth the taking by one who had risked his neck for the sole purpose of theft.</p>
<p>"This wallet, and the flight of the murderer without it, give to this affair, otherwise simply brutal, a dramatic interest which will be appreciated not only by the very able detectives already hot upon the chase, but by all other inquiring minds anxious to solve a mystery of which so estimable a woman has been the unfortunate victim. A problem is presented to the police--"</p>
<p>There Violet stopped.</p>
<p>When, not long after, the superb limousine of Peter Strange stopped before the little house in Seventeenth Street, it caused a veritable sensation, not only in the curiosity-mongers lingering on the sidewalk, but to the two persons within--the officer on guard and a belated reporter.</p>
<p>Though dressed in her plainest suit, Violet Strange looked much too fashionable and far too young and thoughtless to be observed, without emotion, entering a scene of hideous and brutal</p>

<pb n="77 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
crime. Even the young man who accompanied her promised to bring a most incongruous element into this atmosphere of guilt and horror, and, as the detective on guard whispered to the man beside him, might much better have been left behind in the car.</p>
<p>But Violet was great for the proprieties and young Arthur followed her in.</p>
<p>Her entrance was a <hi rend="italic">coup du th&eacute$acirctre</hi>. She had lifted her veil in crossing the sidewalk and her interesting features and general air of timidity were very fetching. As the man holding open the door noted the impression made upon his companion, he muttered with sly facetiousness:</p>
<p>"You think you'll show her nothing; but I'm ready to bet a fiver that she'll want to see it all and that you'll show it to her."</p>
<p>The detective's grin was expressive, notwithstanding the shrug with which he tried to carry it off.</p>
<p>And Violet? The hall into which she now stepped from the most vivid sunlight had never been considered even in its palmiest days as possessing cheer even of the stately kind. The ghastly green light infused through it by the coloured glass on either side of the doorway seemed to promise yet more dismal things beyond.</p>

<pb n="78 An Intangible Clue">
<p>"Must I go in there?" she asked, pointing, with an admirable simulation of nervous excitement, to a half-shut door at her left. "Is there where it happened? Arthur, do you suppose that there is where it happened?"</p>
<p>"No, no, Miss," the officer made haste to assure her. "If you are Miss Strange" (Violet bowed), "I need hardly say that the woman was struck in her bedroom. The door beside you leads into the parlour, or as she would have called it, her work-room. You needn't be afraid of going in there. You will see nothing but the disorder of her boxes. They were pretty well pulled about. Not all of them though, he added, watching her as closely as the dim light permitted. There is one which gives no sign of having been tampered with. It was done up in wrapping paper and is addressed to you, which in itself would not have seemed worthy of our attention had not these lines been scribbled on it in a man's handwriting: <hi rend="italic">"Send without opening.</hi></p>
<p>"How odd!" exclaimed the little minx with widely opened eyes and an air of guileless innocence. "Whatever can it mean? Nothing serious I am sure, for the woman did not even know me. She was employed to do this work by Madame Pirot."</p>

<pb n="79 Problem 3 for Violet Strange">
<p>"Didn't you know that was to be done here?"</p>
<p>"No. I thought Madame Pirot's own girls did her embroidery for her."</p>
<p>"So that you were surprised----"</p>
<p>"Wasn't I!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to make of it."</p>
<p>The earnest, half-injured look with which she uttered this disclaimer, did its appointed work. The detective accepted her for what she seemed and, oblivious to the reporter's satirical gesture, crossed to the work-room door, which he threw wide open with the remark:</p>
<p>"I should be glad to have you open that box in our presence. It is undoubtedly all right, but we wish to be sure  You know what the box should contain?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, indeed; pillow-cases and sheets, with a big S embroidered on them.</p>
<p>"Very well. Shall I undo the string for you?"</p>
<p>I shall be much obliged," said she, her eye flashing quickly about the room before settling down upon the knot he was deftly loosening.</p>
<p>Her brother ther gazing indifferently in from the doorway, hardly noticed this look; but the reporter at his back did, though he failed to detect its quality.</p>

<p>"Your name is on the other side," observed the detective as he drew away the string and turned the package over.</p>
<p>The smile which just lifted the corner of her lips was not in answer to this remark, but to her recognition of her employer's handwriting in the words under her name: <hi rend="italic">Send without opening.</hi> She had not misjudged him.</p>
<p>"The cover you may like to take off yourself," suggested the officer, as he lifted the box out of its wrapper.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't mind. There's nothing to be ashamed of in embroidered linen. Or perhaps that is not what you are looking for?"</p>
<p>No one answered. All were busy watching her whip off the lid and lift out the pile of sheets and pillow-cases with which the box was closely packed.</p>
<p>"Shall I unfold them?" she asked.</p>
<p>The detective nodded.</p>
<p>Taking out the topmost sheet, she shook it open. Then the next and the next till she reached the bottom of the box. Nothing of a criminating nature came to light. The box as well as its contents was without mystery of any kind. This was not an unexpected result of course, but the smile with which she began to refold the pieces and throw them back into the box, revealed one</p>

of her dimples which was almost as dangerous to the casual observer as when it revealed both.</p>
<p>"There," she exclaimed, "you see! Household linen exactly as I said. Now may I go home?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Miss Strange."</p>
<p>The detective stole a sly glance at the reporter. She was not going in for the horrors then after all.</p>
<p>But the reporter abated nothing of his knowing air, for while she spoke of going, she made not move towards doing so, but continued to look about the room till her glances finally settled on a long dark curtain shutting off an adjoining room.</p>
<p>"There's where she lies, I suppose," she feelingly exclaimed. "And not one of you knows who killed her. Somehow, I cannot understand that. Why don't you know when that's what you're hired for?" The innocence with which she uttered this was astonishing. The detective began to look sheepish and the reporter turned aside to hide his smile. Whether in another moment either would have spoken no one can say, for, with a mock consciousness of having said something foolish, she caught up her parasol from the table and made a start for the door.</p>

o this seemingly irresponsible chatter. To them
she was a child to be humoured and humour her

found their way to that gloomy staircase were
allowed to ascend, followed it is true by those of
, the officer who did not dare to smile back at the
reporter because of the brother's watchful and
none too conciliatory eye.
At the stair head she paused to look back.
"I don't see those horrible marks which the
papers describe as running all along the lower
hall and up these stairs."
"No, Miss Strange; they have gradually been
rubbed out, but you will find some still showing on
these upper floors."
"Oh! oh! where? You frighten me-frighten
me horribly! But-but-if you don't mind, I
hould like to see."
Why should not a man on a tedious job amuse
himself? Piloting her over to the small room in
the rear, he pointed down at the boards. She
gave one look and then stepped gingerly in.
"Just look!" she cried; "a whole string of
marks going straight from door to window. They
have no shape, have they,-just blotches? I
wonder why one of them is so much larger than
the rest?"

This did not seem to offend Miss Strange.
On the contrary it gave her an opportunity to
babble away to her heart's content.
"One, two, three, four, five, six," she counted, 
with a shudder at every count. "And one of
them bigger than the others." She might have
added, "It is the trail of one foot, and strangely
intermingled at that," but she did not, though 
we may be quite sure that she noted the fact.
"And where, just where did the old wallet fall? '
Here? or here ?"
She had moved as she spoke, so that in uttering 
the last "here," she stood directly before the
window. The surprise she received there nearly
made her forget the part she was playing. From 
the character of the light in the room, she had
expected, on looking out, to confront a near-by
wall, but not a window in that wall. Yet that

regard to the possible renting of the Shaffer house.
She had an old lady friend who was desirous of
living downtown.
In passing through Seventeenth Street, she had
noticed that the old Shaffer house was standing
empty and had been immediately struck with the
advantages it possessed for her elderly friend's
occupancy. Could it be that the house was for
rent? There was no sign on it to that effect,
but-etc.
His answer left her nothing to hope for.
"It is going to be torn down," he said.
"Oh, what a pity!" she exclaimed. "Real
colonial, isn't it! I wish I could see the rooms
inside before it is disturbed. Such doors and
such dear old-fashioned mantelpieces as it must
have! I just dote on the Colonial. It brings up
such pictures of the old days; weddings, you know,
and parties;-all so different from ours and so
much more interesting."
Is it the chance shot that tells? Sometimes.
Violet had no especial intention in what she said
save as a prelude to a pending request, but nothing
could have served her purpose better than that
one word, wedding. The agent laughed and giving
her his first indulgent look, remarked genially:
"Romance is not confined to those ancient

times. If you were to enter that house to-day ;
you would come across evidences of a wedding as 
romantic as any which ever took place in all the 
seventy odd years of its existence. A man and
a woman were married there day before yesterday
who did their first courting under its roof forty
years ago. He has been married twice and she
once in the interval; but the old love held firm and
now at the age of sixty and over they have come
together to finish their days in peace and happiness.
Or so we will hope."
"Married! married in that house and on the
day that-"
She caught herself up in time. He did not
notice the break.
"Yes, in memory of those old days of court-
ship, I suppose. They came here about five,
got the keys, drove off, went through the cere-
mony in that empty house, returned the keys to 
me in my own apartment, took the steamer for
Naples, and were on the sea before midnight.
Do you not call that quick work as well as highly '
romantic?"
"Very." Miss Strange's cheek had paled. 
It was apt to when she was greatly excited. "But
I don't understand," she added, the moment 
after. "How could they do this and nobody know




<pb n="89"/>
Problem 3 for Violet Strange      89
about it? I should have thought it would have
got into the papers."
"They are quiet people. I don't think they
told their best friends. A simple announcement
in the next day's journals testified to the fact of
their marriage, but that was all. I would not
have felt at liberty to mention the circumstances
myself, if the parties were not well on their way to
Europe."
"Oh, how glad I am that you did tell me!
Such a story of constancy and the hold which
old associations have upon sensitive minds!
But-"
"Why, Miss? What's the matter? You look
very much disturbed."
"Don't you remember? Haven't you thought?
Something else happened that very day and almost
at the same time on that block. Something very
dreadful--"
"Mrs. Doolittle's murder?"
"Yes. It was as near as next door, wasn't it?
Oh, if this happy couple had known -"
"But fortunately they didn't. Nor are they
likely to, till they reach the other side. You
needn't fear that their honeymoon will be spoiled
that way."
"But they may have heard something or seen

notice how the gentleman looked when he returned 
you the keys?"
"I did, and there was no cloud on his satis- 
faction."
"Oh, how you relieve me!" One-two dimples

young cheeks. "Well! I wish them joy. Do
you mind telling me their names? I cannot think 
of them as actual persons without knowing their
names."
"The gentleman was Constantin Amidon; the
lady, Marian Shaffer. You will have to think
of them now as Mr. and Mrs. Amidon."
"And I will. Thank you, Mr. Hutton, thank
you very much. Next to the pleasure of getting
the house for my friend, is that of hearing this
charming bit of news in its connection."
She held out her hand and, as he took it,
remarked:
"They must have had a clergyman and wit-
nesses."
"Undoubtedly."
"I wish I had been one of the witnesses," she
sighed sentimentally.
"They were two old men."
"Oh, no! Don't tell me that."

"Fogies; nothing less."
"But the clergyman? He must have been
young. Surely there was some one there capable
of appreciating the situation?"
"I can't say about that; I did not see the
clergyman."
"Oh, well! it doesn't matter." Miss Strange's
manner was as nonchalant as it was charming.
'"We will think of him as being very young."
And with a merry toss of her head she flitted
away.
But she sobered very rapidly upon entering
her limousine.
"Hello!"
"Ah, is that you?"
"Yes, I want a Marconi sent."
"A Marconi?"
"Yes, to the Cretic, which left dock the very

adjoining house? No remarks, please. I use tlh
telephone because I am not ready to explain my
self. If she did, let her send a written descriptio
to you of that person as soon as she reaches the
Azores."
"You surprise me. May I not call or hope
for a line from you early to-morrow?" 
"I shall be busy till you get your answer."
He hung up the receiver. He recognized the
resolute tone.
But the time came when the pending explanation'
was fully given to him. An answer had been'
returned from the steamer, favourable to Violet's 
hopes. Mrs. Amidon had seen such a person and
would send a full description of the same at the
first opportunity. It was news to fill Violet's:
heart with pride; the filament of a clue which had
led to this great result had been so nearly invisible
and had felt so like nothing in her grasp.
To her employer she described it as follows:
"When I hear or read of a case which contains
any baffling features, I am apt to feel some hidden
chord in my nature thrill to one fact in it and 
not to any of the others. In this case the single 
fact which appealed to my imagination was the




<pb n="93"/>
Problem 3 for Violet Strange      93
dropping of the stolen wallet in that upstairs room.
Why did the guilty man drop it? and why, having
dropped it, did he not pick it up again? But one
answer seemed possible. He had heard or seen
something at the spot where it fell which not only
alarmed him but sent him in flight from the house."
"Very good; and did you settle to your own
mind the nature of that sound or that sight?"
"I did." Her manner was strangely business-
like. No show of dimples now. "Satisfied that
if any possibility remained of my ever doing this,
it would have to be on the exact place of this
occurrence or not at all, I embraced your sugges-
tion and visited the house."
"And that room no doubt."
"And that room. Women, somehow, seem to
manage such things."
"So I've noticed, Miss Strange. And what
was the result of your visit? What did you dis-
cover there?"
"This: that one of the blood spots marking
the criminal's steps through the room was de-
cidedly more pronounced than the rest; and, what
was even more important, that the window out of
which I was looking had its counterpart in the
house on the opposite side of the alley. In gazing
through the one I was gazing through the other;




<pb n="94"/>
94         An Intangible Clue
and not only that, but into the darkened area of
the room beyond. Instantly I saw how the latter ;
fact might be made to explain the former one.
But before I say how, let me ask if it is quite
settled among you that the smears on the floor
and stairs mark the passage of the criminal's
footsteps!"
"Certainly; and very bloody feet they must
have been too. His shoes-or rather his one shoe
-for the proof is plain that only the right one left
its mark-must have become thoroughly satu-
rated to carry its traces so far."
"Do you think that any amount of saturation
would have done this? Or, if you are not ready
to agree to that, that a shoe so covered with blood
could have failed to leave behind it some hint of
its shape, some imprint, however faint, of heel or
toe? But nowhere did it do this. We see a
smear-and that is all."
"You are right, Miss Strange; you are always
right. And what do you gather from this?"
She looked to see how much he expected from
her, and, meeting an eye not quite as free from all
ironic suggestion as his words had led her to
expect, faltered a little as she proceeded to say:
"My opinion is a girl's opinion, but such as
it is you have the right to have it. From the indi-




<pb n="95"/>
Problem   3 for Violet Strange    95
cations mentioned I could draw but this conclu-
sion: that the blood which accompanied the
criminal's footsteps was not carried through the
house by his shoes;-he wore no shoes; he did not
even wear stockings; probably he had none. For
reasons which appealed to his judgment, he went
about his wicked work barefoot; and it was the
blood from his own veins and not from those of his
victim which made the trail we have followed
with so much interest. Do you forget those
broken beads;-how he kicked them about and
stamped upon them in his fury? One of them
pierced the ball of his foot, and that so sharply
that it not only spurted blood but kept on bleeding
with every step. he took. Otherwise, the trail
would have been lost after his passage up the
stairs."
"Fine!" There was no irony in the bureau-
chief's eye now. "You are progressing, Miss
Strange. Allow me, I pray, to kiss your hand.
It is a liberty I have never taken, but one which
would greatly relieve my present stress of feeling."
She lifted her hand toward him, but it was in
gesture, not in recognition of his homage.
"Thank you," said she, "but I claim   no
monopoly on deductions so simple as these. I
have not the least doubt that not only yourself

upon him from the neighbouring house which he"
had probably been told was empty. The shock :
disturbed his judgment. He saw his crime dis-c
covered-his guilty secret read, and fled in un-
reasoning panic. He might better have held on
to his wits. It was this display of fear which led 
me to search after its cause, and consequently to

,   discover that at this especial hour more than one
person had been in the Shaffer house; that, in
fact, a marriage had been celebrated there under
circumstances as romantic as any we read of in
books, and that this marriage, privately carried
out, had been followed by an immediate voyage
of the happy couple on one of the White Star
steamers. With the rest you are conversant. I
do not need to say anything about what has
followed the sending of that Marconi."
"But I am going to say something about your
work in this matter, Miss Strange. The big
'detectives about here will have to look sharp
if--"
"Don't, please! Not yet." A smile softened
the asperity of this interruption. "The man has
yet to be caught and identified. Till that is done
I cannot enjoy any one's congratulations. And
you will see that all this may not be so easy. If
no one happened to meet the desperate wretch
before he had an opportunity to retie his shoe-
laces, there will be little for you or even for the
police to go upon but his wounded foot, his un-
doubtedly carefully prepared alibi, and later, a
woman's confused description of a face seen but
for a moment only and that under a personal
excitement precluding minute attention. I should

not be surprised if the whole thing came to
nothing."
But it did not. As soon as the description was
received from Mrs. Amidon (a description, by the
way, which was unusually clear and precise, owing
to the peculiar and contradictory features of the
man), the police were able to recognize him among
the many suspects always under their eye. Ar-
rested, he pleaded, just as Miss Strange had fore-
told, an alibi of a seemingly unimpeachable
character; but neither it, nor the plausible explana-
tion with which he endeavoured to account for a
freshly healed scar amid the callouses of his right
foot, could stand before Mrs. Amidon's unequiv-
ocal testimony that he was the same man she had
seen in Mrs. Doolittle's upper room on the after-
noon of her own happiness and of that poor
woman's murder.
The moment when, at his trial, the two faces
again confronted each other across a space no
wider than that which had separated them on the
dread occasion in Seventeenth Street, is said to
have been one of the most dramatic in the annals
of that ancient court room.

PROBLEM IV
THE GROTTO SPECTRE
M   ISS STRANGE was not often pensive-at
least not at large functions or when under
the public eye. But she certainly forgot herself
at Mrs. Provost's musicale and that, too, without
apparent reason. Had the music been of a high
order one might have understood her abstraction;
but it was of a decidedly mediocre quality, and
Violet's ear wasmuch too fine and her musical sense
too cultivated for her to be beguiled by anything
less than the very best.
Nor had she the excuse of a dull companion.
Her escort for the evening was a man of unusual
conversational powers; but she seemed to be almost
oblivious of his presence; and when, through some
passing courteous impulses she did turn her ear his
way, it was with just that tinge of preoccupation
which betrays the divided mind.
Were hea thoughts with some secret problem yet
unsolved? It would scarcely seem so from the




<pb n="100"/>
Ioo        The Grotto Spectre 
gay remark with which she had left home. She
was speaking to her brother and her words were:
"I am going out to enjoy myself. I've not a care
in the world. The slate is quite clean." Yet she
had never seemed more out of tune with her sur-
roundings nor shown a mood further removed from
trivial entertainment. What had happened to
becloud her gaiety in the short time which had
since elapsed?
We can answer in a sentence.
She had seen, among a group of young men in a
distant doorway, one with a face so individual and
of an expression so extraordinary that all interest
in the people about her had stopped as a clock
stops when the pendulum is held back. She could
see nothing else, think of nothing else. Not
that it was so very handsome-though no other
had ever approached it in its power over her
imagination-but because of its expression of
haunting melancholy,-a melancholy so settled and
so evidently the result of long-continued sorrow
that her interest had been reached and her heart-
strings shaken as never before in her whole life.
She would never be the same Violet again.
Yet moved as she undoubtedly was, she was not
conscious of the least desire to know who the young
man was, or even to be made acquainted with his




<pb n="101"/>
      Problem 4 for Violet Strange     IoI
story. She simply wanted to dream her dream
undisturbed.
It was therefore with a sense of unwelcome shock
that, in the course of the reception following the
programme, she perceived this same young man
approaching herself, with his right hand touching
his left shoulder in the peculiar way which com-
mitted her to an interview with or without a formal
introduction.
Should she fly the ordeal? Be blind and deaf
to whatever was significant in his action, and go
her way before he reached her; thus keeping her
dream intact? Impossible. His eye prevented
that. His glance had caught hers and she felt
forced to await his advance and give him her
first spare moment.
It came soon, and when it came she greeted him
with a smile. It was the first she had ever be-
stowed in welcome of a confidence of whose tenor
she was entirely ignorant.
To her relief he showed his appreciation of the
dazzling gift though he made no effort to return
it. Scorning all preliminaries in his eagerness to
discharge himself of a burden which was fast be-
coming intolerable, he addressed her at once in
these words:
"You are very good, Miss Strange, to receive

me in this unconventional fashion. I am in that
desperate state of mind which precludes etiquette.
Will you listen to my petition? I am told-you
know by whom-"(and he again touched his
shoulder) "that you have resources of intelligence
which especially fit you to meet the extraordinary
difficulties of my position. May I beg you to exer-
cise them in my behalf? No man would be more
grateful if-  But I see that you do not recognize
me. I am Roger Upjohn. That I am admitted to
this gathering is owing to the fact that our hostess
knew and loved my mother. In my anxiety to
meet you and proffer my plea, I was willing to
brave the cold looks you have probably noticed
on the faces of the people about us. But I have
no right to subject you to criticism. I-"
"Remain." Violet's voice was troubled, her
self-possession disturbed; but there was a com-
mand in her tone which he was only too glad to
obey. " I know the name" (who did not!) "and
possibly my duty to myself should make me shun
a confidence which may burden me without reliev-
ing you. But you have been sent to me by one
whose behests I feel bound to respect and-"
Mistrusting her voice, she stopped. The suffer-
ing which made itself apparent in the face before
her appealed to her heart in a way to rob her of




<pb n="103"/>
r          Problem 4 for Violet Strange     103
F  her judgment. She did not wish this to be seen,
and so fell silent.
He was quick to take advantage of her obvious
embarrassment. "Should I have been sent to
you if I had not first secured the confidence of the
sender? You know the scandal attached to my
name, some of it just, some of it very unjust. If
you will grant me an interview to-morrow, I will
make an endeavour to refute certain charges which
I have hitherto let go unchallenged. Will you do
me this favour? Will you listen in your own house
to what I have to say?"
Instinct cried out against any such concessicn
on her part, bidding her beware of one who
charmed without excellence and convinced with-

and compassion won the day. Though conscious
of weakness,-she, Violet Strange on whom strong
men had come to rely in critical hours calling for
well-balanced judgment,-she did not let this con-
cern her, or allow herself to indulge in useless re-
grets even after the first effect of his presence had
passed and she had succeeded in recalling the facts
which had cast a cloud about his name.
Roger Upjohn was a widower, and the scandal
AL   affecting him was connected with his wife's death.

Though a degenerate in some respects, lacking
the domineering presence, the strong mental quali-
ties, and inflexible character of his progenitors,
the wealthy Massachusetts Upjohns whose great
place on the coast had a history as old as the State
itself, he yet had gifts and attractions of his own
which would have made him a worthy representa-
tive of his race, if only he had not fixed his affec-
tions on a woman so cold and heedless that she
would have inspired universal aversion instead of
love, had shenot been dowered with the beauty
and physical fascination which sometimes accom-
pany a hard heart and a scheming brain. It was
this beauty which had caught the lad; and one
day, just as the careful father had mapped out a
course of study calculated to make a man of his
son, that son drove up to the gates with this lady
whom he introduced as his wife.
The shock, not of her beauty, though that was
of the dazzling quality which catches a man in the
throat and makes a slave of him while the first
surprise lasts, but of the overthrow of all his hopes
and plans, nearly prostrated Homer Upjohn. He
saw, as most men did the moment judgment re-
turned, that for all her satin skin and rosy flush,
the wonder of her hair and the smile which pierced
like arrows and warmed like wine, she was more

took to inviting friends to meet them in th
grotto which, through the agency of one old serv
ant devoted to Roger to the point of folly, h
been fitted up and lighted in a manner not onl
comfortable but luxurious. A small but shelter
haven hidden in the curve of the rocks made 
approach by boat feasible at high tide; and at lo
the connection could be made by means of 
path over the promontory in which this grotto lay
concealed. The fortune which Roger had in-
herited from his mother made these excesses possi,

call his, soon disappeared under the witchery of an
irresponsible woman, and the half-dozen friends

a man to be approached lightly, nor was he one to
listen to charges without ocular proof to support

than was possessed by any one who knew them

with a heart of gold for those he loved. This,  1

bewitching graces. But he never changed his
first opinion of her, and once she became fully
convinced of the folly of her efforts, she gave up all
attempt to please him and showed an open indiffer-
ence. This in time gradually extended till it
embraced not only her child but her husband as
well. Yes, it had come to that. His love no
longer contented her. Her vanity had grown by
what it daily fed on, and now called for the admi-
ration of the fast men who sometimes came up
from Boston to play with them in their unholy
retreat. To win this, she dressed like some
demon queen or witch, though it drove her hus-
band into deeper play and threatened an exposure
which would mean disaster not only to herself but
to the whole family.
In all this, as any one could see, Roger had been
her slave and the willing victim of all her caprices.
What was it, then, which so completely changed
him that a separation began to be talked of and
even its terms discussed? One rumour had it
that the father had discovered the secret of the
grotto and exacted this as a penalty from the son
who had dishonoured him. Another, that Roger
himself was the one to take the initiative in this
matter: That, on returning unexpectedly from
New York one evening and finding her missing

from the house, he had traced her to the grotto
where he came upon her playing a desperate game
with the one man he had the greatest reason to
distrust.
But whatever the explanation of this sudden'
change in their relations, there is but little doubt
that a legal separation between this ill-assorted
couple was pending, when one bleak autumn morn-
ing she was discovered dead in her bed under
circumstances peculiarly open to comment.
The physicians who made out the certificate
ascribed her death to heart-disease, symptoms of
which had lately much alarmed the family doctor;
but that a personal struggle of some kind had
preceded the fatal attack was evident from the
bruises which blackened her wrists. Had there
been the like upon her throat it might have gone
hard with the young husband who was known to
be contemplating her dismissal from the house.
But the discoloration of her wrists was all, and as
bruised wrists do not kill and there was besides no
evidence forthcoming of the two having spent one
moment together for at least ten hours preceding
the tragedy but rather full and satisfactory testi-
mony to the contrary, the matter lapsed and all
criminal proceedings were avoided.
But not the scandal which always follows the

unexplained. As time passed and the peculiar
look which betrays the haunted soul gradually
became visible in the young widower's eyes,
doubts arose and reports circulated which cast
strange reflections upon the tragic end of his mis-
taken marriage. Stories of the disreputable use
to which the old grotto had been put were mingled
with vague hints of conjugal violence never pro-
perly investigated. The result was his general
avoidance not only by the social set dominated by
his high-minded father, but by his own less re-
putable coterie, which, however lax in its moral
code, had very little use for a coward.
Such was the gossip which had reached Violet's
ears in connection with this new client, prejudicing
her altogether against him till she caught that
beam of deep and concentrated suffering in his eye
and recognized an innocence which ensured her
sympathy and led her to grant him the interview
for which he so earnestly entreated.
He came prompt to the hour, and when she
saw him again with the marks of a sleepless night
upon him and all the signs of suffering intensified
in his unusual countenance, she felt her heart sink
within her in a way she failed to understand. A 
dread of what she was about to hear robbed her of

all semblance of self-possession, and she stood like'
one in a dream as he uttered his first greetings and '
then paused to gather up his own moral strength 
before he began his story. When he did speak it 
was to say: 
"I find myself obliged to break a vow I have
made to myself. You cannot understand my need
unless I show you my heart. My trouble is not
the one with which men have credited me. It has
another source and is infinitely harder to bear.
Personal dishonour I have deserved in a greater
or less degree, but the trial which has come to me
now involves a person more dear to me than
myself, and is totally without alleviation unless
you-"    He paused, choked, then recommenced
abruptly: "My wife "-Violet held her breath-
"was supposed to have died from heart-disease or
-or some strange species of suicide. There were
reasons for this conclusion-reasons which I ac-
cepted without serious question till some five weeks
ago when I made a discovery which led me to

The broken sentence hung suspended. Violet,
notwithstanding his hurried gesture, could not:

II2        The Grotto Spectre 
the morning preceding the day of Mrs. Upjohn's 
death, an interview took place between us at which 
my father was present. You do not know my
father, Miss Strange. A strong man and a stern
one, with a hold upon old traditions which nothing
can shake. If he has a weakness it is for my little
boy Roger in whose promising traits he sees the
one hope which has survived the shipwreck of all
for which our name has stood. Knowing this, and
realizing what the child's presence in the house
meant to his old age, I felt my heart turn sick
with apprehension, when in the midst of the dis-
cussion as to the terms on which my wife would 
consent to a permanent separation, the little fellow
came dancing into the room, his curls atoss and his
whole face beaming with life and joy.
"She had not mentioned the child, but I knew
her well enough to be sure that at the first show
of preference on his part for either his grandfather
or myself, she would raise a claim to him which
she would never relinquish.  I dared not speak,
but I met his eager looks with my most forbidding
frown and hoped by this show of severity to hold
him back. But his little heart was full and, ignor-
ing her outstretched arms, he bounded towards
mine with his most affectionate cry. She saw and
uttered her ultimatum. The child should go with i

her or she would not consent to a separation. It
was useless for us to talk; she had said her last
word.  The blow'struck me hard, or so I thought,
till I looked at my father. Never had I beheld
such a change as that one moment had made in
him. He stood as before; he faced us with the same
silent reprobation; but his heart had run from him
like water.
"It was a sight to call up all my resources.
To allow her to remain now, with my feelings to-
wards her all changed and my father's eyes fully
opened to her stony nature, was impossible. Nor
could I appeal to law. An open scandal was my
father's greatest dread and divorce proceedings his
horror. The child would have to go unless I
could find a way to influence her through her own
nature. I knew of but one-do not look at me,
Miss Strange. It was dishonouring to us both,
and I am horrified now when I think of it. But to
me at that time it was natural enough as a last
resort. There was but one debt which my wife
ever paid, but one promise she ever kept. It was
that made at the gaming-table. I offered, as soon
as my father, realizing the hopelessness of the
situation, had gone tottering from the room,
to gamble with her for the child.
"And she accepted. "




<pb n="114"/>
II4        The Grotto Spectre
The shame and humiliation expressed in this final'
whisper; the sudden darkness-for a storm was
coming up-shook Violet to the soul. With
strained gaze fixed on the man before her, now little
more than a shadow in the prevailing gloom, she
waited for him to resume, and waited in vain.
The minutes passed, the darkness became intoler-
able, and instinctively her hand crept towards the
electric button beneath which she was sitting.
But she failed to press it. A tale so dark called for
an atmosphere of its own kind. She would cast
no light upon it. Yet she shivered as the silence
continued, and started in uncontrollable dismay
when at length her strange visitor rose, and still,
without speaking, walked away from her to the
other end of the room. Only so could he go on
with the shameful tale; and presently she heard
his voice once more in these words:
"Our house is large and its rooms many; but for
such work as we two contemplated there was but
one spot where we could command absolute seclu- 
sion. You may have heard of it, a famous natural
grotto hidden in our own portion of the coast and
so fitted up as to form a retreat for our miserable
selves when escape from my father's eye seemed
desirable. It was not easy of access, and no one,
so far as we knew, had ever followed us there.




<pb n="115"/>
Problem 4 for Violet Strange     II5
But to ensure ourselves against any possible in-
terruption, we waited till the whole house was abed
before we left it for the grotto. We went by boat
and oh! the dip of those oars! I hear them yet.
And the witchery of her face in the moonlight;
and the mockery of her low fitful laugh! As I
caught the sinister note in its silvery rise and fall,
I knew what was before me if I failed to retain my
composure. And I strove to hold it and to meet
her calmness with stoicism and the taunt of her
expression with a mask of immobility. But the
effort was hopeless, and when the time came for
dealing out the cards, my eyes were burning in
their sockets and my hands shivering like leaves
in a rising gale.
"We played one game-and my wife lost. We
played another-and my wife won. We played
the third-and the fate I had foreseen from the
first became mine. The luck was with her, and
I had lost my boy !"
A gasp-a pause, during which the thunder
spoke and the lightning flashed,-then a hurried
catching of his breath and the tale went on.
"A burst of laughter, rising gaily above the
boom of the sea, announced her victory-her
laugh and the taunting words: 'You play badly,
Roger. The child is mine. Never fear that I

shall fail to teach him to revere his father.' Had
I a word to throw back? No. When I realized
anything but my dishonoured manhood, I found
myself in the grotto's mouth staring helplessly out
upon the sea. The boat which had floated us in
at high tide lay stranded but a few feet away, but
I did not reach for it. Escape was quicker over
the rocks, and I made for the rocks.
"That it was a cowardly act to leave her there
to find her way back alone at midnight by the same
rough road I was taking, did not strike my mind
for an instant. I was in flight from my own past;
in flight from myself and the haunting dread of
madness. When I awoke to reality again it was to
find the small door, by which we had left the house,
standing slightly ajar. I was troubled by this, for
I was sure of having closed it. But the impression
was brief, and entering, I went stumbling up to my
room, leaving the way open behind me more from
sheer inability to exercise my will than from any
thought of her.
"Miss Strange" (he had come out of the
shadows and was standing now directly before
her), "I must ask you to trust implicitly in what I
tell you of my further experiences that fatal night.

had to assume coldness lest they should see the

no memory then of the part I had played in this

her own triumphant spirit to help her over those

treacherous rocks. The necessity for keeping 
secret this part of our disgraceful story led me to
exert myself to keep it out of my own mind. It
has only come back to me in all its force since a
new horror, a new suspicion, has driven me to
review carefully every incident of that awful night.
"I was never a man of much logic, and when they
came to me on that morning of which I have just
spoken and took me in where she lay and pointed
to her beautiful cold body stretched out in seeming
peace under the satin coverlet, and then to the
pile of dainty clothes lying neatly folded on a chair
with just one fairy slipper on top, I shuddered at
her fate but asked no questions, not even when one
of the women of the house mentioned the circum-
stance of the single slipper and said that a search
should be made for its mate. Nor was I as much
impressed as one would naturally expect by the
whisper dropped in my ear that something was the
matter with her wrists. It is true that I lifted the
lace they had carefully spread over them and
examined the discoloration which extended like a
ring about each pearly arm; but having no
memories of any violence offered her (I had not
so much as laid hand upon her in the grotto), these
marks failed to rouse my interest. But-and now
I must leap a year in my story-there came a




<pb n="119"/>
Problem 4 for Violet Strange      19
time when both of these facts recurred to my mind
with startling distinctness and clamoured for
explanation.
"I had risen above the shock which such a death
following such events would naturally occasion
even in one of my blunted sensibilities, and was
striving to live a new life under the encouragement
of my now fully reconciled father, when accident
forced me to re-enter the grotto where I had never
stepped foot since that night. A favourite dog
in chase of some innocent prey had escaped the
leash and run into its dim recesses and would not
come out at my call. As I needed him imme-
diately for the hunt, I followed him over the
promontory and, swallowing my repugnance, slid
into the grotto to get him. Better a plunge to
my death from the height of the rocks towering
above it. For there in a remote corner, lighted
up by a reflection from the sea, I beheld my setter
crouched above an object which in another mo-
ment I recognized as my dead wife's missing slipper.
Here! Not in the waters of the sea or in the inter-
stices of the rocks outside, but here! Proof that
she had never walked back to the house where she
was found lying quietly in her bed; proof positive;
for I knew the path too well and the more than usual
tenderness of her feet.
*"t.




<pb n="120"/>
120        The Grotto Spectre
"How then, did she get there; and by whose
agency? Was she living when she went, or was
she already dead? A year had passed since that
delicate shoe had borne her from the boat into
these dim recesses; but it might have been only
a day, so vividly did I live over in this moment
of awful enlightenment all the events of the hour
in which we sat there playing for the possession
of our child. Again I saw her gleaming eyes, her
rosy, working mouth, her slim, white hand, loaded
with diamonds, clutching the cards. Again I
heard the lap of the sea on the pebbles outside
and smelt the odour of the wine she had poured
out for us both. The bottle which had held it;
the glass from which she had drunk lay now in
pieces on the rocky floor. The whole scene was
mine again and as I followed the event to its de-
spairing close, I seemed to see my own wild figure
springing away from her to the grotto's mouth and
so over the rocks. But here fancy faltered, caught
by a quick recollection to which I had never given
a thought till now. As I made my way along those
rocks, a sound had struck my ear from where
some stunted bushes made a shadow in the moon-
light. The wind might have caused it or some small
night creature hustling away at my approach; and
to some such cause I must at the time have




<pb n="121"/>

attributed it. But now, with brain fired by sus-
picion, it seemed more like the quick intake of a
human breath. Some one had been lying there in
wait, listening at the one loophole in the rocks
where it was possible to hear what was said and
done in the heart of the grotto. But who? who?
and for what purpose this listening; and to what
end did it lead?
"Though I no longer loved even the memory of
my wife, I felt my hair lift, as I asked myself these
questions. There seemed to be but one logical
answer to the last, and it was this: A struggle
followed by death. The shoe fallen from her foot,
the clothes found folded in her room (my wife was
never orderly), and the dimly blackened wrists
which were snow-white when she dealt the cards-
all seemed to point to such a conclusion. She
may have died from heart-failure, but a struggle
had preceded her death, during which some man's
strong fingers had been locked about her wrists.
And again the question rose, Whose?
"If any place was ever hated by mortal man
that grotto was hated by me. I loathed its walls,
its floor, its every visible and invisible corner.
To linger there-to look-almost tore my soul
from my body; yet I did linger and did look and
this is what I found by way of reward.




<pb n="122"/>

"Behind a projecting ledge of stone from which
a tattered rug still hung, I came upon two nails
driven a few feet apart into a fissure of the rock.
I had driven those nails myself long before for a
certain gymnastic attachment much in vogue at
the time, and on looking closer, I discovered hang-
ing from them the rope-ends by which I was won't
to pull myself about. So far there was nothing to
rouse any but innocent reminiscences. But when
I heard the dog's low moan and saw him leap at
the curled-up ends, and nose them with an eager
look my way, I remembered the dark marks
circling the wrists about which I had so often
clasped my mother's bracelets, and the world
went black before me.
"When consciousness returned-when I could
once more move and see and think, I noted an-
other fact. Cards were strewn about the floor,
face up and in a fixed order as if laid in a mocking
mood to be looked upon by reluctant eyes; and
near the ominous half-circle they made, a cushion
from the lounge, stained horribly with what I
then thought to be blood, but which I afterwards
found to be wine. Vengeance spoke in those ropes
and in the carefully spread-out cards, and murder
in the smothering pillow. The vengeance of one
who had watched her corroding influence eat the

life out of my honour and whose love for our little
Roger was such that any deed which ensured his
continued presence in the home appeared not
only warrantable but obligatory. Alas! I knew
of but one person in the whole world who could
cherish feeling to this extent or possess sufficient
will power to carry her lifeless body back to the
house and lay it in her bed and give no sign of
the abominable act from that day on to this.
"Miss Strange, there are men who have a
peculiar conception of duty. My father-"
"You need not go on." How gently, how
tenderly our Violet spoke. "I understand your
trouble-  "
Did she? She paused to ask herself if this were
so, and he, deaf perhaps to her words, caught up
his broken sentence and went on:
"My father was in the hall the day I came
staggering in from my visit to the grotto. No
words passed, but our eyes met and from that
hour I have seen death in his countenance and he
has seen it in mine, like two opponents, each struck
to the heart, who stand facing each other with
simulated smiles till they fall. My father will
drop first. He is old-very old since that day five
weeks ago; and to see him die and not be sure-

my own eyes close forever, is more than I can hold
up under; more than any son could. Cannot you
help me then to a positive knowledge? Think!
think! A woman's mind is strangely penetrating,
and yours, I am told, has an intuitive faculty more
to be relied upon than the reasoning of men. It
must suggest some means of confirming my doubts
or of definitely ending them."
Then Violet' stirred and looked about at him
and finally found voice.
"Tell me something about your father's ways.
What are his habits? Does he sleep well or is he
wakeful at night?"
"He has poor nights. I do not know how poor
because I am not often with him. His valet, who
has always been in our family, shares his room and
acts as his constant nurse. He can watch over him
better than I can; he has no distracting trouble
on his mind."
"And little Roger? Does your father see much
of little Roger? Does he fondle him and seem
happy in his presence?"
"Yes; yes. I have often wondered at it, but
he does. They are great chums. It is a pleasure
to see them together. "
"And the child clings to him-shows no fear-t

sits on his lap or on the bed and plays as children
do play with his beard or with his watch-chain?"
"Yes. Only once have I seen my little chap
shrink, and that was when my father gave him a
look of unusual intensity,-looking for his mother
in him perhaps." 
"Mr. Upjohn, forgive me the question; it seems
necessary. Does your father-or rather did your
father before he fell ill-ever walk in the direction
of the grotto or haunt in any way the rocks which
surround it ?"
"I cannot say. The sea is there; he naturally
loves the sea. But I have never seen him standing
on the promontory."
"Which way do his windows look?"
"Towards the sea. "
"Therefore towards the promontory?"
"Yes. "
"Can he see it from his bed?"
"No. Perhaps that is the cause of a peculiar
habit he has."
"What habit?"
"Every night before he retires (he is not yet
confined to his bed) he stands for a few minutes
in his front window looking out. He says it's
his good-night to the ocean. When he no longer
does this, we shall know that his end is very near."

The face of Violet began to clear. Rising, she  v
turned on the electric light, and then, reseating 
herself, remarked with an aspect of quiet cheer: 
"I have two ideas; but they necessitate my 
presence at your place. You will not mind a 
visit? My brother will accompany me."
Roger Upjohn did not need to speak, hardly to
make a gesture; his expression was so eloquent. 
She thanked him as if he had answered in words, 
adding with an air of gentle reserve: "Providence 
assists us in this matter. I am invited to Beverly  l
next week to attend a wedding. I was intending 
to stay two days, but I will make it three and
spend the extra one with you."
"What are your requirements, Miss Strange? 
I presume you have some." 
Violet turned from the imposing portrait of .,
Mr. Upjohn which she had been gravely contem- 
plating, and met the troubled eye of her young ,
host with an enigmatical flash of her own. But t,'
she made no answer in words. Instead, she lifted

stood till it struck a nick in the old mahogany
almost on a level with her head.
"Is your son Roger old enough to reach so

far?" she asked with another short look at him as
she let her finger rest where it had struck the
roughened wood. "I thought he was a little
fellow."
"He is. That cut was made by-by my wife;
a sample of her capricious wilfulness. She wished
to leave a record of herself in the substance of
our house as well as in our lives. That nick marks
her height. She laughed when she made it.
'Till the walls cave in or burn,' is what she said.
And I thought her laugh and smile captivating."
Cutting short his own laugh which was much
too sardonic for a lady's ears, he made a move
as if to lead the way into another portion of
the room. But Violet failed to notice this, and
lingering in quiet contemplation of this sugges-
tive little nick,-the only blemish in a room of
ancient colonial magnificence,-she thoughtfully
remarked:
"Then she was a small woman?" adding with
seeming irrelevance-"like myself."
Roger winced. Something in the suggestion
hurt him, and in the nod he gave there was an air
of coldness which under ordinary circumstances
would have deterred her from pursuing this sub-
ject further. But the circumstances were not
ordinary, and she allowed herself to say:

"Was she so very different from me,-in figure,
I mean?" "
"No. Why do you ask? Shall we not join
your brother on the terrace?"
"Not till I have answered the question you put
me a moment ago. You wished to know my
requirements. One of the most important you
have already fulfilled. You have given your
servants a half-holiday and by so doing ensured to
us full liberty of action. What else I need in the
attempt I propose to make, you will find listed in 
this memorandum." And taking a slip of paper
from her bag, she offered it to him with a hand,
the trembling of which he would have noted had he
been freer in mind.
As he read, she watched him, her fingers
nervously clutching her throat.
"Can you supply what I ask?" she faltered, as
he failed to raise his eyes or make any move or 
even to utter the groan she saw surging up to his 
lips. "Will you?" she impetuously urged, as
his fingers closed spasmodically on the paper, in 
evidence that he understood at last the trend of
her daring purpose.
The answer came slowly, but it came. "I will.
But what-"
Her hand rose in a pleading gesture.

"Do not ask me, but take Arthur and myself
into the garden and show us the flowers. After-
wards, I should like a glimpse of the sea. "
He bowed and they joined Arthur who had
already begun to stroll through the grounds.
Violet was seldom at a loss for talk even at the
most critical moments. But she was strangely
tongue-tied on this occasion, as was Roger himself.
Save for a few observations casually thrown out
by Arthur, the three passed in a disquieting silence
through pergola after pergola, and around beds
gorgeous with every variety of fall flowers, till they
turned a sharp corner and came in full view of the
sea.
"Ah! " fell in an admiring murmur from Violet's
lips as her eyes swept the horizon. Then as they
settled on a mass of rock jutting out from the shore
in a great curve, she leaned towards her host and
softly whispered:
"The promontory?"
He nodded, and Violet ventured no farther, but
stood for a little while gazing at the tumbled rocks.
Then, with a quick look back at the house, she
asked him to point out his father's window.
He did so, and as she noted how openly it faced
the sea, her expression relaxed and her manner
lost some of its constraint. As they turned to




<pb n="130"/>
I30        The Grotto Spectre
re-enter the house, she noticed an old man picking
flowers from a vine clambering over one end of the
piazza.
"Who is that?" she asked.
" Our oldest servant, and my father's own man, "
was Roger's reply. "He is picking my father's
favourite flowers, a few late honeysuckles. "
"How fortunate! Speak to him, Mr. Upjohn.
Ask him how your father is this evening. "
"Accompany me and I will; and do not be
afraid to enter into conversation with him. He is
the mildest of creatures and devoted to his patient.
He likes nothing better than to talk about him."
Violet, with a meaning look at her brother, ran
up the steps at Roger's side. As she did so, the
old man turned and Violet was astonished at the
wistfulness with which he viewed her.
"What a dear old creature!" she murmured.
"See how he stares this way. You would think
he knew me. "
"He is glad to see a woman about the place. He
has felt our isolation-Good-evening, Abram.
Let this young lady have a spray of your sweetest
honeysuckle. And, Abram, before you go, how
is Father to-night? Still sitting up?"
"Yes, sir. He is very regular in his ways..
Nine is his hour; not a minute before and not a

minute later. I don't have to look at the clock
when he says: 'There, Abram, I've sat up long
enough.'"
"When my father retires before his time or goes
to bed without a final look at the sea, he will be a
very sick man, Abram."
"That he will, Mr. Roger; that he will. But he's
very feeble to-night, very feeble. I noticed that he
gave the boy fewer kisses than usual. Perhaps he
was put out because the child was brought in a
half-hour earlier than the stated time. He don't
like changes; you know that, Mr. Roger; he don't
like changes. I hardly dared to tell him that
the servants were all going out in a bunch to-
night."
"I'm sorry," muttered Roger. "But he'll for-
get it by to-morrow. I couldn't bear to keep a
single one from the concert. They'll be back in
good season and meantime we have you. Abram
is worth half a dozen of them, Miss Strange. We
shall miss nothing."
"Thank you, Mr. Roger, thank you," faltered
the old man. "I try to do my duty." And with
another wistful glance at Violet, who looked very
sweet and youthful in the half-light, he pottered
away.
The silence which followed his departure was as




<pb n="132"/>
I32        The Grotto Spectre
painful to her as to Roger Upjohn. When she
broke it it was with this decisive remark:
"That man must not speak of me to your father.
He must not even mention that you have a guest
to-night. Run after him and tell him so. It is
necessary that your father's mind should not be
taken up with present happenings. Run."
Roger made haste to obey her. When he came
back she was on the point of joining her brother
but stopped to utter a final injunction:
"I shall leave the library, or wherever we may
be sitting, just as the clock strikes half-past eight.
Arthur will do the same, as by that time he will
feel like smoking on the terrace. Do not follow
either him or myself, but take your stand here on
the piazza where you can get a full view of the
right-hand wing without attracting any attention
to yourself. When you hear the big clock in the
hall strike nine, look up quickly at your father's
window. What you see may determine-    Oh, 
Arthur! still admiring the prospect? I do not'
wonder. But I find it chilly. Let us go in."
Roger Upjohn, sitting by himself in the library,
was watching the hands of the mantel clock slowly
approaching the hour of nine.
Never had silence seemed more oppressive nor




<pb n="133"/>
Problem 4 for Violet Strange      i33
his sense of loneliness greater. Yet the boom of
the ocean was distinct to the ear, and human
presence no farther away than the terrace where
Arthur Strange could be seen smoking out his cigar
in solitude. The silence and the loneliness were
in Roger's own soul; and, in face of the expected
revelation which would make or unmake his future,
the desolation they wrought was measureless.
To cut his suspense short, he rose at length and
hurried out to the spot designated by Miss Strange
as the best point from which to keep watch upon
his father's window. It was at the end of the
piazza where the honeysuckle hung, and the odour
of the blossoms, so pleasing to his father, well-
nigh overpowered him not only by its sweetness
but by the many memories it called up. Visions
of that father as he looked at all stages of their
relationship passed in a bewildering maze before
him. He saw him as he appeared to his childish
eyes in those early days of confidence when the
loss of the mother cast them in mutual dependence
upon each other. Then a sterner picture of the
relentless parent who sees but one straight course
to success in this world and the next. Then the
teacher and the matured adviser; and then-oh,
bitter change! the man whose hopes he had crossed
-whose life he had undone, and all for her who




<pb n="134"/>
134        The Grotto Spectre 
now came stealing upon the scene with her slim, 
white, jewelled hand forever lifted up between
them. And she! Had he ever seen her more
clearly? Once more the dainty figure stepped
from fairy-land, beauteous with every grace that
can allure and finally destroy a man. And as he
saw, he trembled and wished that these moments
of awful waiting might pass and the test be over
which would lay bare his father's heart and justify
his fears or dispel them forever.
But the crisis, if crisis it was, was one of his own
making and not to be hastened or evaded. With
one quick glance at his father's window, he turned
in his impatience towards the sea whose restless
and continuous moaning had at length struck his
ear. What was in its call to-night that he should
thus sway towards it as though drawn by some
dread magnetic force? He had been born to the
dashing of its waves and knew its every mood and
all the passion of its song from frolicsome ripple
to melancholy dirge. But there was something
odd and inexplicable in its effect upon his spirit
as he faced it at this hour. Grim and implacable-
a sound rather than a sight-it seemed to hold
within its invisible distances the image of his future
fate. What this image was and why he should
seek for it in this impenetrable void, he did not




<pb n="135"/>
Problem 4 for Violet Strange 135
know. He felt himself held and was struggling
with this influence as with an unknown enemy
when there rang out, from the hall within, the pre-
paratory chimes for which his ear was waiting, and
then the nine slow strokes which signalized the
moment when he was to look for his father's
presence at the window.
Had he wished, he could not have forborne that
look. Had his eyes been closing in death, or so he
felt, the trembling lids would have burst apart
at this call and the revelations it promised.
And what did he see? What did that window
hold for him?
Nothing that he might not have seen there any
night at this hour. His father's figure drawn up
behind the panes in wistful contemplation of the
night. No visible change in his attitude, nothing
forced or unusual in his manner. Even the hand,
lifted to pull down the shade, moves with its
familiar hesitation. In a moment more that shade
will be down and- But no! the lifted hand falls
back; the easy attitude becomes strained, fixed.
He is staring now-not merely gazing out upon the
wastes of sky and sea; and Roger, following the
direction of his glance, stares also in breathless
emotion at what those distances, but now so im-
penetrable, are giving to the eye.




<pb n="136"/>
I36        The Grotto Spectre'
A spectre floating in the air above the promon-
tory! The spectre of a woman-of his wife, clad,
as she had been clad that fatal night! Outlined in
supernatural light, it faces them with lifted arms
showing the ends of rope dangling from either
wrist. A sight awful to any eye, but to the man
of guilty heart-
Ah! it comes-the cry for which the agonized
son had been listening! An old man's shriek,
hoarse with the remorse of sleepless nights and
days of unimaginable regret and foreboding! It
cuts the night. It cuts its way into his heart. He
feels his senses failing him, yet he must glance
once more at the window and see with his last
conscious look-  But what is this! a change has
taken place in the picture and he beholds, not the
distorted form of his father sinking back in shame
and terror before this visible image of his secret
sin, but that of another weak, old man falling to
the floor behind his back! Abram! the attentive, 
seemingly harmless, guardian of the household!
Abram! who had never spoken a word or given a
look in any way suggestive of his having played
any other part in the hideous drama of their lives
than that of the humble and sympathetic servant 
The shock was too great, the relief too absolute
for credence. He, the listener at the grotto? He,




<pb n="137"/>
Problem 4 for Violet Strange 137
the avenger of the family's honour? He, the
insurer of little Roger's continuance with the
family at a cost the one who loved him best would
rather have died himself than pay? Yes! there is
no misdoubting this old servitor's attitude of
abject appeal, or the meaning of Homer Upjohn's
joyfully uplifted countenance and outspreading
arms. The servant begs for mercy from man,
and the master is giving thanks to Heaven. Why
giving thanks? Has he been the prey of cankering
doubts also? Has the father dreaded to discover
that in the son which the son has dreaded to
discover in the father?
It might easily be; and as Roger recognizes
this truth and the full tragedy of their mutual
lives, he drops to his knees amid the honeysuckles.
"Violet, you are a wonder. But how did you
dare?"
This from Arthur as the two rode to the train
in the early morning.
The answer came a bit waveringly.
"I do not know. I am astonished yet, at my
own daring. Look at my hands. They have not
ceased trembling since the moment you threw the
light upon me on the rocks. The figure of old
Mr. Upjohn in the window looked so august."




<pb n="138"/>
I38        The Grotto Spectre
Arthur, with a short glance at the little hands
she held out, shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly.
It struck him that the tremulousness she com-
plained of was due more to some parting word
from their young host, than from prolonged awe
at her own daring. But he made no remark to
this effect, only observed:
"Abram has confessed his guilt, I hear."
"Yes, and will die of it. The master will bury
the man, and not the man the master."
"And Roger? Not the little fellow, but the
father?"
"We will not talk of him," said she, her eyes
seeking the sea where the sun in its rising was
battling with a troop of lowering clouds and
slowly gaining the victory.

"AND this is all you mean to tell me?"
"I think you will find it quite enough, Miss
Strange."
"Just the address-"-
"And this advice: that your call be speedy.
Distracted nerves cannot wait."
Violet, across whose wonted piquancy there lay
an indefinable shadow, eyed her employer with a
doubtful air before turning away toward the door.
She had asked him for a case to investigate (some-
thing she had never done before), and she had
even gone so far as to particularize the sort of
case she desired: "It must be an interesting one,"
she had stipulated, "but different, quite different
from the last one. It must not involve death or
any kind of horror. If you have a case of subtlety
without crime, one to engage my powers without
depressing my spirits, I beg you to let me have it.

from MasSachusetts." Whereupon, without fur-
ther comment, but with a smile she did not under-
stand, he had handed her a small slip of paper on
which he had scribbled an address. She should
have felt satisfied, but for some reason she did not.
She regarded him as capable of plunging her into
an affair quite the reverse of what she felt herself
in a condition to undertake.
"I should like to know a little more," she pur-
sued, making a move to unfold the slip he had
given her.
But he stopped her with a gesture.
"Read it in your limousine, " said he. "If you 
are disappointed then, let me know. But I think
you will find yourself quite ready for your task." 
"And my father?"
"Would approve if he could be got to approve
the business at all. You do not even need to take
your brother with you."
"Oh, then, it's with women only I have to deal?"
"Read the address after you are headed up
Fifth Avenue."
But when, with her doubts not yet entirely re-
moved, she opened the small slip he had given her,
the number inside suggested nothing but the fact
that her destination lay somewhere near Eightieth

Street. It was therefore with the keenest surprise
she beheld her motor stop before the conspicuous
house of the great financier whose late death had so
affected the money-market. She had not had any
acquaintance with this man herself, but she knew
his house. Everyone knew that. It was one of
the most princely in the whole city. C. Dudley
Brooks had known how to spend his millions.
Indeed he had known how to do this so well that
it was of him her father, also a financier of some
note, had once said he was the only successful
American he envied.
She was expected; that she saw the instant the
door was opened. This made her entrance easy-
an entrance further brightened by the delightful
glimpse of a child's cherubic face looking at her
from a distant doorway. It was an instantaneous
vision, gone as soon as seen; but its effect was to
rob the pillared spaces of the wonderful hallway
of some of their chill, and to modify in some slight
degree the formality of a service which demanded
three men to usher her into a small reception-room
not twenty feet from the door of entrance.
Left in this secluded spot, she had time to ask
herself what member of the household she would be
called upon to meet, and was surprised to find that
she did not even know of whom the household

his sole heir in a will he drew up during the lifetime
of his wife. But when he found, as he very soon

did, that this young man was not developing in a
way to meet such great responsibilities, he made a
new will-though unhappily without the know-
ledge of the family, or even of his most intimate
friends-in which he gave the bulk of his great
estate to his nephew Clement, who has bettered
the promise of his youth and who besides has
children of great beauty whom my brother had
learned to love. And this will-this hoarded scrap
of paper which means so much to us all, is lost!
lost and I-" here her voice which had risen
almost to a scream, sank to a horrified whisper,
"am the one who lost it."
"But there's a copy of it somewhere-there is
always a copy-  "
"Oh, but you haven't heard all. My nephew
is an invalid; has been an invalid for years-that's
why so little is known about him. He's dying
of consumption. The doctors hold out no hope
for him, and now, with the fear preying upon
him of leaving his wife and children penniless,
he is wearing away so fast that any hour may see
his end. And I have to meet his eyes-such
pitiful eyes-and the look in them is killing me.
Yet, I was not to blame. I could not help-Oh,

sleep. Find it; find it, I pray, or-"
The moment had come for Violet's soft touch,
for Violet's encouraging word.
"I will try," she answered her.
Mrs. Quintard grew calmer.
"But, first," the young girl continued, "I must
know more about the conditions. Where is this
nephew of yours-the man who is ill?"
"In this house, where he has been for the last
eight months."
"Was the child his of whom I caught a glimpse
in the hall as I came in?"
"Yes, and-"
"I will fight for that child!" Violet cried out
impulsively. "I am sure his father's cause is
good. Where is the other claimant-the one
you designate as Carlos?"
"Oh, there's where the trouble is! Carlos is on
t&  Maurtania, and she is due here in a couple of
days. He comes from the East where he has been
tourig with his wife. Miss Strange, the lost will
must be found before then, or the other will be
opened and read and Carlos made master of this
house, which would mean our quick departure and
Clement's certain death."

that, were the house a cabin and its owners
paupers."
"You do not know Carlos; you do not know his
wife. We should not be given a week in which to
pack. They have no children and they envy
Clement who has. Our only hope lies in discover-
ing the paper which gives us the right to remain
here in face of all opposition. That or penury.
Now you know my trouble. "
"And it is trouble; one from which I shall make
every effort to relieve you. But first let me ask if
you are not worrying unnecessarily about this
missing document? If it was drawn up by Mr.
Brooks's lawyer-"
"But it was not," that lady impetuously inter-
rupted. "His lawyer is Carlos's near relative, and
has never been told of the change in my brother's
intentions. Clement (I am speaking now of my
brother and not of my nephew) was a great
money-getter, but when it came to standing up for
his rights in domestic matters, he was - ore timid
than a child. He was subject to his wife while
she lived, and when she was gone, to her relatives,
who are all of a dominating character. When he

this-the presence of some unsuspected agency

"Very," replied Violet, watching her curiously.

able to point out, by some power we cannot of
course explain, just the spot where the paper lies,
without having to tell all that. Some people can,
you know. "
"Ah, I understand. You regarded me as unfit
for practical work, and so credited me with occult
powers. But that is where you made a mistake,
Mrs. Quintard; I'm nothing if not practical. And

"Because the will was gone when I went to take
it out. There was nothing to show Mr. Delahunt

"Yes. It's-it's not the first time I have walked

,"Yes. "
"I am anxious to see the room. It is upstairs,

"Yes."
She had risen and was moving rapidly toward
the door. Violet eagerly followed her.

first, what news from the sick-room?"
"Nothing good. The doctor has just come for
the third time to-day. Mrs. Brooks is crying and
even the children are dumb with fear."
"I will go. I must see the doctor. I must tell
him to keep Clement alive by any means till- "
She did not wait to say what; but Violet under-
stood and felt her heart grow heavy. Could it be
that her employer considered this the gay and easy
task she had asked for?
The next minute she was putting her first
question:
"Hetty, what did you see in Mrs. Quintard's
action last night, to make you infer that she left
the missing document in this room?"
The woman's eyes, which had been respectfully
studying her face, brightened with a relief which
made her communicative. With the self-posses-
sion of a perfectly candid nature, she inquiringly
remarked:
"My mistress has spoken of her infirmity?"
"Yes, and very frankly."
"She walks in her sleep."
"So she said."
"And sometimes when others are asleep, and

"No, Miss; she left it here. It never passed

showed through the natural brown of her cheeks.
"No," she disclaimed; "she could not have done

No furniture was to be seen there except a couple of
stalls taken from some old cathedral, which stood
in the two bare places just mentioned.
But within, on the extensive floor-space, several
articles were grouped, and Violet, recognizing the
possibilities which any one of them afforded for
the concealment of so small an object as a folded
document, decided to use method in her search,
and to that end, mentally divided the space before
her into four segments.

illuminations.

Violet did so, with the result that the poker was

soon put back into place, and she herself down on
her knees looking up the chimney.
"Had she thrust it up there, " Hetty made haste
to remark, "there would have been some signs of
soot on her sleeves. They are white and very
long and are always getting in her way when she
tries to do anything. "
Violet left the fire-place after a glance at the
mantel-shelf on which nothing stood but a casket
of open fretwork, and two coloured photographs
mounted on small easels. The casket was too
open to conceal anything and the photographs
lifted too high above the shelf for even the smallest
paper, let alone a document of any size, to hide
behind them.
The chairs, of which there were several in this
part of the room, she passed with just an inquiring
look. They were all of solid oak, without any
attempt at upholstery, and although carved to
match the stalls on the other side of the room,
offered no place for search.
Her delay in the third segment was brief.
Here there was absolutely nothing but the door
by which she had entered, and the books. As
she flitted on, following the oval of the wall, a
small frown appeared on her usually smooth
forehead. She felt the oppression of the books-

suitable to its double use. Without being crowded,
it displayed a pile of magazines and pamphlets,
boxes for stationery, a writing pad with its accom-
paniments, a lamp, and some few ornaments,
among which was a large box, richly inlaid with
pearl and ivory, the lid of which stood wide
open.
"Don't touch," admonished Violet, as Hetty
stretched out her hand to move some little object
aside. "You have already worked here busily in
the search you made this morning."
"We handled everything."
"Did you go through these pamphlets?" 
"We shook open each one. We were especially

"Drooped."

moved, and Violet took her place but in
i a step or two farther front. This brought
very near to the centre of the table. Hanging
,en her head, just as Hetty had done, she reached out
her right hand.
"Have you looked under this blotter?" she
asked, pointing towards the pad she touched.
"I mean, between the blotter and the frame
which holds it?"
"I certainly did," answered Hetty, with some
pride.
Violet remained staring down.
"Then you took off everything that was lying
on it?"
"Oh, yes."
Violet continued to stare down at the blotter.
Then impetuously:
"Put them back in their accustomed places."
Hetty obeyed.




<pb n="166"/>
i66       The Dreaming Lady
Violet continued to look at them, then slowly
stretched out her hand, but soon let it fall again
with an air of discouragement. Certainly the
missing document was not in the ink-pot or the
mucilage bottle. Yet something made her stoop
again over the pad and subject it to the closest
scrutiny.
"If only nothing had been touched!" she in-
wardly sighed. But she let no sign of her discon-
tent escape her lips, simply exclaiming as she
glanced up at the towering spaces overhead:
"The books! the books! Nothing remains but for
you to call up all the servants, or get men from the
outside and, beginning at one end-I should say
the upper one-take down every book standing
within reach of a woman of Mrs. Quintard's
height."
"Hear first what Mrs. Quintard has to say
about that," interrupted the woman as that lady
entered in a flutter of emotion springing from more
than one cause.
"The young lady thinks that we should remove
the books," Hetty observed, as her mistress's eye
wandered  to hers from   Violet's abstracted
countenance.

for? "
"Not at all. Neither of us went near them."
This from Hetty.
"Nor any one else?"
"No one else has been admitted to the room.
We locked both doors the moment we felt satisfied
that the will had been left here."
"That's a relief. Now I may be able to do
something. Hetty, you look like a very strong
woman; and I, as you see, am very little. Would
you mind lifting me up to these shelves? I want
to look at them. Not at the books, but at the
shelves themselves. "
The wondering woman stooped and raised her
to the level of the shelf she had pointed out.
Violet peered closely at it and then at the ones
just beneath.
"Am I heavy?" she asked; "if not, let me see
those on the other side of the door."
Hetty carried her over.
Violet inspected each shelf as high as a woman
of Mrs. Quintard's stature could reach, and when
on her feet again, knelt to inspect the ones below.
"No one has touched or drawn anything from
these shelves in twenty-four hours," she declared.
"The small accumulation of dust along their edges

ferent with the table-top. That shows very
plainly where you had moved things and where
you had not."
"Was that what you were looking for? Well,
[ never!"
Violet paid no heed; she was thinking and
thinking very deeply.
Hetty turned towards her mistress, then quickly
back to Violet, whom she seized by the arm.
"What's the matter with Mrs. Quintard?"
she hurriedly asked. "If it were night, I should
think that she was in one of her spells."
Violet started and glanced where Hetty pointed.
Mrs. Quintard was within a few feet of them, but
is oblivious of their presence as though she stood
alone in the room. Possibly, she thought she did.
With fixed eyes and mechanical step she began to
nove straight towards the table, her whole ap-
pearance of a nature to make Hetty's blood run
:old, but to cause that of Violet's to bound
;hrough her veins with renewed hope.

Dreams are no longer regarded by scientists as
prophecies of the future or even as spontaneous
and irrelevant conditions of thought, but as re-
flections of a near past, which can almost without
exception be traced back to the occurrences which
caused them. Your action with the will had its
birth in some previous line of thought afterwards
forgotten. Let us try and find that thought.
Recall, if you can, just what you did or read
yesterday."
Mrs. Quintard looked frightened.
"But, I have no memory," she objected. "I
forget quickly, so quickly that in order to fulfil
my engagements I have to keep a memorandum
of every day's events. Yesterday? yesterday?
What did I do yesterday? I went downtown for
one thing, but I hardly know where."
"Perhaps your memorandum    of yesterday's

As she passed by, she dropped one word: "Carlos!" 
Then she went staggering on, to disappear a
moment later down the stairway.
This vision lost, another came. This time it was 
that of Clement's wife leaning from the marble
balustrade above, the shadow of approaching
grief battling with the present terror in her perfect
features. Then she too withdrew from view and
Violet, left for the moment alone in the great hall,
stepped back into the library and began to put on
her hat.
The lights had been turned up in the grand salon
and it was in this scene of gorgeous colour that 
Mrs. Quintard came face to face with Carlos
Pelacios.  Those who were witness to her en-
trance say that she presented a noble appearance,
as with the resolution of extreme desperation she 
stood waiting for his first angry attack. 
He, a short, thick-set, dark man, showing both .
in features and expression the Spanish blood of
his paternal ancestors, started to address her in
tones of violence, but changed his note, as he met
her eye, to one simply sardonic.
"You here! " he began. "I assure you, madame, 
that it is a pleasure which is not without its in-
conveniences. Did you not receive my cable-

owner of this house, not you. My brother left a

guests, and not he yours. As his representative
I entreat you and your wife to remain here until
you can find a home to your mind."
The silence seethed. Carlos had a temper of
fire and so had his wife. But neither spoke, till
he had gained sufficient control over himself to
remark without undue rancour:
"I did not think you had the wit to influence
your brother to this extent; otherwise, I should
have cut my travels short." Then harshly:
"Where is this will?"
"It will be produced." But the words faltered. 
Carlos glanced at the man standing behind his
wife; then back at Mrs. Quintard.
"Wills are not scribbled off on deatl,-oeds; or if 
they are, it needs something more than a signature
to legalize them. I don't believe in this trick of

the gentleman accompanying them-"has done
my father's business for years, and he assured me
that the paper he holds in his pocket is the first,

"That, for-for reasons I cannot give, I must
refuse to do at present. But I am ready to

A mocking laugh cut her short. Did it issue
from his lips or from those of his highstrung and
unfeeling wife. It might have come from either;
there was cause enough.
"Oh!" she faltered, "may God have mercy!"

I told him that you had succeeded in your task
and that all was well with us. But I was not able
to tell him how you had succeeded or in what place
the will had been found; and he died, unknowing.
But we may know, may we not, now that he is
laid away and there is no more talk of our leaving
this house?"
Violet smiled, but very tenderly, and in a way
not to offend the mourner. They were sitting in
the library-the great library which was to remain
in Clement's family after all-and it amused her to
follow the dreaming lady's glances as they ran in
irrepressible curiosity over the walls. Had Violet
wished, she could have kept her secret forever.
These eyes would never have discovered it.
But she was of a sympathetic temperament, our
Violet, so after a moment's delay, during which
she satisfied herself that little, if anything, had
been touched in the room since her departure from
it a week before, she quietly observed:
"You were right in persisting that you hid it in
this room. It was here I found it. Do you notice
that photograph on the mantel which does not
stand exactly straight on its easel?"
"Yes. 
"Supposing you take it down. You can reach
it, can you not?"

"Oh, yes. But what-"
"Lift it down, dear Mrs. Quintard; and then
turn it round and look at its back."
Agitated and questioning, the lady did as she
was bid, and at the first glance gave a cry of sur-
prise, if not of understanding. The square of
brown paper, acting as a backing to the picture,
was slit across, disclosing a similar one behind it
which was still intact.
"Oh! was it hidden in here?" she asked.
"Very completely," assented Violet. "Pasted

mounting and framing photographs. Usually,
she is conscious of her work, but this time she

me to examine those on the mantel, if you had not
given me another suggestion a little while before.
We did not tell you this, Mrs. Quintard, at the
time, but during the search we were making here
that day, you had a lapse into that peculiar state
which induces you to walk in your sleep. It was
a short one, lasting but a moment, but in a moment
one can speak, and this you did-"
"Spoke? I spoke?"
"Yes, you uttered the word 'paper!' not the
paper, but 'paper!' and reached out towards the
shears. Though I had not much time to think of
it then, afterwards upon reading your memoran-
dum I recalled your words, and asked myself if it
was not paper to cut, rather than to hide, you
wanted. If it was to cut, and you were but repeat-
ing the experience of the night before, then the 
room should contain some remnants of cut paper.
Had we seen any? Yes, in the basket, under the
desk we had taken out and thrown back again a
strip or so of wrapping paper, which, if my memory
did not fail me, showed a clean-cut edge. To pull
this strip out again and spread it flat upon the desk
was the work of a minute, and what I saw led me
to look all over the room, not now for the folded
document, but for a square of brown paper, such

I successful? Not for a long while, but when I

how nearly they corresponded in shape and size

fancy for mounting photographs and felt that the
mystery was solved.

M   ISS STRANGE was not in a responsive mood.
This her employer had observed on first
entering; yet he showed no hesitation in laying on
the table behind which she had ensconced herself
in the attitude of one besieged, an envelope thick
with enclosed papers.
"There," said he. "Telephone me when. you
have read them."
"I shall not read them."
"No?" he smiled; and, repossessing himself of
the envelope, he tore off one end, extracted the 
sheets with which it was filled, and laid them down,
still unfolded, in their former place on the table-top.
The suggestiveness of the action caused the
corners of Miss Strange's delicate lips to twitch
wistfully, before settling into an ironic smile.
Calmly the other watched her.

"It's out of town this time-'way out. Your
health certainly demands a change of air. "
"My health is good. Fortunately, or unfor-
tunately, as one may choose to look at it, it
furnishes me with no excuse for an outing," she
steadily retorted, turning her back on the table. 
"Ah, excuse me!" the insidious voice apologized,
"your paleness misled me. Surely a night or two's
change might be beneficial."
She gave him a quick side look, and began to
adjust her boa.
To this hint he paid no attention.
"The affair is quite out of the ordinary," he
pursued in the tone of one rehearsing a part. But
there he stopped. For some reason, not altogether
apparent to the masculine mind, the pin of flashing
stones (real stones) which held her hat in place had
to be taken out and thrust back again, not once,
but twice. It was to watch this performance he
had paused. When he was ready to proceed, he
took the musing tone of one marshalling facts for
another's enlightenment:
"A woman of unknown instincts--"
"Pshaw!" The end of the pin would strike 
against the comb holding Violet's chestnut-col- 
oured locks.

it contains. But-" here he allowed his patience
apparently to forsake him, "I will bore you no
longer. Go to your teas and balls; I will struggle
with my dark affairs alone."
His hand went to the packet of papers she
affected so ostentatiously to despise. He could
be as nonchalant as she. But he did not lift them;
he let them lie. Yet the young heiress had not
made a movement or even turned the slightest
glance his way.
"A woman difficult to understand! A mys-
terious house-possibly a mysterious crime!"
Thus Violet kept repeating in silent self-com-
munion, as flushed with dancing she sat that even-
ing in a highly-scented conservatory, dividing her
attention between the compliments of her partner
and the splash of a fountain bubbling in the heart
of this mass of tropical foliage; and when some
hours later she sat down in her chintz-furnished
bedroom for a few minutes' thought before retir-
ing, it was to draw from a little oak box at her
elbow the half-dozen or so folded sheets of closely
written paper which had been left for her perusal
by her persistent employer.

as noncommittal as the plodding beast he drove.
If I ventured upon a remark, he gave me a long and
curi6us look; if I went so far as to attack him with
a direct question, he responded with a hitch of the
shoulder or a dubious smile which conveyed noth-
ing. Was he deaf or just unpleasant?  I soon
learned that he was not deaf; for suddenly, after a
jog-trot of a mile or so through a wooded road
which we had entered from the main highway, he
drew in his horse, and, without glancing my way,
spoke his first word:
"This is where you get out. The house is back
there in the bushes."
As no house was visible and the bushes rose in
an unbroken barrier along the road, I stared at
him in some doubt of his sanity.
"But-" I began; a protest into which he at
once broke, with the sharp direction:
"Take the path. It'll lead you straight to the
front door."
"I don't see any path." 
For this he had no answer; and confident from
his expression that it would be useless to expect
anything further from him, I dropped a coin into 
his hand, and jumped to the ground. He was off 
before I could turn myself about.
"'Something is rotten in the State of Denmark,'" 




<pb n="191"/>

I quoted in startled comment to myself; and not
knowing what else to do, stared down at the turf
at my feet.
A bit of flagging met my eye, protruding from a
layer of thick moss. Farther on I espied another
-the second, probably, of many. This, no doubt,
was the path I had been bidden to follow, and
without further thought on the subject, I plunged
into the bushes which with difficulty I made give
way before me.
For a moment all further advance looked hope-
less. A more tangled, uninviting approach to a
so-called home, I had never seen outside of the
tropics; and the complete neglect thus displayed
should have prepared me for the appearance of
the house I unexpectedly came upon, just as the
way seemed on the point of dosing up before
me.
But nothing could well prepare one for a first
view of Gloom Cottage. Its location in a hollow
which had gradually filled itself up with trees and
some kind of prickly brush, its deeply stained
walls, once picturesque enough in their grouping
but too deeply hidden now amid rotting boughs
to produce any other effect than that of shrouded
desolation, the sough of these same boughs as they
rapped a devil's tattoo against each other, and the

absence of even the rising column of smoke which
bespeaks domestic life wherever seen-all gave to
one who remembered the cognomen Cottage and
forgot the pre-cognomen of Gloom, a sense of buried
life as sepulchral as that which emanates from
the mouth of some freshly opened tomb.
But these impressions, natural enough to my
youth, were necessarily transient, and soon gave
way to others more business-like. Perceiving the
curve of an arch rising above the undergrowth
still blocking my approach, I pushed my way
resolutely through, and presently found myself
stumbling upon the steps of an unexpectedly
spacious domicile, built not of wood, as its name
of Cottage had led me to expect, but of carefully
cut stone which, while showing every mark of 
time, proclaimed itself one of those early, carefully
erected Colonial residences which it takes more
than a century to destroy, or even to wear to
the point of dilapidation.
Somewhat encouraged, though failing to detect
any signs of active life in the heavily shuttered
windows frowning upon me from either side, I ran
up the steps and rang the bell which pulled as
hard as if no hand had touched it in years.
Then I waited.
But not to ring again; for just as my hand was

noiselessly, it was more like a shadow's flitting than
a man's withdrawal.
The darkness in which I sat was absolute; but
gradually, as I continued to look about me, the
spaces lightened and certain details came out,
which to my astonishment were of a character to
show that the plain if substantial exterior of this
house with its choked-up approaches and weedy
gardens was no sample of what was to be found
inside. Though the walls surrounding me were
dismal because unlighted, they betrayed a splen-
dour unusual in any country house.  The fres-
coes and paintings were of an ancient order, dating
from days when life and not death reigned in this
isolated dwelling; but in them high art reigned
supreme, an art so high and so finished that only
great wealth, combined with the most cultivated
taste, could have produced such effects. I was
still absorbed in the wonder of it all, when the quiet
voice of the old gentleman who had let me in
reached me again from the doorway, and I heard:
"Madam is ready for you. May I trouble you
to accompany me to her room." 
I rose with alacrity. I was anxious to see ma-
dam, if only to satisfy myself that she was as
interesting as the house in which she was self-
immured.

gaze startling to behold in eyes so colourless. Then
she smiled, and in obedience to that smile I seated
myself in a chair placed very near her own. Was
she too paralysed to express herself clearly? I
waited in some anxiety till she spoke, when this
fear vanished. Her voice betrayed the character

but penetrating, and of a quality which made one
listen with his heart as well as with his ears. What

to carry her off. When the door had closed upon
these two, the silence of my client drew my atten- 
tion back to herself.
"I am waiting," was her quiet observation, and
without any further reference to what had just
taken place under our eyes, she went on with the
business previously occupying us.
I was able to do my part without any too great
display of my own disturbance. The clearness of
my remarkable client's instructions, the definite-
ness with which her mind was made up as to the
disposal of every dollar of her vast property, made
it easy for me to master each detail and make care-
full note of every wish. But this did not prevent
the ebb and flow within me of an undercurrent of
thought full of question and uneasiness. What
had been the real purport of the scene to which I'
had just been made a surprised witness? The few,
but certainly unusual, facts which had been given
me in regard to the extraordinary relations existing
between these two closely connected women will
explain the intensity of my interest. Those facts
shall be yours.
Arabella Merwin, when young, was gifted with a
peculiar fascination which, as we have seen, had
not altogether vanished with age. Consequently
she had many lovers, among them two brothers,

open ways to lessen any sense she might entertain
of her mistake in preferring for her lifemate his
self-centred and unstable brother.  She should
have adored him; but though she evinced grati-
tude enough, there is nothing to prove that she
ever gave Frank Postlethwaite the least cause to
cherish any other sentiment towards his brother
than that of honest love and unqualified respect.
Perhaps he never did cherish any other. Perhaps
the change which everyone saw in the young
couple immediately after the birth of their only
child was due to another cause. Gossip is silent
on this point. All that it insists upon is that from
this time evidences of a growing estrangement
between them became so obvious that even the
indulgent Andrew could not blind himself to it;
showing his sense of trouble, not by lessening
their income, for that he doubled, but by spending
more time in Peru and less in New York where the
two were living.
However,-and here we enter upon those details
which I have ventured to characterize as uncom-

company of his brother when the accident oc-
curred which terminated both their lives. It was

break between Frank and his wife was brought to
light by a revelation of the fact that he had prac-
tised a great deception upon her at the time of his
marriage. Instead of being a bachelor as was
currently believed, he was in reality a widower,
and the father of a child. This fact, so long held
secret, had become hers when her own child was
born; and constituted as she was, she not only
never forgave the father, but conceived such a

hatred for the innocent object of their quarrel
that she refused to admit its claims or even to
acknowledge its existence.
But later-after his death, in fact-she showed
some sense of obligation towards one who under
ordinary conditions would have shared her wealth.
When the whole story became hers, and she dis-
covered that this secret had been kept from his
brother as well as from herself, and that conse-
quently no provision had been made in any way for
the child thus thrown directly upon her mercy, she
did the generous thing and took the forsaken girl
into her own home. But she never betrayed the
least love for her, her whole heart being bound up
in her boy, who was, as all agree, a prodigy of
talent.
But this boy, for all his promise and seeming
strength of constitution, died when barely seven
years old, and the desolate mother was left with
nothing to fill her heart but the uncongenial
daughter of her husband's first wife. The fact
that this child, slighted as it had hitherto been,
would, in the event of her uncle having passed
away before her father, have been the undisputed
heiress of a large portion of the wealth now at the
disposal of her arrogant step-mother, led many to
expect, now that the boy was no more, that Mrs.

well as all the rest of her household with a rod of
iron ever disturbed by the least sign of reproach.
Though the riches, which in those early days poured
into the home in a measure far beyond the needs of
its mistress, were expended in making the house
beautiful rather than in making the one young life
within it happy, she never was heard to utter so

much as a wish to leave the walls within which fate
had immured her. Content, or seemingly content,
with the only home she knew, she never asked
for change or demanded friends or amusements.
Visitors ceased coming; desolation followed neglect.
The garden, once a glory, succumbed to a riot of
weeds and undesirable brush, till a towering wall
seemed to be drawn about the house cutting it off
from the activities of the world as it cut it off from
the approach of sunshine by day, and the comfort
of a star-lit heaven by night. And yet the young
girl continued to smile, though with a pitifulness
of late, which some thought betokened secret
terror and others the wasting of a body too sensi-
tive for such unwholesome seclusion.
These were the facts, known if not consciously
specialized, which gave to the latter part of my
interview with Mrs. Postlethwaite a poignancy
of interest which had never attended any of my
former experiences. The peculiar attitude of Miss
Postlethwaite towards her indurate tormentor i
awakened in my agitated mind something much
deeper than curiosity, but when I strove to speak
her name with the intent of inquiring more par-
ticularly into her condition, such a look confronted

groping among her belongings on the little tray 
perched upon her lap, and another of the intent
and strangely bent figure of the old man who had
acted as my usher, listening to the ticking of one
of the great clocks. So absorbed was he in this
occupation that he not only failed to notice me
when I went by, but he did not even lift his head
at my cheery greeting. Such mysteries were too
much for me, and led me to postpone my departure
from town till I had sought out Mrs. Postle-
thwaite's doctor and propounded to him one or two
leading questions. First, would Mrs. Postle-
thwaite's present condition be likely to hold good
till Monday; and secondly, was the young lady
living with her as ill as her step-mother said.
He was a mild old man of the easy-going type,
and the answers I got from him were far from
satisfactory. Yet he showed some surprise when
I mentioned the extent of Mrs. Postlethwaite's
anxiety about her step-daughter, and paused, in
the dubious shaking of his head, to give me a short
stare in which I read as much determination as
perplexity.
"I will look into Miss Postlethwaite's case
more particularly," were his parting words. And
with this one gleam of comfort I had to be
content.

before, he stood listening to the monotonous tick-
ing of one of the clocks, muttering to himself and
quite oblivious of my presence.
However, this time I decided not to pass him
without amore persistent attempt to gain his notice.
Pausing at his side, I asked him in the friendly
tone I thought best calculated to attract his
attention, how Miss Postlethwaite was to-day.
He was so intent upon his task, whatever that was,
that while he turned my way, it was with a glance
as blank as that of a stone image.
"Listen!" he admonished me. "It still says
No! Nol I don't think it will ever say anything
else."
I stared at him in some consternation, then at
the clock itself which was the tall one I had found
run down at my first visit. There was nothing
unusual in its quiet tick, so far as I could hear, and
with a compassionate glance at the old man who
had turned breathlessly again to listen, proceeded
on my way without another word.
The old fellow was daft. A century old, and
daft.
I had worked my way out through the vines
which still encumbered the porch, and was taking
my first steps down the walk, when some impulse
made me turn and glance up at one of the windows.

Thus spoke Mrs. Postlethwaite to her doctor, as
he introduced into her presence a little figure in

that my old nurse could give it, and you objected

where Violet could not follow him. But when,
after a hesitation which enabled her to slip behind
the curtain hiding the drawing-room door, he
approached and laid his ear against the great one
standing, as if on guard, at the foot of the stairs,
she saw by the renewed vigour he displayed that
there was comfort for him in its message, even
before she caught the whisper with which he left
it and proceeded to mount the stairs:
"It says Nol It always says Nol I will heed
it as the voice of Heaven. "
But one conclusion could be the result of such
an experiment to a mind like Violet's. This
partly touched old man not only held the key to
the secret of this house, but was in a mood to
divulge it if once he could be induced to hear
command instead of disuasion in the tick of this
one large clock. But how could he be induced?
Violet returned to Mrs. Postlethwaite's bedside
in a mood of extreme thoughtfulness.
Another day passed, and she had not yet seen
Miss Postlethwaite. She was hoping each hour
to be sent on some errand to that young lady's
room, but no such opportunity was granted her.

His look expressed benevolence, but he took care
not to meet the gaze of the woman he had just

him in a way to tax his moral courage. The

To make the old man speak! To force this con-

the clock forbade! How could it be done?
This continued to be Violet's great problem.
She pondered it so deeply during all the remainder
of the day that a little pucker settled on her

brow, which someone (I will not mention who)
would have been pained to see. Mrs. Postle-
thwaite, if she noticed it at all, probably ascribed
it to her anxieties as nurse, for never had Violet
been more assiduous in her attentions. But Mrs.
Postlethwaite was no longer the woman she had
been, and possibly never noted it at all.
At five o'clock Violet suddenly left the room.
Slipping down into the lower hall, she went the
round of the clocks herself, listening to every one.
There was no perceptible difference in their tick.
Satisfied of this and that it was simply the old
man's imagination which had supplied them each
with separate speech, she paused before the huge
one at the foot of the stairs,-the one whose
dictate he had promised himself to follow,-and
with an eye upon its broad, staring dial, muttered
wistfully:
"Oh! for an idea! For an idea!"
Did this cumbrous relic of old-time precision
turn traitor at this ingenuous plea? The dial
continued to stare, the works to sing, but Violet's
face suddenly lost its perplexity. With a wary
look about her and a listening ear turned towards
the stair top, she stretched out her hand and pulled
open the door guarding the pendulum, and peered
in at the works, smiling slyly to herself as she

A blow to the aged man's heart which called
forth a feeble "Yes, yes," followed by a wild
stare which imprinted itself upon the doctor's
memory as the look of one hopelessly old, who
hears for the first time a distinct call from the
grave which has long been awaiting him!
A solitary lamp stood in the lower hall. As the
old man picked his slow way down, its small,
hesitating flame flared up as in a sudden gust,
then sank down flickering and faint as if it, too, had
heard a call which summoned it to extinction.

No other sign of life was visible anywhere. Sunk 
in twilight shadows, the corridors branched away
on either side to no place in particular and serving,
to all appearance (as many must have thought in
days gone by), as a mere hiding-place for clocks.
To listen to their united hum, the old man
paused, looking at first a little distraught, but
settling at last into his usual self as he started
forward upon his course. Did some whisper,
hitherto unheard, warn him that it was the last
time he would tread that weary round? Who can
tell? He was trembling very much when with
his task nearly completed, he stepped out again 
into the main hall and crept rather than walked
back to the one great clock to whose dictum he     ;
made it a practice to listen last.
Chattering the accustomed words, "They say 
Yes! They are all saying Yes! now; but this one 
will say Nol" he bent his stiff old back and laid 
his ear to the unresponsive wood. But the time for ',
no had passed. It was Yes! yesl yes! yes! now, 
and as his straining ears took in the word, he ,
appeared to shrink where he stood and after a 
moment of anguished silence, broke forth into a
low wail, amid whose lamentations one could hear:
"The time has come! Even the clock she loves
best bids me speak. Oh! Arabella, Arabella!"

even oblivious of her. This became quite evident

and when he spoke, as he presently did, it was with
the freedom of one to whom speech is life's last

how, unknown to his friends and the world, he
was a widower when he married her, and the father
of a living child.
"With some women this might have passed with a
measure of regret, and some possible contempt for
his silence, but not so with her. She rose to her feet
-I can see her yet-and for a moment stood facing
him in the still, overpowering manner of one who
feels the icy pang of hate enter where love has
been. Never was moment more charged. I could
not breathe while it lasted; and when at last she
spoke, it was with an impetuosity of concentrated
passion, hardly less dreadful than her silence had
been.

wrath. 'You whom I expected to make so happy

it had been cleft at the root, and nothing could
restore it to life. They loved the child; I have
never seen evidence of greater parental passion
than they both displayed, but there their feelings
stopped. Towards each other they were cold.
They did not even unite in worship of their treas-
ure. They gloated over him and planned for him,
but always apart. He was a child in a thousand,
and as he developed, the mother especially, nursed
all her energies for the purpose of ensuring for him
a future commensurate with his talents. Never a
very conscientious woman, and alive to the advan-
tages of wealth as demonstrated by the power
wielded by her rich brother-in-law, she associated
all the boy's prospects with money, great money,
such money as Andrew had accumulated, and now
had at his disposal for his natural heirs.
"Hence came her great temptation,-a tempta-
tion to which she yielded, to the lasting trouble of
us all. Of this I must now make confession though
it kills me to do so, and will soon kill her. The
deeds of the past do not remain buried, however

hidden in the darkest corner of the room,
so also.
"I never knew how she became acquainted with
the terms of her brother-in-law's will. He cer-
tainly never confided them to her, and as certainly
the lawyer who drew up the document never did.
But that she was well aware of its tenor is as posi-
tive a fact as that I am the most wretched man
alive to-night. Otherwise, why the darksome deed
into which she was betrayed when both the
brothers lay dying among strangers, of a dreadful
accident?
" I was witness to that deed. I had accompanied
her on her hurried ride and was at her side when
she entered the inn where the two Postlethwaites
lay. I was always at her side in great joy or in
great trouble, though she professed no affection
for me and gave me but scanty thanks.
" During our ride she had been silent and I had
not disturbed that silence. I had much to think of.
Should we find him living, or should we find him
dead? If dead, would it sever the relations be-
tween us two? Would I ever ride with her again?
" When I was not dwelling on this theme, I was
thinking of the parting look she gave her boy; a
look which had some strange promise in it. What
had that look meant and why did my flesh creep

and my mind hover between dread and a fear- 
some curiosity when I recalled it? Alas! There was 
reason for all these sensations as I was soon to learn.
"We found the inn seething with terror and
the facts worse than had been represented in the
telegram. Her husband was dying. She had
come just in time to witness the end. This
they told her before she had taken off her veil.
If they had waited-if I had been given a full
glimpse of her face-But it was hidden, and I
could only judge of the nature of her emotions by 
the stern way in which she held herself.
" 'Take me to him,' was the quiet command
with which she met this disclosure. Then, before 
any of them could move:
"'And his brother, Mr. Andrew Postlethwaite?
Is he fatally injured too?'
"The reply was unequivocal. The doctors were
uncertain which of the two would pass away first. 
"You must remember that at this time I was
ignorant of the rich man's will, and consequently
of how the fate of a poor child of whom I had 
heard only one mention, hung in the balance at
that awful moment. But in the breathlessness 
which seized Mrs. Postlethwaite at this sentence
of double death, I realized from my knowledge of 
her that something more than grief was at prey

art watched her as she bent over the dying man
and gazed into his wide-open eyes, already sight-
less and staring. Calculation was in her look and
calculation only; and calculation, or something
equally unintelligible, sent her next glance in the
direction of his brother. What was in her mind?
I could understand her indifference to Frank even
at the crisis of his fate, but not the interest she
showed in Andrew. It was an absorbing one,
altering her whole expression. I no longer knew
her for my dear young madam, and the jealousy
I had never felt towards Frank rose to frantic
resentment in my breast as I beheld what very

ikely might be a tardy recognition of the other's
well-known passion, forced into disclosure by the
exigencies of the moment. 
"Alarmed by the strength of my feelings, and
fearing an equal disclosure on my own part, I
sought for a refuge from all eyes and found it in a
little balcony opening out at my right. On to this
balcony I stepped and found myself face to face
with a star-lit heaven. Had I only been content
with my isolation and the splendour of the spec-
tacle spread out before me! But no, I must look
back upon that bed and the solitary woman stand-
ing beside it! I must watch the settling of her
body into rigidity as a voice rose from beside the
other Postlethwaite saying, 'It is a matter of
minutes now,' and then-and then-the slow
creeping of her hand to her husband's mouth, the
outspreading of her palm across the livid lips-its
steady clinging there, smothering the feeble
gasps of one already moribund, till the quivering 
form grew still, and Frank Postlethwaite lay dead
before my eyes!
"I saw, and made no outcry, but she did, bring-
ing the doctor back to her side with the startled
exclamation:

in him, and he has passed before his brother.'

made my hair rise, as the proceedings over, I
faced her and made my first and last effort to rid
my conscience of its new and intolerable burden.
" But the woman I had known and loved was no

brows, and her charm which had been mainly sex-
ual up to this hour had merged into an intellectual
force, with which few men's mentality could cope.

I knew that a slavery of spirit, as well as of heart,

great charitable institutions was spent with the
base purpose of demonstrating to this child the
power of immense wealth, and in what ways she
might expect to see her little brother expend the
millions in which she had been denied all share.
" I was so sure of this that one night while I was
winding up the clocks with which Mrs. Postle-
thwaite in her fondness for old timepieces has filled
the house, I stopped to look at the little figure
toiling so wearily upstairs to bed, without a
mother's kiss. There was an appeal in the small
wistful face which smote my hard old heart, and
possibly a tear welled up in my own eye when I
turned back to my duty.
"Was that why I felt the hand of Providence
upon me, when in my halt before the one clock to
which any superstitious interest was attached-the
great one at the foot of the stairs-I saw that it had 
stopped and at the one minute of all minutes in our

" Oh, those days and nights! And oh, the face
of the mother when the doctors told her that the
case was hopeless! I asked myself then, and I
have asked myself a hundred times since, which of
all the emotions I saw pictured there bit the deep-
est, and made the most lasting impression on her
guilty heart? Was it remorse? If so, she showed
no change in her attitude towards Helena, unless
it was by an added bitterness. The sweet looks
and gentle ways of Frank's young daughter could
not win against a hate sharpened by disappoint-
ment. Useless for me to hope for it. Release
from the remorse of years was not to come in that
way. As I realized this, I grew desperate and
resorted again to the old trick of stopping the
clock at the fatal hour. This time her guilty heart
responded. She acknowledged the stab and let
all her miseries appear. But how? In a way to
wring my heart almost to madness, and not benefita
the child at all. She had her first stroke that
night. I had made her a helpless invalid.

in her eyes, or just that air of desolation in her
stony figure. Something made me speak; some-
thing made me ask if she were not quite so well as
usual, and something made her reply with the
dreadful truth that the doctor had given her just
two months more to live. My fright and mad
anguish stupefied me; for I was not prepared for
this, no, not at all;-and unconsciously I stared 
down at the bowl I held, unable to breathe or
move or even to meet her look.
"As usual she misinterpreted my emotion.
"'Why do you stand like that?' I heard her
say in a tone of great irritation. 'And why do you
stare into that bowl? Do you think I mean to

various docks striking the hour. When all were
still again and Violet had drawn aside the portiere,
it was to see the old man on his knees, and between
her and the thin streak of light entering from the
hall, the figure of the doctor hastening to Helena's
bedside.
When with inducements needless to name, they
finally persuaded the young girl to leave her
unholy habitation, it was in the arms which had 
upheld her once before, and to a life which prom- 
ised to compensate her for her twenty years of 
loneliness and unsatisfied longing.
But a black shadow yet remained which she 
must cross before reaching the sunshine!
It lay at her step-mother's door.
In the plans made for Helena's release, Mrs.  '
Postlethwaite's consent had not been obtained, 
nor was she supposed to be acquainted with the
doctor's intentions towards the child whose death
she was hourly awaiting.
It was therefore with an astonishment, bordering
on awe, that on their way downstairs, they saw the
door of her room open and herself standing alone
and upright on the threshold-she who had not
been seen to take a step in years. In the wonder

she ,   conscious of the duty she thus openly
negleced, she sat crouched over her desk with her
hand on the mysterious packet, the string of which,
however, she made no effort to loosen.

What was she thinking of?
We are not alone in our curiosity on this subject. 
Her brother Arthur, coming unperceived into the
room, gives tokens of a similar interest. Never
before had he seen her oblivious to an approaching
step; and after a momentary contemplation of
her absorbed figure, so girlishly sweet and yet so
deeply intent, he advances to her side, and peer-
ing earnestly into her face, observes with a serious-
ness quite unusual to him:
"Puss, you are looking worried,-not like your-
self at all. I've noticed it for some time. What's
up. Getting tired of the business?"
"No-not altogether-that is, it's not that, if it's
anything. I'm not sure that it's anything. I- "
She had turned back to her desk and was pushing
about the various articles with which it was plenti-
fully bespread; but this did not hide the flush which
had crept into her cheeks and even dyed the snowy
whiteness of her neck. Arthur's astonishment at
this evidence of emotion was very great; but he
said nothing, only watched her still more closely,
as with a light laugh she regained her self-posses-
sion, and with the practical air of a philosopher
uttered this trite remark:
"Everyone has his sober moments. I was only

"Then what?"
A sweet soft look robbed her face of its piquancy,
but gave it an aspect of indescribable beauty quite
new to Arthur's eyes.
Tapping his lips with a thoughtful forefinger,
he asked:
"Who was that sombre-looking chap I saw bow-
ing to you as we came out of church last Sunday?"
She awoke from her dreamy state with an
astonishing quickness.
"He? Surely you remember him. Have you

"Oh, it's Upjohn, is it? Yes, I remember him.

rewards in order to cry halt to the pursuit for which
you have proved yourself so well qualified.
The story, in deference to yourself as a young
and much preoccupied woman, has been written
in a way to interest. Though the work of an every-
day police detective, you will find in it no lack of
mystery or romance; and if at the end you perceive
that it runs, as such cases frequently do, up against
a perfectly blank wall, you must remember that
openings can be made in walls, and that the loosen-
ing of one weak stone from its appointed place,
sometimes leads to the downfall of all.
So much for the letter.
Laying it aside, with a shrug of her expressive
shoulders, Violet took up the manuscript.
Let us take it up too. It runs thus:
On the I7th of July, I9-, a tragedy of no little  '
interest occurred in one of the residences of the
Colonnade in Lafayette Place.
Mr. Hasbrouck, a well known and highly re-
spected citizen, was attacked in his room by an 
unknown assailant, and shot dead before assistance

of Mr. Hasbrouck's room, crying "Murder!
murder!"
But when I had crossed the threshold, I was

astonished at the paucity of facts to be gleaned
from the inmates themselves. The old servant, 
who was the first to talk, had only this account 
of the crime to give:
The family, which consisted of Mr. Hasbrouck,
his wife, and three servants, had retired for
the night at the usual hour and under the usual
auspices. At eleven o'clock the lights were all
extinguished, and the whole household asleep, with
the possible exception of Mr. Hasbrouck himself,
who, being a man of large business responsibilities,
was frequently troubled with insomnia.
Suddenly Mrs. Hasbrouck woke with a start.
Had she dreamed the words that were ringing in her
ears, or had they been actually uttered in her
hearing? They were short, sharp words, full of
terror and menace, and she had nearly satisfied
herself that she had imagined them, when there
came, from somewhere near the door, a sound she
neither understood nor could interpret, but which
filled her with inexplicable terror, and made her
afraid to breathe, or even to stretch forth her hand
towards her husband, whom she supposed to be
sleeping at her side. At length another strange
sound, which she was sure was not due to her
imagination, drove her to make an attempt to rouse
him, when she was horrified to find that she was

moved, if a carriage had not at that moment passed 
down Astor Place, bringing with it a sense of corn-
panionship which broke the spell holding her, and
gave her strength to light the gas which was in
ready reach of her hand.
As the sudden blaze illuminated the room,
revealing in a burst the old familiar walls and well-
known pieces of furniture, she felt for a moment as
if released from some heavy nightmare and re-
stored to the common experiences of life. But in
another instant her former dread returned, and
she found herself quaking at the prospect of passing
around the foot of the bed into that part of the
room which was as yet hidden from her eyes. 
But the desperation which comes with great
crises finally drove her from her retreat; and, creep-  '
ing slowly forward, she cast one glance at the floor 
before her, when she found her worst fears realized
by the sight of the dead body of her husband lying 
prone before the open doorway, with a bullet-hole
in his forehead.
Her first impulse was to shriek, but, by a power-
ful exercise of will, she checked herself, and ring-
ing frantically for the servants who slept on the top
floor of the house, flew to the nearest window and
endeavoured to open it. But the shutters had
been bolted so securely by Mr. Hasbrouck, in his

Problem 7 for Violet Strange 257
endeavour to shut out all light and sound, that by
the time she had succeeded in unfastening them, all
trace of the flying murderer had vanished from the
street.
Sick with grief and terror, she stepped back into
the room just as the three frightened servants
dfsehded the stairs. As they appeared in the
'   Sway, she pointed at her husband's in-
',i~  form, and then, as if suddenly realizing

two women rushed to her assistance, but the
butler, bounding over the bed, sprang to the

ir  In the interim that followed, Mrs. Hasbrouck
was revived, and the master's body laid decently
on the bed; but no pursuit was made, nor any
inquiries started likely to assist me in establishing
the indentity of the assailant.
Indeed, everyone both in the house and out,
seemed dazed by the unexpected catastrophe, and
as no one had any suspicions to offer as to the
probable murderer, I had a difficult task before
me.
I began in the usual way, by inspecting the
scene of the murder. I found nothing in the room,

or in the condition of the body itself, which added
an iota to the knowledge already obtained. That
Mr. Hasbrouck had been in bed; that he had risen
upon hearing a noise; and that he had been shot
before reaching the door, were self-evident facts.
But there was nothing to guide me further. The
very simplicity of the circumstances caused a
dearth of clues, which made the difficulty of pro-
cedure as great as any I had ever encountered.
My search through the hall and down the stairs
elicited nothing; and an investigation of the bolts
and bars by which the house was secured, assured
me that the assassin had either entered by the front
door, or had already been secreted in the house
when it was locked up for the night.
"I shall have to trouble Mrs. Hasbrouck for a
short interview," I hereupon announced to the
trembling old servant, who had followed me like
a dog about the house.
He made no demur, and in a few minutes I was
ushered into the presence of the newly made widow,
who sat quite alone, in a large chamber in the rear.
As I crossed the threshold she looked up, and I
encountered a good, plain face, without the shadow
of guile in it.
"Madam," said I, "I have not come to disturb
you. I will ask two or three questions only, and

the front door close. I was paralysed by fear and
dread."
"Are you in the habit of trusting to the security
of a latch-lock only in the fastening of your front
door at night? I am told that the big key was not
in the lock, and that the bolt at the bottom of the
door was not drawn."
"The bolt at the bottom of the door is never
drawn. Mr. Hasbrouck was so good a man that
he never mistrusted any one. That is why the big
lock was not fastened. The key, not working
well, he took it some days ago to the locksmith, and
when the latter failed to return it, he laughed, and
said he thought no one would ever think of
meddling with his front door."
"Is there more than one night-key to your
house?" I now asked.
She shook her head.
"And when did Mr. Hasbrouck last use his?"
"To-night, when he came home from prayer
meeting," she answered, and burst into tears.
Her grief was so real and her loss so recent that
I hesitated to afflict her by further questions. So
returning to the scene of the tragedy, I stepped out
upon the balcony which ran in front. Soft voices
instantly struck my ears. The neighbours on
either side were grouped in front of their own win-

out his arms in a dazed way that insensibly accen-
tuated the horror I myself felt of the crime which 
had so lately taken place in the room behind me.
She, noting the movement, took one of the grop-
ing hands in her own and drew him gently towards
her.
"This way," she urged; and, guiding him into
the house, she closed the window and drew down
the shades.
I have no excuse to offer for my curiosity, but the
interest excited in me by this totally irrelevant
episode was so great that I did not leave the
neighbourhood till I had learned something of
this remarkable couple:
The story told me was very simple. Dr. Za-
briskie had not been born blind, but had become
so after a grievous illness which had stricken him
down soon after he received his diploma. Instead
of succumbing to an affliction which would have 
daunted most men, he expressed his intention of
practising his profession, and soon became so 
successful in it that he found no difficulty in estab-
lishing himself in one of the best paying quarters 
of the city. Indeed, his intuition seemed to have
developed in a remarkable degree after the loss of
his sight, and he seldom, if ever, made a mistake
in diagnosis. Considering this fact, and the per- 




<pb n="263"/>
Problem 7 for Violet Strange     263
sonal attractions which gave him distinction, it
was no wonder that he soon became a popular
physician whose presence was a benefaction and
whose word law.
He had been engaged to be married at the time
of his illness, and when he learned what was likely
to be its result, had offered to release the young
lady from all obligation to him. But she would
not be released, and they were married. This had
taken place some five years previous to Mr.
Hasbrouck's death, three of which had been spent
by them in Lafayette Place.
So much for the beautiful woman next door.
There being absolutely no clue to the assailant
of Mr. Hasbrouck, I naturally looked forward to
the inquest for some evidence upon which to work.
But there seemed to be no underlying facts to this
tragedy. The most careful study into the habits
and conduct of the deceased brought nothing to
light save his general beneficence and rectitude,
nor was there in his history or in that of his wife,
any secret or hidden obligation calculated to pro-
voke any such act of revenge as murder. Mrs.
Hasbrouck's surmise that the intruder was simply
a burglar, and that she had rather imagined than
heard the words which pointed to the shooting as
a deed of vengeance, soon gained general credence.
I1

But though the police worked long and arduously
in this new direction their efforts were without fruit
and the case bids fair to remain an unsolvable
mystery.
That was all. As Violet dropped the last page
from her hand, she recalled a certain phrase in her
employer's letter. "If at the end you come upon
a perfectly blank wall--" Well, she had come upon
this wall. Did he expect her to make an opening
in it? Or had he already done so himself, and was
merely testing her much vaunted discernment.
Piqued by the thought, she carefully reread
the manuscript, and when she had again reached
its uncompromising end, she gave herself up to a
few minutes of concentrated thought, then, taking
a sheet of paper from the rack before her, she wrote
upon it a single sentence, and folding the sheet,
put it in an envelope which she left unaddressed.
This done, she went to bed and slept like the child
she really was.
At an early hour the next morning she entered
her employer's office. Acknowledging with a nod
his somewhat ceremonious bow, she handed him
the envelope in which she had enclosed that one
mysterious sentence.
He took it with a smile, opened it offhand,

glanced at what she had written, and flushed a
vivid red.
"You are a--brick," he was going to say, but

with be characterand appearance. "Look here. I

onl:Ch dimples can. "But-what do you want
of mA'in an affair of this kind? Something more
than to help you locate the one possible clue
to further enlightenment. You would not have
mentioned the big reward just for that."

"Perhaps not. There is a sequel to the story
I sent you. I have written it out, with my own
hand. Take it home and read it at your leisure. 
When you see into what an unhappy maze my own
inquiries have led me, possibly you will be glad to
assist me in clearing up a situation which is inflict-
ing great suffering on one whom you will be the
first to pity. If so, a line mentioning the fact will
be much appreciated by me." And disregarding
her startled look and the impetuous shaking of
her head, he bowed her out with something more
than his accustomed suavity but also with a seri-
ousness which affected her in spite of herself and
effectually held back the protest it was in her heart
to make. She was glad of this when she read his
story; but later on-
However, it is not for me to intrude Violet, or 
Violet's feelings into an affair which she is so

full record of her work. When she is necessary to 
the story, you will see her again. Meanwhile,

my inner consciousness, for no one spoke I am
sure-ringing with a question which, whether the
echo of some old thought or the expression of a
new one, so affected me by the promise it held of
some hitherto unsuspected clue, that I hesitated
whether to push this new inquiry then or there by
an attempted interview with Mrs. Hasbrouck, or
to wait till I had given it the thought which such a
stirring of dead bones rightfully demanded.
You know what that question was. I shall have
communicated it to you, if you have not already
'guessed it, before perusing these lines:
" Who uttered the scream which gave the first alarm
of Mr. Hasbrouck's violent death?"
I was in a state of such excitement as I walked
away-for I listened to my better judgment as to
the inadvisability of my disturbing Mrs. Has-
brouck with these new inquiries-that the perspira-
tion stood out on my forehead. The testimony
she had given at the inquest recurred to me, and
I remembered as distinctly as if she were then
.speaking, that she had expressly stated that she
did not scream when confronted by the sight of her
husband's dead body. But someone had screamed 
and that very loudly. Who was it, then? One of
the maids, startled by the sudden summons from 
below, or someone else-some involuntary witness    l

of the crime, whose testimony had been suppressed
at the inquest, by fear or influence?
The possibility of having come upon a clue even
at this late day so fired my ambition that I took
the fist opportunity of revisiting Lafayette Place.

and in less than fifteen minutes I was at the door 
of his new home, where I asked, not for him, but'
for Mrs. Zabriskie.
It required some courage to do this, for I had
taken particular notice of the doctor's wife at the
inquest, and her beauty, at that time, had worn
such an aspect of mingled sweetness and dignity
that I hesitated to encounter it under any circum-
stances likely to disturb its pure serenity. But a 
clue once grasped cannot be lightly set aside by a
true detective, and it would have taken more
than a woman's frowns to stop me at this
point.
However, it was not with frowns she received me,
but with a display of emotion for which I was even
less prepared. I had sent up my card and I saw ;
it trembling in her hand as she entered the room.
As she neared me, she glanced at it, and with a
show of gentle indifference which did not in the,
least disguise her extreme anxiety, she courteously
remarked:
"Your name is an unfamiliar one to me. But
you told my maid that your business was one of
extreme importance, and so I have consented to see
you. What can an agent from a private detective

The blind have often been said to possess a sixth
sense in place of the one they have lost. Though 
I am sure we made no noise, I soon perceived that
he was aware of our presence. Stepping hastily '
forward he said, in the high and vibrating tone of 
restrained passion:
"Zulma, are you there?"
For a moment I thought she did not mean to
answer, but knowing doubtless from experience the
impossibility of deceiving him, she answered with
a cheerful assent, dropping her hand as she did
so from before my lips.
He heard the slight rustle which accompanied the
movement, and a look I found it hard to compre- 
hend flashed overhis features, altering his expression
so completely that he seemed another man.
"You have someone with you," he declared,
advancing another step, but with none of the ,
uncertainty which usually accompanies the move-,
ments of the blind. "Some dear friend," he:
went on, with an almost sarcastic emphasis and a '
forced smile that had little of gaiety in it.
The agitated and distressed blush which an- 
swered him could have but one interpretation.
He suspected that her hand had been clasped in
mine, and she perceived his thought and knew that
I perceived it also.

Drawing herself up, she moved towards him,

cination which must vanish the moment we drag
it into broad daylight-that he-he, the best man
in all the world, was himself the assailant of Mr.
Hasbrouck."
Good God!
"I say nothing of the impossibility of this being
so," she went on in a fever of expostulation. 
"He is blind, and could not have delivered such a
shot even if he had desired to; besides, he had no 
weapon. But the inconsistency of the thing
speaks for itself, and should assure him that his
mind is unbalanced and that he is merely suffering
from a shock that was greater than we realized.
He is a physician and has had many such instances
in his own practice. Why, he was very much
attached to Mr. Hasbrouck! They were the best 
of friends, and though he insists that he killed him, M
he cannot give any reason for the deed."
At these words the doctor's face grew sterm, 
and he spoke like an automaton repeating somiori
fearful lesson: 
"I killed him. I went to his room and deliber',i
ately shot him. I had nothing against him, and 
my remorse is extreme. Arrest me and let me pay 
the penalty of my crime. It is the only way in 
which I can obtain peace."                  i

"No pistol was ever found," I answered with a
smile, forgetting for the moment that he could not
see. "If such an instrument had been found in
the street after a murder of such consequence, it 
certainly would have been brought to the police."
"You forget that a good pistol is valuable prop-
erty," he went on stolidly. "Someone came along I
before the general alarm was given; and seeing
such a treasure lying on the sidewalk, picked it up .

He was gone, and the poor young wife was left
crouching on the floor alone. Pitying her shame
and terror, I ventured to remark that it was not an,
uncommon thing for a man to confess to a crime
he had never committed, and assured her that the
matter would be inquired into very carefully'

She thanked me, and slowly rising, tried to regain
her equanimity; but the manner as well as the
matter of her husband's self-condemnation was,
too overwhelming in its nature for her to recover
readily from her emotions.
"I have long dreaded this," she acknowledged.

hand towards his, in the tender hope that he would
feel its approach and accept her sympathy. But
he was deafas well as blind; and sat wrapped up 
thoughts which she, I know, would have give
worlds to penetrate.
Her countenance was not without its mystery
also. She showed in every lineament passionatq

nearest me.
Immediately the inspector put the question
which I had suggested:
" By what means did you enter Mr. Hasbrouck's
house at so late an hour as this murder occurred?"
The blind doctor's head fell forward on his
breast, and he hesitated for the first and only
time.
"You will not believe me," said he; "but the
door was ajar when I came to it. Such things
make crime easy; it is the only excuse I have to
offer for this dreadful deed."
The front door of a respectable citizen's house
ajar at half-past eleven at night! It was a state-
ment that fixed in all minds the conviction of the
speaker's irresponsibility.. Mrs. Zabriskie's brow
c!eared, and her beauty became for a moment
dsain' g as she held out her hands in irrepressible
iies towards those who were interrogating her
thsband. I alone kept my impassibility. A
poible explanation of this crime had flashed like
ligtiag across my mind; an explanation from
which I inwardly recoiled, even while I felt forced
to caider it.

"Very well," said he, "give me the least proof

"Proof? Is not a man's word--  "

with which you assert yourself to have committed

"True, true. I was frightened by what I had

to rid myself of the weapon in any way I could.
But someone found this pistol; someone picked it
up from the sidewalk of Lafayette Place on that

to realize how all this sounded. "Alas!" cried he,
"I know the story seems improbable; but it is not
the probable things that happen in this life, as
you should know, who every day dig deep into
the heart of human affairs."
Were these the ravings of insanity? I began to
understand the wife's terror.

The result was that he was not detained, thoughl

"From this time on I shall never know whether
or not I am alone," was his final observation as
he left the building.
Here is where the matter rests and here, Miss
Strange, is where you come in. The police were
for sending an expert alienist into the house; but
agreeing with me, and, in fact, with the doctor
himself, that if he were not already out of his mind,
this would certainly make them so, they, at my
earnest intercession, have left the next move to
me.
That move as you must by this time understand
involves you. You have advantages for making
Mrs. Zabriskie's acquaintance of which I beg you
to avail yourself. As friend or patient, you must
win your way into that home? You must sound
to its depths one or both of these two wretched
hearts. Not so much now for any possible reward
which may follow the elucidation of this mystery
which has come so near being shelved, but for
pity's sake and the possible settlement of a ques-

strange dual nature, when he was in his office or
at the bedside of the sick;-and had she not been
a deep reader of the human soul she would have
left his presence in simple wonder at his skill and
entire ;bsorption in an exacting profession.
But as it was, she carried with her an image of
subdlued suffering, which drove her, from that
W|9"aent on, to ask herself what she could do to

~  ssdciaote such a man with a senseless and cruel

W hat this wish, helped by no common deter-
mination, led her into, it was not in her mind to
conceive. She was making her one great mistake,
but as yet she was in happy ignorance of it, and
pursued the course laid out for her without a doubt
of the ultimate result.
Having seen and made up her mind about the
husband, she next sought to see and gauge the
wife. That she succeeded in doing this by means
of one of her sly little tricks is not to the point; but
what followed in natural consequence is very much
so. A mutual interest sprang up between them
which led very speedily to actual friendship.
Mrs. Zabriskie's hungry heart opened to the sym-
pathetic little being who clung to her in such
evident admiration; while Violet, brought face

of practical insight in cases of a more or less
baffling nature. He is certainly a most wonderful
physician, and I feel bound to record that his
mind is as clear for business as if no shadow had
fallen upon it.
Dr. Zabriskie loves his wife, but in a way tor-
turing to himself and to her. If she is gone from
the house he is wretched, and yet when she returns
he often forbears to speak to her, or if he does speak
it is with a constraint that hurts her more than his
silence. I was present when she came in today.
Her step, which had been eager on the stairway,
flagged as she approached the room, and he natu-
rally noted the change and gave his own interpre-
tation to it. His face, which had been very pale,
flushed suddenly, and a nervous trembling seized
him which he sought in vain to hide. But by the
time her tall and beautiful figure stood in the door-
way, he was his usual self again in all but the
expression of his eyes, which stared straight before
him in an agony of longing only to be observed
in those who have once seen.
"Where have you been, Zulma?" he asked, as
contrary to his wont, he moved to meet her.

bitterness that promised but little peace for her
future. Yet she quickly dried them and busied
herself with ministrations for his comfort.
If I am any judge of woman, Zulma Zabriskie
is superior to most of her sex. That her husband
mistrusts her is evident, but whether this is the
result of the stand she has taken in his regard, or
only a manifestation of dementia, I have as yet
been unable to determine. I dread to leave them
alone together, and yet when I presume to suggest
that she should be on her guard in her interviews
with him, she smiles very placidly and tells me
;hat nothing would give her greater joy than to
see him lift his hand against her, for that would
argue that he is not accountable for his deeds or
assertions.
Yet it would be a grief to see her injured by this
passionate and unhappy man.
You have said that you wanted all the details
I could give; so I feel bound to say that Dr.
Zabriskie tries to be considerate of his wife, though
ie often fails in the attempt. When she offers
lerself as his guide, or assists him with his mail,

which she continually manifests her sense of his

conduct? 
I have before me two visions of mental 
ing. At noon I passed the office door, and looki
within, saw the figure of Dr. Zabriskie seated
his great chair, lost in thought or deep in 
memories which make an abyss in one's c
sciousness. His hands, which were clench;
rested upon the arms of his chair, and in one!)
them I detected a woman's glove, which I had i
difficulty in recognizing as one of the pair worn 
his wife this morning. He held it as a tiger mig'

cerned the sadness of a broken heart. When she
left, I left also, without having learned anything
beyond the fact that Mrs. Zabriskie is one who
does her duty in sorrow as in joy. A rare and
trustworthy woman I should say, and yet her
1h04sd does not trust her. Why?
:)i have spent this day in accumulating details
iI regard to Dr. and Mrs. Zabriskie's life previous
to the death of Mr. Hasbrouck. I learned from
sources it would be unwise to quote just here, that
Mrs. Zabriskie had not lacked enemies to charge
her with coquetry; that while she had never
sacrified her dignity in public, more than one per-
son had been heard to declare that Dr. Zabriskie
was fortunate in being blind, since the sight of his
wife's beauty would have but poorly compensated
him for the pain he would have suffered in seeing
how that beauty was admired.
That all gossip is more or less tinged with exag-
geration I have no doubt, yet when a name is
mentioned in connection with such stories, there
is usually some truth at the bottom of them.
And a name is mentioned in this case, though I do
not think it worth my while to repeat it here; and
loth as I am to recognize the fact, it is a name that
carries with it doubts that might easily account for
20

who dares hint that she still continues to i

to his most intimate friends. He sailed from this
country most unexpectedly on the eighteenth of
July a year ago, which was the day after the murder
of Mr. Hasbrouck. It looks like a flight, especially
as he has failed to maintain open communication
even with his relatives. Was he the man who shot
Mr. Hasbrouck? No; but he was the man who put
the pistol in Dr. Zabriskie's hand that night, and
whether he did this with purpose or not, was evi-
dently so alarmed at the catastrophe which fol-
lowed that he took the first outgoing steamer to
Europe. So far, all is clear, but there are myster-
ies yet to be solved, which will require my utmost
tact. What if I should seek out the gentleman
with whose name that of Mrs. Zabriskie has been
linked, and see if I can in any way connect him
with Mr. Stanton or the events of that night.
Eureka! I have discovered that Mr. Stanton
cherished a mortal hatred for the gentleman above
mentioned. It was a covert feeling, but no less
deadly on that account; and while it never led
him into, any extravagances, it was of force suffi-
cient to account for many a secret misfortune
occurring to that gentleman. Now if I can prove

behind one of the pictures, when I suddenly heard
Joe say:
"He has the most remarkable memory I ever
met. He can tell to a day when any notable
event occurred."
"Pshaw!" answered his companion, who, by the
way, was known to pride himself upon his own
memory for dates, "I can state where I went and
what I did on every day in the year. That may
not embrace what you call 'notable events,'
but the memory required is all the more remarkable
is it not?"
"Pooh!" was his friend's provoking reply, "you
are bluffing, Ben; I will never believe that."
Mr. T    , who had passed by this time into
that stage of intoxication which makes persistence
in an assertion a duty as well as a pleasure, threw
back his head, and as the wreaths of smoke rose
in airy spirals from his lips, reiterated his state-
ment, and offered to submit to any test of his
vaunted powers which the other might dictate.
"You keep a diary-" began Joe.
"Which at the present moment is at home,"

The doctor sat with his wife in the ster and it
was upon their faces Violet's glance was fixed.
The glare shone luridly on his sightless eyeballs,
and as she noticed his unwinking lids, she realized
as never before what it was to be blind in the
midst of sunshine. His wife's eyes, on the con-
trary, were lowered, but there was a look of hope-
less misery in her colourless face which made her
appearance infinitely pathetic, and Violet felt
confident that if he could only have seen her, he
would not have maintained the cold and unre-
sponsive manner which chilled the words on his
poor wife's lips and made all advance on her part
impossible.
On the seat in front of them sat an inspector
and from some quarter, possibly from under the
inspector's coat, there came the monotonous
ticking of the small clock, which was to serve as
a target for the blind man's aim.
This ticking was all Violet heard, though the
river was alive with traffic and large and small
boats were steaming by them on every side.
And I am sure it was all that Mrs. Zabriskie heard
also, as with hand pressed to her heart, and eyes
fixed on the opposite shore, she waited for the
event which was to determine whether the man
she loved was a criminal or only a being afflicted

the ground which had been selected for this trial
at arms, and the various members of the party
were being placed in their several positions.
The doctor, to whom light and darkness were
alike, stood with his face towards the western
glow, and at his side were grouped the inspector
and the two physicians. On the arm of one of the
latter hung Dr. Zabriskie's overcoat, which he
had taken off as soon as he reached the field.
Mrs. Zabriskie stood at the other end of the
opening near a tall stump, upon which it had been
decided that the clock should be placed when the
moment came for the doctor to show his skill.
She had been accorded the privilege of setting the
clock on this stump, and Violet saw it shining in
her hand as she paused for a moment to glance
back at the circle of gentlemen who were awaiting
her movements. The hands of the clock stood at
five minutes to five, though Violet scarcely noted
it at the time, for Mrs. Zabriskie was passing her
and had stopped to say:
"If he is not himself, he cannot be trusted.
Watch him carefully and see that he does no mis-
chief to himself or others. Ask one of the in-
spectors to stand at his right hand, and stop him if
he does not handle his pistol properly."
Violet promised, and she passed on, setting the

that he understood the instrument, and Violet's
hopes which had been strong up to this moment,
sank at his air of confidence.
"Thank God I am blind this hour and cannot see
her," fell from his lips; then, before the echo of
these words had died away, he raised his voice and
observed calmly enough, considering that he was
about to prove himself a criminal in order to save
himself from being thought a madman:
"Let no one move. I must have my ears free
for catching the first stroke of the clock." And he
raised the pistol before him.
There was a moment of torturing suspense and
deep, unbroken silence. Violet's eyes were on him,
so she did not watch the clock, but she was sud-
denly moved by some irresistible impulse to note
how Mrs. Zabriskie was bearing herself at this
critical moment, and casting a hurried glance in
her direction she perceived her tall figure swaying
from side to side, as if under an intolerable strain
of feeling. Her eyes were on the clock, the hands
of which seemed to creep with snail-like pace
along the dial, when unexpectedly, and a full
minute before the minute hand had reached the
stroke of five, Violet caught a movement on her
part, saw the flash of something round and white
show for an instant against the darkness of her

"Zulma," he shrieked, "what is this? Were
not my hands dyed deep enough in blood that you
should make me answerable for your life also?"
Her eyes were closed but she opened them.
Looking long and steadily at his agonized face,
she faltered forth:
"It is not you who have killed me; it is your
crime. Had you been innocent of Mr. Has-
brouck's death your bullet would never have found
my heart. Did you think I could survive the
proof that you had killed that good man?"
"I-I did it unwittingly. I-  "

It was now his turn to silence her. His hand
crept to her lips, and his despairing face turned
itself blindly towards those about them.
"Go!" he cried; "leave us! Let me take a last
farewell of my dying wife, without listeners or
spectators."
Consulting the eye of her employer who stood
close beside her, and seeing no hope in it, Violet
fell slowly back. The others followed, and the
doctor was left alone with his wife. From the

the surrounding darkness and set it like an image
of frozen horror before their eyes. Against his
breast he held the form of his dead wife, and now
and then Violet saw him stoop as if he were
listening for some token of life from her set lips.
Then he would lift himself again with hopelessness
stamped upon his features, only to lean forward
in renewed hope that was again destined to dis-
appointment.
Violet had been so overcome by this tragic end
to all her hopes, that her employer had been
allowed to enter the boat with her. Seated at her
side in the seat directly in front of the doctor, he
watched with her these simple tokens of a breaking
heart, saying nothing till they reached midstream,
when true to his instincts for all his awe and com-
passion, he suddenly bent towards him and said:
"Dr. Zabriskie, the mystery of your crime is no
longer a mystery to me. Listen and see if I do
not understand your temptation, and how you,
a conscientious and God-fearing man, came to slay
your innocent neighbour.

plain, the furniture simple. Nothing suggestive
in either, unless it was the fact that nothing was
new, nothing modern. As it looked in the days of
Burr and Hamilton so it looked to-day, even to the
rather startling detail of candles which did duty
on every side in place of gas.
As Violet recalled the reason for this, the fascin-
ation of the past seized upon her imagination.
There was no knowing where this might have
carried her, had not the feverish gleam in Miss
Digby's eyes warned her that the present held its
own excitement. Instantly, she was all attention
and listening with undivided mind to that lady's
disclosures.
They were brief and to the following effect:
The dinner which had brought some half-dozen
people together in this house had been given in
celebration of her impending marriage. But it
was also in a way meant as a compliment to one
of the other guests, a Mr. Spielhagen, who, during
the week, had succeeded in demonstrating to a few
experts the value of a discovery he had made which
would transform a great industry.
In speaking of this discovery, Miss Digby did
not go into particulars, the whole matter being
far beyond her understanding; but in stating its
value she openly acknowledged that it was in the




<pb n="344"/>
Missing: Page Thirteen
of Mr. Cornell's own work, and one which
Ived calculations and a formula which, if
laturely disclosed, would invalidate the con-
Mr. Spielhagen hoped to make, and thus
-oy his present hopes.

oly life but one interest which could be called
11 absorbing. This was for explosives. As a 
equence, much of the talk at the dinner-table
been on Mr. Spielhagen's discovery, and the
ible changes it might introduce into this espe- 
ndustry. As these, worked out from a formula
secret from the trade, could not but affect
tly Mr. Cornell's interests, she found herself
ning intently, when Mr. Van Broecklyn, with
.pology for his interference, ventured to re-
k that if Mr. Spielhagen had made a valuable 
)very in this line, so had he, and one which he
substantiated by many experiments. It was 




<pb n="345"/>
Problem 8 for Violet Strange     345
not a marketable one, such as Mr. Spielhagen's
was, but in his work upon the same, and in the
tests which he had been led to make, he had dis-
covered certain instances he would gladly name,
which demanded exceptional procedure to be
successful. If Mr. Spielhagen's method did not
allow for these exceptions, nor make suitable
provision for them, then Mr. Spielhagen's method
would fail more times than it would succeed. Did
it so allow and so provide? It would relieve him
greatly to learn that it did.
The answer came quickly. Yes, it did. But
later and after some further conversation, Mr.
Spielhagen's confidence seemed to wane, and before
they left the dinner-table, he openly declared his
intention of looking over his manuscript again that
very night, in order to be sure that the formula
therein contained duly covered all the exceptions
mentioned by Mr. Van Broecklyn.
If Mr. Cornell's countenance showed any change
at this moment, she for one had not noticed it;
but the bitterness with which he remarked upon
the other's good fortune in having discovered this
formula of whose entire success he had no doubt, was
apparent to everybody, and naturally gave point
to the circumstances which a short time afterward
associated him with the disappearance of the same.

"Let us call the ladies," suggested one.
It was done, and however great the tension had
been before, it was even greater when Miss Digby
stepped upon the scene. But she was not a woman
to be shaken from her poise even by a crisis of this
importance. When the dilemma had been pre-
sented to her and the full situation grasped, she
looked first at Mr. Cornell and then at Mr. Spiel-
hagen, and quietly said:
"There is but one explanation possible of this
matter. Mr. Spielhagen will excuse me, but he is
evidently mistaken in thinking that he saw the lost
page among the rest. The condition into which
he was thrown by the unaccustomed drug he had
drank, made him liable to hallucinations. I have
not the least doubt he thought he had been study-
ing the formula at the time he dropped off to
sleep. I have every confidence in the gentleman's
candour. But so have I in that of Mr. Cornell,"
she supplemented, with a smile.
An exclamation from Mr. Van Broecklyn and a
subdued murmur from all but Mr. Spielhagen
testified to the effect of this suggestion, and there
is no saying what might have been the result if
Mr. Cornell had not hurriedly put in this extra-
ordinary and most unexpected protest:
"Miss Digby has my gratitude," said he, "for a

try to assume the individuality of the person who

A ridiculous concession, but finally she had her

Suddenly they heard her cry out, and in another

came to a turn, beyond which her fingers failed
to reach any wall on her left. Then came a step
up which she stumbled, and farther on a short
flight, each tread of which she had been told to
test before she ventured to climb it, lest the decay
of innumerable years should have weakened the
wood too much to bear her weight. One, two,
three, four, five steps! Then a landing with an
open space beyond. Half of her journey was done.
Here she felt she could give a minute to drawing
her breath naturally, if the air, unchanged in years,
would allow her to do so. Besides, here she had
been enjoined to do a certain thing and to do it
according to instructions. Three matches had

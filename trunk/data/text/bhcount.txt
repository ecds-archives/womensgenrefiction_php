A brief discussion of <hi rend="italic">pate</hi> sandwiches, hot bouillon, and other enticements, sent them, both men and women, refreshed to the carriages and herdics lined up in the bowery street below. McPhail himself escorted to her brougham the large pink and white Ambassadress, who had honoured him with her efflorescent presence. As he put her inside, he kissed the plump hand from whose wrist depended a bag of flexible gold set with sapphires, now comfortably filled with her evening's winnings.</p><pb n="4     THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN."/><p>"Good night, and ever so many thanks for a delightful little party," she said, settling her superb shoulders back upon the cushions. "No one can be dependedupon for such good bridge as Mr. McPhail. One thinksalways play is better in a bachelor's house. We werea little afraid last winter, yours would lose that prestige, but since Mrs Wilfred Methuen went abroad,taking with her the so-lovely niece, our fears are--"</p><p>"Have no fears but that my house will always beat the disposition of Mme l'Ambassadrice," saidAngus McPhail, gallantly, stepping back, as her footman received his order to take the great lady home.</p><p>While the host was remounting the stairs to the draw-ing-ro   foom floor, he passed a man coming down them."Dropped my cigar case and went back to look forit.

Her quite famous little feet twinkled down thered velvet carpet resolutely. McPhail saw that shewas going to sink with colour at her masthead. Headmired her for it, as he had always admired the inde-finable insignia of race and breeding stamped uponthis charming product of bygone Southern prestige inWashington society. But he felt conclusively that itwas as a bygone alone, that she could ever again stirthe fountains of his heart.As he shook hands with her in the cab-leaning pasther poor yawning ghost of a maid to do so, the odourof the gardenias Miss Carteret generally wore came tohim from her person mingled with the as familiar oneof stale cigarettes.

Mr..Muguttin Methuen, of a Virginian family connected<pb n="11"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRSSM        .     11with half the tombstones in the State, had been duringthe latter years of his threadbare existence in the em-ploy of Government as a clerk of an uninterestingDepartment. The initialmisfortune of his life had beenhis descent from a long line of English and VirginianSquires who had spent money freely upon their statepolitics and many acres, bequeathing neither fortunenor energy to the generation shattered by a mighty civilwar.. His second and greater mishap had been the oneacebntable for so many kindred failures of young man-,hood in the South; an early marriage with a pretty,silly girl without a cent, who had borne him too manychildren to do justice to them or to herself, and wasnow, in consequence, a shut-in hypochondriac, forevercomplaining of her lot. After that he had fallen intothe hands of sharpers who had ruined him in affairs.It was wonderful, so people said, how the AugustinMethuens had inanaged to struggle along during allthese years and live, with a family of four boys andfour girls to feed and clothe and educate and launchupon the world according to their station! But theyhad lived, the boys were now variously self-supporting,and the three older Misses Methuen were still afloatupon the current of Washington society, the lovely<pb n="12"/>12      THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.youngest being abroad with a solvent sister-in-law oftheif father's, who had taken her husband's niece withthe proviso that it was a mere temporary arrangement,binding the lady to no future 4ption.Late in life, Mr. Wilfred Methuen, a handsomene'er-do-weel of a bachelor fAted in Washington society,had espoused a wealthy widow from New York, whoi6r some years after his demise appeared to ignore theexistence of her husband's humble brother and his needyfamily. A visit to Washington in the interval of timespent mostly abroad had recently put this super-civ-ilized lady in touch with the Augustin Methuen house-hold. The result was the transplanting of Margot.While Mr. McPhail waited in the big empty frontparlour pending the progress of a shuffling negro girlto ago and see" if "the ladies" were at home, hebecame coincidentally aware of the scattering froma dim rear room of several feminine forms previouslyteiconced upon couches, light literature in hand, ormaking over old finery in the half-light under paint-less shutters bowed to keep out the Southern heat.Later in the day, as he well knew, these young ladies,would be seen sallying forth equipped in the heightof fashiol in cheap materials, leaving their cards in<pb n="13"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.         13the front halls of a dozen desirable houses. From thebeginning of the Washington season until the endthereof, the Misses Methuen kept up this ceaseless riteof rendering tribute in pasteboard to the social deities.In certain fashionable streets, they might generallycount.upon ringing every door along one side of asquare then crossing, to perform the same act of' civil-ityl on the other. One saw them "everywhere," the,}thuiaen girls," rather good to look at, facile in/~;:p pon/versation; repertories of gossip concerningaHi.~  m   and diplomats conspicuous in society, allresidts or birds of passage who had made a lodgmentin public observation, in their time. Appearing in.the front rank at receptions, "days," and general enter-tainments, to' what went on outside the District ofColumbia save in New York and Newport, they wereprofoundly indifferent.  Thus pursuing the eternal.round of petty happenings in their town and family,nothing had occurred to bring the Methuens beforethe public, until Margot, the youngest girl, after a fewpreliminary symptoms of beauty and fascination, burstas a perfect rose of maiden loveliness upon the back-ground of their dull home. It was not these charmerswhom McPhail now desired to see, and perhaps they<pb n="14"/>14      THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.had tact enough to discern the.fact  After a discreetinterval of audible whispers, giggles and footsteps onte stairs, the negro girl came back, announcing in-differently that Mis' Methuen would be  right down."Before the appearance of the lady of the house whomthe visitor understood to be so designated, he had ampleleisure to rejoice at the lucky chance that had led Mar-got's footsteps to deflect from the narrow pathway trod-den by her tiresome trinity of sisters. He had neverunderstood the whim of nature by which the dazzlingyoung creature, fine, fair and thoroughbred, meant forthe primrose paths of life, to be surrounded by allthings beautiful, should have grown up in this un-lovely and dismal dwelling. Walls, carpets, furniturewere faded and timeworn. A few family portraitsdarkling at intervals; a few shelves of ancient books,somme bits of old china-a centre table displaying thesupreme ornament of a bowl of dustyvisiting cards-this, was the only setting of his gem, save when herfamily were boarding at some -cheap resort in themountains of Yirginia IWell he knew how distasteful it all was to her eagerbeautycraving spiritl  He had perceived that thesisters were a weariness to her, the mother a thorn in<pb n="15"/>THE COUNT AND THE    CONGRESSMAN.       15her flesh, the father alone claiming her ardent loveand sympathy. And yet, in the full reality of suchconditions and surroundings, and of her lack of pros-peet of change from them, Margot had twice refusedhim. He knew at the time that her heart was emptysave of a thousand dreams of uncomprehended senti-met, of lofty ideals hardly to be materialized. Inthis fact he had accepted with sick certainty' 4igtio^n Ithat it was not he who might ever hoperromantic dreams. His face burned again,i^'  sfiy  abslutenes of her repellent gaze when't  ` 4a   1li; awli^ngness to wait, no matter howloung ttil be might laim her as his wife.There had remained but a single string on which hemight play to win her, and this he was now preparedto touch.

Mrs. Methuen's talk dribbled ina steady rivulet on and ever, happily exacting smallreturn. From early youth she had been accustomedto fulfil the supreme duty of a Virginia girl upon hernative heath by making herself agreeable to "com-pany." No matter what her physical weakness, onceseated to receive a visitor, she would continue to putforth her wan enticements until he left her. On thepresent occasion, the strain of endeavour was clearly in-spired by a feeling of unusual ambition to succeed.She was at a white heat of anxious agitation.

She knew that theobligation of money lent at a crisis, money which hadnot yet been returned, and of McPhail's action in pro-viding a livelihood for her two sons, were facts alwaysgalling to her husband's thoughts. A dim understand-ing that Methuen chafed because he could not affordto speak  his mind   openly  about McPhail, hadseveral times dawned upon her slow   apprehension.The specific reason alleged for his opposition to theproposed marriage had been the-in his eyes-allsufficient one, of McPhail's previously immoral life.Mrs. Methuen could not forget his telling their girl thathe was prouder of her when she "turned down Me-Phil," than he had ever been since he stepped up to receive his degree of A.M from the faculty of the Uni-vermity of Virginia.

That morning, acertain cable message had come for Aunt Katrina, andfollowing it a baffle of words had passed between thetwo women. The struggle had left Margot sore andstirred to the core of her resistent heart. After lunch-eon, Mrs. Methuen had betaken herself to rest on the chaise-longue in her pleasant salon. The girl had stolen out on the balcony to look down upon the passing show  'in the garden beneath, and wonder where she might turn for aid and comfort in sore stress of mind.28                         ;<pb n="29"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.           29A fair scene lay before her, a festa of earth and skywas enactingl   The whole flower-decked, palpitatingworld seemed to be offering herself to the sun god.The mountains across the lake wore the tint and tex-ture of ripe, purple plums. The intermediate stretchof lake seen beyond the garden railing whereon werewelded roses, cream, pink, blackish-red and crimson,was a plain of shimmering silver. The trim gravel Wlk along the edge of the water was shaded by.lternate pollard planes and palm trees. Already, al-though luncheon was not long over, waiters were set-ting little tables up on the grass for the tea and theother. mild liquid refreshments foreigners seem everready to imbibe.Up and down between the beds of flaring marguer-ites and myosotis, strolled the hotel guests, men inwhite trousers, blue sack coats and spotless panamahats, women for the most part in white frocks pro-fusely embroidered. Some of them were droppinginto iron chairs by the tea tables, lounging upon wickerseats under the great white pillared arcade over thehotel entrance, or hooding themselves under Bath chairscoquettishly lined with red or blue.Below  the landing stairs, a little fleet of rowing<pb n="30"/>30      Tfl COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.boats were assembling for the afternoon diversion of the guest--craft broad bottomed and safe of build,their stern seats cushioned in flowery chintz, gay awn-ings overhead, and the flag of his country conveniently ready to be run up astern for the benefit of any citizen 'of any nationality prepared to pay the price. Margot found herself vaguely watching the embarcation of aparty of two in the jaunty steam launch belonging tothe hotel-a honeymoon couple of the pattern so fre- quent and obvious on the Italian Lakes. Very young .they were, very fluffy, doing their best to look indiffer- ent to the prospect of an afternoon afloat in eachother's company in this earthly paradise. As the mattred'ktel, bearing aloft a tray containing enough stickyconfectioneries to have spread a table for St. Agnes'Eve, hurried down to the landing to put his daintiesaboard the launch, a general smile overspread the facesof on-lookers. It was as if two children were goingif for a picnic feast.  But Margot did not smile. In her heart she was rather enjoying the little bride in herpiakfrilled muslin hat, who looked so adorably happyin spite of her best efforts to the contrary.OVer all this va-et-vien of cheerful summer folk,flared upon its staff the great banner of Italy, barred.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~, I<pb n="31"/>THE COUNT AND TH    CONGRESMAN.        31with green and red and white, that kept guard over theirlanding.  To-day, Margot felt out of tune with thecharming spectacle so familiar to her eyes. They hadcome North from Sicily by automobile along the East-ern coast of Italy, visiting the less-frequented citiesand localities of that region, stopping as they choseacording to the fancy of a traveller jaded yet discrim-inating as was Mrs. Wilfred Methuen. During this.:time of prolonged enchantment including their stay inV.enie,  Margot had not once heard mention of herby o/re, the Washington Congessman       The oldwearisome play of argument from the lips of her chap-eron as to her duty in the matter of accepting so mani-festly eligible an opportunity of bettering her own con-dition and the family's fortunes, had apparently dieda natural death. The girl had breathed gloriously free.To-day, after the cablegram from McPhail had beenplaced in Mrs. Methuen's hands, the stroke of doom hadsounded louder than ever in Margot's ears. To escapefrom the thoughts of it, she felt that she could nolonger bear the imprisonment of the trim terrace withits balustrade of stone, its pots of plants and mosaicpatterned floor, looking down upon all these conven-<pb n="32"/>32      THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.tional people preoccupied with their petty attempts tomake time fly.Fly! when every day would bring nearer the threat-ened arrival of McPhail ISlipping back into the darkened salon, stacked withJune roses in every corner, she crept past her auntstill dozing on the chaise-longue, a French novel fallenfrom he' relaxed grasp, her aristocratic profile gleam-ing whitely against a pillow of Bologna cut-work. Howwas it possible this fair delicate being could have shownsuch iron purpose, such dire tenacity in urging herniece to a loveless marriage  Scarcely daring to trustherself to look a second time at the mute destroyer of.her peace, Margot picked up a garden hat and went ontiptoe out into the spacious corridor, down the widemarble stairs to the grounds.A former palace of that errant and ill-starred prin-,4c.

She wanted to protectStelvio against she knew not what."If you noticed so much at Chevy Chase, perhapsyou will also recall that I was angry, ill-mannered, thatthe interruption you speak of was an annoyance," shes tammered.i .

It must be that some of the old investmentshad come out well, or perhaps Aunt Katrina herselfhad been the good fairy to buy back Harmony Hall, andlet her father have the use of it for life. But even asshe searched Mrs. Methuen's eyes for confirmation ofher hopes, Katrina saw them droop before her ardentyoung gaze. A cloud came between Margot and hersun."Aunt Katrinal   It has nothing to do with-withMr. McPhail " she faltered in accents of bitter dis-appointment"My dear child, we'll be late for dinner if you do notdress at once.""I shall go in as I am.

Margot wouldnot admit to herself what magic was at work in keyingher spirits to a pitch they had never before reachedduring her travels with her aunt. Nothing more wassaid about McPhail's visit, and-if occasionally, ashade of anxiety came over her because Aunt Katrinahad ominously ceased all allusion to the detested Ameri-can wooer-in such beautiful weather, in such a worldof bloom and sunshine it was not possible to dwell upondisagreeable things, so long as she did not see or heartheml Nor had further reference been made to theprspect held for a moment before her dazzled eyes,u lifting the life burden from her father's shoulders.Slh" almost thought it had been a dream that AuntKa*tin had ever promised to tell her how this blessedtask could be aecomplished; if not a dream of her own,at least a delusion of Aunt Katrina's, who when she76<pb n="77"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.         11was set upon having her own way, often cleverlypersuaded herself that facts may be disestablished!Count Stelvio, having been duly presented as a callerin Mrs. Methuen's salon, came frankly and frequently.Aunt Katrina, artistic to her finger tips, seemed fascin-ated by his youthful beauty, his engaging manners, hisfitness to his frame.During the midday hours, when a golden haze ofheat lay upon all things living, substituting torpor forexertion, the ladies kept behind double blinds, in thecool darkness of flower-laden rooms. In the late after-noon, they made many excursions, chiefly by water,since to drive with horses at Lake Como means. jogglingalong a hard, burning high road in a velvet-lined landau,conducted by a theatrical personage in a coat of many.colours and many buttons, who at every opportunity,blows an ear-piercing blast upon a curly brass horn; andtheir heavy touring-car seemed to lack proportion withthe miniature beauties of this landscape.At night, again, they would go out in the launch Mrs.Methuen had now hired for her own personal use; cut-ting the silver waters of the lake, gazing up at the darkshoulders of the mountains reared against their starrybackground-watching the foam bells clash together in<pb n="78"/>78      THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.their wake-or listening, in silence too full for words,to the music floating out to them across the rose-gardensof some lighted villa.In a short time, the appearance of young Stelvio atthe gatherings of residents on the lake who exchangedcivilities chiefly of an aquatic sort, had ceased to becommented upon as a novelty. Margot, through Count-ess Fleury, had come to be known by the desirable en-tertainers, and now found herself daily meeting him.As it had begun to be understood among neighbourhoodgossips that Miss Methuen had no fortune, and was en-tirely dependent upon the good graces of a fairly youth-ful and well-preserved relative-in-law, much quiet sym-pathy was expressed for the young man's unfortunatedebut in the tender passion attributed to him: CountessFleury who perhaps more than anyone else regrettedthe circumstance of his infatuation for the fair Wash-ingtonian, declared that she washed her hands of thewhole affair; having brought the two together to gratifyher own esthetic sense of a perfect harmony in con-trasted colouring, without imagining that Stelvio wasfool enough to play with his only chance of rehabilitat-ing his sattered fortunes, when she had distinctly toldhim of a Chicago heiress coming to visit her during the<pb n="79"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESBMAN.         79autumn season. What more the countess might havesaid, was temporarily put out of her head by the arrivalof a young artist from Paris, summoned by telegraph toredecorate the long gallery of her chateau, who provingto be unusually good-looking and well-mannered, wasadopted by the charming lady as a favourite of the hour,Stelvio for the moment dropping out of place.Mrs. Clandeboye and Mr. Lee, still lingering on atVilla d'Este, were often included ih the hospitalitiesf Mrs. Methuen's launch parties, and sometimes ex-haned comments on the progress of affairs."I can't understand it in the least;" the English-woman said. "They must both know, and the auntcertainly knows, that the thing is out of the question.""My own opinion is there is somebody in their owacountry," answered Mr. Lee, sapiently. "Somebodyfatiguingly'rich and uninteresting like so many of theirmen. La Belle Demoiselle will go back home to marryhim, and in the meantime the aunt will not interferewith this idyl which keeps her charge harmlesslyamused.""What a horribly cold-blooded way to look at it,"cried Mrs. Clandeboye, who herself matrimonially dis-illusioned and accustomed to travel on the Continent<pb n="80"/>80     THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.while her liege lord hugged his ancestral acres in Hert-fordshire, could not easily be shocked. " put you areso clever, Mr. Lee, I wonder if you are not right. Ifthe girl has to marry money, which the aunt seems toexpece--'"" In these days, the wheels positively won't go roundwithout a great lot of it, will they " asked Mr. Lee."Oh! never," said the lady, fervently. "As I wassaying, if Margot is bound to be bored to extinction forthe rest of her existence, it seems cruel to cut her offfrom this good little time at Como. And I'll own I'vebeen selfishly hoping to profit by the affair, to the extentof an invitation to visit Far Niente. I went so faryesterday as to tell Stelvio, in her presence, that sheand I were both dying to see the gardens, the Biberon,and the books.""You did?" exclaimed the gentleman with spark-lig eyes. "And with what success?";"Stelvio, who has always the air of an Edgar ofavenswood, turned red, then pale, looked at Margot,then at me, then at her again. She, too, blushed, but Iam gl$d to say, stood by me very prettily. She saidthat FOr Niente always seemed to her the one sealedpage in the perfect poem of the Lake. " It is a very<pb n="81"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSAN.          81ragged page, Miss Methuen. Blurred and shabby sadblotted with sad hieroglyphs, but always open to youand your friends, if you deign to look at it," said Ed-gardo, as if he were laying it at her feet.

During  this interlude  MargotMethuen and later, Stelvio, left the group around theperformers and went over to a window opening uponthe garden to look out into dewy vistas where countlessroses slumbered beneath the stars, and near by, a night-ingale sang in a thicket of rhododendron." One could count the oranges in that tree," exclaimedMargot, under her breath. " They look, in this lightfrom inside, as if carved in amber against the jade greenof the foliage. How intensely beautiful the night islHow'restful, how upliftingl ".   !,  T am thinking, perhaps, less of the night upon the.'.ake, to which I am well accustomed in all its phases,"'answered Stelvio, "than of the rare luck of being herew'ith you in a half American house, where we mayStan  part in a window and talk, without committinga crime against the convenances.

"Perhaps, before you askit, Count Stelvio, you had better give me a hint in whatdirection the favour lies.""That direction," said the young man, pointingacross to the shore opposite, where in the centre of aglimmering mass of pale-tinted walls, beneath clusteredfoliage, a single light burned in the casement of an...pper window, sending down a pencil of radiance into.:ji ^A dark expanse of water underneath.- You said, yesterday, words that have been haunt-ing me and delighting me ever since-beautiful words,tender words-that Far Niente had seemed to you theone sealed page in the perfect poem of the Lake.

Now, I wantto ask if your aunt and you-and perhaps Mrs. Clande-boye and Mr. Lee-will not do me the honour of takingbreakfast with me, there ? "Margot's breath came more easily. She had fearedsomething far more difficult to answer."For the others, I can say I know they will considerit a high compliment to be asked," she exclaimed, warmly. " And for myself, the only drawback to my<pb n="84"/>84      THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.pleasure in accepting is the thought that I've per-haps driven you to inviting us,""When you come, you will understand why I hesi-tated.

I don't carethe least whether it is shabby and run-down.

The young French-man, in the act of fetching her a glass of lemonade ofwhich beverage the chatelaine consumed large quanti-ties in and out of season, was received with an absent-minded smile. His Traumerei was played and over.Stelvio's "Uno furtiva lagrima," was yet to be sung.And when the glorious voice, schooled to carry aheart-break in each note, arose on this thrilling air andsmote the evening silence, no mortal listener could haveresisted him. Men bent their heads in envious submis-sion to his rulership over women's hearts. Women couldhardly wait for him to end it, in their desire to avowthemselves his subjects  Margot Methuen, believingthat she was unobserved, had slipped outside the longwiindow and stood alone on the terrace steeped in theUaight and delicious thoughts.

Stelvio abruptly arose from thepiano, and strode through the group of people who sur-rounded him clamouring for " just one more." He sawMargot taking flight at his' approach down an alley ofroses grown over a trellis, and stopped short upon thethreshold.

He has in fact toldher so.""Good heavens, is that possible?" cried Margot,stung out of her apathy, and springing to her feet." I don't mean in so many words, of course.

Over the summit of the wall above theirheads foamed roses. In the heart of the little grottoseen throuh the grille waved a mass of luxuriant<pb n="99"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESMAN.           99maidenhair. The hillside behind and around the des-olate old weather-scaled mansion was clothed in glor-ious beech and chestnut trees. In the terraced gardento one side, sprang a marvel of flowers and leafage withclumps of rhododendrons and red camellia springingfrom amid their shed petals as from islands of rosysnow.

His bossy back, as he totteredahead of them on the return up a flight of pebbledsteps supported by cross pieces of stone and sproutingwith green things undisturbed, expressed distinct dis-approval of their intrusion. For Guiseppe held in thelocked places of his proud old spirit, an invincible be-lief in the glory of the Stelvio race that for five cen-turies had ridden on the crest of the wave in Italianhistory. He considered that no outsiders, least of allEnglish and Americans, had a right to see a Stelvioin decay. He had been tormented enough by touristsof their stripe coming there and trying to buy an en-trance to his master's home. Nevertheless, since theyoung Count had willed this piteous exposition of theirfallen fortunes, it was Guiseppe's part but to obey.Margot, last to ascend the steps, and lingering for acharmed glance into a grotto with dripping lilies and:maidenhair gemmed with diamond drops from       thejguntain it enshrined, now found her hand clasped byBitlvio's, his eager eyes fixed on hers with honest rap-ture. The others, who had already been received byhim had passed on, into the cortile."   ,or one horrible moment, I thought you had notcome," he whispered.

A couple of dogs lying upon a wolf skin beforea couch, a small piano, books upon the shelves, a writ-ing table littered with papers and current periodicalsof Italy, France, England and America, with anodour of tobacco over all, lent the human touch so sadlylacking elsewhere in the big bare dwelling.Mrs. Methuen, whose enthusiasm   for the purely'pituresque  was already on the wane in face of thespritual depression she had pased through in a briefspaee of time, cheered visibly. She let Stelvio instalher in a fauteuil, covered with new crimson leather,and looked around her with a sigh of relief."I permitted myself the luxury of that arm-<pb n="105"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGESSMAN.         105chair I I I" confided Stelvio, to Margot  " When I re-turned from America with the spoils of one of yournational legislators in my pocket.

Here under the in-'terlacing boughs of mighty beeches and chestnuts, theylooked upon a long enchanting vista of blooming hillsand mist-wreathed mountains arising from reaches ofblue water flecked with sun save where it shaded toemerald beneath the foliage of the shores. From oneend of the shelf that held them a narrow stairway ofstone embedded in moss and maidenhair led up themountain-side till it was lost in greenery. Everywherewas seen the moist shining of glorious verdure, and achill as of winter was exhaled from the sunless cleft.In the extraordinary beauty and witchery of theseurroundings, Margot could forget even McPhail andfll his works.

In vain he had fumed. There was notime, no material for a change. Guiseppe could but trotforward presenting his platter with a crimson face atthe left elbow of the lady upon his master's right. Tothe old servitor, cursing within him his wife's folly, itseemed that the seigneurs of five centuries of Stelviosf were dishonoured and belittled by her action.'All went well until the last visible " poussin " was-·ifeed to the English gentleman.

Margot, across thetable saw the little comedy and laughed back at him.Mrs. Clandeboye, who sat on Stelvio's left, saw nothing.She was too busily engaged in cutting up her owndelicious allotment of the feast.Guiseppe's old knees knocked together as he hastenedto the side table after the salad bowl. He felt that ablight had come over his career.

Another circum-stance weighed on the old man's mind. Stelvio hadforgotten that the infirm knife of the four vermeil-handled ones remaining to them, had been put at hisplate. There was brief delay in the crash of the im-pending crisis.

Here, the Count,after unlocking the silk-lined glass doors, had exposedto the connoisseurs ravished view two or three shelvesfull of treasures before which the Englishman's heartdid silent homage. From that moment until recalledto life by main force, Mr. Lee would be dead to hissurroundings. The two ladies who remained sittingon either side of the tortoise-shell coffer were less activelybut as thoroughly aroused to curiosity. Stelvio, re-turning to them, had taken out a silver circle strungwith keys, and selecting the smallest one opened thelittle chest. Its contents revealed a number of ex-quisitely shaped shagreen cases, each in itself a work ofart, and each containing an antique watch or fingerring of unique beauty and workmanship."Oh     Oh " breathed Mrs. Olandeboye.    "TheHStel de Cluny collection has nothing so good.

Afterall, thought she, was it not her last chance to be alonewith him in unconstrained intercourse  Strive as shemight against it, the dark cloud of McPhail's arrivalwas gathering upon her mental horizon.

Leaving behindthe thickets wherein rhododendron massed its crimson,pink, white and sulphur-tinted bloom; where orangeshung like burnished gold, and red camellias glowed,where acacia and banksia twined their flowery gar-lands everywhere; where roses ran up tall tree trunks,throwing back branches starred with countless vividblossoms-they had come into this sweet and solitaryspot near the water's edge. The only tenants besidethemselves were a marble Hermes, the worse for timeand moss, but smiling eternally between mottled treeboles under his umbrella of tender foliage-and a sun-beam, that defying the ban placed by nature upon hiskind elsewhere at Far Niente, peeped through the treesto rest upon the young girl's radiant face.Stelvio saw with a fearsome joy that she was happybeyond all his imaginings of her.

Staggering beneath the cross of a greatsorrow, a greater fear, he had grown up to manhood.His patience, tenderness and forbearance with the poors::  tken mother who had imposed this blight upon him,wi.'  e lbeyond all praise  Throughout this hard bittertime the priest who had trained and educated him, whobetter than anyone living sympathised with him andbelieved that his rights would'one day be established,had instilled upon him the folly, the useless sacrificeof indulgence-in earthly passion; trying to lift his soulto the altitude of pure religion where Father Anselmohimself had climbed upon the ruins of a dead past.When the climax was reached that had brought toCountess Stelvio a brief period of sanity following hermad act of setting fire to their ancestral home, thepoor lady came too late into a clear comprehensionof the wrong she had wrought upon her son. The papersthat proved his legitimacy, long cunningly hidden bythe mad woman, were produced by her in the presence<pb n="120"/>120    THB tOUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.of Father Anselmo and a notary from the neighbouringtown. Guido's pardon, pathetically implored, wasgranted to her but a few hours before her death. Whenhe went from that intensely painful scene, leaving hisdying mother alone with the priest, Guido for the firsttime in his life, had lifted his head proudly to thelight of stars. A swirl of new thoughts, new hopes andmbitions, filled his mind. No longer nameless, butthe rightful heir of a proud old title  No longer out-side the pale of young men of his own tastes and edu-cation but safely established in the social stratum towhich he had been born I When Father Anselmo hadfinally come out to find him, the boy, with flushedcheeks and eyes brilliant as with fever, was walkingback and forth upon the parapet of the only survivinghabitable wing of Castel Stelvio. It had cost the goodrather many pangs to have to take that moment toannounce to the young Count that his mother had justpssed awayl                   ,    . "Reinstated beyond question in the eyes of the worldinto his father's high social positon, Guido found but apoor remnant of money coming to him of all their by-gone wealth. A man without near ties or intimacieshe continued to live aliost as much to himself as he<pb n="121"/>.TH  COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.         12hld done previously. But Father Anselmo had toacknowledge that whatever career awaited his pupil,it would never be that of a Churchman. His youth, hisbeauty, his romantic story, not to say that his rarevoice was a talisman to unlock most hearts, made Stelviomore than welcome in society, which reached out itsmyriad arms in his direction with varying success. Thevoyage to America, undertaken at the instance of afriend who believed it would serve as a needed tonic:tp his mind, had effected much in arousing him to newzs: -  est in life, and a broader understanding of ambition.rfter it, he began to read voraciously upon subjects ofvital contemporaneous interest, and to write essays andmonographs which were at once received favourablyby the public. Until the coming of Margot Methuento stir the calm waters of his existence, he was happierthan he had ever been before. The calm retreat of FarNiente, with his few devoted servants and an occasionalvisit from Father Anselmo, proved an ideal atmos-phere for the fostering of his new employment   If,at times, the memory of the fresh young beauty he hadseen for a moment in Washington, flashed over himirresistibly, Stelvio accepted it as his inspiration, neverdreaming that he was to meet her again in the flesh,<pb n="122"/>122    THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESMAN. and to have his pulses stirred by her into a young man'spassion. But the unexpected had occurred and tri-umphed    Since their meeting at Villa d'Este, he hadlived for little elhe but the moments he spent with her.Nearer and nearer had come the vertiginous possibilitythat she could care for him. Since Guido had visited.America, his ideas on many points had modified, andhe could now picture a Count and Countess di Stelvioliving upon the work of the husband's brain, she happyin home and family without feeling belittled that allcame to them in payment of his toil. He knew thatthis was the case with numbers of Margot's friendsmarried and living in a small way around her in Wash-ington.

A perfect scene, a propitious hour inwhich to let the words that thrilled within him findtheir vent. And yet, in his own house, on his own ter-ritory, how dared he speak to her of love ?

She beheld a vision of the Congressman's fatmiddle-aged prosperity, his too-new clothes, his tooprotuberant waistcoat, the high colour, the bristlingblack moustache, his self-satisfied smile-in Stelvio'splee-and uttered an ejaculation, half pain, halfanger "What is it " Guido exclaimed anxiously.

Theterrible plain speaking of the modern Englishwoman offashion was never less to her taste than now. Perhapsit cut deeper in that she recognized its truth.Margot, personally, had had little to complain of inMcPhail's attitude towards her since his arrival. Hewas, as far as externals went, a changed being, givingno indication of the sentimental aspirations of bygone,days, quiet, considerate and agreeable as she had neverfound him. He had so far-until this expedition to theFrari with Mr. Lee, made no attempt to see her apartfrom the others. The first dreaded encounter with himbad passed unemotionally., He had not sought to re-wne. their previous relations even in petty thing. :I<pb n="168"/>168    TBB COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.the breathing spee thus afforded her, she had a delight-ful feelingthat perhaps he now wanted no more thanher friendhip; this, she would make an heroic effort tobestow upon him, in view of her mother's letter detail-ibg the kindnesses by which he had striven to alleviatethe hardships of Mr. Augustin Methuen's present lotit life. It had been a pleasure to hear from him of theprogress of the improvements now going on at HarmonyHall Every trifle she had ever commented on con-cerning her childhood's home was remembered by him,and emphasised in his plan of restoration. He hadbrought out the plans to show her, together with a blueprint of te proposed additions that were to make theold house a perfect example of early Colonial architec-ture. There was even a pretty photograph of the re-newed garden with its box-edged walks and clumps ofqueer peacocks and animals in trimmed box as she hadoaee adored them before they had bulged beyond theines of veri-similitude. Its little fountain shot up intl: oetre a jet d'eau visible in the picture. She hadgaud at this in facinated silence, then uttered a longdsi  osatisfaction.Mr.t Ie, had he known that in the dusky corner ofthe Frai, the two Americans were talking about<pb n="169"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONRs        AN.    169whether to mass foxgloves or hollyhocks in the bedsunder the library-window, instead of doing their dutyby the tombs of the Doges all around them, would havebeen perhaps justly condemnatory of their frivolity.But he knew nothing until forcibly wrenched away froma favorite Bellini by the necessity of closing the church;and on their way back, sustained a monologue concern-ing Italian mortuary art, which at least saved Missethuen from the necessity of general conversation.or at heart, Margot was sad and sore, and the pleasdit thoughts of the revival of her old home had not longpower to ]bep upher spirits That Stelvio had not cometo her in the morning after their virtual avowal of loveeach for the other had been a keen blow. The letter shehad sent him out of her deeply wounded heart, althoughwritten in haste, was what she knew she ought to havesaid to him, and she must not now repent it. Althoughshe did not, as she had said, "doubt" her lover, therefrigerating effect of silence and absence, confirmedher belief that he knew he must go no further. Yes,they had made a terrible mistake. She had taken theinitiative in telling him so, which in some degree salvedher sense of mortification at his attitude. For foolish,eckless, unthinking though a man may be, in letting<pb n="170"/>170     THE CONT AND. THE OONGRESSMAN.his passion for a woman get the better of cold commonsense, the woman always wants to feel that lie is readyto stand by. his folly. The little burst of weakness thatended her letter, had come in spite of her. She hardlyrealised the force of it  She had written at hot speed,and after sending away her missive, felt that a great'gulf separated her from the idyl of Far Niente gardenand the lake. At such a crisis, the proposal of McPhailthat.they should accompany him to Venice, had beenwelcomed, albeit mournfully. She had determined togo cheerfully, to keep up a brave front, exerting herselfto be agreeable to all around her, behaving in short, asany well-bred, high-mettled girl should do under the cir-cumstances. The only thing that could afford her realpleasure in return came, as has been said, through Mc-Phail's talk of her family at home and the revival ofbygones at dear Harmony Hall-hers no more, herspiver to be, but still of supreme interest to her lovingitagination.,A :few letter, forwarded from Villa d'Este, were pre-seinAte  totheir party as they went in to dinner in theprivatt  qsm reserved by McPhail for his party. Therewas amzong those handed to Mrs. Methuen, one whichthat lady took care to put at the bottom of her little pile<pb n="171"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGISSUMAN.         17ishe negligently laid near her wine glasses on the table,beneath the gold meshed bag containing her handker-chief and money for distribution at the floating concertto come in the Grand Canal. It was in truth one ofthose letters a wise chaperon would give anything tohave had lost by the way in coming. She had in scru-tinising the envelope addresse to her niece seen that itcame from Stelvio, and was probably destined to workhavoc in her present scheme of entertainment and dis-traction for Margot. Since Margot could not appropri-ate its contents here at table, her aunt decided not toexcite her by putting it into her hands until the close ofthe evening on their return from the water. To divertsuspicion from her plan, she passed over to her nieceanother, an American letter directed to Margot in thehandwriting of one of her sisters, which Margot receivedwith a smile of thanks and tucked into her belt ribbonto be read at leisure. Well she knew the quality of thoseprofuse epistles in which Maud and Jessy and Julialoved to spread their meagre intellectual quality overmany sheets of thin cheap paper for the benefit of theiryoungest sister, "travelling in Europe with our aunt,kMrs. Wilfred Methuen, and having the loveLest time "'as they loved to speak of her. And yet in these feeble<pb n="172"/>172    THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.paragraphs of personal items concerning uninterestingpeople, there was a certain Pepysian flavour, not unac-ceptable to the absent rover. She liked to hear aboutthe new frock Jessy had contrived out of Maud's dis-caded last summer crepon, trimmed with lace beggedfwom mother's chest of drawers She was interested inblowing how many evenings of the week Mr. Anstrutheralled upon the family without ever yet having shownany sign of preference for one young lady over theother. The welfare of the kitten, the cook, the hopesand fears of the sisters concerning their summer outing,the numerous on dits of Washington gossip, all had acertain interest because of their connection with herhome.But to-night, Margot did not feel attuned to theseartless chronicles, wanted nothing that would draw heraway from the absorbing interest of her constantlyhronging thoughts of Stelvio. During dinner her long-ag to see or hear from him increased to an alarmingextint   She, who had thought herself admirably incheck, became feverish with restless desire to know whathe had tbught of her note; whether he was prepared toaccept it a a final farewell as her tone had indicatedto him he might appropriately do. She wished she had<pb n="173"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRIESMAN    .    173not been so positive, so explicit. She repented especi-ally the words " we had better never meet again thanplunge deeper into the sadness and sorrow awaiting usand otheas." A literal man, or a sensitive man (whichStelvio certainly was) would abide by that suggestion.And again, in ending, she had hinted that they might"never meet again."  Fatal phrase  What had pof-essed her to repeat it ? Once, surely, was enough ! She.cew now, just how much of her readiness to renounce;:m eternally was due to pique because he had notcome or 'ent that morning. The memory of his words,his loOks, the love-light in his glorious dark eyes thrilledher anew, and she felt that she had let herself act tooharshly. All she could hope and pray was that on theirreturn by way of Como, she might have another glimpseof him, and, in plain words, "give herself anotherchance."In this mood, she threw herself into the talk at table,was livelier and wittier than usual, looked as beautifulas any of the golden-locked Dogaressas who ever trailedtheir damask robes over the immemorial marbles ofnear-by pavements, and succeeded in thoroughly be-witching the giver of the feast out of what constraint hehad put upon himself.

Margot, well pleased to be-left to her medita-tions, amused herself by strewing the petals of thecostly roses McPhail had laid by her plate at dinnerupon the water in their wake. McPhail, annoyed by.her attitude in the talk to-night, more stirred than hechose to admit to himself by the vision of Betty Car-teret at Venice, was glad of an opportunity to regaincontrol of his feelings. He had not the best of tem-pers, and his present humility of spirit was not watrranted to last forever. The little period of drawingt ether between Margot and himself over the restora-t'It of Harmony Hall had been skilfully planned byhim, and the result had proved gratifying.

I like that " exclaimed Margot, withmore enthusiasm than she had shown the speaker foran hour.-" The artist was probably out of an engagement, orhad made a fiasco in his last new role," commented Mrs.Clandeboye.The gondolier, obedient to direction from his em-ployer manemvred them into place between two othercraft lying motionless, their ferrae gleaming overhead,their occupants, muffled and whispering, lending them-selves to the poetic mystery of the hour and scene.An audible exclamation in Mrs. Clandeboye's low sweetvoice brought to her from the gondola on her side, agreeting. Following her surprised identification oftwo friends, a man and a woman, she at once plunged:with them into a close low-toned conversation, excludingXMPhail and Miss Methuen. Hardly had this inci-dent occurred when McPhail, in the middle seat foundhis own attention claimed by the detached memer of a<pb n="188"/>188    THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.party of three ladies, placed like himself, with herback to the gondolier a little apart from the others." Please don't appear to notice me," came softly outof the darkness. "I saw you as you passed in underthe lantern of the next gondola.

Sheis not thinking of you now, though, so you need notfear.""There is nothing settled, I am not afraid," he an-swered nettled by her tone.For Margot was indeed a thousand leagues distantfrom him in thought She had turned away her grace-ful head and was lost in yearning reverie. Oh to seeStelvio, was the burden of her thoughts. In this ab-sorption, she did not observe a new stir in the regionof the mysterious boat sending down its spirals of quiv-ering emerald into the stream. She was recalled to thepresent by the musicians aboard of it striking the pre-liminary chords of the well-remembered " Una furtivalagrime," than which no air was more intimately as-sociated with her lover. All talk from the other boatsceased instantly, all heads were turned in rapt atten-tion as the voice of an unseen man broke into the open-ing phrase of this infinitely wailing and appealingsong.A n electric thrill ran through Margott She sat up-fight trembling, yearning; not because it carried herback to the summer night on the flowery terrace aboveLake Como where she had first heard Stelvio sing, but<pb n="190"/>190     THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.because, unles her ears tricked her, this was Stelviosinging now! Stelvio and none other  As she listened,Margot forced herself to sit as if turned to stone. Sotumultutds her feeling, she dared not look a secondtime at the masked boat. Every note seemed to heriagiiation to be addressed to her reproachfully. Whenthe song ended, and a storm of hand-clapping and vivasgreeted the singer from the gondolas now gathered toform a shadowy bridge across the canal, Mrs. Clande-boye turned toward her companions."Wasn't it adorable    My friends say they hearfrom their gondolier it is a tenor in training for theopera at Milan, who is amusing himself in this way.rAl the other singers on the boats have gone into eclipse,you see, and betaken themselves far up the Canal.

She wanted to say"how dare you ? ""Mr    Clandeboye's theory seems to me unhappilythe correct one," added McPhail, feeling in the dark-ies for his gold. To his relief, the gondola contain-ing Miss Carteret had stolen out of the ranks after thelast song, her patroness avowing that she "felt herneuralgia coming on." He could afford to be generous.While Margot was trying to master her indignation,the boat with the green lanterns still showing no signof life aboard save for the two oarsmen who picked theirway silently among the gondolas, proceeded also to takeits departure from the flotilla, disappearing almostimmediately in the gloom of a side-canal."No collection I" exclaimed Mrs. Clandeboye." Wonders will never cease.

"But I fear CountStelvio has found it impossible to live up to his highideals, since three days ago he accepted my price forthe Biberon which has already started on its voyageto America."Margot started as if she had been shot."And you never told us 1" cried Mr. Olandeboye,.There is something in men after all  How grandaind poud you must be feeling, and as to Count Stelvio,that kecounts for our not seeing him  again.

For upon reaching her bedroomafter the exciting experience of hearing Stelvio singupon the Grand Canal, she had found on her dressingtable the letter addressed by him to her aunt's care, andsitting under the meagre light of an electric bulb sus-pended by the management of the hotel far beyond like-lihood of illuminating aught below, read it with breath-less eagerness. In a few words, Stelvio told her of thesudden illness that had kept him from her side; ofhis grief and bitter disappointment that she had givenhim no chance to explain himself; of his resistance ofthe immediate temptation to follow her and offer thesefacts in person; and, finally-to her complete despair-of his acceptance of her farewell"What you have decreed as to our separation9" theletter ran, "I have no alternative but to accept withthe best grace I can muster.

I should be a poor sort of fel-low if I could not bear this blow, and you must thinkof me as standing up after it and going back to mylife-work with no ill-feeling or vain regret.

Margot, with feelings that may beimagined, succeeded in deciphering what follows here:"Oh my darling child, my sweetest little one, whathave I got to write you?

When she now passed intoher luxurious modern salle de bain with its marble fit-tings, a stabbing thought came to her of the family athome in their cramped quarters waiting turns for theuse of a worn old zinc-lined tub.

Now,to the awesome astonishment of those privileged to be-hold it, arose again a crystal dome intended to over;arch in winter a steam-warmed bower of greenerywith walks of golden sand, a fountain surrounded bygreat-leafed Egyptian plants, roses trained over greentrellis work upon the walls, and tall palms and bamboosplanted in clumps amid couches, chairs and tables ofjaunty wicker-work I The country now, indeed, sat upand began to look with respect upon the new proprietorof old Harmony.After the restoration of the house, came that of the16<pb n="226"/>399f    THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.grounds   A landscape gardener "all the way fromNew York," ttp     in charge hedes, paths, shrubbery,Lo1wer b*S, bxwalks and mazes, buiwing order out ofu*a5L, giiM employment to more men than the neigh-bowuoo could supply and in the end convincing eventhe grnmblers againt ehange that he was more invet-frete than they in keeping to the models of the pastiWben the stables came in for their share of renovation,iad were further supplemented by a smart and capaciousgarage up to date, the gossips who peeped at thesewonders went home wagging their heads as who shouldsay-" the last touch has been put "And still no owner made his appearance on the scene.It was whispered that he had been there in companywith his architect and landscape gardener, between twoboats and had expressed himself as satisfied in a per-*.nptory sort of way.

She hadborne with perfect good humour the interruption of herplans; had allowed Mr. McPhail to make arrangementsfor their voyage homebut suggested that he himself hadbetter return by a later steamer, to which dictum Mc-Phail gave reluctant assent. It was observable by himand Margot, that the good lady was distinctly nervousabout her visit to the Massachusetts coast, from whichboth argued that she had resolved on this occasion tomake a virtue of impending necessity, and effect a meet-ing with her future charge, Miss Minnie Fothergill.How thankfully Margot had subscribed to her aunt'sdecision that McPhail might not accompany them, shehardly realised.  Her whole mind and heart werefilled to ovlowing with distress at her father's condi-tion., Se had found him in a hospital, their poor littlehome proving inadequate to give shelter to his case.Every day while she walked over scorching pavements<pb n="229"/>THE COUNT AND THE   CONGRESSMA        2to visit him, she had thought not of the promise tomarry him she had finally given McPhail on their way'back from Chioggia on the Rosa Maria, but of the im-mediate absorbing present. Would her dear one beliving another day ?The poverty, mean device, discomfort of her home,the wearisome iteration of her sisters' lament over theirlack of prospect, the dazed despair of her mother, didnot in those days affect her sensibly. The first threat-aeing of the break of this tie that had always been su-preme in her affection dwarfed all beside. As she atin the waiting-room of the hospital her heart beatingwith dull fear as to what change might have come tothe dear patient in the night, till the message came downto her by telephone to mount up to his ward, even thememory of Far Niente's enchanted garden and its mas-ter dwindled to insignificance. She could not, shedared not, trust herself to think of another love than thather father claimed.At last a day had come when Augustin Methuen wasdistinctly better. He recognized his child, welcomedher back with a faint smile, showed that he wanted hernear him. His wife, the authorities did not ventureas yet to trust at their patient's bedside.<pb n="230"/>SQo     THB COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.The net 4y, the physician in charge of Mr. Methuenhad acopppq4a d his daughter along the corridor andstopped Ipjf her with his hand on the button of the"Yes, I think the worst is over, my dear young lady,"b     h sd said, while casting an eye of appreciation upon$ aextreme beauty and distinction of his visitor, so oddap offshoot from the overworn and wasted parent towhom he dared not propose the only scheme that oc-curred to him as probable to revive a crushed nervoussystem.

You are not to expectany immediate ecognition of place, or times or sur-roundings, rom my patient. It will be weeks beforehe notices what is going on outside his bedroom. Hisgood nurse win be his intermediary with his family andthe outer world. He will probably not know he is notstill in the hospital.For the first time the Doctor observed a token of ordi-nary girlish sensibility in Margot Methuen. A deep redflush ran up into her face, extending to the roots of hersplendid rippled hair."That is what I am counting upon," she said withperfect dignity.The physician tried after she left him to understandher meaning, and finally gave it up. He had a prettyand petted daughter of his own, and while decidingthat he would hardly be glad to give her in marriage tothe Honourable Angus, it seemed to him that it was awvy different thing with the broken-down and im-poverished gentleman who lay prone on his cot, hisearthly usefulness forever over, a lot of helpless womenon his hands, his two sons barely able to keep themselvesgoing in a far-distant city. Augustin Methuen, in short,4<pb n="233"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSBMA.        933could not afford to look down upon this math. Hisfriends generally would consider it a Godsend.As for the extraordinarily calm and almost haughtyyoung person, Methuen's daughter, the doctor could notfathom her attitude to the affair, and would not try.Next winter there would be a superb new hostess forAngus McPhail's dinners, and all the world would beraving of her beauty and surroundings. In the mean-time the doctor would hasten arrangements to get poorIMethuen oat of town.-When Margot for the first time told her mother whatshe had told the doctor a half hour previously, MrsMethuen grew quite faint with joy. A heavenly vistaseemed to open before her. She even found herself lift-ing her child's hands to her poor pale lips and kissingthem. She did not offer to kiss her face."Understand me, mother," said the girl, drawingback ashamed at this unusual demonstration. " I amdoing this thing for my father. I had decided upon itwhen your last letter came to me in Venice, and at oncetold Mr. McPhail I would marry him some day, if onlyhe would give me time to be used to the idea.

That is all I exact. Now we have loads to do,packing and so on and shutting up this house, so stiryourself to think of that, and nothing else.""Mayn't I even tel you that there's been a letterfrom Julia to-day, saying she is going to make anothervisit in Fauquier, and needn't be home till the end ofiaigUSt.  The Tankervillee have invited her, thankeKfen.' And ther's somehing better. She's met Mr.8Staci   again at the Taakerviles and he has prospectsof a 'ldae in North Carolint with a decent salary; andhe's told bhr just to wait a little while and see.

PoorMaud and Jessy will go crazy with joy over Harmony,I expect, and as for me, that and your father's better-ment to-day, have made me ten years younger, I dodeclare."As the little procession wound up to the high groundon which the Hall stood, and Margot keeping ahead ofthe limp Maudnd Jessy, took in the full beauty andfinish of the scene, her heart swelled with an excitementthat was not altogether displeasing. All that McPhailhad told her about it in the Frari, was more than justi-fied by actuality. The ancient house had been made tolive again, was endued with all its old-time stateliness.Gardens, orchards, fields, uplands, forest, nestledaround it in the plentitude of summer's golden prime,the whole a "goodly heritage," linking past witpresent.Two servants, a man and a woman, quiet, discreetand pleasant of manner, were at the door to welcomeihem. These people had received their orders, and actedupon them strictly. The Methuens, whenever they sig-lied their intention of visiting the place were to be<pb n="236"/>23(     THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.treated as if it were still their own. Margot, first toarrive upon the threshold, was deferred to as the leaderof the party. When the bustle of transferring the in-valid to.the chamber where he had first seen light, wasacomplished successfully, and his nurse left in charge,. Mras Methuen with the young doctor and her daughtersfound awaiting them in the cool airy dining-room withits fittings of black oak, flowers looking in at the openwindows, such a daintily spread meal as had not formonths occurred to at least three of them as a possi-bility."It is so wonderful, my dears," cooed the mother."It is like fairy work, when I remember this roomas it was before we sold. Awfully shabby, yet nothingmuch seems changed, except their putting this lovelyTurkish rug in the middle of the floor, and polishingnp the furniture. There's old Aunt Kitty Davenant's'iode tea service behind the glass of the corner cup-board, Ill declare! In my time it was scattered allover the house, what the neroes had left of it. I'd noidea it would look so stylish brought together."Margot ate her clear soup, her sweetbread and broiledchicken feeling like a person who had .been gentlydrugged. When they had finished, while yet her mother<pb n="237"/>THE COUNT AND THE CONGRESSMAN.          237and the girls nibbled on with their ecstasies overeverything, she excused herself to go to her father'sroom. Finding the patient not only none the worse forhis transfer, but sleeping more quietly, she sent thenurse into the adjoining dressing-room where her trayhad been placed at her request."It is just beautiful how he's borne it," whisperedMiss Bellmap, smilingly as she went off on tiptoe."'Two or three quiet days in this sweet atmosphere andrll warrant we'll feel our minds at rest about him."Left with the beloved sufferer, Margot stood in her-strong and erect young beauty beside the old four-poster-bed with its tester of snowy netting, looking tenderlydown at this unconscious form. The green shutters ofall the windows save one were closed, leaving the roomin cool twilight. Through the aperture left by the bowedshutters of the window toward the river, came a wander-,ing breeze scented with mignonette.

Thingssubsequent had moved so rapidly; the shock of herfather's illness; the rushed voyage over; the terriblefortnight of hospital attendance in Washington, all hadcombined to dull and dim her impresions of the heav-enly weeks at Como.

She tried to speak, but failed.Neither could he speak and they stood silently, desper-ately, looking into each other's eyes till Margot re-gained her voice."Look over there !" she said sombrely, pointing toa glimpse of the mansion and gardens seen through anopening between verdant oak boughs.   "You don'tknow, perhaps, that not one inch of this land, one brickof the old house, nothing out or inside of it, is ours?Yet it is giving refuge to my poor father and mother, toall of us-and it is I who must pay the price."Presently, she resumed:"Is it shameful to tell you this  If so, you mustforgive me, for I could think of nothing to say to youhbt the truth.

It was getting toward the hour when shewas accustomed to relieve the nurse in sitting besideher father, and she told him so.

He had pushed his jour-ney to reach her earlier. The very stopping of hismachine at the front door had in it something master-.fu, menacing. She must face him without delay. She.yed that the courage of a brave race would notdesert her now.There was a moment's parley in the hall outside.She listened to McPhail's abrupt queries to the butlerand the man's low respectful answers, as to the where-abouts of the family. It passed through her mind thata gentleman would have sent to ask if she would receivehim.

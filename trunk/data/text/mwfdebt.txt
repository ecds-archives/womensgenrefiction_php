THE DEBTOR

CHAPTER I

<p>BANBRIDGE lies near enough to the great City to perceive after nightfall, along the southern horizon, the amalgamated glow of its multitudinous eyes of electric fire. In the daytime the smoke of its mighty breathing, in its race of progress and civilization, darkens the southern sky. The trains of great railroad systems speed between Banbridge and the City. Half the male population of Banbridge and a goodly proportion of the female have for years wrestled for their daily bread in the City, which the little village has long echoed, more or less feebly, though still quite accurately, with its own particular little suburban note.</p>
<p>Banbridge had its own "season," beginning shortly after Thanksgiving, and warming gradually until about two weeks before Lent, when it reached its high-water mark. All winter long there were luncheons and teas and dances. There was a whist club, and a flourishing woman's club, of course. It was the women who were thrown with the most entirety upon the provincial resources. But they were a resolved set, and they kept up the gait of progress of their sex with a good deal of success. They improved their minds and their bodies, having even a physical-culture club and a teacher coming weekly from the City. That there were links and a golf club goes without saying.</p>
<pb n="2     THE DEBTOR "/>

<p>It was spring, and golf had recommenced for some little time. Mrs. Henry Lee and Mrs. William Van Dor passed the links that afternoon.</p>
<p>The two ladies were being driven about Banbridge by Samson Rawdy, the best liveryman in Banbridge, in his best coach, with his two best horses. The horses, indeed, two fat bays, were considered as rather sacred to fashionable calls, as was the coach, quite a resplendent affair, with very few worn places in the cloth-lining.</p>
<p>Banbridge ladies never walked to make fashionable calls. They had a coach even for calls within a radius of a quarter of a mile, where they could easily have walked, and did walk on any other occasion. It would have shocked the whole village if a Banbridge woman had gone out in her best array, with her card-case, making calls on foot. Therefore, in this respect the ladies who were better off in this world's goods often displayed a friendly regard for those who could ill afford the necessary expense of state calls. Often one would invite another to call with her, defraying all the expenses of the trip, and Mrs. Van Dor had so invited Mrs. Lee to-day. Mrs. Lee, who was a small, elderly woman, was full of deprecating gratitude and a sense of obligation which made it appear incumbent upon her not to differ with her companion in any opinion which she might advance, and, as a rule, to give her the initiative in conversation during their calls, and the precedence in entry and retreat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dorn was as small as her companion, but with a confidence of manner which seemed to push her forward in the field of vision farther than her size warranted.</p>
<p>She was also highly corseted, and much trimmed over her shoulders, which gave an effect of superior size and weight; her face, too, was very full and rosy, while the
<pb n="3      THE DEBTOR"/>

other's was narrow and pinched at the chin and delicately transparent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor sat quite erect on the very edge of the seat, and so did Mrs. Lee. Each held her card-case in her two hands encased in nicely cleaned, white kid gloves. Each wore her best gown and her best bonnet. The coach was full of black velvet streamers, and lace frills and silken lights over precise knees, and the nodding of flowers and feathers.</p>
<p>There was, moreover, in the carriage a strong odor of Russian violet, which diffused itself around both the ladies. Russian violet was the calling perfume in vogue in Banbridge. It nearly overcame the more legitimate fragrance of the spring day which floated in through the open windows of the coach.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful day in May. The cherry-trees were in full bloom, and tremulous with the winged jostling of bees, and the ladies inhaled the sweetness intermingled with their own Russian violet in a bouquet of fragrance. It was warm, but there was the life of youth in the air; one felt the bound of the pulse of the spring, not its lassitude of passive yielding to the forces of growth.</p>
<p>The yards of the village homes, or the grounds, as they were commonly designated, were gay with the earlier flowering shrubs, almond and bridal wreath and Japanese quince. The deep scarlet of the quince-bushes was evident a long distance ahead, like floral torches. Constantly tiny wings flashed in and out the field of vision with insistences of sweet flutings. The day was at once redolent and vociferous.</p>
<p>"It is a beautiful day," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is beautiful," echoed Mrs. Lee, with fervor.</p>
<p>Her faded blue eyes, under the net-work of ingratiating wrinkles, looked aside, from self-consciousness, out of the coach window at a velvet lawn with a cherry-tree
<pb n="4     THE DEBTOR"/>

and a dark fir side by side, and a Japanese quince in the foreground.</p>
<p>After passing the house, both ladies began pluming themselves, carefully rubbing on their white gloves and asking each other if their bonnets were on straight.</p>
<p>"Your bonnet is so pretty," said Mrs. Lee, admiringly.</p>
<p>"It's a bonnet I have had two years, with a little bunch of violets and new strings," said Mrs. Van Dorn, with conscious virtue.</p>
<p>"It looks as if it had just come out of the store," said Mrs. Lee. She was vainly conscious of her own head-gear, which was quite new that spring, and distinctly prettier than the other woman's. She hoped that Mrs. Van Dorn would remark upon its beauty, but she did not. Mrs. Van Dor was a good woman, but she had her limitations when it came to admiring in another something that she had not herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee's superior bonnet had been a jarring note for her all the way. She felt in her inmost soul, though she would have been loath to admit the fact to herself, that a woman whom she had invited to make calls with her at her expense had really no right to wear a finer bonnet--that it was, to say the least, indelicate and tactless. Therefore she remarked, rather dryly, upon the beauty of a new pansy-bed beside the drive into which they now turned. The bed looked like a bit of fairy carpet in royal purples and gold.</p>
<p>"I call that beautiful," said Mrs. Van Dorn, with a slight emphasis on the that, as if bonnets were nothing; and Mrs. Lee appreciated her meaning.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is lovely," she said, meekly, as they rolled past and quite up to the front-door of the house upon whose mistress they were about to call.</p>
<p>"I wonder if Mrs. Morris is at home," said Mrs. Van Dorn, as she got a card from her case.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     5 "/>

<p>"I think it is doubtful, it is such a lovely day," said Mrs. Lee, also taking out a card.</p>
<p>Samson Rawdy threw open the coach door with a flourish and assisted the ladies to alight. He had a sensation of distinct reverence as the odor of Russian violet came into his nostrils.</p>
<p>"When them ladies go out makin' fashionable calls they have the best perfumery I ever seen," he was fond of remarking to his wife.</p>
<p>Sometimes he insisted upon her going out to the stable and sniffing in the coach by way of evidence, and she would sniff admiringly and unenviously. She knew her place. The social status of every one in Banbridge was defined quite clearly. Those who were in society wore their honors easily and unquestioned, and those who were not went their uncomplaining ways in their own humble spheres.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor and Mrs. Henry Lee, gathering up their silken raiment genteelly, holding their visiting-cards daintily, went up the front-door steps, and Mrs. Lee, taking that duty upon herself, since she was Mrs. Van Dorn's guest, pulled the door-bell, having first folded her handkerchief around her white glove.</p>
<p>"It takes so little to soil white gloves," said she, "and I think it is considerable trouble to send them in and out to be cleaned."</p>
<p>"I clean mine with gasolene myself," said Mrs. Van Dorn, with the superiority of a woman who has no need for such economies, yet practises them, over a woman who has need but does not.</p>
<p>"I never had much luck cleaning them myself," said Mrs. Lee, apologetically.</p>
<p>"It is a knack," admitted Mrs. Van Dor. Then they waited in silence, listening for an approaching footstep.</p>
<p>"If she isn't at home," whispered Mrs. Van Dorn,
<pb n="6     THE DEBTOR "/>

"we can make another call before the two hours are up." Mr. Rawdy was hired by the hour.</p>
<p>"Yes, we can," assented Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>Then they waited, and neither spoke. Mrs. Lee had occasion to sneeze, but she pinched her nose energetically and repressed it.</p>
<p>Suddenly both straightened themselves and held their cards in readiness.</p>
<p>"How does my bonnet look?" whispered Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor paid no attention, for then the door was opened and Mrs. Morris's maid appeared, with cap awry and her white apron over a blue-checked gingham which was plainly in evidence at the sides.</p>
<p>The ladies gave her their cards, and followed her into the best parlor, which was commonly designated in Banbridge as the reception-room. The best parlor was furnished with a sort of luxurious severity. There were a few pieces of staid old furniture of a much earlier period than the others, but they were rather in the background in the gloomy corners, and the new pieces were thrust firmly forward into greater evidence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor sat down on the corner of a fine velvet divan, and Mrs. Lee near her on the edge of a gold chair. Then they waited, while the maid retired with their cards. "It's a pretty room, isn't it?" whispered Mrs. Lee, looking about.</p>
<p>"Beautiful."</p>
<p>"She kept a few pieces of the old furniture that she had in her old house when this new one was built, didn't she?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I suppose she didn't feel as if she could buy all new."</p>
<p>The ladies studied all the furnishings of the room, keeping their faces in readiness to assume their calling expression at an instant's notice when the hostess should appear.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     7"/>

<p>"Did she have those vases on the mantel-shelf in the old house?" whispered Mrs. Lee, after a while; but Mrs. Van Dorn made a warning gesture, and instantly both ladies straightened themselves and looked pleasantly expectant, and Mrs. Morris appeared.</p>
<p>She was a short and florid woman, and her face was flushed a deep rose; beads of perspiration glistened on her forehead, her black hair clung to it in wet strands. In her expression polite greeting and irritation and intense discomfort struggled for mastery. She had been house-cleaning when the door-bell rang, and had hastened into her black skirt and black-and-white silk blouse. The blouse was buttoned wrong, and it did not meet the skirt in the back; and she had quite overlooked her neckgear, but of that she was pleasantly unconscious, also of the fact that there was a large black smooch beside her nose, giving her both a rakish and a sinister air.</p>
<p>"I am so glad to find you in," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"I was telling Mrs. Van Dorn that I was so afraid you would be out, it is such a lovely day," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"I am so glad I was in," responded Mrs. Morris, with effusion. "I should have been so disappointed to miss your call."</p>
<p>Then the ladies seated themselves, and the conversation went on. Overhead the maid could be heard heavily tramping. The carpet of that room was up, and the mistress and maid had planned to replace it before night; but the mistress held fast to her effusive air of welcome. It had never been fashionable or even allowable not to be at home when one was at home in Banbridge. When Banbridge ladies went abroad calling, in the coach, much was exacted. Mrs. Morris could never have held up her social head again had she fibbed, or bidden the maid fib--that is, if it had been discovered.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     8"/>

<p>"How lovely your house is, Mrs. Morris!" said Mrs. Van Dor, affably. The Morris house was only a year old, and had not yet been nearly exhausted as a topic of polite conversation.</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Mrs. Morris. "Of course there are things about the furnishings, but one cannot do everything in a minute."</p>
<p>"Now, my dear Mrs. Morris," said Mrs. Lee, "I think everything is sweet."</p> <p>Mrs. Lee said sweet with an effect as if she stamped hard to emphasize it. She made it long and extremely sibilant. Mrs. Lee always said sweet after that fashion.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course you would rather have all your furniture new, than part new and part old," said Mrs. Van Dor; "but, as you say, you can't do everything at once."</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dorn was inclined at times to be pugnaciously truthful, when she heard any one else lie. Her hostess looked uneasily at an old red velvet sofa in a dark corner, which was not so dark that a worn place along the front edge did not seem to glare at her. Nobody by any chance sat on that sofa and looked at the resplendent new one. They always sat on the new and faced the old. Mrs. Morris began absently calculating, while the conversation went on to other topics, if she could possibly manage a new sofa before summer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee asked if she knew if the new people in the Ranger place, "Willow Lake," were very rich? She said she had heard they were almost millionaires.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Morris. "Very rich indeed. Mr. Morris says he thinks they must be, from everything he hears."</p>
<p>"Of course it does not matter in one way or another whether they are rich or not," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," said Mrs. Van Dorn. "Of course nobody is going to say that money is everything,
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     9"/>

and of course everybody knows that good character is worth more than anything else, and yet I do feel as if folks with money can do so much if they have the will."</p>
<p>"I think that these new people are very generous with their money," said Mrs. Morris. "I heard they about supported the church in Hillfield, New York, where they used to live, and Captain Carroll has joined the Village Improvement Society, and he says he is very much averse to trading with any but the local tradesmen."</p>
<p>"What is he captain of?" inquired Mrs. Lee, who had at times a fashion of putting a question in a most fatuously simple and childish manner.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't suppose he is really captain of anything now," replied Mrs. Morris. "I don't know how he happened to be captain, but I suppose he must have been a captain in the regular army."</p>
<p>"I suppose he hasn't any business, he is so very rich?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes; he has something in the City. I dare say he does not do very much at it, but I presume he is an active man and does not want to be idle."</p>
<p>"Why didn't he stay in the army, then?" asked Mrs. Lee, clasping her small white kid hands and puckering her face inquiringly.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Perhaps that was too hard, or took him away too far. I suppose some of those army posts are pretty desolate places to live in, and perhaps his wife was afraid of the Indians."</p>
<p>"He's got a wife and family, I hear," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>Both calling ladies were leaning farther and farther towards Mrs. Morris with an absorption of delight. It was as if the three had their heads together over a honey-pot.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lee said he heard they had a fine turnout," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<pb n="10     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"Mrs. Peel told me that Mr. Peel said the horses never cost less than a thousand," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"A thousand!" repeated Mrs. Morris. "Mr. Morris  said horses like those were never bought under twenty-five hundred, and Mr. Morris is a pretty good judge of horse-flesh.</p>
<p>"Mr. Van Dor said Dr. Jerrolds told him that Captain Carroll told him he expected to keep an automobile, and was afraid the Ranger stable wouldn't be large enough," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"So I heard," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"I hear he pays a very large rent to Mr. Ranger--the largest rent he has ever got for that house," said Mrs. Morris.</p>
<p>"Well, I hear he pays fifty dollars a month."</p>
<p>"Why, he never got more than forty before!" said Mrs. Lee. "That is, I don't believe he ever did."</p>
<p>"I know he didn't," said Mrs. Morris, positively.</p>
<p>"Well, it is a handsome place," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is, but these new people aren't satisfied. They must have been used to pretty grand things where they came from. They want the stable enlarged, as I said before, and a box-stall. Mr. Carroll owns a famous trotter that he hasn't brought here yet, because he is afraid the stable isn't warm enough. I heard he wanted steam-heat out there, and a room finished for the coach-man, and hard-wood floors all over the house. They say he has two five-thousand-dollar rugs."</p>
<p>"The house is let furnished, I thought," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is, and the furniture is still there. The Carrolls don't want to bring on many of their own things till they are sure the house is in better order. I heard they talk of buying it."</p>
<p>"Do you know how much--" inquired Mrs. Van Dor, breathlessly, while Mrs. Lee leaned nearer, her
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     11"/>

eyes protruding, her small thin mouth open, and her white kid fingers interlacing.</p>
<p>"Well, I heard fifteen thousand."</p>
<p>Both callers gasped.</p>
<p>"Well, it is a great thing for Banbridge to have such people come here and buy real estate and settle, if they are the right sort," said Mrs. Van Dorn, rising to go; and Mrs. Lee followed her example, with a murmur of assent to the remark.</p>
<p>"Must you go?" said Mrs. Morris, with an undertone of joy, thinking of her carpet up-stairs, and rising with thinly veiled alacrity.</p>
<p>"Have you called?" asked Mrs. Van Dorn, moving towards the door, and gathering up her skirts delicately with her white kid fingers, preparatory to going down the steps. Mrs. Lee followed, also gathering up her skirts.</p>
<p>"No, I have not yet," replied Mrs. Morris, preceding them to the door and opening it for them, "but I intend to do so very soon. I have been pretty busy house-cleaning since they came, and that is only two weeks ago, but I am going to call."</p>
<p>"I think it is one's duty to call on new-comers, with a view to their church-going, if nothing else," said Mrs. Van Dorn, with a virtuous air.</p>
<p>"So do I," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Good-afternoon," said Mrs. Van Dorn. "What a beautiful day it is!"</p>
<p>Both ladies bade Mrs. Morris good-afternoon and she returned the salutation with unction. Both ladies looked fascinatedly to the last at the black smooch on her cheek as they backed out.</p>
<p>"I thought I should burst right out laughing every time I looked at her, in spite of myself," whispered Mrs. Lee, as they passed down the walk.</p>
<p>"So did I."</p>
<pb n="12     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"And no collar on!"</p>
<p>"Yes. She must have been house-cleaning."</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, I don't want to say disagreeable things, but really it doesn't seem to me that I would have been house-cleaning such an afternoon as this, when people were likely to be out calling."</p>
<p>"Well, I know I would not," said Mrs. Van Dorn, decidedly. "I should have done what I could in the morning, and left what I couldn't do till next day."</p>
<p>"So should I."</p>
<p>Samson Rawdy stood at the coach-door, and both ladies stepped in. Then he stood waiting expectantly for orders. The ladies looked at each other.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go next?" asked Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," said Mrs. Van Dorn, hesitatingly. "We were going to Mrs. Fairfield's next, but I am afraid there won't be time if--"</p>
<p>"It really seems to me that we ought to go to call on those new people," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Well, I think so too. I suppose there would be time if Mrs. Fairfield wasn't at home, and it is such a lovely day I doubt if she is, and it is on the way to the Carrolls'." She spoke with sudden decision to Samson Rawdy. "Drive to Mr. Andrew Fairfield's, and as fast as you can, please." Then she and Mrs. Lee leaned back as the coach whirled out of the Morris grounds.</p>
<p>It was only a short time before they wound swiftly around the small curve of drive before the Fairfield house. "There is no need of both of us getting out," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Don alighted and went swiftly with a tip-toeing effect upon the piazza-steps. She was seen to touch the bell. She waited a short space, and then she did not touch it again. She tucked the cards under the door-step, and hurried back to the carriage.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR    13"/>

<p>"I knew she wasn't at home," said she, in a whisper, "it is such a lovely day." She turned to Samson Rawdy, who stood holding open the coach-door. "Now you may drive to those new people who have moved into the Ranger place," said she, "Mrs. Carroll's."</p>
<pb n="14"/>
CHAPTER II

<p>THERE are days in spring wherein advance seems as passive as is the progress of a log down the race of a spring freshet. Then there are other days wherein it seems that every mote must feel to the full its sentient life, and its swelling towards development or fulfilment. On a day like the latter, everything and everybody bestirs. The dust motes spin in whirling columns, the gnats dance for their lives their dance of death before the wayfarer. The gardeners and the grave-diggers turn up the earth with energy, making the clods fly like water. The rich play, or work- that they may play, as do the poor. Everybody is up and wide awake and doing. The earth and the habitations thereof are rubbed, cleaned, and swept, or skylarked over; the boy plays with his marbles on the sidewalk or whoops over the fields; the housewives fling wide open their house windows, and the dust of the winter flies out like smoke; the tradesmen set out their new wares to public view, the bees make honey, the birds repeat their world-old nesting songs, the cocks crow straight through the day; nothing stops till the sun sets, and even then it is hard for such an ardent clock of life to quite run down.</p>
<p>It was that spirit of unrest which had sent the two ladies out making calls. There was not one where, if the womenkind were at home at all and not afield, but they had been possessed of the spring activity, until they reached the Ranger place, where the new-comers to Banbridge lived. The Ranger place was, in some respects
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     15"/>

the most imposing house in Banbridge. It stood well back from the road, in grounds which deserved the name. They were extensive, dotted with stately groups of spruces and pines, and there was in the rear of the house a pond with a rustic bridge, fringed with willows, which gave the place its name, "Willow Lake." The house had formerly been owned by two maiden women with much sentiment, the sisters of the present owner. The place was "Willow Lake." The pond was the "Willow Mere," in defiance of the name of the place. The little rustic bridge was the "Bridge of Sighs," for some obscure reason, perhaps buried in the sentimental past of the sisters. And the little hollow which was profusely sprinkled with violets in the sprirfg was "Idlewild." It was in "Idlewild" that the new family, perverse to the spirit of the day, idled when the callers drove up the road in the best coach.</p>
<p>There was in the little violet-sprinkled hollow a small building with many peaks as to its roof, and diamond-paned windows which had been fitted out with colored glass in a hideous checker-work of orange and crimson and blue, which the departed sisters had called, none but themselves knew why, "The Temple." On the south side grew a rose-bush of the kind which flourished most easily in the village, taking most kindly to the soil. It was an ordinary kind of rose. The sisters had called it an eglantine, but it was not an eglantine. They had been very fond, when the weather permitted, of sitting in this edifice with their work. The place was fitted up with a rustic table and two quite uncomfortable rustic chairs, particularly uncomfortable for the sisters, who were of a thin habit of body.</p>
<p>When James Ranger, who was himself not a man of sentiment, showed the new aspirant for the renting of the place this fantastic building, he spoke of it with a species of apology.</p>
<pb n="16     THE DEBTOR "/>

<p>"My sisters had this built," said he, "and it cost considerable," for he did not wish to disparage the money value of anything.</p>
<p>When the family were established in their new home, one of the first things which they did--they signifying Mrs. Carroll, Miss Anna Carroll, the daughters Miss Ina and Miss Charlotte Carroll, and the son Edward Carroll, called Eddy by the family--was to march in a body upon the little "Temple," and, armed with stones, proceed with shouts of merriment to smash out every spear of the crimson and orange and blue glass in the windows. They then demolished the rustic furniture and made of that a noble bonfire. Mrs. Carroll had indeed wondered, between fits, of laughter, in her sweet drawl, if they ought to destroy the furniture, as it could not be said, strictly speaking, to belong to them to destroy, but she was promptly vetoed by all the others in merry chorus.</p>
<p>"They are too hideous to live," said Ina; "they ought to be burned. It is our plain duty to burn them."</p>
<p>Therefore they burned them, and brought out some of the parlor chairs to replace them. Then Eddy was sent to Rosenstein's, the village dry-goods store of Banbridge, for yards of green mosquito netting, which, the Carroll credit being newly established with a blare of trumpets, he purchased. Then they had tacked up the green mosquito netting over the window and door gaps, for they had forcibly wrenched the ornate door from its hinges and added it to the bonfire, and the temple of the Muses stood in a film of gently undulating green under the green willows, and was rather a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>The Carrolls loved to pass away the time in that retreat veiled with cloudy green, through which they could see the dull glimmer, of the pond, like an old shield of silver, reflecting the waving garlands of the willows, which at that time of year were as beautiful as trees of heaven,
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      17"/>

having effects of waving lines of liquid green light, and the charming violet-blue turf around them.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the call all the female members of the Carroll family were out there. Captain Carroll was in the City, and Eddy, who, being a boy, was more susceptible to the lash of atmospheric influence, had gone fishing.</p>
<p>"I wonder why Eddy likes to go fishing," said Mrs. Carroll, in her sweet drawl. "Eddy never caught anything."</p>
<p>"You don't have a very high opinion of your son's powers as a fisherman, Amy," said Ina, and they all laughed. The Carrolls were an easy-to-laugh family, and always seemed to find delicious humor in one another's remarks.</p>
<p>"Amy never thinks any of us can catch anything," said Charlotte, the younger daughter, and they all laughed again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carroll was always Amy in her family. Never did one of her children address her as a parent.</p>
<p>They were a charming group in the little, green, gloomy place, each with the strongest possible family likeness to the others. They were as much alike as the roses on one bush; all were, although not tall, long, and slim of body, and childishly round of face, with delicate coloring; all had pathetic dark eyes and soft lengths of dark hair. Mrs. Carroll and her husband's sister, although not nearly related (Mrs. Carroll had married her many-times-removed cousin), resembled each other as if they had been sisters of one family, and the children resembled their mother. The only difference among any of them was a slight difference of expression that existed mostly in the youngest girl, Charlotte. There were occasions when Charlotte Carroll's expression of soft and pathetic wistfulness and pleading could change to an expression of defiance, almost fierceness.</p>
<pb n="18     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Her mother often told her that she resembled in disposition her paternal grandmother, who had been a woman of high temper, albeit a great beauty.</p>
<p>"Charlotte, dear, you are just like your grandmother, dear Arthur's mother, who was the worst-tempered and loveliest woman in Kentucky," Mrs. Carroll often remarked. She scarcely sounded the t in Kentucky, since she also was of the South, where the languid air tends to produce elisions. The Carrolls came originally from Kentucky, and had lived there until after the births of the two daughters. When they were scarcely more than infants, Arthur Carroll had experienced the petty and individual, but none the less real, cataclysm of experience which comes to most men sooner or later. It is the earthquake of a unit, infinitesimal, but entirely complete of its kind, and possibly as far-reaching in its thread of consequences. Arthur Carroll had had his palmy days, when he was working with great profits, and, as he believed, with entire righteousness and regard to his fellow-men, a coal-mine in the Kentucky mountains. He had inherited it from his father, as the larger part of his patrimony. When most of the property had been dissipated, at the time of the civil war, the elder Carroll, who was broken by years and reverses, used often to speak of this unimproved property of his, to his son Arthur, who was a young boy at the time. Anna, who was a mere baby, was the only other child.</p>
<p>"When you are a man, Arthur," he was fond of remarking--"when you are a man, you must hire some money, sell what little is left here, if necessary, and work that coal-mine. I always meant to do it myself, and reckon I should have, if that damned war had not taken the money and the strength out of the old man. But when you are a man, Arthur, you must work that mine, and you must build up what the war has torn down. You can buy back and restore, Arthur, and if
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     19"/>

the South should get back her rights by that time, as she may, why, then, you can stock up the old place again, and go on as your father did."</p>
<p>The old man, who was gouty and full of weary chills of body and mind, used to sit in the sun and dream, to his faint solace, until Arthur was a grown man and through college, and Anna a young girl at school near by. The little that had been left, with the bare exception of the home estate, the plantation, and the mine, had been sold to pay for Arthur's education. Arthur had been out of college only one summer when his father died. His mother, whose proud spirit had fretted the flesh from her bones and drunk up her very blood with futile rage and repining, had died during the war. Then Arthur, who had control of everything, as his sister's guardian, set to work to carry out his father's cherished dream with regard to the coal-mine. He sold every foot of the estate to a neighboring planter, an old friend of his father's, at a sacrifice, with a condition attached that he should have the option of buying it back for cash, at an advanced price, at the end of five years. The purchaser, who was a shrewd sort, of Scotch descent, curiously grafted on to an impetuous, hot-blooded Southern growth, looked at the slim young fellow with his expression of ingenuous almost fatuous confidence in his leading-strings of fate, and considered that he was safe enough and had made a good bargain. He too had suffered from the war, in more ways than one. He had come out of the strife shorn in his fleece of worldly wealth and mutilated as to his body. He limped stiffly on a wooden leg, and his fine buildings had gone up in fire and smoke. But during the years since the war he had retrieved his fortunes. People said he was worth more than before; everything he had handled had prospered. He was one of those men whose very touch seems to multiply possessions. He was a much younger

man than Arthur's father, and robust at the time of his death. He explained to Arthur that he was doing him an incalculable service in purchasing his patrimonial estate, when he announced his decision so to do, after taking several weeks to conceal his alacrity.</p>
<p>"It is not everybodee would take a propertee, with such a condeetion attached, Arthur, boy," he said. He had at times a touch of the Scotch in his accent. His father had been straight from the old country when he married the planter's daughter. "Not everybodee, with such a condeetion," he repeated, and the boy innocently believed him. He had been used, ever since he was a child and could remember anything, to seeing a good deal of the man. The Southern wife had died early and the man had been lonely and given to frequent friendly meetings with Mr. Carroll, who had valued him.</p>
<p>"He's the right sort, Arthur," he had often told the boy; "you can depend on him. He has given his gold and his flesh and blood for the South, although he came on one side of another race and might have sided against us. He's the right sort."</p>
<p>So the Scotch-Southern planter had been one of the bearers at the old Carroll's funeral, and the son, when he had formulated his business schemes, had gone to this friend with them, and with his proposal for the sale of the Carroll property. The boy, who was honorable to the finish, had been loath to ask, in the then reduced state of the property, for a loan on mortgage to the extent which he would require; therefore he proposed this conditional sale as offering rather better, or at least more evident, security, and he regarded it in his own mind as practically amounting to the same thing. He was as sure of his being able to purchase back his own, should he secure the necessary funds; as he would have been of paying up the mortgage. The advance price would about twice cover the interest at a goodly rate,
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     21"/>

had the affair been conducted on the mortgage basis. Arthur himself had proposed that, and "I will of course pay for any improvements you may have made in the mean time," he said. There was nothing in the least mean or ungenerous about Arthur Carroll. He meant, on the whole, rather more squarely to his fellow-men than to himself.</p>
<p>Then with the money obtained from the sale of his patrimony he went to work on his coal-mine. A very trifle of a beginning had been made on it before the war, so he had not actually to break the first ground. The previous owner had died bankrupt from lack of capital, and his minor daughter had inherited it. It was from the minor daughter that the elder Carroll had purchased it, partly with a view to assisting the child, who had been left penniless except for the mine, at the death of her father, who was of a distant branch of Carroll's own family. With the proceeds of the sale the girl was supported and educated; then she lost the remainder through the dishonesty of her guardian. That was the year after young Carroll began to work the mine. Then he married her. She was a beautiful girl, and helpless as a flower. He married her without a cent to support her except the old coal-mine, and he worked as hard and bravely as a man could. And he prospered, to the utter amazement of everybody who watched him, and who had prophesied failure from the start. In four years he was looked upon with respect. People said he was fast getting rich. He went to the man who had bought the Carroll place, at the end of the four years, with the money in his hand and proposed purchasing it. He had not a doubt, such was his trust in the friendliness of the man, that he would gladly consent and pat him on the back with fatherly affection for his success; but, to his amazement, he was refused, although still under the guise of the purest philanthropy.</p>
<pb n="22     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"No, Arthur, boy," he said. "It is best for you to keep the money in your business awhile longer. It will not do, in a big undertaking like a mine, for you to be creepled. No, Arthur, boy, wait until the next year is up. It is for your good."</p>
<p>In vain Arthur offered an advance upon the original advance price. "No, Arthur, boy," he repeated.</p>
<p>"No, Arthur, boy," he continued to repeat. "It is not wise for you to be creepled in your business."</p>
<p>Arthur protested that he would not be crippled, but with no avail. He went away disappointed, and yet with his faith unshaken. He did not know what transpired later on, that negotiations which would materially enhance the value of the property were being carried on with a railroad by the planter, who was himself one of the railroad directors.</p>
<p>About six months after Arthur's attempt to purchase back his ancestral acres, and while he was at high tide of a small prosperity, this same man came to him with a proposal for him to furnish on contract a large quantity of coal to this same railroad. Arthur jumped at the chance. The contract was drawn up by a lawyer in the nearest town and signed. Arthur, trusting blindly to the honesty and good-will of everybody, had hurried for his train without seeing more than that the stipulated rates had been properly mentioned in the contract. His wife was ill; in fact, Charlotte was only a few days old, and he was anxious and eager to be home. There had been no strikes at that period in that vicinity, and indeed comparatively few in the whole country. Arthur would almost as soon have thought of guarding in his contract against an earthquake; but the strike clause was left out, and there was a strike. In consequence he was unable to fill the contract without ruin, and he was therefore ruined. In the end the old friend of his father, who had purchased his patrimony, remained in
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     23"/>

undisputed possession of it, with an additional value of several thousands from the passage of the railroad through one end of the plantation, and had, besides, the mine. Arthur had sold the mine at a nominal price to pay his debts, to a third party who represented this man. He had been left actually penniless with a wife and two babies to support, but as his pocket became empty his very soul had seemed to become full to over-flowing with the rage and bitterness of his worldly experience. He had learned that the man whom he had trusted had instigated the strike; he learned about the railroad deal. One night he went to his plantation with a shot-gun. He approached the house which had formerly been his own home, where the man was living then. He fully intended to shoot him. He had not a doubt but he should do it, and he had always considered that he should have carried out his purpose had not an old horse which the man had purchased with the estate, and which was loose on the lawn, from some reason or other, whinnied eagerly, and sidled up to him, and thrust her nose over his shoulder. He had been used, when a boy, to feed her sugar, and she remembered. Arthur went away through the soft Southern moonlight without shooting the man. Somehow it was because of the horse, and he never knew why it was. The old childish innocence and happiness seemed to flood over him in a light of spirit which dimmed the moonlight and swept away the will for murder from his soul. But the bitterness and the hate of the man who had wronged him never left him. The next day he went North, and the man in possession breathed more easily, for he had had secret misgivings.</p>
<p>"You had better look out," another man had said to him. "You have trodden on the toes of a tiger when ,you have trodden on the toes of a Carroll. Sooner or later you will have to pay for it."</p>
<pb n="24     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>No one in the little Kentucky village knew what had become of Arthur Carroll for some time, with the exception of an aunt of Mrs. Carroll's, who was possessed of some property and who lived there. She knew, but she told nothing, probably because she had a fierce pride of family. After years the Carroll girls, Ina and Charlotte, had come back to their father's birthplace and attended a small school some three miles distant from the village, a select young ladies' establishment at which their mother had been educated, and they had visited rather often at their great-aunt Catherine's. After they had finished school, the great-aunt had paid the bills, although nobody knew it, not even the elderly sisters who kept the school, since the aunt lied and stated that Captain Carroll had sent the money. Arthur Carroll was called captain then, and nobody knew why, least of all Carroll himself. Suddenly he had been called captain, and after making a disclaimer or two at first, he had let it go; it was a minor dishonesty, and forced upon him in a measure. The old aunt calmly stated that he had joined the army, been rapidly promoted, and had resigned. People laughed a little, but not to her face. Besides, she had stated that Arthur was a very rich man, and much thought of among the Yankees, and nobody was in a position to disprove that. Certainly when the feminine Carrolls visited in the old place, their appearance carried out the theory of riches. They were very well dressed, and they looked well fed, with that placid, assured air which usually comes only from the sense of possession.</p>
<p>The feminine Carrolls had been speaking of this old aunt that spring day as they sat idly in the little green-curtained temple beside the pond. They had indulged in a few low, utterly gentle, and unmalicious laughs of reminiscence at some of her eccentricities; then they had agreed that she was a good old soul, and said no more of her, but gazed with languorous delight at the
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     25"/>

spring scene misty with green and rose and gold like the smoke of some celestial fire.</p>
<p>Through the emerald dazzle of the trailing willow-boughs could be seen a small, blooming apple-tree, and a bush full of yellow flowers. Miss Anna Carroll and Ina held books in their laps, but they never looked in them. They were all very well dressed and they wore quite a number of fine jewels on their hands and at their necks, particularly Mrs. Carroll. Her stones, though only of the semi-precious kind, were very beautiful, amethysts which had belonged to a many-times-removed creole grandmother of hers, and the workmanship of whose fine setting dated back to France, and there was a tradition of royal ownership. Mrs. Carroll had a bracelet, a ring, a brooch, and a necklace. The stones, although deeply tinted, showed pink now instead of purple. In fact, they seemed to match the soft, rose-tinted India silk which she wore.</p>
<p>"Amy's amethysts match colors like chamellons," said Ina. "Look how pink they are."</p>
<p>"Lovely," said Charlotte, gazing admiringly. "The next time I go to a dance, you promised I should wear the necklace, Amy, dear."</p>
<p>"You will not go to a dance for a long time in Banbridge, sweet, I fear," said Mrs. Carroll, with loving commiseration.</p>
<p>"Somebody will call soon, and we shall be asked to something," said Charlotte, with conviction.</p>
<p>"Nobody has called yet," Ina said.</p>
<p>"We have only been here three weeks," said Miss Anna Carroll, who was a beautiful woman, and, but for a certain stateliness of carriage, might have seemed but little older than her elder niece.</p>
<p>"Somebody may be calling this afternoon," said Ina, "and the maid has gone out, and we should not know they called."</p>
<pb n="26     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"Oh, let them leave their cards," said Mrs. Carroll, easily. "That is the only way to receive calls, and make them. If one could only know when people would be out, but not have them know you knew, always--that would be lovely--and if one only knew when they were coming, so one could always be out--that would be lovelier still." Mrs. Carroll had a disjointed way of speaking when she essayed a long speech, that had almost an infantile effect.</p>
<p>"Amy, how very ungracious of you, dear," said Miss Anna Carroll. "You know you always love people when you really do meet them."</p>
<p>"Oh yes," replied Amy, "I know I love them."</p>
<p>Meantime, Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Van Dorn were ringing the door-bell of the Carroll house. They rang the bell and waited, and nobody came.</p>
<p>"Did you ring the bell?" asked Mrs. Van Dorn, anxiously.</p>
<p>"I thought I did. I pressed the button very hard."</p>
<p>"I didn't hear it. I think you had better ring again."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee obediently pressed the bell again, and then both ladies heard distinctly the far-away tinkle in the depths of the house.
<p>"I heard that," said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Yes, so did I. It rang that time."</p>
<p>Then the ladies waited again.</p>
<p>"Suppose you ring again," said Mrs. Van Dor, and Mrs. Lee rang again. Then they waited again, straining their ears for the slightest sound in the house.</p>
<p>"I am afraid they are out," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"So am I. It is such a lovely afternoon."</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dorn, after they had waited a short time, put out her hand with a decisive motion, and rang the bell yet again.</p>
<p>"I'm going to make sure they are not at home," said she, "for I don't know when I shall get out calling
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     27"/>

again, and I always feel as if it was my duty to call on new-comers in the village pretty soon after they move in."</p>
<p>Then they waited again, but no one came. Once Mrs. Lee started and said she was sure she heard some one coming, but it was only the rumble of a train at a station two miles away.</p>
<p>"Shall we leave our cards?" said Mrs. Lee. "I don't suppose there is much use in waiting any longer, or ringing again."</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dorn, who had been staring intently at the door, looked quickly at her companion with a curious expression. Her face had flushed.</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Mrs. Lee. "You don't suppose any one is in there and not coming to the door?" Mrs. Lee had a somewhat suspicious nature.</p>
<p>"No; I don't think there is a soul in that house, but--"</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, only--"</p>
<p>"Only what?"</p>
<p>"Why, don't you see what they have done?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid I don't quite know what you mean," Mrs. Lee returned, in a puzzled way. It was quite evident that Mrs. Van Dor wished her to grasp some thing which her own mind had mastered, that she wished it without further explanation, and Mrs. Lee felt bewilderedly apologetic that she could not comply.</p>
<p>"Don't you see that they have gone off and left the front door unlocked?" said Mrs. Van Dor, with inflections of embarrassment, eagerness, and impatience. If she and Mrs. Lee had been, as of yore, school-children together, she would certainly have said, "You ninny!" to finish.</p>
<p>"Why!" returned Mrs. Lee, with a sort of gasp. She saw then that the front door was not only unlocked,
<pb n="28      THE DEBTOR"/>

but slightly ajar. "Do you suppose they really are not at home?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Of course they are not at home."</p>
<p>"Would they go away and leave the front door unlocked?"</p>
<p>"They have."</p>
<p>"They might be in the back part of the house, and not have heard the bell," Mrs. Lee said, with a curious tone, as if she replied to some unspoken suggestion.</p>
<p>"I know this house as well as I do my own. You know how much I used to be here when the Ranger girls were alive. There is not a room in this house where anybody with ears can't hear the bell."</p>
<p>Still, Mrs. Van Dorn spoke in that curiously ashamed and indignant voice. Mrs. Lee contradicted her no further.</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose you must be right," said she. "There can't be anybody at home; but it is strange they went off and did not even shut the front door."</p>
<p>"I don't know what the Ranger girls would have said, if they knew it. They would have had a fit at the bare idea of going away for ever so short a time, and leaving the house and furniture alone and the door unlocked."</p>
<p>"Their furniture is here now, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so-some of it, anyway, but I don't know how much furniture these people bought, of course."</p>
<p>"Mr. Lee said he heard they had such magnificent things."</p>
<p>"I heard so, but you hear a good deal that isn't so in Banbridge!"</p>
<p>"That is true. I suppose you knew the house and the Ranger girls' furniture so well that you could tell at a glance what was new and what wasn't?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I could."</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     29"/>

<p>As with one impulse both women turned and peered through a green maze of trees and bushes at Samson Rawdy, several yards distant.</p>
<p>"Can you see him?" whispered Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Yes. I think he's asleep. He is sitting with his head all bent over."</p>
<p>"He is-not-looking?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Van Dor regarded each other. Both looked at once ashamed and defiant before the other, then into each pair of eyes leaped a light of guilty understanding and perfect sympathy. There are some natures for whom curiosity is one of the master passions, and the desire for knowledge of the affairs of others can become a lust, and Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Van Dor were of the number. Mrs. Van Dor gave her head in her best calling-bonnet a toss, and the violets, which were none too securely fastened, nodded loosely; then she thrust her chin forward, she sniffed like a hunting-hound on the scent, pushed open the front-door, and entered, with Mrs. Lee following. As Mrs. Van Dor entered, the violets on her bonnet became quite detached and fell softly to the floor of the porch, but neither of the ladies noticed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee, in particular, had led a monotonous life, and she had a small but intense spirit which could have weathered extremes. Now her faculties seemed to give a leap; she was afraid, but there was distinct rapture in her fear. She had not been so actively happy since she was a child and had been left at home with the measles one Sunday when the rest of the family had gone to church, and she had run away and gone wading in the brook, at the imminent risk not only of condign punishment, but of the measles striking in. She felt now just as then, as if something terrible and mysterious were striking in, and she fairly smacked her soul over it.</p>
<pb n="30     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Mrs. Lee no longer shrank; she stood up straight; she also thrust her chin forward; her nose sharpened, her blue eyes contracted under her light brows. She even forgot her r&ocirc;le of obligation, and did not give Mrs. Van Dor the precedence; she actually pushed before her. Mrs. Van Dor had closed the front door very softly, and they stood in a long, narrow hall, with an obsolete tapestry carpet, and large-figured gold and white paper revealing its gleaming scrolls in stray patches of light. Mrs. Lee went close to an old-fashioned black-walnut hat-tree, the one article of furniture besides a chair in the hall.</p>
<p>"Was this theirs?" she whispered to Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor nodded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee deliberately removed the nice white kid glove from her right hand, and extending one small taper forefinger, rubbed it over the surface of the black-walnut tree; then she pointed meaningly at the piece of furniture, which plainly, even in the half-light, disclosed an unhousewifely streak. She also showed the dusty forefinger to the other lady, and they both nodded with intense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Lee folded her silk skirts tightly around her and lifted them high above her starched white petticoat lest she contaminate them in such an untidy house; Mrs. Van Dor followed her example, and they tip-toed into the double parlors. They were furnished, for the most part, with the pieces dating back to the building of the house, in one of the ugliest eras of the country, both in architecture and furniture. The ceilings in these rather small square rooms were so lofty that one was giddy with staring at the elaborate cornices and the plaster centrepieces. The mantels were all of massively carved marble, the windows were few and narrow, the doors multitudinous, and lofty enough for giants. The parlor floor was carpeted with tapestry in
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      31"/>

enormous designs of crimson roses, in deliriums of arabesques, though there were a few very good Eastern rugs. The furniture was black-walnut, upholstered in crimson plush; the tables had marble tops; the hangings were lace under heavily fringed crimson lambrequins dependent from massive gilt mouldings. There were a bronze clock and a whatnot and a few gilt-framed oil-paintings of the conventional landscape type, contemporary with the furniture in American best parlors. Still, there were a few things in the room which directly excited comment on the part of the visitors. Mrs. Lee pointed at some bronzes on the shelf.</p>
<p>"Those are theirs, aren't they?" said she.</p>
<p>"Yes, the Ranger girls had some very handsome Royal Worcester vases. I guess James Ranger saw to it that those weren't left here."</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor eyed the bronzes with outward respect, but she did not admire them. Banbridge ladies, as a rule, unless they posed, did not admire bronzes. She also viewed with some disapproval a number of exquisite little Chinese ivory carvings on the whatnot.</p>
<p>"Those are theirs," said she. "The Ranger girls had some handsome bound books and a silver card-receiver, and a bust of Clytie on top of the whatnot. I suppose these are very expensive; I have always heard so. I never priced any, but it always seemed to me that they hardly showed the money."</p>
<p>"I suppose they have afternoon tea," said Mrs. Lee, regarding a charming little inlaid tea-table, decked with Dresden.</p>
<p>"Perhaps so," replied Mrs. Van Dor, doubtfully. "But I have noticed that when tea-tables are so handsome, folks don't use them. They are more for show. That cloth is beautiful."</p>
<p>"There is a tea-stain on it," declared Mrs. Lee, pointing triumphantly.</p>
<pb n="32     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"That is so," assented;Mrs. Van Dor. "They must use it."  She looked hard at the stain on the tea-cloth. "It's a pity to get tea on such a cloth as that," said she. "It will never come out."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't believe that will trouble them much," said Mrs. Lee, with soft maliciousness. She indicated with the pointed toe of her best calling-shoe, a hole in the corner of the resplendent Eastern rug.</p>
<p>"Oh," returned Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>"I know it is considered desirable to have these Oriental things worn," said Mrs. Lee, "but there is no sense in letting an expensive rug like this wear out, and no good house-keeper would."</p>
<p>"Well, I agree with you," said Mrs. Van Dorn.</p>
<p>Presently they passed on to the other rooms. They made a long halt in the dining-room.</p>
<p>"That must be their solid silver," said Mrs. Van Dorn, regarding rather an ostentatious display on the side-board.</p>
<p>"The idea of going away and leaving all that silver, and the doors unlocked!" said Mrs. Lee.</p>
<p>"Evidently they are people so accustomed to rich things that they don't think of such risks," said Mrs. Van Dor, with a curious effect of smacking her lips over possessions of her own, instead of her neighbors. She in reality spoke from the heights of a small but solid silver service, and a noble supply of spoons, and Mrs. Lee knew it.</p>
<p>"I suppose they must have perfectly beautiful table-linen," remarked Mrs. Lee, with a wistful glance at the sideboard-drawers.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so," assented Mrs. Van Dorn, with a half-sigh. Her eyes also on the closed drawers of the sideboard, were melancholy, but there was a line which neither woman could pass. They could pry about another woman's house in her absence, but they shrank
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     33"/>

from opening her drawers and investigating her closets. They respected all that was covered from plain sight. Up-stairs it was the same. Things were strewn about rather carelessly, therefore they saw more than they would otherwise have done, but the closet-doors and the bureau-drawers happened to be closed, and those were inviolate.</p>
<p>"If all their clothes are as nice as these, they must have wardrobes nicer than any ever seen in Banbridge," said Mrs. Lee, fingering delicately a lace-trimmed petticoat flung over a chair in one of the bedrooms. "This is real lace, don't you think so, Mrs. Van Dor?"</p>
<p>"I don't think. I know," replied Mrs. Van Dorn. "They must have elegant wardrobes, and they must be very wealthy people. They--" Suddenly Mrs. Van Dorn cut her remarks short. She turned quite pale and clutched at her companion's silk-clad arm.</p>
<p>"Hush!" she whispered. "What was that?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Lee, herself ashy white, looked at her. Both had distinctly heard a noise. Now they heard it again. The sound was that of footsteps, evidently those of a man, in the lower hall.</p>
<p>"What shall we do? Oh, what shall we do?" said Mrs. Lee, in a thin whisper. She trembled so that she could scarcely stand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor, trying to speak, only chattered. She clutched Mrs. Lee harder.</p>
<p>"Is there a back staircase? Oh, is there?" whispered Mrs. Lee. "Is there?"  The odor of a cigar stole softly through the house. "I can smell his cigar," whispered Mrs. Lee, in an agony.</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor pulled herself together. She nodded, and began pulling Mrs. Lee tow<p>
"Oh," panted Mrs. Lee, "anything except being caught up-stairs in their bedrooms! They might think--anything."</p>
<pb n="34     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"Hurry!" hissed Mrs. Van Dor. They could hear the footsteps very distinctly, and the cigar-smoke made them want to cough. Holding their silk skirts like twisted ropes around them so they should not rustle, still clinging closely one to the other, the two women began slowly moving, inch by inch, through the upper hall, towards the back stairs. These they descended in safety, and emerged on the lower hall.</p>
<p>They were looking for a rear door, with the view of a stealthy egress and a skirting of the bushes on the lawn unobserved until they should gain the shelter of the carriage, when there was a movement at their backs, and a voice observed, "Good-afternoon, ladies," and they turned, and there was Captain Arthur Carroll. He was a man possibly well over forty, possibly older than that, but his face was as smooth as a boy's, and he was a man of great stature, with nevertheless a boyish cant to his shoulders. Captain Arthur Carroll was a very handsome man, with a viking sort of beauty. He was faultlessly dressed in one of the lightest of spring suits and a fancy waistcoat, and he held quite gracefully the knot of violets which had fallen from Mrs. Van Dor's bonnet.</p>
<p>The two stood before him, gasping, coloring, trembling. For both of them it was horrible. All their lives they had been women who had held up their heads high in point of respectability and more. None was above them in Banbridge, no shame of wrong-doing or folly had ever been known by either of them, and now both their finely bonneted heads were in the dust. They stood before this handsome, courteously smiling gentleman and were conscious of a very nakedness of spirit. Their lust of curiosity was laid bare, they were caught in the act. Mrs. Van Dor opened her mouth, she tried to speak, but she only made a strange, croaking sound. Her face was now flaming. But Mrs. Lee was pale, and she stood rather unsteadily.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     35"/>

<p>Arthur Carroll at first looked merely bewildered. "Aren't the ladies at home?" said he. "Have you seen the ladies?" He glanced at Mrs. Van Dorn's deflowered bonnet, and extended the bunch of violets. "Yours, I think," he said. Mrs. Van Dor took them with an idiotic expression, and he asked again if they had seen the ladies.</p>
<p>The spectacle of two elderly, well-dressed females of Banbridge quaking before him in this wise, and of their sudden appearance in his house, was a mystery too great to be grasped at once even by a clever man, and he was certainly a clever man. So he stared for a second, while the two remained standing before him, holding their card-cases in their shaking, white-gloved fingers, and Mrs. Van Dorn with the violets; then suddenly an expression of the most delighted comprehension and amusement overspread his face.</p>
<p>"Oh," he said, politely, with a great flourish, as it were of deference, "the ladies are not in. They will be exceedingly sorry to have missed your call. But will you not come in and sit down?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Van Dor gained voice enough to gasp that she thought they must go. Captain Carroll stood back, and the two women, pressing closely together, tottered through the hall towards the front door.</p>
<p>Captain Carroll followed, beaming with delighted malice. "I hope you will call again, when the ladies are home," he said to Mrs. Van Dor, whom he recognized as the leader.</p>
<p>She made an inarticulate attempt at "Thank you." She was making for the door, like a scared hare to the entrance of its cover.</p>
<p>"But I have not your names, ladies, that I may inform Mrs. Carroll who has called?" said Captain Carroll, in his stingingly polite voice.</p>
<pb n="36     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Both women looked over their shrinking shoulders at him at that. Suddenly the hideous consequences of it all, the afterclap, sounded in their ears. That was the end of their fair fame in Banbridge, in their world. Life for them was over. Their faces, good, motherly, elderly village faces, after all, were pitiful; the shame in them was a shame to see, so ignominious was it. They stood convicted of such a mean fault, that the shame was the meaner also.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mr. Carroll's face changed. It became broadly comprehensive, so generously lenient that it was fairly grand. A certain gentleness also was evident, his voice was kind.</p>
<p>"Never mind, ladies," said Arthur Carroll. "There is really very little use in your telling me your names, because my memory is so bad. I remember neither names nor faces. If I should meet you on the street, and should fail to recognize you on that account, I trust that you will pardon me. And--" said Captain Carroll, "on that account, I will not say anything about your call to the ladies of my family; I should be sure to get it all wrong. We will wait, and trust that you will find them at home the next time you call. Good-afternoon, ladies." Captain Carroll had further mercy. He allowed the ladies to leave the house unattended and to dive desperately into the waiting coach.</p>
<p>"Home at once," Mrs. Van Dorn cried, hoarsely, to Samson Rawdy, waking from his nap in some bewilderment.</p>
<p>Captain Carroll was standing on the porch with a compound look of kindest pity and mirth on his face when the Carroll ladies came strolling round that way from the pond. He kissed them all, as was his wont; then he laughed out inconsequently.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at, dear?" asked Amy.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      37"/>

<p>"At my thoughts, sweetheart."</p>
<p>"What are your thoughts, daddy?" asked Charlotte.</p>
<p>"Thoughts I shall never tell anybody, honey," he replied, with another laugh. And Captain Arthur Carroll never did tell.</p>

CHAPTER III

<p>HISTORY often repeats itself where one would least expect it, and the world-old tide of human nature has a way of finding world-old channels. Therefore it happened in Banbridge, as in ancient times, that there was a learned barber, or perhaps, to be more strictly accurate, a barber who thought that he was learned. He would have been entirely ready, had his customers coincided with his views, to have given his striped pole its old signification of the ribbon bandage which bound the arm of a patient after bleeding, and added surgery to his hair-cutting and his beard-shaving. John Flynn had the courage of utter conviction as to his own ability to master all undertakings at which he chose to tilt. An aspiration once conceived, he never parted with, but held to it as a part of his life. Non-realization made not the slightest difference. His sense of time as a portion of eternity never left him, and therefore his patience under tardy fulfilment of his desires never faltered. Some ten years before, he decided that he would at some earlier or later date become mayor of Banbridge, and his decision was still impregnable. After every new election of another candidate, he begged his patrons for their votes another time, and was not in the least disturbed nor daunted that they had failed in their former promises. Flynn's good-nature was as unfaltering as his self-esteem, perhaps because of his self-esteem. He only smiled with fatuous superiority when from time to time, after the elections, his patrons would
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     39"/>

chaff him about his failure to secure the mayoralty. They did so with more effect since there were always among the horse-players on such occasions a few who would cast votes for the barber, esteeming it as a choice and perennial joke, and his reading his name among the unsuccessful candidates served to foster his delusion and keep Flynn's ambition alive.</p>
<p>One Sunday, shortly after the Carrolls had moved to Banbridge, John Flynn was shaving Jacob Rosenstein, who kept the principal dry-goods store of the village, and a number of men were sitting and lounging about, waiting their turns. Flynn's shop was on the main street in the centre of the business district--his shop, or his "Tonsorial Parlor," as his sign had it. It was quite an ornate establishment. There was a lace lambrequin in the show-window, a palm in each corner, between which stood a tank of gold-fish, and below the lace lambrequin swung a gilt cage containing an incessantly hopping, though silent, yellow canary.</p>
<p>Flynn was intensely proud and fond of the establishment, and was insulted if it was alluded to as a barber-shop. He himself never even thought of it, much less spoke of it, as such. "Well, I must be going to the 'Parlor,'" he would say when setting out to business. He was unmarried, and lived in a boarding-house.</p>
<p>As Flynn shaved Rosenstein, who was naturally speechless, his landlady's husband, Billy Amidon, was talking a good deal. Amidon was always shaved for nothing, in consideration of the fact that his wife supported him with board money, and the barber had an undefined conviction that it was mean to take it back after he had just paid it. Amidon was a notorious talker, and was called a very "dry sort of man," which, in the village vernacular, signified that he was esteemed a wit.</p>
<p>"Well," he said to another man, who was leaning
<pb n="40     THE DEBTOR"/>

with a relaxation of all his muscles against the little strip of counter, which contained a modest assortment of hair-oils and shaving-brushes and soaps which nobody was ever seen to buy--"well, John has lost ten pounds since the election, Tappan."</p>
<p>Tappan ran a milk-route between Banbridge and Ardmoor, a little farming-place six miles out. Tappan was an Ardmoor man. His milk-wagon stood in front of the "Tonsorial Parlor." He had had a drink of beer at Frank Steinbach's saloon next door, and now was waiting for his Sunday shave before going home. His milk-peddling was over for the day. He was a hard-working-man, and had been on the road since four o'clock. He had a heavy look about his eyes, and he greeted Amidon's facetiousness with a weary and surly hitch.</p>
<p>"Has he?" he replied, indifferently.</p>
<p>But a very young, very small man, sitting in one of the "Parlor" arm-chairs, laughed like a child, with intense enjoyment. "Yep," he said, "I've noticed that. As much as ten pounds has went since election, sure."</p>
<p>"Shet up," replied Flynn, carefully scraping his patron's face. He said "Shet up" with an expression of foolish pride. The postmaster of Banbridge, who was sitting somewhat aloof and held himself with a constraint of exclusiveness (he was new to his office and had not yet lost the taste of its dignity), laughed.</p>
<p>"Let me see, how many votes did you have this year, John?" he asked, condescendingly.</p>
<p>"Five," replied John, with open exultation.</p>
<p>"Now, John, why didn't you get more than that, I'd like to know?"</p>
<p>Flynn laughed knowingly. "Oh," he said, "it's the old story--not money enough."</p>
<p>"But a lot promised they'd vote for you, didn't they, John?" persisted the postmaster, Sigsbee Ray, with a wink of humorous confidence at the others.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     41"/>

<p>"Yep, but damme, who expects anybody to keep an election promise if he ain't paid for it? I ain't unreasonable. What's elections for? You wait."</p>
<p>"Haven't you given up yet, John?"</p>
<p>"Well, I guess not. You wait."</p>
<p>"Say, John," interposed Amidon, "how much did you pay them five what voted for you this year, hey?"</p>
<p>Flynn looked up from Rosenstein's belathered face with a burst of simple triumph. "I didn't pay any of them a penny," said he. "There is damn fools everywhere, and you wait," said he, "an' see ef there ain't more come to light next time. I'll fetch it yet, along of the fools, an' ef I can raise a leetle money, an' I begin to see my way clear to that."</p>
<p>"How's that?" John was asked by the small young man.</p>
<p>"I'm layin' low 'bout that," replied John, mysteriously.</p>
<p>"Now, John," said the postmaster, "you wouldn't lay low if there was a good chance to make some money, and not give us poor devils a chance?"</p>
<p>The postmaster spoke consciously. He expected what came, the buzz of remonstrance at his classing himself in his new office with poor devils.</p>
<p>"You'd better talk about poor devils," growled the milkman, Tappan. "You'd better talk. Huh! Here you be, don't hev to git to work till eight o'clock, an' quittin' at eight nights, and fifteen hundred a year. You'd better talk, Mr. Ray. If you was a man gittin' up at three of a winter's mornin', and settin' out with a milk-route at four, an' makin' 'bout half a penny a quart, an' cussed at that 'cause it ain't all cream--if you was as dead tired as I be this minute you might talk."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm willing to allow that I am not as hard pushed as you are," said the postmaster, with magnanimous humility.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     42"/>

<p>"You'd better. Poor devils, huh! I guess I know what poor devils be, and the hell they're in. Bet your life I do. Huh!"</p>
<p>"I'm a poor devil 'nough myself, when it comes to that," said Amidon, "but I reckon you kin speak for yourself when it comes to talkin' about bein' in hell, appan. Fur's I'm concerned, I'm findin' this a purty comfertable sort of place."</p>
<p>Amidon was a tall man, and he stretched his length luxuriously as he spoke. Tappan eyed him malignantly. He was not a pleasant-tempered man, and now he was both weary and impatient of waiting for his turn with the barber.</p>
<p>"I should think any man might be comfortable, ef he had a wife takin' boarders to support him, but mebbe if she was to be asked to tell the truth, she'd tell a different story," he said. Tappan spoke in a tone of facetious rage, and the others laughed, all except the barber. He had a curious respect for his landlady's husband.</p>
<p>"Ef a lady has the undisposition to let her husband subside on her bounty, it is between them twain. Who God has joined together, let no man set asunder," said he, bombastically, and even the surly milkman, and Rosenstein under his manipulating razor, when a laugh was dangerous, laughed. John Flynn, when he waxed didactic, and made use of large words and phrases, was the comic column of Banbridge.</p>
<p>Amidon, thus defended, chuckled also, albeit rather foolishly, and slouched to the door. "Guess I'll drop up and git the Sunday paper. I'll be in later on, John," he mumbled. He had the grace to be somewhat ashamed both by the attack and by the defence, and was for edging out, but stopped on the threshold of the door, arrested by something which the small man said.</p>
<p>"Talkin' about poor devils, there's one man in Ban-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     43"/>

bridge ain't no poor devil. S'pose you know we've got a J. P. Morgan right amongst us?"</p>
<p>"Who?" asked the postmaster; and Amidon, directly now the conversation was thoroughly shifted from himself, returned to his former place.</p>
<p>"I know who he means," said he, importantly. "Oh, it's the man what's rented the Ranger place. They say he's a millionaire."</p>
<p>The milkman straightened himself interestedly. "I rather guess he is," said he. "They take two quarts of cream every morning, and three quarts of milk."</p>
<p>"Lord!" said the barber, gaping over his patron's head. "Lord!"</p>
<p>Although very short and slight, the barber had a large face, simple, amiable with a smirk of conceit as to the lower part; his forehead was very large and round, as was his head, and his blue eyes were very placid, even beautiful. The barber never laughed.</p>
<p>"Two quarts of cream!" said the small man. "Whew!"</p>
<p>"He must be rich if he takes all that cream," said the postmaster. "A half a pint a day about breaks me, but my wife must have it for her coffee."</p>
<p>Rosenstein had so far got his freedom of speech, for the barber had never ceased operation to speak, though rather guardedly. "He must be rich," he said. "Any man in Banbridge that buys as much as he does from a store in the place, an' wants his bills regular every Saturday night, has got somethin'."</p>
<p>"Has he paid 'em?" asked the postmaster.</p>
<p>"All except the last one, an' that he didn't pay because I couldn't cash a check for five hundred and give him the balance. 'Lord, sir,' says I, 'ef you want a check of that value cashed, you'll have to go to John Wanamaker. That's as much as I take in Banbridge in a whole year.' 'Well, mebbe you'll do better this year,' says he, laughing, and goes out. He's a fine-
<pb n="44     THE DEBTOR"/>

spoken man, an' it was a lucky day for Banbridge when he come here."</p>
<p>"He don't buy many postage-stamps," said the post-master, thoughtfully, "but he asked me if I should be able to let him have as much as ten dollars' worth at a time, ef he wanted 'em, an' I said I should, an' I've just ordered in more. An' he has a big mail."</p>
<p>The barber had been opening his mouth and catching his breath preparatory to speaking and saying more than any of them. Now he spoke: "That man's wuth a mighty lot of money now," said he, "but what he's wuth now ain't nothin' to what he's goin' to be wuth some day."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, John?" asked Amidon, patronizingly.</p>
<p>"Well, now, I'll tell you what I mean. That man, it's Cap. Carroll what's just arraigned to Banbridge that you're all talkin' about, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Go ahead."</p>
<p>"Well, now, Cap. Carroll is agoin' to be one of them great clapatalists, ef he ain't now," he said.</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"Well, he got holt of some stock that's goin' to bust the market and turn Wall Street into a mill-stream in less than a year, ef it keeps on as it has wen<p>
<p>"What is it?" asked the small man.</p>
<p>The milkman sighed wearily. "Oh, slow up yer jaw, and gimme a chance sometime," he growled. "I want to git home an' git my breakfast. I'm hungry."</p>
<p>Flynn began hurriedly finishing off Rosenstein, talking with no less eagerness as he did so. "Well, it's Bona-flora mining-stock, ef you want to know," he said, importantly.</p>
<p>"Where is it?" asked the postmaster, with a peculiar smile.</p>
<p>"Out West somewhere. It ain't but fifty cents a
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     45"/>

share, an' it's goin' up like a skyrocket, an' there's others. There's a new railroad out there, an' other mines, an' a new invention for makin' fuel out of coal-dust, an' some other things."</p>
<p>"Is Captain Carroll the president of them?" asked the small man, with an impressed air. He was very young, and eager-looking, and very shabby. He grubbed on a tiny ancestral farm, for a living for himself and wife and four children, young as he was. He had never had enough to eat, at least of proper food. He did not come to the "Tonsorial Parlor" to be shaved, for he hacked away at his innocent cheeks at home with his deceased father's old razor, but he loved a little gossip. In fact, John Flynn's barber-shop was his one dissipation. Sometimes he looked longingly at a beer-saloon, but he had no money, unless he starved Minna and the children, and for that he was too good and too timid. His Minna was a stout German girl, twice his size, and she ruled him with a rod of iron. She did not approve of the barber-shop, and so the pleasure had something of the zest of a forbidden one.</p>
<p>Every Sunday he was at his wit's end, which was easily reached, to invent a suitable excuse for his absence. To-day it had been to see if Mrs. Amidon did not want to buy some apples. Some of their last winter's store had been miraculously preserved, and Minna saw the way to a few pennies thereby. He could quite openly say that he had been to the barber-shop to-day, having seen Amidon there, therefore he was quite easy in his mind, and leaned back in his chair with perfect content. One of the children at home cried all the time. A yawning mouth of wrath at existence was about all he ever saw of that particular baby, and Minna almost always scolded, and this was a haven of peace to little Willy Eddy.</p>
<pb n="46     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Here he felt like a man among men; at home he felt like nothing at all among women. The children were all girls. Sometimes he wondered if a boy-baby might not have been a refuge. He was not very clean; his hands were still stained with picking over potatoes the day before; his shoulders in their rusty coat had a distinct hunch; but he was radiantly happy talking of the rich Captain Carroll. He seemed to taste the honey of the other man's riches and importance in his own mouth. Willy Eddy did not know the meaning of envy. He had such a fund of sympathetic imagination that he possessed the fair possessions of others like a child with fairy tales.</p>
<p>"Is he president of all of them?" asked little Willy Eddy, with gusto, and looked as if he himself held them all in his meagre potato-stained hands.</p>
<p>"No," replied the barber, with importance--"no, he's more than a president. A president is nothin' except a figger-head. I don't care what he's president of, whether it is of this great country or of railroads or what not. They could git along without the president, but they can't without this gentleman. He's the promoter."</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the small man.</p>
<p>The milkman sighed wrathfully again. "Oh, hang it all!" he said. "I've seed promoters. It's mostly their own pockets they promote."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," said the postmaster, as one with authority. "I don't know. Captain Carroll was in the office the other day, and we had a little talk, and it struck me that some of the ventures he is interested in were quite promising. And it is different with a man of his wealth. When a poor man takes up anything of the kind, you can suspect, but this is different. He said to me that he had no occasion, so far as the money was concerned, to turn his finger over for any of them or to
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      47"/>

open his mouth concerning them. He said he would not be afraid to stake every dollar he had in the world on them if it was necessary."</p>
<p>Flynn had daintily anointed Rosenstein's shaven face with witch-hazel and was now dusting it with powder. Tappan was slouching towards the chair.</p>
<p>"Have you bought some of the stock?" the barber asked, abruptly, of the postmaster, who smiled mysteriously and hedged.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe I have, and maybe again I haven't," said he. "Have you, John?"</p>
<p>" Not yet," replied the barber. "I am deflecting upon the matter. It requires considerable loggitation when a man has penuriously saved a circumscribed sum from the sweat of his brow."</p>
<p>"That's so. Don't be rash, John," said Amidon.</p>
<p>It was not especially funny, but since Amidon intended it to be, they all obligingly laughed, except Tappan, who set himself with a grunt in the chair and had the white sheet of which Rosenstein had been denuded tied around his neck.</p>
<p>Rosenstein, who was a lean man, with a much-lined face, cast a glance at himself in the looking-glass, and heaved an odd sigh as he turned away to get his hat.</p>
<p>"You don't seem to be much stuck on your looks, old man," remarked Amidon.</p>
<p>Rosenstein cast a perfectly good-humored but rather melancholy look at Amidon. "No; I never was," he replied, soberly. "Can't remember when I wouldn't have preferred to meet some other fellow in the looking-glass. It's such an awful thing, the intimacy with himself that's forced on a man when he comes into this world."</p>
<p>"That's so," assented Amidon, rather stupidly, but he was not to be abashed with the other man's meta-
<pb n="48      THE DEBTOR "/>

physics. Rosenstein did credit to his German ancestry at times, and was then in deep waters for his village acquaintances.</p>
<p>"Who would you ruther meet in the lookin'-glass than yerself?" pursued Amidon.</p>
<p>"Not you," replied Rosenstein, with unexpected repartee, and was going out amid a chorus of glee at Amidon's discomfiture when another man darkened the doorway, and the storekeeper fell back as Captain Carroll entered amid a sullen silence.</p>
<p>The postmaster rose, and in a second the small man and Amidon followed his example. Carroll greeted them all with a cordiality which had in it a certain implication of admiring confidence. Not a man there but felt at once that this new-comer had a most flattering recognition of himself in particular, to the exclusion of all the others. It was odd how he contrived to produce this impression, but produce it he did. It was Arthur Carroll's great charm, the great secret of a remarkable influence over his fellow-men. He appealed with consummate skill to the selfish side of every one with whom he came in contact, he exalted him in his own eyes far above the masses with whom he was surrounded, by who could tell what subtle alchemy. Each man preened unconsciously his panoply of spiritual pride under this other man's gentle, courteous eyes. Even Rosenstein straightened himself. And besides this was the respectful admiration which the man himself excited, by reason of his fine appearance and address, his good looks, his irreproachable clothes, and his reputed wealth.</p>
<p>Arthur Carroll made an entrance into the "Tonsoria Parlor." Moreover, the other men could see out in front of the establishment, the coach, the coachman in livery--the first livery on record as actually resident in Banbridge; liveries had passed through, but never be-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     49"/>

fore tarried--the fretting steeds with their glittering equipment. Around the coach had already gathered several small boys, huddled together, and transfixed with awe too deep for impudence.</p>
<p>Carroll, having greeted the men, said good-morning urbanely to the barber, who had ceased lathering Tappan and was looking at him indeterminately. It seemed dreadful to him that this great man should have to wait for the milkman. The barber was a conservative to the core, and would speak of the laboring-classes and tradesmen as if he himself were on the other side of the highway from birth. Tappan himself, who, as said before, was naturally surly, was also a dissenter on principle, and had an enlarged sense of injury, had qualms at keeping waiting a man who patronized him to the extent of two quarts of cream and three quarts of milk daily. It was like quarrelling with his bread-and-butter, as he put it, when alluding to the affair later on.</p>
<p>"I ain't goin' through the world seein' no men as is better 'n I be," he said, "but there's jest this much about it, I ain't a fool, an' I know enough to open the door when a man wants to walk through to pay me some money. Ef Carroll hadn't been takin' that much cream and milk, I'd set there in that barber's-chair ef I'd had a year's beard to shave, an' I'd kept him waitin', and enjoyed it, but, as it was, I did what I did."</p>
<p>What Tappan did was to wave back Flynn's lathering-hand, and to say, rather splutteringly, that he would wait, "ef Captain Carroll was in a hurry."</p>
<p>But Captain Carroll was in no hurry, it seemed, and, moreover, gave the impression that if he had been about to catch a railroad train to keep an important business engagement, he would not have dreamed of thrusting himself in before the milkman with his milk all delivered. He, moreover, gave the impression that
<pb n="50"/>
THE DEBTOR

he considered the milkman a polished gentleman for his handsome offer, and all this without saying so much. Captain Carroll seated himself, and completed the impression by tendering everybody cigars. Then the "Tonsorial Parlor" and its patrons waiting for a Sunday-morning shave became a truly genteel function. Willy Eddy, who was dreamily imaginative, and read the Sunday papers when his Minna gave him a chance and did not chide him for the waste of money, remembered things he had read about the swagger New York clubs. He smoked away and made-believe he was a clubman, and enjoyed himself artlessly. The sun got farther around and the south window was a sheet of burning radiance. It became rather too warm, and on Carroll making a motion to move his chair into the shade, every other man moved into the sunshine, and sat sweltering and smoking in a fatuous vainglory. The canary bird hopped faster and faster. The gold-fishes swam with a larger school of bright reflections. A bumblebee flew in the open window and buzzed dangerously near the hero's head. Willy Eddy rose and, ostentatiously, at his own risk, drove the intruder away, and was gratefully thanked. Truly hero-worship, while it is often foolish and fool-making, is not the worst sentiment of mankind. When the great man made a move to order his coachman to take the wonderful rig away, and drive, because the horses were restive and needed exercise, and he himself--the delicate humor of the thing--also needed exercise and would walk home, Amidon sped in his service as he had never sped in the service of the long-suffering wife, at that moment struggling painfully with the Sunday dinner, and bringing wood from the shed to replenish the fire.</p>
<p>Carroll did not need to lead up to his mining and other interests. The subject was broached at once by the others. The postmaster opened it. He spoke
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      51"/>

with less humility than the others, as being more on a footing of equality.</p>
<p>"Well, captain, heard anything lately from the Boniflora?" he asked, knowingly. And Carroll replied that he had received a letter from the manager the night before which gave most encouraging information concerning the prospects.</p>
<p>"Anything of the United Fuel?" continued the postmaster.</p>
<p>"Large block just sold, at an advance of six and three-eighths," replied Carroll, blowing the smoke from his mouth. Carroll inspired confidence by the very quietness and lack of enthusiasm with which he spoke of his enterprises. All his listeners thought privately that he was in no way anxious to sell his stock, after all. Perhaps, moreover, he did not intend to sell any but large blocks. Little Willy Eddy ventured to ask for information on the latter point.</p>
<p>"Mebbe you don't keer nothin' about sellin' of it unless it is in big lumps?" he queried, timidly. He was thinking of a matter of $250 which his father had saved from pension-money, and was still in the savings-bank. Carroll replied (but with the greatest indifference) that they often sold stock in very small blocks, and the confidence of them waxed apace. Amidon thought of a little money which his wife had saved from her boarders, and the barber immediately resolved to invest every cent he had in the United Fuel. Such was Captain Carroll's graciousness and urbanity that he idled away an hour in the barber-shop, and the other men melted away, although reluctantly, from an atmosphere of such effulgence. The milkman's hollow stomach drove him home for his breakfast. Little Willy Eddy thought uneasily of his Minna, and took his departure. The postmaster had a Sunday mail to sort. And Amidon went out to get a drink of beer; Carroll's cigar had
<pb n="52     THE DEBTOR"/>

dried his throat. Carroll was shaven last, and Flynn did his best by him, even unto a new jar of cold cream, double the quantity of witch-hazel, and a waste of powder. Then after he had carefully adjusted his hat, and was at last about to go, Flynn stopped him.</p>
<p>"Beg your pardon, sir," said he, "but--"</p>
<p>"But what?" said Carroll, rather kindly.</p>
<p>The barber's lip was actually quivering. The magnitude and importance of what he was about to propose almost affected his weakly emotional nature to tears.</p>
<p>He finally made out to say, while tears were actually rolling down his cheeks under Carroll's puzzled regard, that he had $1000 which he had saved, and he would like to invest every penny of it in United Fuel. And before Carroll knew what he was at, he had actually produced $1000 in a bulky roll of much-befingered notes, from some hiding-place, and was waving them before Carroll's eyes.</p>
<p>"Here," said he, "here is the money. You may as well take it now. You can get the securities in New York to-morrow, and bring them out on the train. Here is the money. Take it."</p>
<p>Arthur Carroll did not move to take the money. He stood looking at the excited man with a curious expression. In fact, his face seemed to reflect the emotion of the barber's. His voice was a trifle husky.</p>
<p>"Is that all you have saved?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Every dollar," replied the barber, continuing to wave and thrust the bills, but he raised an edge of his apron to his eyes, overflowing with the stupendousness of it. "Every dollar. I might have saved more, but I've been laid up winters considerable with grippe, and folks don't like to be shaved by a grippy barber. Dunno's I blame 'em. I've had to hire, and hirin' comes high. I've had considerable to do for a widder with four chillren, too--she's my brother's widder--an', take it all
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      53"/>

together, I 'ain't been able to save another dollar. But that don't make no odds, as long as I'm going to double it in that stock of yourn. Take it."</p>
<p>Carroll backed away almost sternly. "I don't want your money," he said.</p>
<p>The barber stood aghast. Captain Carroll had actually a look of offence.</p>
<p>"I hope as I hain't done nothin' that ain't reg'lar," he stammered.</p>
<p>Captain Carroll stepped close to him. He laid one white long-fingered hand on the barber's white jacket-sleeve. He whispered with slyest confidence, although no one was within hearing:</p>
<p>"You keep that money a little while longer," he whispered. "I wouldn't say it to every man, but I will to you. There's going to be a lawsuit, and the stock may drop a point or two. It won't drop much, and it will recover more than it loses, but then is the time to buy, especially when you want a big block, and--I'll let you know."</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you," said the barber, restoring the bills to a greasy old pocket-book. He was faint with gratitude. "All right," he said, and he nodded and winked with intensest comprehension. "All right. You let me know."</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll let you know when it is best to invest," repeated Carroll. He turned on the threshold. "See here," he said, "if I were you, I'd put that money in a bank. I wouldn't keep it here."</p>
<p>"Oh, nobody knows it's here, except you, and you are safe, I ruther guess."</p>
<p>The barber laughed like a child. Carroll went out and passed up the street. He heard from the Episcopal church the sound of singing. Finally he left it behind. He was passing along a short extent where there were no houses. On one side there was a waste tract of land,
<pb n="54     THE DEBTOR"/>

and on the other a stretch of private grounds. The private grounds were bordered by a budding hedge, the waste lot bristled with strong young weeds. Carroll, as he swung along with his stately carriage of the head and shoulders, took out his pocket-book. It was an important-looking affair, the size of bank-notes. He opened it. There was not a vestige of money within. He laughed a little softly to himself, and replaced it. He lived on a street which diverged at right angle from the main street. Just as he was about turning the corner, a runabout in which were seated two men passed him. It stopped, and the men turned and looked back at him. Then before Carroll turned the corner, one hailed him:</p>
<p>"Hullo!" he said.</p>
<p>"Hullo!" returned Carroll, and stood waiting while the man swung his trap round with cautious hisses--he drove a high-stepping mare.</p>
<p>"Are you a man by the name of Carroll?" said he holding the fretting mare tightly, and seesawing the lines, as she tried to dart first one way, then the other.</p>
<p>Carroll nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, look a-here," said the man, "I heerd you wanted to buy some bosses."</p>
<p>"You heard rightly," said Carroll.</p>
<p>"Wall, I've got a pair that can't be beat. Kentucky bred, four-year-old, sound as a whip. Not an out."</p>
<p>"Are you a trader?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Hed them bosses in last week. New-Yorker jest sent for 'em, then he died sudden, and his heirs threw 'em on the market at a sacrifice."</p>
<p>Carroll looked at the men, and they looked at him. The two men in the runabout resembled each other, and were evidently brothers. Carroll's eyes on the men were sharp, so were theirs on him. Carroll's eyes were
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     55"/>

looking for knavery, and the men's were looking for suspicion of knavery.</p>
<p>"How much?" asked Carroll, finally.</p>
<p>The men looked at each other. One made a motion with his lips; the other nodded.</p>
<p>"Fifteen hundred," said the first speaker, "and damned cheap."</p>
<p>"Well, you can bring them around, and I'll look at them," said Carroll. "Any night after seven."</p>
<p>Carroll walked on, turning up the road which led to his own house, and the men whirled about again and then drove on, the mare breaking into a gallop.</p>

CHAPTER IV

<p>IN Banbridge no one in trade was considered in polite society, with one exception. The exception was Randolph Anderson. Anderson had studied for the law. He had set up his office over the post-office, hung out his innocent and appealing little sign, and sat in his new office-chair beside his new desk, surrounded by the majesty of the lettered law, arranged in shelves in alphabetical order, for several years, during which his affairs were constantly on a descending scale. Then at last came a year when scarcely one client had darkened his doors except Tappan, who wanted to sue a delinquent customer and attach some of his personal property. After ascertaining that the personal property had been cannily transferred to the debtor's wife, he had told Anderson, upon the presentation of a modest bill, that he was a fraud and he could have done better himself. Beside this backward stroke of business, Anderson had that year a will to draw up, for which he was never paid, and had married a couple who had reimbursed him in farm produce. At the expiration of that year the lawyer, having to all intents and purposes been given up by the law, gave it up in his turn. Every cent of the money which he had inherited from his father had been expended. Nothing remained except his mother's small property, which barely sufficed to support her. Anderson then borrowed money from his uncle, who was well-to-do, giving him his note for three years, rented a store on Main Street, purchased a stock of
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      57"/>

groceries, and went into trade. His course made quite a sensation. He was the first Anderson in the memory of Banbridge, where the name was an old one, to be outside the genteel pale of a profession. His father had been a physician, his grandfather a clergyman.</p>
<p>"If my son had studied medicine instead of law, he could have at least subsisted upon the proceeds of his profession," his mother said, with the gentle and dignified dissent which was her attitude with regard to her son's startling move. "People are simply obliged by the laws of the flesh to go through measles and whooping-coughs and mumps, and they have to be born and die, and when they get in the way of microbes they have to be ill and they have to call in a physician, and some few of them pay him, so he can manage at least to live. Of course law is different. If people haven't any money they can forego quarrels, unless they are forced upon them. Quarrels are luxuries. It really began to seem to me that all the opportunity for a lawyer in Banbridge was in the simple line of suing some one for debt, and there is always that way, which does seem to me rather dishonest, of putting the property out of one's hands."</p>
<p>There was undoubtedly much truth in what Mrs. Sylvia Anderson said. She was a shrewd old woman, with such a softly feminine manner that she misled people into thinking the contrary. Banbridge folk rather pitied Randolph Anderson for having such a sweetly helpless and incapable mother, albeit very pretty and very much of a lady.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson was a large woman, but delicately articulated, with small hands, and such tiny feet that she toppled a little when she walked. Her complexion was like a child's, and she fluffed her thick white locks over her ears and swathed her throat high in soft laces, concealing all the aged lines in face and figure with innocent feminine arts.</p>
<pb n="58     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Randolph adorer his mother. He had never cared for any other woman. He had sat at his mother's little feet all his life, although he had at times his own masculine way, as in the matter of the deserting of his profession for trade. He had remained firm, although his mother had said much against it.</p>
<p>"Frankly, I do not approve of it, dear," she said. "I agree, but I do not approve. I do not like it, that you should desert the trodden path of your forebears. It is not so much that I am proud, but I am conservative. I believe there is a certain harmony between the man and the road his race have travelled. I believe he is a very sorry figure on another, especially if it be on a lower level."</p>
<p>"I don't think it is a question of level," said Randolph. "A road is simply a question of progress."</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps," said his mother, "but in that case the state of things is the same. A grocer would cut a sorry figure on your road, even if it ran parallel towards the same goal, and a lawyer would cut a sorry figure on a grocer's. Frankly, dear, I really doubt if you will make a good grocer."</p>
<p>Randolph laughed. "At least I hope I can earn our bread-and-butter," he said. Then he went on seriously. "It is just here," he said--"you and I are not sordid. Neither of us cares about money for itself, but here we are on this earth, with that existence which has its money price, and obligations imposed upon us. We cannot shirk it. We must live, and in order to live we must have a certain amount of money. Now all we have in this world for material goods is this old house and your little pittance. We have not a cent besides. If we were to try living on that, it would not last out your lifetime. If it would, I should not combat your prejudices, but we could lie on our oars and eat up the old place, and later on I would hustle for my-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     59"/>

self. But it will not. Now, I have demonstrated that I cannot earn anything by my profession. I have tried it faithfully and well. Last year I did not earn enough to pay my office rent. I never shall in Banbridge, and there is no sense whatever in my striking out in a new place with no prestige and no money. You and I simply want enough to live on, enough money to buy the wherewithal to keep the flame of life comfortably burning, and I can think of no other way than this grocery business. People must eat. You are certainly sure of earning something, if you offer people something they want. In my profession there is nothing that they do want."</p>
<p>"But your education," said his mother. She thought of the rows of law-books of whose contents she fondly believed her son a master.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is mine still," said Randolph, "but other people don't want it. There is no use, mother, in evading the question. We live in an age of market values. We must consider them. Butter and cheese have a sure market value, and the knowledge of the law in my head has not. Nobody wants it enough to pay anything for it, to give us a moneyed equivalent wherewith we may buy the things we need. Therefore, if nobody wants that, we must offer them something else. When it comes to the rights of our fellow-men to spend their own money as they choose, that is inalienable. It is about the most firmly established right in the country. No; people cannot be coerced into buying my little store of knowledge, therefore I will try them with my little store of butter and cheese and eggs and molasses."</p>
<p>Randolph Anderson laughed. Aside from regard for his mother's feelings, he had not the slightest scruple against his business venture. On the contrary, it rather amused him. He must have had a latent taste
<pb n="60     THE DEBTOR"/>

for business, for he quite enjoyed studying the market and purchasing his stock in trade. He purchased wisely, too. He offered a choice stock of goods, or, rather, his two salesmen did. He himself did not sell much over his own counters, except in the case of a great rush of business. But it was not from the least sensation of superiority. It was merely because of a distrust of his own ability to acquit himself well in such a totally different branch of industry. Anderson was cast on unusually simple and ingenuous lines. Nobody would have believed it, but he was actually somewhat modest and shy before his own clerks, and realized sensitively his own lack of experience. So he had a way of subsiding when customers appeared, and retreating to his office in the rear of the building. He spent most of his time in this office. It was a very pleasant one, overlooking the river, on which steamboats and canal-boats travelled to the city. From Anderson's office the bank of red clay soil sloped to the water's edge. He could see the gleam of the current through the shag of young trees which found root in the unpromising soil. Now and then the tall mast of a sailing-vessel glided by, now the smoke-stack of a steamer. Often the quiet was broken by the panting breath of a tug. Often into his field of vision flapped the wet clothes from the line strung along the deck of a canal-boat. The canal ran along beside the regular current of the river, separated from it by a narrow tow-path. Farther down, the great railroad bridge crossed the stream, and at all hours he could catch the swift glisten of the train-windows as they shot past.</p>
<p>Anderson's office was about twelve by fourteen, and lined with shelves on two sides. On these he had books, not law-books. Those he had relegated to the library at home. He had probably in the depths of his consciousness a sensation of melancholy at the contempla-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     61"/>

tion of those reminders of his balked career. No man, no matter how gracefully he may yield to it, cares to contemplate failures. He had filled these shelves with books of which he was fond, for daily reading. They were most of them old. He had little money with which to purchase new ones. He had been forced to rely upon those which his father and grandfather had accumulated. There were, however, a few recent and quite valuable books which he had acquired since his venture in trade, upon entomology, especially books upon butterflies. Since his retreat from the law he had developed suddenly, perhaps by the force of contrast, or, the opposite swing of the pendulum, an overwhelming taste for those airy flowers of animated life. The two walls of the office not occupied with books were hung with framed specimens. He had also under the riverward window a little table equipped with the necessary paraphernalia for mounting them. Many a sunny day in the season he spent in the fields on this gentle hunt. There was a broad sill to the window, and upon it stood a box filled with green plants. When the season was enough advanced and the window always open, the trailing vines rooted in the box hung far down outside, and the women on the passing canal-boats looked up at them. The window-ledge was wide enough, moreover, for an old red cushion upon which slept in the sun when he was not afield for love or war or prey, a great cat striped like a tiger, with fierce green eyes, and a mighty purr of comfort, and a rounding back of affection for Anderson's legs when he talked to him.</p>
<p>Anderson had two comfortable old chairs in his office, and a goodly assortment of pipes, for he was a great smoker. He made tobacco a part of his grocery business, and had a strong sense of comfort in reflecting upon the unlimited supply. He had been forced, in the last days of his law-practice, to stint himself even in
<pb n="62     THE DEBTOR"/>

this creature comfort. On the whole, he was much happier when fairly established in trade than he had ever been before. He was so absorbed in his business (all the details of which he mastered), in his books, and his butterflies, that he saw very little of the people, and knew very little of what was going on in Banbridge, except through his mother. Mrs. Anderson, in spite of her years, and a certain lack of strength which had always hampered her, was quite prominent in Banbridge society. She was one of the old women whom young girls adore, even when the adoration is not increased by the existence of a marriageable son. Sometimes the old lady would regard an unmarried female-caller with a soft suspicion of ulterior motives, but she never whispered them to her son. Sylvia Anderson had a lovely, fine delicacy where the foibles of her own sex were concerned. She was so essentially feminine herself that she was never quite rid of her maiden sense of alienation even with her son. She would have been much happier with a daughter, although she was very fond of her son.</p>
<p>One afternoon in May, a short time after Mrs. Van Dorn and Mrs. Lee had made their circuit of calls which had included her, some other ladies were making the rounds in the calling-coach, which drew up before her door. There were three ladies, two of them unmarried. They were an elder aunt, her young unmarried niece, and a married lady who had been the girl friend of the aunt. They made a long call, and Mrs. Anderson entertained them with tea in her pink-and-gold china cups, with cream in the little family silver cream-jug, and with slices of pound-cake. It was an old custom of Mrs. Anderson's which she had copied all through her married life from Madam Anderson, Randolph's grandmother, the widow of old Dr. Anderson, the clergyman.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     63"/>

<p>"I always make it a custom, my dear, to keep pound-cake on hand, and have some of the best green tea in the caddy, and then when callers come of an afternoon I can offer them some refreshment," she had said when her son's wife first came to live with her. So Mrs. Anderson had antedated the modern fashion in Banbridge, but she did not keep a little, ornate tea-table in her parlor. The cake and tea were brought in by the one maid on a tray covered with a polka-dotted damask.</p>
<p>This afternoon the callers had their cake and tea, and lingered long afterwards. Now and then Mrs. Anderson glanced imperceptibly at the window, thinking her son might pass. She regarded the unmarried aunt and the young niece with asides of reflection even while she talked to them. The niece was not pretty, but her bloom of youth under the roses of her spring hat was ravishing. The aunt had never been pretty; and, moreover, her bloom had gone, but she was well dressed, and her thin figure was full of grace. She sat in her chair with delicate erectness, the folds of her gray gown was disposed over her supple length of limb with charming effect. She also had a sort of eager, almost appealing amiability. It was as if she said:</p>
<p>"Yes, I know I am no longer young. I am not fair to see, but indeed I mean well by you. I would do much for you. I even love you. Cannot you love me for that?" and that was softly compelling.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson reflected that a man might easily admire either of these women. Her manner, in spite of herself, cooled towards them. She did not think of the third woman, who was married, except to ply her with cake and tea and inquire for her husband and children. The woman, after she had finished her cake and tea, sat sunken in her corsets, under her loosely fitting black silk, and looked stupidly amiable. She rose with a slight sigh of relief when at last the others made
<pb n="64     THE DEBTOR"/>

a motion to go. She thought of her supper at home, and the children long out of school. It was past supper-time for Banbridge. The sun was quite low. An hour ago a little herd of cows had pelted by in a cloud of dust, with great udders swinging perilously, going home to be milked.</p>
<p>"That Flannigan boy always runs those cows home," said the aunt, disapprovingly, as she passed the window.</p>
<p>"I have always heard it was bad for the milk," assented Mrs. Anderson.</p>
<p>Now that her callers were on the move, Mrs. Anderson was exceedingly cordial. She said something further about the quality of the cream obtained from the cows, and the aunt said yes, it was very good, although so dear. The old lady kissed both the aunt and the niece when they at last went out of the door, and said she was so glad that she was at home, and begged them to come again. She stood in the door watching them get into the coach. The young girl's face in the window, with her beflowered hat, a rose crowned with roses, in the dark setting of the window, was beautiful. Even the aunt's face, older and more colorless, except for an unlovely flush of excitement, was pathetically compelling and charmed. Mrs. Anderson, filling up the doorway with her stately bulk, swept around by her soft black draperies, her fair old face rising from a foam of lace, and delicately capped with lace, on which was a knot of palest lavender, stood in a frame of luxuriant Virginia-creeper, and smiled and nodded graciously to her departing guests, while wondering if they would meet her son coming home. After that followed a reflection as to the undesirability of either of them as a possible daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>Just as she was turning to enter the house, after the coach had rolled out of sight, she saw her son coming down the street under the green shade of the maples
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     65"/>

which bordered it. The mother went toddling on her tiny feet down the steps to the gate to meet her son. The house stood quite close to the road; indeed, only a little bricked-path separated it from the sidewalk. All the ground was at the sides and back. The house was a square old affair with a row of half-windows in the third-story, or attic, and considerable good old panel-work and ornamentation about it. On the right side of the house was a large old flower-garden, now just beginning to assert itself anew; on the left were the stable and some out-buildings, with a grassy oval of lawn in the centre of a sweep of drive; in the rear was a kitchen-garden and a field rising to the railroad, for railroads circled all Banbridge in their vises of iron arms. A station was only a short distance farther up this same street. As Mrs. Anderson stood waiting and her son was advancing down the street a train from the city rumbled past. When Randolph had come up, and they had both entered the house, a carriage passed swiftly and both saw it from the parlor window.</p>
<p>"Do you know who's carriage that is?" asked Mrs. Anderson. "It is something new in Banbridge, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It belongs to those new people who have moved into the Ranger place," replied Randolph. He wore a light business-suit which suited him, and he looked like a gentleman, as much so as when he had come from a law-office instead of a grocery-store. Indeed, he had been much shabbier in the law-office and had not held his head so high. In the law-office he had constantly been confronted with the possibility of debt. Here he was free from it. He had been smoking, as usual, and there was about his garments an odor of mingled coffee and tobacco. He had been selling coffee, and grinding some. One of his two salesmen was ill, and that was why he was so late. The new carriage rolled silently on its rubber tires along the macadamized road; the
<pb n="66      THE DEBTOR"/>

high black polish and plate-glass flashed in the sunlight, the coachman in livery sat proudly erect and held his whip stylishly, the sleek horses pranced, seeming scarcely to touch the road with their dainty hoofs.</p>
<p>"Those are fine horses," said Randolph.</p>
<p>"Yes," assented his mother. "They must be very wealthy people, I suppose."</p>
<p>"It looks so," replied Randolph.</p>
<p>His mother, still staring out of the window, started. "Why," she said, "the coachman is turning around!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps he has forgotten something at the station," said Randolph.</p>
<p>"Why, it is stopping here!" cried Mrs. Anderson, wonderingly. The carriage indeed stopped just before the Anderson gate, and remained there perfectly still. The coachman gazed intently at the house, but made no motion to get down. At a window was seen a gentleman's face; past him the fresh face of a girl, also gazing. Randolph looked out, and the gentleman in the carriage made an imperious beckoning motion.</p>
<p>"Why, he is beckoning you!" said Mrs. Anderson, amazedly and indignantly.</p>
<p>Anderson moved towards the door.</p>
<p>"You are not going out when you are beckoned to in that way?" cried his mother.</p>
<p>Anderson laughed. "You forget, mother," he said, "that a grocer is at the beck and call of his patrons."</p>
<p>"I am ashamed of you!" she said, hotly, her fair old face flushing, "to have no more pride--"</p>
<p>Anderson laughed again. "I am too proud to have pride," he said, and went out of the room. He went leisurely down the steps, and crossed the little brick walk to the gate, and then approached the carriage. The gentleman inside, with what seemed an unpremeditated movement, raised his hat. Randolph bowed. Carroll smiled in the gentle, admiring way which he had.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     67"/>

<p>"Perhaps I have made a mistake," he said, "but I was directed here. I was told that Anderson, who keeps the grocery, lives here."</p>
<p>"I am Anderson," replied Randolph, with dignity and a certain high scorn, and purposely leaving off the Mr. from his name.</p>
<p>Arthur Carroll no longer smiled, but his voice had a certain urbanity, although it rang imperiously. "Now, see here," he said. "I want to know why you did not do as I left instructions at your shop?"</p>
<p>"To what do you refer?" inquired Anderson, quietly.</p>
<p>"I want to know why you did not send in your bill last Saturday night, as I ordered." Carroll's voice was so loud that Mrs. Anderson, in the house, heard him distinctly through the open windows.</p>
<p>"I did not know that you had so ordered," replied Anderson, still quietly, with a slight emphasis on the ordered. He looked slightly amused.</p>
<p>"Well, I did. I told your clerk to be sure to send in my bills promptly every Saturday morning. I wish to settle weekly."</p>
<p>"The mistake was doubtless due to the fact that my clerk has been at home ill for the last three days," said Anderson. "This is the first time I have heard of your order."</p>
<p>"Well," said Carroll, "send it in at once now, and don't let it happen again."</p>
<p>Although the tone was harsh and the words were imperious, still they were not insolent. There was even an effect of <hi rend=italic">camaraderie</hi> about them. At the last he flashed a quick smile at Anderson, which Anderson returned. He was dimly conscious all the time of Charlotte's very pretty face past her father's, peeping around his gray shoulder with a large-eyed, rather puzzled expression. Carroll nodded slightly after the smile, and told the coachman to go on, and the horses
<pb n="68     THE DEBTOR"/>

sprang forward after a delicate toss of their curving forelegs.</p>
<p>Randolph re-entered the house, and his mother, who was waiting, faced him with soft indignation.</p>
<p>"I must say, my son, that I am surprised that you submit to being addressed in such a fashion as that," she said, her blue eyes darkening at him.</p>
<p>Randolph laughed again. "There was no real insolence about it, after all, mother," he replied.</p>
<p>"It sounded so," said she.</p>
<p>"That was because you could not see his face," said Randolph. "He looked very amiable."</p>
<p>"He was angry because he did not get his bill Saturday?" said Mrs. Anderson, interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Yes. He must have given the order to Sam Riggs the day before he went home ill, I suppose."</p>
<p>"He must be a very wealthy man," said Mrs. Anderson. "It is rather good of him to be so anxious to pay his bill every week."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is a very laudable desire," said Randolph. "I only hope his ability may equal it."</p>
<p>His mother looked at him with quick surprise. "Why, you surely don't think--" she said.</p>
<p>"I think nothing. The man is all right, so far as I know. He seems a gentleman, and if he is well off he is a very desirable acquisition to Banbridge."</p>
<p>"Who was that with him in the coach?" asked Mrs. Anderson.</p>
<p>"One of his daughters, I should judge. I hear he has two."</p>
<p>"Pretty?"</p>
<p>"Well, I hardly know. Have you had any callers?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I suppose you met them. They made a very long call."</p>
<p>"You mean the Egglestons?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Josie and little Agnes Eggleston and Mrs.
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     69"/>

Monroe. They stayed here over an hour. I thought you would meet them."</p>
<p>"Yes, I met them just as I turned from Main Street," replied Randolph, soberly, but he was inwardly amused. He understood his mother. But there was something which he did not tell her concerning his experience with the new-comers, the Carrolls. Shortly, she went out to give some directions about tea, and Randolph, sitting beside a window in the parlor with an evening paper, drew from his pocket a letter just received in the mail, and examined it again. It was from a city bank, and it contained a repudiated check for ten dollars, made out by Captain Arthur Carroll, and which Anderson had cashed a few days previous at the request of the pretty young girl in the carriage, who to-night had sat there looking at him and did not speak, either because she had forgotten his face as he did her the little favor, or because he was so far away from her social scale that she was innocently unaware of any necessity for it.</p>
<pb n="70"/>

CHAPTER V

<p>RANDOLPH ANDERSON had a large contempt for money used otherwise than for its material ends. A dollar never meant anything to him except its equivalent in the filling of a need. Generosity and the impulse of giving were in his blood, yet it had gone hard several times with people who had tried to overreach him even to a trifling extent. But now he submitted without a word to losing ten dollars through cashing Arthur Carroll's worthless check. He himself was rather bewildered at his tame submission. One thing was certain, although it seemed paradoxical; if he had not had suspicions as to Arthur Carroll's perfect trustworthiness, he would at once have gone to him with the check.</p>
<p>"I dare say he overdrew his account without knowing it, as many an honest man does," he reasoned, when trying to apologize to himself for his unbusiness-like conduct, but always he knew subconsciously that if he had been perfectly sure of that view of it he would not have hesitated to put it to the proof. For some reason, probably unconfessed rather than actually hidden from himself, he shrank from a possible discovery to Arthur Carroll's discredit. When a man of Randolph Anderson's kind replies to a question concerning the beauty of a young girl that he does not know, the assumption is warranted that he has given the matter consideration. A man usually leaps to a decision of that kind, and if he has no ulterior motive for concealment, he would as lief proclaim it to the house-tops.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     71"/>

<p>Usually Randolph Anderson would no more have hesitated about giving his opinion as to a girl's looks than he would have hesitated about giving his candid opinion of the weather. For the most part a woman's face had about as much effect upon his emotional nature as the face of a day. He saw that it was rosy or gray, smiling and sunny, or frowning or rainy, then he looked unmovedly at the retreating backs of both. It was all the same thing. Anderson was a man who dealt mostly with actualities where his emotions were concerned. With some, love-dreams grow and develop with their growth and development; with some not. The latter had been true with Randolph Anderson. Then, too, he was scarcely self-centred and egotistical enough for genuine air-castles of any kind. To build an air-castle, one's own personality must be the central prop and pillar, for even anything as unsubstantial as an air-castle has its building law. One must rear around something, or the structure can never rise above the horizon of the future.</p>
<p>Anderson had stored his mind with the poetic facts of the world rather than projected his poetic fancies into the facts of the world. He saw things largely as they were, with no inflorescence of rainbows where there was none; but there are actual rainbows, and even auroras, so that the man who does not dream has compensations and a less chance of disillusion. Of course Anderson had thought of marriage; he could scarcely have done otherwise; but he had thought of it as an abstract condition pertaining to himself only in a general way as it pertains to all mankind. He had never seen himself plainly enough in his fancy as a lover and husband to have a pang of regret or longing. He had been really contented as he was. He had a powerful mind, and the exercising of that held in restraint the purely physical which might have precipitated matters. Some men advance, the
<pb n="72     THE DEBTOR"/>

soul pushing the body with more or less effort; some with the soul first, trailing the body, some in unison, and these are they who make the best progress as to the real advancement. Anderson moved, on the whole, in the last way. He was a very healthy man, mind and body, and with rather unusual advantages in point of looks. This last he realized in one way but not in another. He knew it on general principles; he recognized the fact as he recognized the fact of his hands and feet; but what he actually saw in the looking-glass was not so much the physical fact of himself as the spiritual problem with its two known quantities of need and circumstance, and its great unknown third which took hold of eternity. Anderson, although not in a sense religious, had a religious trend of thought. He went every Sunday with his mother to the Presbyterian church where his grandfather had preached to an earlier generation.</p>
<p>On the Sunday after his encounter with Arthur Carroll with reference to the bill, he went to church as usual with his mother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson was a picture of a Sunday, in a rich lavender silk and a magnificent though old-fashioned lace shawl which floated from her shoulder in a fairy net-work of black roses. She would never wear plain black like most women of her age. She was one of the blue-eyed women who looks well in lavender. Her blue eyes, now looking at her son from under the rich purples and lavenders of the velvet pansies on her bonnet, got an indeterminate color like myrtle blossoms. A deeper pink also showed on her cheeks because of the color of her gown.</p>
<p>"Mother, you are just such a mixture of color as that lilac-bush," said her son, irrelevantly, looking from her to a great lilac-bush in the corner of the yard they were passing. It was tipped with rose on the delicate
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      73"/>

ends of its blooming racemes, which shaded to blue at the bases.</p>
<p>"Did you see those new people in church to-day?" said she.</p>
<p>"Yes, I think I did," replied Randolph. "They sat just in front of the Egglestons, didn't they?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said his mother, "they did sit there. There is quite a large family. The ladies are all very nice-looking, too, and they all look alike. If they are going to church, such a family as that, and so well off, they will be quite an acquisition to Banbridge."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Randolph. He spoke absently, and he looked absently at a great wistaria which draped with pendulous purple blooms the veranda of a house which they were just passing. It arrested his eyes as with a loud chord of color, but his mind did not grasp it at all. Afterwards he could not have said he had seen it. As is often the case, while his eyes actually saw one thing, his consciousness saw another. Great, purple, pendulous flowers filled his bodily vision, and the head and shoulders of a young girl above a church pew his mental outlook. Had he seen the Carrolls in church--had he, indeed? Had he seen anything besides them, or rather besides one of them? Had he not, the moment she came up the aisle and entered the pew, seen her with a very clutch of vision? He could not have described one article of her dress, and yet it was complete in his thought. She had worn a soft silk of a dull-red shade, with a frill of cream lace about the shoulders, and there were pink roses under the brim of her dull-red hat, and under the roses was her face, shaded softly with a great puff of her dark hair. And her dark eyes under the dark hair had in them the very light of morning dew, which sparkled back both this world and heaven itself into the eyes of the looker, all reflected in tiny crystal spheres. Suddenly the man
<pb n="74     THE DEBTOR"/>

gazing across the church had seen in this girl's face all there was of earth and the overhang of heaven; he had seen the present and the future. It is through the face of another human being that one gets the furthest reach of human vision, and that furthest reach had now come for the first time to Randolph Anderson. All at once a quiver ran through his entire consciousness from this elongated vision, and he realized sight to its uttermost. Yet it did not dawn on him that he was in love with this girl. He would have laughed at the idea. He had seen her only twice; he had spoken to her only once. He knew nothing of her except that she had given him a worthless check to cash. Love could not come to him in this wise, and it had not, in fact. He had only attained to the comprehension of love. He had gotten faith, he had seen the present world and the world to come in the light of it, but not as yet his own soul. Yet always he saw the girl's head under the pink roses under the brim of the dark-red hat. It was evidently a favorite headgear of hers. She had worn it with a white dress when she had come to the store to get the check cashed. But he had not seen her so fully then. His little doubt and bewilderment over the check had clouded his vision. Now, since he had seen her in the church-pew, his last thrifty scruple as to ignoring the matter of the check left him. He felt that he could not put his doubt of her father to the proof. Suppose that the account had not been carelessly overdrawn-- Suppose--He never for one instant suspected the girl. As soon suspect a rosebud of foregoing its own sweet personality, and of being in reality something else, say a stinging nettle. The girl carried her patent royal of youth and innocence on her face. He made up his mind to say nothing about the check, to lose the ten dollars, and, since dollars were so far from plenty with him, to sacrifice some luxury for the luxury of the loss. He made
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     75"/>

up his mind that he could very well do without the book with colored plates of South American butterflies which he had thought of purchasing. Much better live without that than rub the bloom off a better than butterfly's wing. Better anything than disturb that look of innocent ignorance on that girl's little face.</p>

CHAPTER VI

<p>IT was the next day that Randolph Anderson, on his way home at noon, saw ahead of him, just as he turned the corner from Main to Elm street, where his own house was, a knot of boys engaged in what he at first thought was a fight or its preliminaries. There was a great clamor, too. In the boughs of a maple in the near-by yard were two robins wrangling; underneath were the boys. The air was full of the sweet jangle of birds and boyish trebles, for all the boys were young. Anderson, as he came up, glanced indifferently at the turbulent group and saw one boy who seemed to be the centre of contention. He was backed up against the fence, an ornate iron affair backed by a thick hedge, the green leaves of which pricked through the slender iron uprights. In front of this green, iron-grated wall, which was higher than his head, for he was a little fellow, stood a boy, who Anderson saw at a glance was the same one whom he had seen with the Carrolls in church the day before. His hair was rather long and a toss of dark curls. His face was as tenderly pretty as his sister's, whom he strongly resembled, although he was somewhat fairer of complexion. But it was full of the utmost bravado of rage and defiance, and his two small hands were clinched, until the knuckles whitened, in the faces of the little crowd who confronted him. The color had not left his face, for his cheeks burned like roses, but his pretty mouth was hard set and his black eyes blazed. The boys danced and made threat-
<pb n="77     THE DEBTOR"/>

ening feints at him. They called out confused taunts and demands whose purport Anderson at first did not comprehend, but the boy never swerved. When one of his tormentors came nearer, out swung the little white fist at him, and the other invariably dodged.</p>
<p>Anderson's curiosity grew. He went closer. Amidon and Ray, the postmaster, on his way home to his dinner, also joined him, and the little barber, smelling strongly of scented soap and witch-hazel. They stood listening interestedly.</p>
<p>"Most too many against one," remarked the post-master.</p>
<p>"He don't look scared," said Amidon. "He's Southern, and he's got grit. He's backed up there like the whole Confederacy."</p>
<p>A kindly look overspread the sleek, conceited face of the man. His forebears were from Alabama. His father had been a small white slave-owner who had drifted North, in a state of petty ruin after the war, and there Amidon, who had been a child at the time, had grown up and married the thrifty woman who supported him. The wrangle increased, the boys danced more energetically; the small fists of the boy at bay were on closer guard.</p>
<p>"Hi, there!" sung out Amidon. "Look at here; there's too many of ye. Look out ye don't git into no mischief, now."</p>
<p>"Hullo, boys! what's the trouble?" shouted the post-master, in a voice of authority. He was used to running these same boys out of his office when they became too boisterous during the distribution of the mails, making precipitate dashes from the inner sanctum of the United States government. They were accustomed to the sound of his important shout, and a few eyes rolled over shoulder at him. But they soon plunged again into their little whirlpool of excitement, for they were quick-
<pb n="78      THE DEBTOR"/>

witted and not slow to reason that they were now on the king's highway where they had as much right as the postmaster, and could not be coerced under his authority.</p>
<p>"What is it all about ?" the postmaster called, loudly, above the hubbub, to Anderson.</p>
<p>Anderson shook his head. He was listening to the fusillade of taunting, threatening yells, with his forehead knitted. Then all at once he understood. Over and over, with every pitch possible to the boyish threats, the cry intermingling and crossing until all the vowels and consonants overlapped, the boys repeated: "Yerlie--yerlie-yerlie--" They clipped the reproach short; they elongated it into a sliding thrill. From one boy, larger than the others, and whose voice was changing, came at intervals the demand, in a hoarse, cracking treble, with sudden descents into gulfs of bass: "Take it ba-ck! Take it ba-ck!"</p>
<p>Always in response to that demand of the large boy, who was always the one who danced closest to the boy at bay, came the reply, in a voice like a bird's, "Die first-die first."</p>
<p>After a most energetic dash of this large boy, Anderson stepped up and caught him by the shoulder on his retreat from the determined little fist. He knew the large boy; he was a nephew of Henry Lee, whose wife had invaded the Carroll house in the absence of the family.</p>
<p>"See here, Harry," said Anderson, "what is this about, eh?"</p>
<p>The large boy, who, in spite of his size, was a youngster, looked at once terrifiedly and pugnaciously into his face, and beginning with a whimper of excuse to Anderson, ended with a snarl of wrath for the other boy. "He tells lies, he does. He tells lies. Ya-h!" The boy danced at the other even under Anderson's restrain-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     79"/>

ing hand on his shoulder. "Yerlie--yerlie! Ya-h!" he yelled, and all the others joined in. The chorus was deafening. Anderson's hand on the boy's shoulder tightened. He shook him violently. The boy's cap fell off, and his shock of fair hair waved. He rolled eyes of terrified wonder at his captor. "What, wha-at?--" he stammered. "You lemme be. You--Wha-at?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what, you big bully, you," said Anderson, sternly. "That boy there is one to a dozen, and he's the smallest of the lot--he's half your size. Now, what in thunder are you all about, badgering that little chap so?"</p>
<p>A sudden silence prevailed. They all stood looking from under lowered eyebrows at the group of watching men; their small shoulders under their little school-jackets were seen to droop; scarcely a boy but shuffled his right leg, while their hands, which had been gyrating fists, unclinched and twitched at their sides. But the boy did not relax for a second his expression of leaping, bounding rage, of a savage young soul in a feeble body. Now he included Anderson and the other men. He held his head with the haughtiness of a prince. He seemed to question them with silent wrath.</p>
<p>"Who are you who dare to come here and interfere in my quarrel?" he seemed to say. "I was sufficient unto myself. I needed none of your protection. What if I was one to a dozen? Look at <hi rend=italic">me!</hi>" His little hands did not for a second unclinch. He was really very young, probably no more than ten. He was scarcely past his babyhood, but he was fairly impressive, not the slightest maturity of mind, but of spirit. He could never take a fiercer stand against odds than now if he lived to be a hundred.</p>
<p>Anderson approached him, in spite of himself, with
<pb n="80     THE DEBTOR"/>

a certain respect. "What is the matter, young man?" he, inquired, gravely.</p>
<p>"The boy regarded him with silent resentment and scorn; he did not deign an answer. But the big boy replied for him promptly:</p>
<p>"He--he said his father kept a tame elephant when they lived in New York State, and he--he used to ride him--"</p>
<p>He spoke in; a tone of aggrieved virtue, and regarded the other with a scowl. The men guffawed, and after a second the boys also. Then a little fellow behind the ringleader offered additional testimony.</p>
<p>"He said he used to get up a private circus once a week, every Saturday, and charge ten cents a head, and made ten dollars a week," he said. Then his voice of angry accusation ended in a chuckle.</p>
<p>Anderson kept his face quite grave, but all the others joined in the chorus of merriment. The little fellow backed against the iron fence gave an incredulous start at the sound of the laughter, then the red roses faded out on his smooth cheeks and he went quite white. The laughter stung his very soul as no recrimination could have done. He suffered tortures of mortified pride. His fists were still clinched, but his proud lip quivered a little. He looked very young--a baby.</p>
<p>Anderson stepped to his aid. He raised his voice. "Now, look here, boys,": he said. But he made no headway against the hilarity, which swelled higher and higher. The crowd increased.  Several more men and boys were on the outskirts. An ally pressed through the crowd to Anderson's side.</p>
<p>"Now, boys," he proclaimed, and for a moment his thin squeak weighted with importance gained a hearing--"now, boys," said the barber, "this, little feller's father is an extinguished new denizen of Banbridge, and you ain't treatin' of him with proper disrespect.
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     81"/>

<p>Now--" But then his voice was drowned in a wilder outburst than ever. The little crowd of men and boys went fairly mad with hysterical joy of mirth, as an American crowd will when once overcome by the humor of the situation in the midst of their stress of life. They now laughed at the little barber and the boy. The old familiar butt had joined forces with the new ones.</p>
<p>"They have formed a trust," said Amidon, deserting his partisanship, now that it had assumed this phase of harmless jocularity. But the boy at bay, as the laughter at his expense increased, was fairly frantic. He lost what he had hither--to retained, his self-possession. "I tell you I did!" he suddenly screamed out, in a sweet screech, like an angry bird, which commanded the ears of the crowd from its strangeness. "I tell you I did have an elephant, I did ride him, and I did have a circus every Saturday afternoon, so there!"</p>
<p>The "so there" was tremendous. The words vanished in the sound. The boyish expression denoting triumphant climax became individual, the language of one soul. He fired the words at them all like a charge of shot. There was a pause of a second, then the laughter and mocking were recommencing. But Anderson took advantage of the lull.</p>
<p>"See here, boys, he shouted, "there's been enough of this. What is it to you whether he had a dozen elephants and rode them all at once, and had a circus every day in the week with a dozen tame bears thrown in? Clear out and go home and get your dinners. Clear out! Vamoose! Scatter!" His tone was at once angry and appealing. It implied authority and comradeship.</p>
<p>Anderson had given great promise as a speaker during his college course. He was a man who, if he exerted himself, could gauge the temper of a mob. The men
<pb n="THE DEBTOR       82"/>

on the outskirts began moving away easily; the boys followed their example. The little barber took the boy familiarly by the arm.</p>
<p>"Now, you look at here," said he. "Don't you hev them chaps a-pesterin' of you no more, an' ef they do, you jest streak right into my parlor an' I'll take care of ye. See?"</p>
<p>The boy twitched his arm away and eyed the barber witheringly. "I don't want anything to do with you nor your old barber-shop," said he.</p>
<p>"You had better run along, John," said Anderson to the barber, who was staring amazedly, although the complacent smirk upon his face was undiminished.</p>
<p>"I guess he's a child kinder given to speakin' at tandem," he said, as he complied with Anderson's advice.</p>
<p>The boy turned at once to the man. "What business had that barber telling me to go into his old barber-shop?" demanded he. "I ain't afraid of all the boys in this one-horse town."</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"I did have an elephant when I lived in Hillfield, and I did ride him, and I did have circuses every Saturday," said the boy, with challenge.</p>
<p>Anderson said nothing.</p>
<p>"At least--" said the child, in a modified tone.</p>
<p>Anderson looked at him with an air of polite waiting.</p>
<p>The boy's roses bloomed again. "At least--" he faltered, "at least--" A maid rang a dinner-bell frantically in the doorway of the house near which they were standing. Anderson glanced at her, then back at the boy. "At least--" said the boy, with a blurt of confidence which yielded nothing, but implied the recognition of a friend and understander in the man--" at--least I used to make believe I had an elephant when I lived in Hillfield."</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     83"/>

<p>"Yes?" said Anderson. He made a movement to go, and the boy still kept at his side.</p>
<p>"And--" he added, but still with no tone of apology or confession, "I might have had an elephant."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Anderson, "you might have."</p>
<p>"And they did not know but what I might," said the boy, angrily.</p>
<p>Anderson nodded judicially. "That's so, I suppose; only elephants are not very common as setter dogs for a boy to have around these parts."
<p>"It was a setter dog," said the boy, with a burst of innocence and admiration. "How did you know?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I guessed."</p>
<p>"You must be real smart," said the boy. "My father said he thought you were, and somehow had got stranded in a grocery store. Did you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did," replied Anderson.</p>
<p>Anderson was now walking quite briskly towards home and dinner, and the boy was trotting by his side, with seemingly no thought of parting. They proceeded in silence for a few steps; then the boy spoke again.</p>
<p>"I began with the setter dog," said he. "His name was Archie, and he used to jump over the roof of a part of our house as high as"--he looked about and pointed conclusively at the ell of a house across the street--" as high as that," he said, with one small pink finger indicating unwaveringly.</p>
<p>"That must have been quite a jump," remarked Anderson, and his voice betrayed nothing.</p>
<p>"That setter was an awful jumper," said the little boy. "He died last winter. My sisters cried, but I didn't." His voice trembled a little.</p>
<p>"He must have been a fine dog," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, he could jump. I think that piece of our house he used to jump over was higher than that," said the boy, reflectively, with the loving tone of a panegyrist
<pb n="84     THE DEBTOR"/>

who would heap more and more honors and flowers upon a dear departed.</p>
<p>"A big jump," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, he was an awful jumper. Those boys they said I lied. First they said he couldn't do it, then they said I didn't have any dog, and then I--"</p>
<p>"And then you said you had the elephant?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Say, you ain't going to tell 'em what I've told you?"</p>
<p>"You better believe I'm not. But I tell you one thing--next time, if you'll take my advice, you had better stick to the setter dog and let elephants alone."</p>
<p>"Maybe it would be better," said the boy. Then he added, with a curious sort of naive slyness, "But I haven't said I didn't have any elephant."</p>
<p>"That's so," said Anderson.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as the two walked along, the man felt a hard, hot little hand slide into his. "I guess you must be an awful smart man," said the boy.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" said Anderson, in lieu of a disclaimer, which somehow he felt would seem to savor of mock modesty in the face of this youthful enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Why, don't you know?" asked the boy, in some wonder. "I thought everybody knew who we were. I am Captain Carroll's son. My name is. Eddy Carroll."</p>
<p>"I knew you were Captain Carroll's so, but I did not know your first name."</p>
<p>"I knew you," said the boy. "I saw you out in the field catching butterflies."</p>
<p>"Where were you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I was fishing. I was under those willows by the brook. I kept pretty still, aid you didn't see me. Have to lay low while you're fishing, you know."</p>
<p>"Of course," said Anderson.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      85 "/>

<p>"I'll didn't catch anything. I don't believe fish are very thick in the brooks around here. I used to catch great big fellers, when I lived in Hillfield. One day--"</p>
<p>"When do you have your dinner at home?" broke in Anderson.</p>
<p>"'Most any time. Say, Mr. Anderson, what are you going to have for dinner?"</p>
<p>Anderson happened to know quite well what he was going to have for dinner, because he had himself ordered it on the way to the store that morning. He answered at once:</p>
<p>"Roast lamb and green pease and new potatoes," said he.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said the boy, with unmistakable emphasis.</p>
<p>"And I am quite sure there is going to be a cherry-dumpling for desert," said Anderson, reflectively.</p>
<p>"I like all those things," stated the boy, with emphasis that was pathetic.</p>
<p>The man stopped and looked down at the boy. "Now, see here, my friend," said he. "Honest, now, no dodging. Never mind if you do like things. Honest--you can't cheat me, you know--"</p>
<p>The boy looked back at him with eyes of profound simplicity and faith. "I know it," he replied.</p>
<p>"Well, then, now you tell me, honest, if you do stay and have dinner with me won't your folks, your mother and your sisters, worry?"</p>
<p>The boy's face, which had been rather anxious, cleared at once. "Oh no, sir!" he replied. "Amy never worries, and Ina and Charlotte won't."</p>
<p>"Who is Amy?"</p>
<p>"Amy? Why, Amy is my mother, of course."</p>
<p>"And you are sure she won't worry?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, sir." The boy fairly laughed at the idea.</p>
<p>His honesty in this at least seemed unmistakable.</p>
<pb n="86     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"Well, then," said Anderson, "come along and have dinner with me."</p>
<p>The boy fairly leaped with delight as, still clinging to the man's hand, he passed up the little walk to the Anderson house. He could smell the roast lamb and the green pease.</p>

CHAPTER VII

<p>ARTHUR CARROLL went on business to the City every morning. He brought up to the station in the smart trap, the liveried coachman, with the mute majesty of his kind, throned upon the front seat. Sometimes one of Carroll's daughters, as delicately gay as a flower in her light daintiness of summer attire, was with him. Often the boy, with his outlook of innocent impudence, sat beside the coachman. Carroll himself was always irreproachably clad in the very latest of the prevailing style. Had he not been such a masterly figure of a man, he would have been open to the charge of dandyism. He was always gloved; he even wore a flower in the lapel of his gray coat. He carried always, whatever the state of the weather, an eminent umbrella with a carved-ivory handle. He equipped himself with as many newspapers from the stand as would an editor of a daily paper. The other men drew conclusions that it was highly necessary for him to study the state of the market and glean the truth from the various reports.</p>
<p>One morning Henry Lee was also journeying to the City on the eight-o'clock train. He held a $2500 position in a publisher's office, and felt himself as good as any man in Banbridge, with the possible exception of this new-comer, and he accosted him with regard to his sheaf of newspapers.</p>
<p>"Going to have all the news there is?" he inquired, jocularly.</p>
<pb n="88      THE DEBTOR"/>

Carroll looked up and smiled and nodded. "Well, yes," he replied. "I find this my only way--read them all and strike an average. There is generally a kernel of truth in each."</p>
<p>"That's so," said Lee.</p>
<p>Carroll glanced speculatively at the ostentatiously squared shoulders of the other man as he passed through the car.</p>
<p>When the train reached Jersey City, Carroll, leaving his newspapers fluttering about the seat he had occupied, passed off the train and walked with his air of careless purpose along the platform.</p>
<p>"This road is a pretty poorly conducted concern," said a voice behind him, and Lee came up hurriedly and joined him.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Carroll, tentatively. His was not the order of mind which could realize its own aggrandizement by wholesale criticism of a great railroad system for the sake of criticism, and, moreover, he had a certain pride and self-respect about maintaining the majesty of that which he must continue to patronize for his own ends.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Lee, moving, as he spoke, with a sort of accelerated motion like a strut. He was a much shorter man than Carroll, and he made futile hops to get into step with him as they proceeded. "Yes, sir, every train through the twenty-four hours is late on this road."</p>
<p>Carroll laughed. "I confess that rather suits me, on the whole. I am usually late myself."</p>
<p>They walked together to the ferry-slip, and the boat was just going out.</p>
<p>"Always lose this boat," grumbled Lee, importantly.</p>
<p>Carroll looked at his watch, then replaced it silently.</p>
<p>"Going to miss an appointment?" questioned Lee.</p>
<p>"No, think not. These boats sail pretty often."</p>
<p>"I wish the train-service was as good," said Lee.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     89"/>

<p>The two men stood together until the next boat came in, then boarded it, and took seats outside, as it was a fine day. They separated a couple of blocks from the pier. Lee was obliged to take an up-town Elevated.</p>
<p>"I suppose you don't go my way?" he said to Carroll, wistfully.</p>
<p>"No," said Carroll, smiling and shaking the ashes from his cigar. Both men had smoked all the way across--Carroll's cigars.</p>
<p>"And I tell you they were the real thing," Lee told his admiring wife that night. "Cost fifteen cents apiece, if they cost a penny; no cheap cigars for him, I can tell you."</p>
<p>Carroll said good-morning out of his atmosphere of fragrant smoke, and Lee, with a parting wave of the hand, began his climb of the Elevated stairs. He cast a backward look at Carroll's broad, gray shoulders swinging up the street. Even a momentary glimpse was enough to get a strong impression of the superiority of the man among the crowd of ordinary men hastening to their offices.</p>
<p>"I wonder where he is going? I wonder where his office is?" Lee said to himself, accelerating his pace a little as the station began to quiver with an approaching train.</p>
<p>What Lee asked himself many another man in Banbridge asked, but no one knew. No one dared to put the question directly to Carroll himself.</p>
<p>Arthur Carroll had never been a man who opened wide all the doors of his secrets of life to all his friends and acquaintances. Some had one entrance, some another, and it is probable that he always reserved ways of entrance and egress unknown to any except himself. At the very time that he evaded the solicitude of Banbridge with regard to his haunts in the City he was more than open, even ostentatious concerning them
<pb n="90     THE DEBTOR"/>

to some parties in the City itself, but he was silent regarding Banbridge. It may have been for the reason that he did not for the present wish to mix the City and Banbridge, that he wished to preserve mysteries concerning himself in the regard of both. It is certain that nobody in his office, where he roused considerable speculation even among a more engrossed and less inquisitive class, knew where he lived. The office had not heard of Banbridge; Banbridge had heard of the office, but knew nothing about it. The office, in a way, was not nearly as wise as Banbridge, for it knew nothing whatever of his family affairs. There was therein much speculation and, more than that, heart-burning as to whether Captain Carroll was or was not married. In the inner office, whence issued a mad tick of type-writers all through business hours, were two girls, one quite young and very pretty, the other also young, but not so pretty, both working for very small returns. There was also a book-keeper, a middle-aged man, and vibrating from the inner to the outer office was a young fellow with an innocent, high forehead and an eager, anxious outlook of brown eyes and a fashion of seeming to hang suspended on springs of readiness for motion when an order should come.</p>
<p>This young fellow, who sped in and out with that alacrity at the word of command, who hastened on errands with such impetus that he inspired alarm among the imaginative, had acquired a curious springiness about his hips that almost gave the effect of dislocation. He winked very fast, having gotten a nervous trick. He hurried ceaselessly. He had upon him the profound conviction of not time enough and the need of haste. He was in love with the prettier of the stenographers, and his heart was torn when he heard the surmises as to his employer's married or single estate. He used to watch Carroll when he left the office at
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     91"/>

night, and satisfied himself that he turned towards Sixth Avenue, and then he satisfied himself no more. Carroll plunged into mystery at night as he did for Banbridge in the morning. It was borne in upon the clerk who had an opulent imagination that Carroll was a great swell and went every night to one of the swellest of the up-town clubs, where he resided in luxury and the most genteel and lordly dissipation. He had, at the same time, a jealousy of and a profound pride in Carroll. Carroll himself had a sort of kindly scorn of him, and treated him very well. He was not of the description of weak character who antagonized him.</p>
<p>As for the girls in the inner office, Carroll only recognized them there. Seen on the street, away from the environment, he would simply not have dreamed he had ever seen them. He knew them only in their frames. As for the middle-aged man at the book-keeper's desk, he disturbed him in a way that he would not admit to himself. He spoke to him rather curtly. If he could avoid speaking to him he did so. He had a way of sending directions to the book-keeper by the young man. The book-keeper, if he also surmised Carroll's private life, gave no sign, although he had ample time. He sat at his desk faithfully from eight o'clock until half-past four, but the work which he had to do was somewhat amazing to a mind which stopped to reason. Sometimes even this man, who understood the world in general as a place to be painfully clambered and tramped and even crawled over, to the accomplishment of the ulterior end of remaining upon it at all, and who paid very little attention to other people's affairs, except as they directly concerned the tragic pettiness of his own, wondered a little at the nature of the accounts which he faithfully kept.</p>
<p>This book-keeper, whose name was William Allbright, lived in Harlem, so far up that it seemed fairly in the
<pb n="92     THE DEBTOR"/>

country, and on the second floor of a small, ancient building which, indeed, belonged to the period when Harlem was country and which remained between two modern apartment houses. The book-keeper had a half-right in a little green backyard, wherein flourished with considerable energy an aged cherry-tree, from which the tenants always fondly hoped for cherries. The cherries never materialized, but the hope was something. The book-keeper's elder sister, who kept house for him, was fond of gazing at the cherry-tree, with its scanty spread of white blossoms, and dreaming of cherries. She was the fonder because she had almost no dreams left. It is rather sad that even dreams go, as well as actualities. However, the sister seemed not to mind so very much. Very little, except the pleasure which she took in watching the cherry-tree, gave evidence that she lamented anything that she had lost or merely missed in life. In general she had an air of such utter placidity and acquiescence that it almost amounted to numbness. The book-keeper at this time of year scratched away every evening with a hoe and trowel in his half of the backyard, where he was making a tiny garden-patch.</p>
<p>The garden represented to him, as the tree did to his sister, his one ladder by which his earthly dreams might climb higher. One night he came home and there were three green spears of corn piercing the mould, and he fairly chuckled.</p>
<p>"The corn has come up," said he.</p>
<p>"So it has," said his sister.</p>
<p>A widow woman and her son, who worked in one of the great retail stores, lived down-stairs in the building. The young man, rather consequential but interested, strolled out in the backyard and surveyed the corn.</p>
<p>The widow, who was consumptive, thrust her head and shoulders, muffled in a white shawl, out of her kitchen window into the soft spring air.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     93"/>

<p>"So the corn has come up," said the son, throwing himself back on his heels with a lordly air. The mother smiled dimly at the green spears from between the woolly swaths of her shawl. She coughed, and pulled the white fleece closely over her mouth and nose. Then only her eyes were visible, which looked young as they gazed at the green spears of corn. The book-keeper nodded his elderly, distinctly commonplace, and unimportant head with the motion of a conqueror who marshals armies.</p>
<p>After all, it is something for a man to be able to call into life, even if under the force which includes him also, the new life of the spring. It is a power like that of a child in leading-strings, but still power. After the mother and son had gone away and he and his sister were still out in the cool, and the great evening star had come out and it was too dark to work any longer, for the first time he said something about the queer accounts in his books in Captain Carroll's office.</p>
<p>"I suppose it is all right," he said, leaning a second on his hoe and staring up at the star, "but sometimes my books and the accounts I keep look rather--strange to me."</p>
<p>"He pays you regularly, doesn't he?" inquired the sister. The question of pay could sting her from her numbness. Once there had been a period, years ago, before Carroll's advent, of no pay.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," replied the brother. "He pays me. He has never been more than a week behind. Captain Carroll seems like a very smart man. I wonder where he lives. I don't believe anybody in the office knows. He went away very early this afternoon. I don't know whether he lives in the City or in the country. I thought maybe if he did live in the country he wanted to get home and go driving or something."</p>
<pb n="94    THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>It had been as the book-keeper surmised. Carroll had gone early to his home in the country with the idea of a drive. But when he reached home he found a state of affairs which precluded the drive. It seemed that young Eddy Carroll was given to romancing in more respects than one, and had not told the truth to Anderson when he had been asked if his family would feel anxious at his non-return to dinner. Eddy knew quite well that they would be anxious. In spite of a certain temperamental aversion to worry, the boy's mother and sisters were wont to become quite actively agitated if he failed to appear at expected times and seasons. Eddy Carroll, in the course of a short life, had contrived to find the hard side of many little difficulties. He had gotten into divers forms of mischief; he had met with many accidents. He had been almost drowned; he had broken an arm; he had been hit in the forehead by a stone thrown by another boy.</p>
<p>When Arthur Carroll reached home that afternoon he found his wife in hysterical tears, his sister trying to comfort her, and the two daughters and the maid were scouring the town in search of the boy. School was out, and he had still not come home. Carroll heard the news before he reached home, from the coachman who met him at the station.</p>
<p>"Mr. Eddy did not come home this noon," said the man, with much deference. He was full of awe at his employer, being a simple sort, and this was his second place, his first having been with the salt of the earth who made no such show as Carroll. He reasoned that virtue and appearances must increase according to the same ratio. "Mrs. Carroll sent me to the school this noon," said the man, further, "and the ladies are very much worried. The young ladies and Marie are out trying to find him." Marie was the maid, a Hungarian girl.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     95"/>

<p>"Well, drive home as fast as you can," said Carroll, with a sigh. He reflected that his drive was spoiled; he also reflected that when the boy was found he should be punished. Yet he did not look out of temper, and, in fact, was not. It was in reality almost an impossibility for Arthur Carroll to be out of temper with one of his own family.</p>
<p>When Carroll reached home his wife came running down the stairs in a long, white tea-gown, and flung her arms around his neck. "Oh, Arthur!" she sobbed out. "What do you think has happened? What do you think?"</p>
<p>Carroll raised his wife's lovely face, all flushed and panting with grief and terror like a child's, and kissed it softly. "Nothing, Amy; nothing, dear," he said. "Don't, my darling. You will make yourself ill. Nothing has happened."</p>
<p>His sister Anna's voice, clear and strained, came from the top of the stairs. She stood there, holding an unbuttoned dressing-sack tightly across her bosom. The day was warm and neither of the ladies had dressed. "But, Arthur, he has not been home since morning," said Anna Carroll, "and Martin has been to the school-house, and the master says that Eddy did not return at all after the noon intermission, and he did not come home to dinner, after all."</p>
<p>"Yes, he did not come home to dinner," said Mrs. Carroll; "and the butcher did send the roast of veal, after all. I was afraid he would not, because he had not been paid for so long, and I thought Eddy would come home so hungry. But the butcher did send it, but Eddy did not come. He cannot have had a thing to eat since morning, and all he had for breakfast were rolls and coffee. The egg-woman would not leave any more eggs, she said, until she was paid for the last two lots, and--"
<pb n="96     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Carroll pulled out a wallet and handed a roll of notes, not to his wife, but to his sister Anna, who came half-way down the stairs and reached down a long, slender white arm for it.</p>
<p>"There," said he, "pay up the butcher and the egg-woman to-morrow. At least--"</p>
<p>"I understand," said Anna, nodding.</p>
<p>"What do you care whether the butcher or the egg-woman are paid or not, when all the boy we've got is lost?" asked Mrs. Carroll, looking up into her husband's face with the tears rolling over her cheeks.</p>
<p>"That's so," said Anna, and she gave the roll of notes a toss away from her with a passionate gesture. "Arthur, where do you suppose he is?"</p>
<p>The notes fell over the banisters into the hall below. Carroll watched them touch the floor as he answered, "My dear sister, I don't know, but boys have played truant before, and survived it; and I have strong hopes of our dear boy." Carroll's voice, though droll, was exceedingly soft and soothing. He put an arm again around his wife, drew her close to him, and pressed her head against his shoulder. "Dear, you will be ill," he said. "The boy is all right."</p>
<p>"I am sure this time he is shot," moaned Mrs. Carroll.</p>
<p>"My dear Amy!"</p>
<p>"Now, Arthur, you can laugh," said his sister, coming down the stairs, the embroidered ruffles of her white cambric skirt fluttering around her slender ankles in pink silk stockings, and her little feet thrust into French-heeled slippers, one of which had an enormous bow and buckle, the other nothing at all. "You may laugh," said Anna Carroll, in a sweet, challenging voice, "but why is it so unlikely? Eddy Carroll has had everything but shooting happen to him."</p>
<p>"Yes, he has been everything except shot," moaned Mrs. Carroll.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     97"/>

<p>"My dearest dear, don't worry over such a thing as that!"</p>
<p>"But, Arthur," pleaded Mrs. Carroll, "what else is there left for us to worry about?"</p>
<p>Carroll's mouth twitched a little, but he looked and spoke quite gravely. "Well," he said, "I am going now, and I shall find the boy and bring him home safe and sound, and--Amy, darling, have you eaten anything?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Arthur," cried his wife, reproachfully, "do you think I could eat when Eddy did not come home to dinner, and always something dreadful has happened other times when he has not come? Eddy has never stayed away just for mischief, and then come home as good as ever. Something has always happened which has been the reason."</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps he has stayed away for mischief alone, and that is what has happened now instead of the shooting," said Carroll.</p>
<p>"Arthur, if--if he has, you surely will not--"</p>
<p>"Arthur, you will not punish that boy if he does come home again safe and sound?" cried his sister.</p>
<p>Carroll laughed. "Have either of you eaten anything?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Of course not," replied his sister, indignantly.</p>
<p>" How could we, dear?" said his wife. "I had thought I was quite hungry, and when the butcher sent the roast, after all--"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I had better wait and not pay him until he does not send anything," murmured Anna Carroll, as if to herself. "And when the roast did come, I was glad, but, after all, I could not touch it."</p>
<p>"Well, you must both eat to-night to make up for it," said Carroll.</p>
<p>"I had thought you would as soon have it cold for dinner to-night," said Mrs. Carroll, in her soft, com-
<pb n="98     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>plaining voice. "We would not have planned it for our noon lunch, but we were afraid to ask the butcher for chops, too, and as long as there were no eggs for breakfast, we felt the need of something substantial; but, of course, when that darling boy did not come, and we had reason to think he was shot, we could not--" Mrs. Carroll leaned weepingly against her husband, but he put her from him gently.</p>
<p>"Now, Amy, dearest," said he, "I am going to find Eddy and bring him home, and--you say Marie has gone to hunt for him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she went in one direction, and Ina and Charlotte in others," said Anna Carroll.</p>
<p>"Well," said Carroll, "I will send Marie home at once, and I wish you would see that she prepares an early dinner, and then we can go for a drive afterwards."</p>
<p>"Eddy can go, too," said Mrs. Carroll, quite joyously.</p>
<p>"No, Amy," said Carroll, "he will most certainly not go to drive with us. There are times when you girls must leave the boy to me, and this is one of them." He stopped and kissed his wife's appealing face, and went out. Then the carriage rolled swiftly round the curve of drive.</p>
<p>"He will whip him," said Anna to Mrs. Carroll, who looked at her with a certain defiance.</p>
<p>"Well," said she, "if he does, I suppose it will be for his good. A man, of course, knows how to manage a boy better than a woman, because he has been a boy himself. You know you and I never were boys, Anna."</p>
<p>"I know that, Amy," said Anna, quite seriously, "and I am willing to admit that a man may know better how to deal with a boy than a woman does, but I must confess that when I think of Arthur punishing Eddy for the faults he may have--"</p>
<p>"May have what?" demanded Mrs. Carroll, quite sharply for her.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     99"/>

<p>"May have inherited from Arthur," declared Anna, boldly, with soft eyes of challenge upon her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>"Eddy has no faults worth mentioning," responded Mrs. Carroll, seeming to enlarge with a sort of fluffy fury like an angry bird; "and the idea of your saying he inherits them from his father. You know as well as I do, Anna, what Arthur is."</p>
<p>"I knew Arthur before you ever did," said Anna, apologetically. "Don't get excited, dear."
<p>"I am not excited, but I do wonder at your speaking after such a fashion when we don't know what may have happened to the dear boy. Of course Arthur will not punish him if he is shot or anything."</p>
<p>"Of course not."</p>
<p>"And if he is not shot, and Arthur should punish him, of course it will be all right."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose it will, Amy," said Anna Carroll.</p>
<p>"Arthur feels so sure that nothing has happened to him that I begin to think so myself," said Mrs. Carroll, beginning to ascend the stairs with a languid grace.</p>
<p>"Yes, he has encouraged me," assented Anna. "I suppose we had better dress now."</p>
<p>"Yes, if we are going to drive directly after dinner. I'll put on my cream foulard, it is so warm. I suppose we have, perhaps, worried a little more than was necessary."</p>
<p>"I dare say," said Anna, trailing her white frills and laces before her sister the length of the upper hall. "I think I'll wear my blue embroidered linen."</p>
<p>"You said the bill for that came yesterday?"</p>
<p>"No, six weeks ago; certainly six weeks ago. You know I had it made very early. Oh yes, the second or third bill did come yesterday. I have had so many, I get mixed over those bills."</p>
<p>"Well, it is a right pretty gown, and I would wear it if I were you," said Mrs. Carroll.</p>

CHAPTER VIII

<p>SHORTLY after Captain Carroll started upon his search for his missing son, Randolph Anderson, sitting peacefully in his back office, by the riverward window, was rudely interrupted. He was mounting some new specimens. Before him the great tiger cat lay blissfully on his red cushion. He was not asleep, but was purring loudly in what resembled a human day-dream. His claws luxuriously pricked through the velvet of his paws, which were extended in such a way that he might have served as a model for a bas-relief of a cat running a race. Now and then the tip of his tail curled and uncurled with an indescribable effect of sensuousness. The green things in the window-box had grown luxuriantly, and now and then trailing vines tossed up past the window in the infrequent puffs of wind. The afternoon was very warm. The temperature had risen rapidly since noon. Down below the wide window ran the river, unseen except for a subtle, scarcely perceptible glow of the brilliant sunlight upon the water. It was a rather muddy stream, but at certain times it caught the sunlight and tossed it back as from the facets of brown jewels.</p>
<p>The murmur of the river was plainly audible in the room. It was very loud, for the stream's current was still high with the spring rains. The rustle of the trees which grew on the river-bank was also discernible, and might have been the rustle of the garments of nymphs tossed about their supple limbs by the warm breeze.
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     101"/>

<p>In fact, a like fancy occurred to Anderson as he sat there mounting his butterflies.</p>
<p>"I don't wonder those old Greeks had their tales about nymphs closeted in trees," he thought, for the rustle of the green boughs had suggested the rustle of women's draperies.</p>
<p>Then he remembered how Charlotte Carroll's skirts had rustled as she went out of the store that last afternoon when he had spoken to her. There was a soft crispness of ruffling lawns and laces, a most delicate sound, a maidenly sound which had not been unlike the sound of the young leaves of the willows overfolding and interlacing with one another when the soft breeze swelled high. Now and then all the afternoon came a slow, soft wave of warm wind out of the west, and all sounds deepened before it, even the purring song of the cat seemed to increase, and possibly did, from the unconscious assertion of his own voice in the peaceful and somnolent chorus of nature. It was only spring as yet, but the effect was as of a long summer afternoon. Anderson, who was always keenly sensitive to all phases of nature and all atmospheric conditions, was affected by it. He realized himself sunken in drowsy, unspeculative contentment. Even the strange, emotional unrest and effervescence, which had been more or less over him since he had seen Charlotte Carroll, was in abeyance. After all, he was not a passionate man, and he was not very young. The young girl seemed to become merely a part of the gracious harmony which was lulling his soul and his senses to content and peace. He was conscious of wondering what a man could want more than he had, as if he had suspected himself of guilt in that direction.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, pell-mell into the office, startling the great cat to that extent that he sprang from his red cushion on the window-ledge, and slunk, flattening his
<pb n="102     THE DEBTOR"/>

long body against the floor, under the table, came the boy Eddy Carroll. The boy stood staring at him rather shamefacedly, though every muscle in his small bodym seemed on a twitch with the restrained impulse of flight.</p>
<p>"Well," said Anderson, finally, "what's the trouble, sir?"</p>
<p>Then the boy found his tongue. He came close to the man.</p>
<p>"Say," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "jest let a feller stay in here a minute, will you?"</p>
<p>Anderson nodded readily. He understood, or thought he did. He immediately jumped to the conclusion that the teasing boys were at work again. He felt a little astonished at this headlong flight to cover of the boy who had so manfully stood at bay a few hours before. However, he was a little fellow, and there had been a good many of his opponents. He felt a pleasant thrill of fatherliness and protection. He looked kindly into the little, pink-flushed face. "Very well, my son," said he. "Stay as long as you like. Take a seat." The boy sat down. His legs were too short for his feet to touch the floor, so he swung them. He gazed ingratiatingly at Anderson, and now and then cast an apprehensive glance towards the door of the office. Anderson continued mounting his butterflies, and paid no attention to him, and the boy seemed to respect his silence. Presently the great cat emerged quite boldly from his refuge under the table, crouched, calculated the distance, and leaped softly back to his red cushion. The boy hitched his chair nearer, and began stroking the cat gently and lovingly with his little boy-hand, hardened with climbing and playing. The cat stretched himself luxuriously, pricked his claws in and out, shut his eyes, and purred again quite loudly. Again the little room sang with the song of the river, the wind in the trees, and the cat's
<pb n="103      THE DEBTOR"/>

somnolent note. The afternoon light rippled full of green reflections through the room. The boy's small head appeared in it like a flower. He smiled tenderly at the cat. Anderson, glancing at him over his butterflies, thought what an angelic aspect he had. He looked a darling of a boy.</p>
<p>The boy, stroking the cat, met the man's kindly approving eyes, and he smiled a smile of utter confidence and trust, which conveyed delicious flattery. Then suddenly the hand stroking the cat desisted and made a dive into a small jacket-pocket and emerged with a treasure. It was a great butterfly, much dilapidated as to its gorgeous wings, but the boy looked gloatingly from it to the man.</p>
<p>"I got it for you," he whispered, with another glance at the office door. Anderson recognized, with the dismay of a collector, a fine specimen, which he had sought in vain, made utterly worthless by ruthless handling, but he controlled himself. "Thank you," he said, and took the poor, despoiled beauty and laid it carefully on the table.</p>
<p>"It got broke a little, somehow," remarked the boy; "it's wings are awful brittle."</p>
<p>"Yes, they are," assented Anderson.</p>
<p>"I had to chase it quite a spell," said the boy, with an evident desire not to have his efforts underestimated.</p>
<p>"Yes, I don't doubt it," replied Anderson, with gratitude well simulated.</p>
<p>"It seemed rather a pity to kill such a pretty butterfly as that," remarked the boy, unexpectedly, but I thought you'd like it."</p>
<p>"Yes, I like to have a nice collection of butterflies," replied Anderson, with a faint inflection of apology. In reality, the butterflies' side of it had failed to occur to him before, and he felt that an appeal to science in
<pb n="104     THE DEBTOR"/>

such a case was rather feeble. Then the boy helped him out.</p>
<p>"Well," said he, "I do suppose that a butterfly don't live very long, anyhow; he has to die pretty soon, and it's better for human beings to have him stuck on a pin and put where they can see how handsome he is, rather than have him stay out in the fields, where the rain would soak him into the ground, and that would be the end of him. I suppose it is better to save anything that's pretty, somehow, even if the thing don't like it himself."</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are right," replied Anderson, regarding the boy with some wonder.</p>
<p>"Maybe he didn't mind dying 'cause I caught him any more than just dying himself," said Eddy.</p>
<p>"Maybe not."</p>
<p>"Anyhow, he's dead," said the boy.</p>
<p>He watched Anderson carefully as he manipulated the insect.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry his wing got broken," he said. "I wonder why God makes butterflies' wings so awful brittle that they can't be caught without spoiling 'em. The other wing ain't hurt much, anyhow."</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck Anderson. "Why, when did you get this butterfly?" he asked.</p>
<p>The boy flushed vividly. He gave a sorrowful, obstinate glance at the man, as much as to say, "I am sad that you should force me into such a course, but I must be firm." Then he looked away, staring out of the window at the tree-tops tossing against the brilliant blue of the sky, and made no reply.</p>
<p>Anderson made a swift calculation. He glanced at a clock on the wall. "Where did you get this butterfly?" he inquired, harmlessly, and the boy fell into the net.</p>
<p>"In that field just beyond the oak grove on the road to New Sanderson," he replied, with entire innocence.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     105"/>

<p>Anderson surveyed him sharply.</p>
<p>"When is afternoon school out?" asked Anderson.</p>
<p>"At four o'clock," replied the boy, with such unsuspicion that the man's conscience smote him. It was too easy.</p>
<p>"Well," said Anderson, slowly. He did not look at the boy, but went on straightening the mangled wing of the butterfly which he had offered on his shrine. "Well," he said, "how did you get time to go to that field and catch this butterfly? You say it took a long time, and that field is a good twenty minutes' run from here, and it is a quarter of five now." The boy kicked his feet against the rounds of his chair and made no reply. His forehead was scowling, his mouth set. "How?" repeated Anderson.</p>
<p>Then the boy turned on the man. He slid out of his chair; he spoke loudly. He forgot to glance at the door. "Ain't you smart?" he cried, with scorn, and still with an air of slighted affection which appealed. "Ain't you smart to catch a feller that way? You're mean, if you are a man, after I've got you that big butterfly, too, to turn on a feller that way."</p>
<p>Anderson actually felt ashamed of himself. "Now, see here, my boy," he said, "I'm grateful to you so far as that goes."</p>
<p>"I didn't run away from school," declared Eddy Carroll, looking straight at Anderson, who fairly gasped.</p>
<p>He had seen people lie before, but somehow this was actually dazzling. He was conscious of fairly blinking before the direct gaze of innocence of this lying little boy. And then his elderly and reliable clerk appeared in the office door, glanced at Eddy, whom he did not know, and informed Anderson, in a slightly impressed tone, that Captain Carroll was in the store and would like to speak to him. Anderson glanced again at his young visitor, who had got, in a second, a look of pale
<pb n="106     THE DEBTOR"/>

consternation. He went out into the store at once, and was greeted by Carroll with the inquiry as to whether or not he had seen his son.</p>
<p>"My boy has not been seen since he started for school this morning," said Carroll. "I came here because another little boy, one of my son's small school-fellows, who has succeeded in treading the paths of virtue and obedience, volunteered the information, without the slightest imputation of any guilty conspiracy on your part, that you had been seen leading my son home to your residence to dinner," said Carroll.</p>
<p>"Your son made friends with me on his way from school this noon," said Anderson, simply, "and upon his evident desire to dine with me I invited him, being assured by him that his so doing would not occasion the slightest uneasiness at home as to his whereabouts."</p>
<p>Anderson was indignant at something in the other man's tone, and was careful not to introduce in his tone the slightest inflection of apology.</p>
<p>He made the statement, and was about to add that the boy was at that moment in his office, when Carroll interrupted. "I regret to say that my son has not the slightest idea of what is meant by telling the truth. He never had," he stated, smilingly, "especially when his own desires lead him to falsehood. In those cases he lies to himself so successfully that he tells in effect the truth to other people. He, in that sense, told the truth to you, but the truth was not as he stated, for the ladies have been in a really pitiable state of anxiety."</p>
<p>"He is in my office now," said Anderson, coldly, pointing to the door and beginning to move towards it.</p>
<p>"I suspected the boy was in there," said Carroll, and his tones changed, as did his face. All the urbanity and the smile vanished. He followed Anderson with a nervous stride. Both men entered the little office, but
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     107"/>

the boy was gone. Both stood gazing about the little space. It was absolutely impossible for anybody to be concealed there. There was no available hiding-place except under the table, and the cat occupied that, and his eyes shone out of the gloom like green jewels.</p>
<p>"I don't see him," said Carroll.</p>
<p>Then Anderson turned upon him.</p>
<p>"Sir," he said, with a kind of slow heat, "I am at a loss as to what to attribute your tone and manner. If you doubt--"</p>
<p>"Not at all, my dear sir," replied Carroll, with a wave of the hand. "But I am told that my son is in here, and when, on entering, I do not see him, I am naturally somewhat surprised."</p>
<p>"Your son was certainly in this room when I left it a moment ago, and that is all I know about it," said Anderson. "And I will add that your son's visit was entirely unsolicited--"</p>
<p>"My dear sir," interrupted Carroll again, "I assure you that I do not for a moment conceive the possibility of anything else. But the fact remains that I am told he is here--"</p>
<p>"He was here," said Anderson, looking about with an impatient and bewildered scowl.</p>
<p>"He could not have gone out through the store while we were there," said Carroll, in a puzzled tone.
<p>"I do not see how he could have done so unobserved, certainly."</p>
<p>"The window," said Carroll, taking a step towards it.</p>
<p>"Thirty feet from the ground; sheer wall and rocks below. He could not have gone out there without wings."</p>
<p>"He has no wings, and I very much fear he never will have any at this rate," said Carroll, moving out. "Well, Mr. Anderson, I regret that my son should have annoyed you."</p>
<p>"He has not annoyed me in the least," Anderson re-
<pb n="108     THE DEBTOR"/>

plied, shortly. "I only regret that his peculiar method of telling the truth should have led me unwittingly to occasion your wife and daughters so much anxiety, and I trust that you will soon trace him."</p>
<p>"Oh yes, he will turn up all right," said Carroll, easily. "If he was in your office a moment ago, he cannot be far off."</p>
<p>There was the faintest suggestion of emphasis upon the "if."</p>
<p>Anderson spoke to the elderly clerk, who had been leaning against the shelves ranged with packages of cereal, surmounted by a flaming row of picture advertisements, regarding them and listening with a curious abstraction, which almost gave the impression of stupidity. This man had lived boy and man in one groove of the grocer business, until he needed prodding to shift him momentarily into any other.</p>
<p>In reality he managed most of the details of the selling. He heard what the two men said, and at the same time was considering that he was to send the wagon round the first thing in the morning with pease to the postmaster's, and a new barrel of sugar to the Amidons, and he was calculating the price of sugar at the slight recent rise.</p>
<p>"Mr. Price," said Anderson to him, "may I ask that you will tell this gentleman if a little boy went into my office a short time ago?"</p>
<p>The clerk looked blankly at Anderson, who patiently repeated his question.</p>
<p>"A little boy," repeated the clerk.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Anderson.</p>
<p>Price gazed reflectively and in something of a troubled fashion at Anderson, then at Carroll. His mind was in the throes of displacing a barrel of sugar and a half-peck of pease by a little boy. Then his face brightened. He spoke quickly and decidedly.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     109"/>

<p>"Yes," said he, "just before this gentleman came in, a little boy, running, yes."</p>
<p>"You did not see him come out while we were talking?" asked Anderson.</p>
<p>"No, oh no."</p></p>
<p>Carroll asked no further and left, with a good-day to Anderson, who scarcely returned it. He jumped into his carriage, and the swift tap of the horse's feet died away on the macadam.</p>
<p>"Sugar ought to bring about two cents on a pound more," said the clerk to Anderson, returning to the office, and then he stopped short as Anderson started staring at an enormous advertisement picture which was stationed, partly for business reasons, partly for ornament, in a corner near the office door. It was a figure of a gayly dressed damsel, nearly life-size, and was supposed by its blooming appearance to settle finally the merit of a new health food. The other clerk, who was a young fellow, hardly more than a boy, had placed it there. He had reached the first fever-stage of admiration of the other sex, and this gaudy beauty had resembled in his eyes a fair damsel of Banbridge whom he secretly adored.</p>
<p>Therefore he had ensconced it carefully in the corner near the office door, and often glanced at it with reverent and sheepish eyes of delight. Anderson never paid any attention to the thing, but now for some reason he glanced at it in passing, and to his astonishment it moved. He made one stride towards it, and thrust it aside, and behind it stood the boy, with a face of impudent innocence.</p>
<p>Anderson stood looking at him for a second. The boy's eyes did not fall, but his expression changed.</p>
<p>"So you ran away from your father and hid from him?" Anderson observed, with a subtle emphasis of scorn. "So you are afraid?"</p>
<pb n="110     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>The boy's face flashed into red, his eyes blazed.</p>
<p>"You bet I ain't," he declared.</p>
<p>"Looks very much like it," said Anderson, coolly.</p>
<p>"You let me go," shouted the boy, and pushed rudely past Anderson and raced out of the store. Anderson and the old clerk looked at each other across the great advertisement which had fallen face downward on the floor.</p>
<p>"Must have come in from the office whilst our back was turned, and slipped in behind that picture," said the clerk, slowly.</p>
<p>Anderson nodded.</p>
<p>"He is a queer feller," said the clerk, further.</p>
<p>"He certainly is," agreed Anderson.</p>
<p>"As queer as ever I seen. Guess his father'll give it to him when he gits home."</p>
<p>"Well, he deserves it," replied Anderson, and added, in the silence of his mind, "and his father deserves it, too," and imagined vaguely to himself a chastening providence for the eternal good of the father even as the father might be for the eternal good of his son. The man's fancy was always more or less in leash to his early training.</p>
<p>Just then the younger clerk, Sam Riggs, commonly called Sammy, entered, and espying at once with jealous eyes the fallen state of his idol in the corner, took the first opportunity to pick her up and straighten her to her former position.</p>

CHAPTER IX

<p>LITTLE Eddy Carroll, running on his slim legs like a hound, raced down the homeward road, and came in sight of his father's carriage just before it turned the corner. Carroll had stopped once on the way, and so the boy overtook him. When Carroll stopped to make an inquiry, he caught a glimpse of the small, flying figure in the rear; in fact, the man to whom he spoke pointed this out.</p>
<p>"Why, there's your boy, now, Cap'n Carroll," he said, "runnin' as fast after you as you be after him." The man was an old fellow of a facetious turn of mind who had done some work on Carroll's garden.</p>
<p>Carroll, after that one rapid, comprehensive glance, said not another word. He nodded curtly and sprang into the carriage; but the old man, pressing close to the wheel, so that it could not move without throwing him, said something in a half-whisper, as if he were ashamed of it.</p>
<p>"Certainly, certainly, very soon," replied Carroll, with some impatience.</p>
<p>"I need it pooty bad," the old man said, abashedly.</p>
<p>"Very soon, I tell you," repeated Carroll. "I cannot stop now."</p>
<p>The old man fell back, with a pull at his ancient cap. He trembled a little nervously, his face was flushed, but he glanced back with a grin at Eddy racing to catch up.</p>
<p>"Drive on, Martin," Carroll said to the coachman.</p>
<p>The old gardener waited until Eddy came alongside,
<pb n="112     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>then he called out to him. "Hi!" he said, "better hurry up. Guess your pa is goin' to have a reckonin' with ye."</p>
<p>"You shut up!" cried the boy, breathlessly, racing past. When finally he reached the carriage, he promptly caught hold of the rear, doubled up his legs, and hung on until it rolled into the grounds of the Carroll place and drew up in the semicircle opposite the front-door. Then he dropped lightly to the ground and ran around to the front of the carriage as his father got out. Eddy without a word stood before his father, who towered over him grandly, confronting him with a really majestic reproach, not untinctured with love. The man's handsome face was quite pale; he did not look so angry as severe and unhappy, but the boy knew well enough what the expression boded. He had seen it before. He looked back at his father, and his small, pink-and-white face never quivered, and his black eyes never fell.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Carroll.</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" asked Carroll.</p>
<p>The anxious faces of the boy's mother and his aunt became visible at a front window, a flutter of white skirts appeared at the entrance of the grounds. The girls were returning from their search.</p>
<p>"Answer me," commanded Carroll.</p>
<p>"Teacher sent me on an errand," he replied then, with a kind of doggedness.</p>
<p>"The truth," said Carroll.</p>
<p>"I went out catching butterflies, after I had dined with Mr. Anderson and his mother."</p>
<p>"You dined with Mr. Anderson and his mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. You needn't think he was to blame. He wasn't. I made him ask me."</p>
<p>"I understand. Then you did not go to school this afternoon, but out in the field?"</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     113 "/>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>Carroll eyed sharply the boy's right-hand pocket, which bulged enormously. The girls had by this time come up and stood behind Eddy, holding to each other, their pretty faces pale and concerned.</p>
<p>"What is that in your pocket?" asked Carroll.</p>
<p>"Marbles."</p>
<p>"Let me see the marbles."</p>
<p>"It ain't marbles, it's candy."</p>
<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Anderson gave it to me."</p>
<p>Carroll continued to look his son squarely in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I stole it when they wasn't looking," said the boy; "there was a glass jar--"</p>
<p>"Go into the house and up to your own room," said Carroll.</p>
<p>The boy turned as squarely about-face as a soldier at the word of command, and marched before his father into the house. The four women, the two at the window, the two on the lawn, watched them go without a word. Ina, the elder of the two girls, put her handkerchief to her eyes and began to cry softly. Charlotte put her arm around her and drew her towards the door.</p>
<p>"Don't, Ina," she whispered, "don't, darling."</p>
<p>"Papa will whip him very hard," sobbed Ina. "It seems to me I cannot bear it, he is such a little boy."</p>
<p>"Papa ought to whip him," said Charlotte, quite firmly, although she herself was winking back the tears.</p>
<p>"He will whip him so hard," sobbed Ina. "I quite gave up when papa found the candy. Stealing is what he never will forgive him for, you know."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. Don't let poor Amy see you cry, Ina."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute before we go in. You remember that the time papa whipped me, the only time he ever did, when--"</p>
<pb n="114     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"Yes, I remember. You never did again, honey."</p>
<p>"Yes, it cured me, but I fear it will not cure Eddy. A boy is different."</p>
<p>"Stop crying, Ina dear, before we go in."</p>
<p>"Yes--I--will. Are my eyes very red?"</p>
<p>"No; Amy will not notice it if you keep your eyes turned away."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Carroll turned sharply upon Ina the moment she saw her. The two elder ladies had left the parlor and retreated to a small apartment on the right of the hall, called the den, and fitted up with some Eastern hangings and a divan. Upon this divan Anna Carroll had thrown herself, and lay quite still upon her back, her slender length extended, staring out of the window directly opposite at the spread of a great oak just lately putting forth its leaves. Mrs. Carroll was standing beside her, and she looked at the two girls entering with a hard expression in her usually soft eyes.</p>
<p>"Why have you been crying?" she asked, directly, of Ina. Her hair was in disorder, as if she had thrust her fingers through it. It was pushed far off from her temples, making her look much older. Red spots blazed on her cheeks, her mouth widened in a curious, tense smile. "Why have you been crying?" she demanded again when Ina did not reply at once to her question.</p>
<p>"Because papa is going to whip Eddy," Ina said then, with directness, "and I know he will whip him very hard, because he has been stealing."</p>
<p>"Well, what is that to cry about?" asked Mrs. Carroll, ruffling with indignation. Don't you think the boy's father knows what is best for his own son? He won't hurt him any more than he ought to be hurt."</p>
<p>"I only hope he will hurt himself as much as he ought to be hurt," muttered Anna Carroll on the divan. Mrs. Carroll gave her sister-in-law one look, then swept out of the room. The tail of her rose-colored silk curled
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     115"/>

around the door-sill, and she was gone. She passed through the hall, and out of the front-door to the lawn, whence she strolled around the house, keeping on the side farthest from the room occupied by her son.</p>
<p>"Hark!" whispered Ina, a moment after her mother had gone.</p>
<p>They all listened, and a swishing sound was distinctly audible. It was the sound of regular, carefully measured blows.</p>
<p>"Amy went out so she should not hear," whispered Ina. "Oh, dear!"</p>
<p>"It is harder for her than for anybody else because she has to uphold Arthur for doing what she knows is wrong," said Anna Carroll on the divan. She spoke as if to herself, pressing her hands to her ears.</p>
<p>"Papa is doing just right," cried Charlotte, indignantly. "How dare you speak so about papa, Anna?"</p>
<p>"There is no use in speaking at all," said Anna, wearily. "There never was. I am tired of this life and everything connected with it."</p>
<p>Ina was weeping again convulsively. She also had put her hands to her ears, and her piteous little wet, quivering face was revealed.</p>
<p>"There is no need of either of you stopping up your ears," said Charlotte. "You won't hear anything except the--blows. Eddy never makes a whimper. You know that."</p>
<p>She spoke with a certain pride. She felt in her heart that a whimper from her little brother would be more than she herself could bear, and would also be more culpable than the offence for which he was being chastised. She said that her brother never whimpered, and yet she listened with a little fear that he might. But she need have had no apprehension. Up in his bedroom, standing before his father in his little thin linen blouse, for he had pulled off his jacket without being told,
<pb n="116     THE DEBTOR "/>

directly when he had first entered the room, the little boy endured the storm of blows, not only without a whimper, but without a quiver.</p>
<p>Eddy stood quite erect. His pretty face was white, his little hands hanging at his sides were clinched tightly, but he made not one sound or motion which betrayed pain or fear. He was counting the blows as they fell. He knew how many to expect. There were so many for running away and playing truant, and so many for lying, more for stealing, so many for all three. This time it was all three. Eddy counted while his father laid on the blows as regularly as a machine. When at last he stopped, Eddy did not move. He spoke without moving his head.</p>
<p>"There are two more, papa," he said. "You have stopped too soon."</p>
<p>Carroll's face contracted, but he gave the two additional blows. "Now undress yourself and go to bed," he told the boy, in an even tone. "I will have some bread and milk sent up for your supper. To-morrow morning you will take that candy back to the store, and tell the man you stole it, and ask his pardon."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said Eddy. He at once began unfastening his little blouse preparatory to retiring.</p>
<p>Carroll went out of the room and closed the door behind him. His sister met him at the head of the stairs and accosted him in a sort of fury.</p>
<p>"Arthur Carroll," said she, tersely, "I wish you would tell me one thing. Did you whip that child for his faults or your own?"</p>
<p>Carroll looked at her. He was very pale, and his face seemed to have lengthened out and aged. "For both, Anna," he replied.</p>
<p>"What right have you to punish him for your faults, I should like to know?"</p>
<p>"The right of the man who gave them to him."</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      117"/>

<p>"You have the right to punish him for your faults--<hi rend=italic">your</hi> faults?"</p>
<p>"I could kill him for my faults, if necessary."</p>
<p>"Who is going to punish you for your faults? Tell me that, Arthur Carroll."</p>
<p>"The Lord Almighty in His own good time," replied Carroll, and passed her and went down-stairs.</p>

CHAPTER X

<p>THE next morning, just before nine o'clock, Anderson was sitting in his office, reading the morning paper. The wind had changed in the night and was blowing from the northwest. The atmosphere was full of a wonderful clearness and freshness. Anderson was conscious of exhilaration. Life assumed a new aspect. New ambitions pressed upon his fancy, new joys seemed to crowd upon his straining vision in culminating vistas of the future. Without fairly admitting it to himself, it had seemed to him as if he had already in a great measure exhausted the possibilities of his own life, as if he had begun to see the bare threads of the warp, as if he had worn out the first glory of the pattern design. Now it was suddenly all different. It looked to him as if he had scarcely begun to live, as if he had not had his first taste of existence. He felt himself a youth. His senses were sharpened, and he got a keen delight from them, which stimulated his spirit like wine. He perceived for the first time a perfume from the green plants in his window-box, which seemed to grow before his eyes and give an odor like the breath of a runner. He heard whole flocks of birds in the sky outside. He distinguished quite clearly one bird-song which he had never heard before. His newspaper rustled with astonishing loudness when he turned the pages, his cigar tasted to an extreme which he had never before noticed. The leaves of the plants and the tree-boughs outside cut the air crisply. His window-shade rattled so loudly
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     119"/>

that he could not believe it was simply that. A great onslaught of the splendid wind filled the room, and everything waved and sprang as if gaining life. Then suddenly, without the slightest warning, came a shower of the confection known as molasses-peppermints through the door of the office. They are a small, hard candy, and being thrown with vicious emphasis, they rattled upon the bare floor like bullets. One even hit Anderson stingingly upon the cheek. He sprang to his feet and looked out. Nothing was to be seen except the young clerk, standing, gaping and half frightened, yet with a lurking grin. Anderson regarded him with amazement. An idea that he had gone mad flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>"What did you do that for, Sam?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"I didn't do it."</p>
<p>"Who did?"</p>
<p>"That kid that was in here last night. That Carroll boy. He run in here and flung that candy, and out again, before I could more 'n' see him. Didn't know what were comin'."</p>
<p>Anderson returned to his office, and as he crossed the threshold heard a duet of laughter from Sam and the older clerk. His feet crushed some of the candy as he resumed his seat. He took up his newspaper, but before he had fairly commenced to read he heard the imperious sound of a girl's voice outside, a quick step, and a dragging one.</p>
<p>"Come right along!" the girl's voice ordered.</p>
<p>"You lemme be!" came a sulky boy's voice in response.</p>
<p>"Not another word!" said the girl's. "Come right along!"</p>
<p>Anderson looked up. Charlotte Carroll was entering, dragging her unwilling little brother after her.</p>
<p>"Come," said she again. She did not seem to regard
<pb n="120     THE DEBTOR"/>

Anderson at all. She held her brother's arm with a firm grip of her little, nervous white hand. "Now," said she to him, "you pick up every one of those molasses-peppermint drops, every single one."</p>
<p>The boy wriggled defiantly, but she held to him with wonderful strength.</p>
<p>"Right away," she repeated, "every single one."</p>
<p>"Let me go, then," growled the boy, angrily. "How can I pick them up when you are holding me this way?"</p>
<p>The girl with a swift motion swung to the office door in the faces of the two clerks, the grinning roundness of the younger, and the half-abstracted bewilderment of the elder. Then she placed her back against it, and took her hand from her brother's arm. "Now, then, pick them up, every one," said she.</p>
<p>Without another word the boy got down on his hands and knees and began gathering up the scattered sweets. Anderson had risen to his feet, and stood looking on with a dazed and helpless feeling. Now he spoke, and he realized that his voice sounded weak.</p>
<p>"Really, Miss Carroll," he said, "I beg--It is of no consequence--" Then he stopped. He did not know what it was all about; he had only a faint idea of not putting any one to the trouble to pick up the d&eacute;bris on his office floor.</p>
<p>Charlotte regarded him as sternly as she had her brother. "Yes, it is of consequence. Papa told him to bring them back and apologize."</p>
<p>Anderson stared at her, bewildered, while the little boy crawled like a nervous spider around his feet.</p>
<p>"Why bring them back to me?" he queried. For the moment the ex-lawyer forgot that molasses-peppermint balls yielded a part of his revenue, and were offered by him to the public from a glass jar on his shelf. He cast about in his mind as to what he could possibly have to
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     121"/>

do with those small, hard, brown lollipops rolling about on his office floor.</p>
<p>"You had them in a glass jar," said Charlotte, in an accusing voice, "right in his way, and--when he came home last night he had them in his pocket, and--papa whipped him very hard. He always does when--My brother is never allowed to take anything that does not belong to him, however unimportant," she concluded, proudly.</p>
<p>Anderson continued to look at her in a sort of daze.</p>
<p>"No," she added, severely, "he is not. No matter if he is so young, no more than a child, and a child is very fond of sweets, and-they were left right in his way."</p>
<p>Anderson looked at her with the vague idea floating through his mind that he owed this sweet, reproachful creature an abject pardon for keeping his molasses-peppermint balls in a glass jar on his own shelf and not locking them away from the lustful eyes of small boys.</p>
<p>"Papa told Eddy that he must bring them back this morning and ask your pardon," said Charlotte, "and when he came running out of the store I suspected what he had done; and when I found out, I made him come back. Pick up every one, Eddy."</p>
<p>"Here is one he stepped on his own self and smashed all to nothing," said Eddy, in an aggrieved tone. "I can't pick that up, anyhow."</p>
<p>"Pick up what you can of it, and put it in the paper bag."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't think he could sell this to anybody without cheating them," remarked Eddy, in a lofty tone, in spite of his abject position.</p>
<p>"Never you mind what he does with it. You pick up every single speck," ordered the girl; and the boy scraped the floor with his sharp finger-nails, and crammed the candy and dust into a small paper bag. The girl
<pb n="122     THE DEBTOR"/>

stood watchfully over him; not the smallest particle escaped her eyes. "There's some more over there," said she, sharply, when the boy was about to rise; and Eddy loped like some small animal on all-fours towards a tiny heap of crushed peppermint-drops.</p>
<p>"He must have stepped on this, too," he muttered, with a reproachful glare at Anderson, who had never in his life felt so at a loss. He was divided between consternation and an almost paralyzing sense of the ridiculous. He was conscious that a laugh would be regarded as an insult by this very angry and earnest young girl. But at last Eddy tendered him the bag with the rescued peppermint-drops.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't think you would ask more than half-price for candy like this, anyway," said Eddy, admonishingly, and that was too much for the man. He shouted with laughter; not even Charlotte's face, which suddenly flushed with wrath, could sober him. She looked at him a moment while he laughed, and her face of severe judgment and anger intensified.</p>
<p>"Very well," said she, "if you see anything funny about this, I am glad, Mr. Anderson."</p>
<p>But the boy, who had viewed with doubt and suspicion this abrupt change of aspect on the part of the man, suddenly grinned in response; his black eyes twinkled charmingly with delight and fun. "Say, <hi rend=italic">you're</hi> all right," he said to Anderson, with a confidential nod.</p>
<p>"Eddy!" cried Charlotte.</p>
<p>"Now, Charlotte, you don't see how funny it is, because you are a girl," said Eddy, soothingly, and he continued to grin at the man, half-elfishly, half-innocently. He looked very small and young.</p>
<p>The girl caught hold of his arm. "Come away immediately," she said, in a choking voice. "Immediately."
<p>"It's just like a girl to act that way about my going,
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     123"/>

as if I wanted to come myself at all," said the boy, following his sister's pulling hand, and still grinning understandingly at Anderson over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Charlotte turned in the doorway and looked majestically at Anderson. "I thought, when I obliged my brother to return here and pick up the candy, that I was dealing with a gentleman," said she. "Otherwise I might not have considered it necessary."</p>
<p>Even then Anderson could scarcely restrain his laughter, although he was conscious that he was mortally offending her. He managed to gasp out something about his surprise and the triviality of the whole affair of the candy.</p>
<p>"I regret that you should consider the taking anything without leave, however worthless, as trivial," said she. "I have not been so brought up, and neither has my brother." She said this with an indescribable air of offended rectitude. She regarded him like a small, incarnate truth and honesty. Then she turned, and her brother was following with a reluctant backward pull at her leading hand, when suddenly he burst forth with a shout of malicious glee.</p>
<p>"Say, you are making me go away, when I haven't given him back his old candy, after all! He didn't take it."</p>
<p>Charlotte promptly caught the paper bag from her brother's hand, advanced upon Anderson, and thrust it in his face as if it had been a hostile weapon. Anderson took it perforce.</p>
<p>"Here is your property," said she, proudly, but she seemed almost as childish as her brother.</p>
<p>"I ain't said any apology, either," said Eddy.</p>
<p>"The coming here and returning it is apology enough," said Anderson.</p>
<p>He looked foolishly at the ridiculous paper bag, sticky with lollipops. For the first time he felt distinctly
<pb n="124      THE DEBTOR"/>

ashamed of his business. It seemed to him, as he realized its concentration upon the petty details of existence, its strenuous dwelling upon the small, inane sweets and absurdities of daily life which ought to be scattered with a free hand, not made subjects of trade and barter, to be entirely below a gentleman. He gave the paper bag an impatient toss out of the open window over the back of the sleeping cat, which started a little, then stretched himself luxuriously and slept again.</p>
<p>"There, he's thrown it out of the window!" proclaimed Eddy. He looked accusingly at Charlotte. "I might just as well have kept it as had it thrown out of the window," said he. "What good is it to anybody now, I'd like to know?"</p>
<p>"Never mind what he has done with it," said Charlotte. "Come at once."</p>
<p>"Papa told me I must apologize. He will ask me if I did."</p>
<p>"Apologize, then. Be quick."</p>
<p>"It is not--" began Anderson, who was sober enough now, and becoming more and more annoyed, but Charlotte interrupted him.</p>
<p>"Eddy!" said she.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry I took your candy," piped Eddy, in a loud, declamatory voice which was not the tone of humble repentance. The boy, as he spoke, eyed the man with defiance. It was as if he blamed him, for some occult reason, for having his own property stolen. The child's face became, under the forced humiliation of the apology, revolutionary, anarchistic, rebellious. He might have been the representative, the walking delegate, of some small cult of rebels against the established order of regard for the property-rights of others. The sinner, the covetous one of another's sweets, became the accuser. Just as he was going out of the door, following
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     125"/>

the pink flutter of his sister's muslin gown, he turned and spoke his whole mind.</p>
<p>"You had a whole big glass jar of them, anyhow," said he, "and I didn't have a single one. You might have given me some, and then I shouldn't have stolen them. It's your own fault. You ought not to have things that anybody else wants, when they haven't got money to pay for them. It's a good deal wickeder than stealing. It was your own fault."</p>
<p>But Eddy had then to deal with his sister. She towered over him, pinker than her pink muslin. The ruffles seemed agitated all over her slender, girlish figure, like the plumage of an angry bird. She caught her small brother by the shoulders, and shook him violently, until the dark hair which he wore rather long waved and his whole head wagged.</p>
<p>"Eddy Carroll," she cried, "aren't you ashamed of yourself? Oh, aren't you ashamed of yourself? Begging, yes, <hi rend=italic">begging</hi> for candy! If you want candy, you will buy it. You will not beg it nor take it without permission. If you cannot buy it, you will go without, if you are a brother of mine.</p>
<p>The boy for the first time quailed somewhat. He looked at her, and raised a hand childishly as if to ward off something.</p>
<p>"I didn't ask, Charlotte," he half whimpered. "If he was to offer me any now, I would not take it. I would just fling it in his face. I would, Charlotte; I would, honest."</p>
<p>"I heard you," said Charlotte.</p>
<p>"I didn't ask him. I said if he had given me a little of that candy, I wouldn't have been obliged to take any. I said--"</p>
<p>"I heard what you said. Now you must come at once."</p>
<p>Anderson said good-morning rather feebly. Charlotte 
<pb n="126     THE DEBTOR"/>

made a distant inclination of her head in response, and they were gone, but he heard Eddy cry out, in a tone of reproachful glee:</p>
<p>"There! you've made me late at school, Charlotte. Look at that clock; it's after nine. You've made me late at school with all that fussing over a few old peppermint-drops."</p>
<pb n="127"/>

CHAPTER XI

<p>ANDERSON, after they were gone, sat staring out of the window at the green spray of the spring boughs. His mouth was twitching, but his forehead was contracted. This problem of feminity and childhood which he had confronted was too much for him. The boy did not perplex him quite so much--he did not think so much about him--but the girl, the pure and sweet unreason of her proceedings, was beyond his mental grasp. The attitude of reproach which this delicate and altogether lovely young blossom of a thing had adopted towards him filled him with dismay and a ludicrous sense of guilt. He had a keen sense of the unreason and contrariness of her whole attitude, but he had no contempt towards her on account of it. He felt as if he were facing some new system of things, some higher order of creature for whom unreason was the finest reason. He bowed before the pure, unordered, untempered feminine, and his masculine mind reeled. And all the time, deeper within himself than he had ever reached with the furthest finger of his emotions, whether for pain or joy, he felt this tenderness, which was like the quickening of another soul, so alive was it. He felt the wonder and mystery of the awakening of love in his heart, this reaching out with all the best of him for the protection and happiness of another than himself. He saw before him, with no dimming because of absence, the girl's little, innocent, fair face, and such a tenderness for her was over him that he felt as if he actually clasped her

<p>127</p>
<pb n="128     THE DEBTOR"/>

and enfolded her, but only for her protection and good, never for himself.</p>
<p>"The little thing," he thought over and over--"the little, innocent, beautiful thing! What kind of a place is she in, among what kind of people? What does this all mean?"</p>
<p>Suspicions which had been in his mind all the time had developed. He had had proof in divers ways. He said to himself, "That man is a scoundrel, a common swindler, if I know one when I see him." But suspicions as to the girl had never for one minute dwelt in his furthest fancy. He had thought speculatively of the possible complicity of the other women of the household, but never of hers. They were all very constant in their church attendance; indeed, Carroll had given quite a sum towards the Sunday-school library, and he had even heard suggestions as to the advisability of making him superintendent and displacing the present incumbent, who was superannuated. Sometimes in church Anderson had glanced keenly from under the quiet droop of languid lids at the Carrolls sitting in their gay fluff and flutter of silks and muslins and laces, and wondered, especially concerning Mrs. Carroll and her sister-in-law. It seemed almost inconceivable that they were ignorant, and if not, how entirely innocent! And then the expressions of their pretty, childish faces disarmed him as they sat there, their dark, graceful heads drooping before the divine teaching with gentle acquiescence like a row of flowers. But there was something about the fearless lift to Charlotte's head and the clear regard of her dark eyes which separated her from the others. She bloomed by herself, individual, marked by her own characteristics. He thought of her passionate assertion of the principles of her home training with pity and worshipful admiration. It was innocence incarnate pleading for guilt which she believed like
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     129"/>

herself, because of the blinding power of her own light. "She thinks them all like herself," he said to himself. "She reasons from her knowledge of herself." Then reflecting how Carroll had undoubtedly sent his son to return his pilfered sweets, he began to wonder if he could possibly have been mistaken in his estimate of the man's character, if he had reasoned from wrong premises, and from that circumstantial evidence which his experience as a lawyer should have led him to distrust.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shadow flung out across the office floor and a man stood in the doorway. He was tall and elderly, with a shag of gray beard and a shining dome of forehead over a nervous, blue-eyed face. He was the druggist, Andrew Drew, who had his little pharmacy on the opposite side of the street, a little below Anderson's grocery. He united with his drug business a local and long-distance telephone and the Western Union telegraph-office, and he rented and sold commutation-books of railroad tickets to the City.</p>
<p>"Good-day," he said. Then, before Anderson could respond, he plunged at once into the subject on his mind, a subject that was wrinkling his forehead. However, he first closed the office door and glanced around furtively. "See here," he whispered, mysteriously; "you know those new folks, the Carrolls?" With a motion of his lank shoulder he indicated the direction of the Carroll house.</p>
<p>Anderson's expression changed subtly. He nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, what I want to know is--what do you think of him?"</p>
<p>"I don't quite understand what you mean," Anderson replied, stiffly.</p>
<p>"Well, I mean--Well, what I mean is jest this"--the druggist made a nervous, imperative gesture with a long forefinger--"this, if you want to know--is he <hi rend=italic">good?</hi>"</p>
<pb n="130     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"You mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes, is he good?"</p>
<p>"He has paid his bills here," Anderson said. He offered the other man a chair, which was declined with a shake of the head.</p>
<p>"No, thank you, can't stop. I've left my little boy in the store all alone. So he has paid you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he has paid his bills here," Anderson replied, with a guilty sense of evasion, remembering the check.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe he is all right. I'll tell you, if you won't speak of it. Of course he may be all right; and I don't want to quarrel with a good customer. All there is--he came rushing in three weeks ago to-day and said he was late for the train, and he had used up his commutation and had come off without his pocket-book, and of course could not get credit at the station office, and if I had a book he would take it and write me a check. While he was talking he was scratching a check on a New York bank like lightning. He made a mistake and drew it for ten dollars too much; and I hadn't a full book anyway, only one with thirty-five tickets in it, and I let him have that and gave him the difference in cash--fifteen dollars and forty-two cents. And--well--the long and short of it is, the check came back from the bank, no good."</p>
<p>"Did you tell him?"</p>
<p>"Haven't seen him since. I went to his house twice, but he wasn't home. I tried to catch him at the station, but he has been going on different trains lately; and once when I got a glimpse of him the train was in and he had just time to swing on and I couldn't stop him then, of course. Then I dropped him a line, and got a mighty smooth note back. He said there was a mistake; he was very sorry; he would explain at once and settle; and that's over a week ago, and--"</p>
<p>"Probably he will settle it, if he said so," said Ander-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     131"/>

son, with the memory of the little boy who had been sent to return the stolen candy in his mind.</p>
<p>"Well, I hope he will, but--" The druggist hesitated. Then he went on: "There is something else, to tell the truth. One of his girls came in just now and asked me to cash a check for twenty-five dollars--her father's check, but on another bank--and--I refused."</p>
<p>Anderson flushed. A great gust of wind made the window rattle, and he pulled it down with an irritated jerk.</p>
<p>"Do you think I did right?" asked the druggist, who had a nervous appeal of manner. "Maybe the check was good. I hated to refuse, of course. I said I was short of ready money. I don't think she suspected anything. She is a nice-spoken girl. I don't suppose she knew if the check wasn't good."</p>
<p>"Any man who thinks so ought to be kicked," declared Anderson, with sudden fury, and the other man started.</p>
<p>"I told you I didn't think so," he retorted, eying him with some wonder and a little timidity. "But I declare I didn't know what to do. There was that other check not accounted for yet; and I can't afford to lose any more, and that's a fact. Then you think I ought to have cashed it?"</p>
<p>Anderson's face twitched a little. Then he said, as if it were wrung out of him, "On general principles, I should not call it good business to repeat a transaction of that kind until the first was made right."</p>
<p>The druggist looked relieved. "Well, I am glad to hear you say so. I hated to--"</p>
<p>"But Captain Carroll may be as good pay in the end as I am," interrupted Anderson. "He seems to me to have good principles about things of that kind."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll cash the next check," said Drew, with a
<pb n="132     THE DEBTOR"/>

laugh. "I must go back, for I left my little boy alone in the store."</p>
<p>The druggist had scarcely gone before the old clerk came to the office door. "That young lady who was here a little while ago wants to speak to you, Mr. Anderson," he said, with an odd look.</p>
<p>"I will come out directly," replied Anderson, and passed out into the store, where Charlotte Carroll stood waiting with a heightened color on her cheeks and a look of mingled appeal and annoyance in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, "but can you cash a check for me for twenty-five dollars? It will be a great favor."</p>
<p>"Certainly," replied Anderson, without the slightest hesitation. He was conscious that both clerks, the man and the boy, were watching him with furtive curiosity, and he was aware that Carroll's unreliability in the matter of his drafts had become widely known. He passed around the counter to the money-drawer.</p>
<p>"Money seems to be very scarce in Banbridge this morning," remarked Charlotte, in a sweet, slightly petulant voice. She was both angry and ashamed that she had been forced to apply to Anderson to cash the check. "I have been everywhere, and nobody had as much as twenty-five dollars," she added.</p>
<p>Anderson heard a very faint chuckle, immediately covered by a cough, from Sam Riggs. He began counting out the notes, being conscious that the man and the boy were regarding each other with meaning, that the boy's elbow dug the man's ribs. He handed the money to Charlotte with a courteous bow, and she gave him in return the check, which was payable to her mother, and which had been indorsed by her.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much indeed," she said, but still in a piqued rather than very grateful voice. She really had no suspicion that any particular gratitude was called
<pb n="THE DEBTOR     133"/>

for towards any one who cashed one of her father's checks.</p>
<p>"You are quite welcome," Anderson replied.</p>
<p>"It is a great inconvenience not having a bank in Banbridge," she remarked, accusingly, as she went out of the door with a slight nod of her pretty head. Then suddenly she turned and looked back. "I am very much obliged," she said, in an entirely different voice. Her natural gentleness and courtesy had all at once reasserted themselves. "I trust I have not inconvenienced you," she added, very sweetly. "I would have waited until papa came home to-night and got him to cash the check. He was a little short this morning, and had to use some money before he could go to the bank, but my sister and I are very anxious to take the eleven-thirty train to New York, and we had only a dollar and six cents between us." She laughed as she said the last, and Anderson echoed her.</p>
<p>"That is not a very large amount, certainly, to equip two ladies to visit the shopping district," he said.</p>
<p>"I am very glad to accommodate you, and it is not the slightest inconvenience, I assure you."</p>
<p>"Well, I am very much obliged, very much," she repeated, with a pretty smile and nod, and she was gone with a little fluttering hop like a bird down the steps.</p>
<p>"He's got stuck," the boy motioned with his lips to the old clerk as Anderson re-entered the office, and the man nodded in assent. Neither of them ventured to express the opinion to Anderson. Both stood in a certain awe of him. The former lawyer still held familiarity somewhat at bay.</p>
<p>However, there followed a whispered consultation between the two clerks, and both chuckled, and finally Sam Riggs advanced with bravado to the office door.</p>
<p>"Mr. Anderson," he said, with mischief in his tone,
<pb n="134     THE DEBTOR"/>

and Anderson turned and looked at him inquiringly. "Oh, it is nothing, not worth speaking of, I suppose," said Sammy Riggs, "but that kid, the Carroll boy, swiped an apple off that basket beside the door when he went out with his sister. I saw him."</p>

CHAPTER XII

<p>ANDERSON was in the state of mind of a man who dreams and is quite aware all the time that he is dreaming. He deliberately indulged himself in this habit of mind. "When I am ready, I shall put all this away," he continually assured his inner consciousness. Then into the delicious charm of his air-castle he leaped again, mind and body. In those days he grew perceptibly younger. The fire of youth lit his eyes. He fed on the stimulants of sweet dreams, and for the time they nourished as well as exhilarated. Everybody whom he met told him how well he looked and that he was growing younger every day. He was shrewd enough to understand fully the fact that they considered him far from youth, or they would not have thus expressed themselves, but the triumph which he felt when he saw himself in his looking-glass, and in his own realization of himself, caused him to laugh at the innuendo. He felt that he <hi rend=italic">was</hi> young, as young as man could wish to be. He, as before said, had never been vain, but mortal man could not have helped exultation at the sight of that victorious visage of himself looking back at him. He did not admit it to himself, but he took more pains with this dress, although he had always been rather punctilious in that direction. All unknown to himself, and, had he known it, the knowledge would have aroused in him rebellion and shame, he was carrying out the instinct of the love - smitten male of all species. In lieu of the gorgeous feathers he put on a
<p>135</p>
<pb n="136      THE DEBTOR"/>

new coat and tie, he trimmed his mustache carefully. He smoothed and lighted his face with the beauty of joy and hope and of pleasant dreams. But there was, since he was a man at the head of creation, something more subtle and noble in his preening. In those days he became curiously careful--although, being naturally clean-hearted, he had little need for care-of his very thoughts. Naturally fastidious in his soul habits, he became even more so. The very books he read were, although he was unconscious of it, such as contributed to his spiritual adornment, to fit himself for his constant dwelling in his country of dreams. Certain people he avoided, certain he courted. One woman, who was innately coarse, although her life had hedged her in safely from impropriety, was calling upon his mother one afternoon about this time. She was the wife of the old Presbyterian clergyman, Dr. Gregg. She was a small, solidly built woman, in late middle life, tightly hooked up in black silk as to her body, and as to her soul by the prescribed boundaries of her position in life. Anderson, returning rather earlier than usual, found her with his mother, and retreated with actual rudeness, the woman became all at once so repellent to him.</p>
<p>"My son gets very tired," Mrs. Anderson said, softly, as she passed the pound-cake again to her caller. "Quite often, when he comes in, he goes by himself and has a quiet smoke before he says much even to me."</p>
<p>Mrs. Gregg was eating the pound-cake with such extreme relish that Mrs. Anderson, who was herself fastidious, looked away, and as she did so heard distinctly a smack of the other woman's lips.</p>
<p>"He grows handsomer and younger every time I see him," remarked Mrs. Gregg when she had swallowed her mouthful of cake and before she took another.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson repeated the caller's compliment to her son later on when the two were at the supper-table.
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      137"/>

<p>"Yes, she paid you a great compliment," said she; "but, dear, why did you run out in that way? It was almost rude, and she the minister's wife, too."</p>
<p>"I don't see how Dr. Gregg keeps up his necessary quota of saving grace, living with her," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, I think she is a good woman."</p>
<p>"She is a bottled-up vessel of wrath," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"My son, I never heard you speak so before, and about a lady, too."</p>
<p>Anderson fairly blushed before his mother's mild eyes of surprise. "Mother, you are right," he said, penitently. "I ought to be ashamed of myself, and I am. I know I was rude, but I did not feel like seeing her to-day. Of course she is a good woman."</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson looked a little reflective. Now that her son had taken a proper attitude with regard to her sister-woman, she began to feel a little critical license herself. "I will admit that she has little mannerisms which are not exactly agreeable and must grate on Dr. Gregg," said she. As she spoke she seemed to hear again the smacking of the lips over the pound-cake. Then she looked scrutinizingly at her son. "But," she said, "I do believe she was right, Randolph, about your looks."</p>
<p>"Nonsense," said Randolph, laughing.</p>
<p>It was a warm night. After supper they both went out on the front porch. Mrs. Anderson sat gazing at her son from between the folds of a little, white lace kerchief which she wore over her head, to guard against possible dampness.</p>
<p>"Randolph," said she, after a while.</p>
<p>"What is it, mother, dear?"</p>
<p>"Do you feel well?"</p>
<p>"Of course I feel well. Why?"</p>
<p>"You look too well to be natural," said she, slowly.</p>
<p>"Mother, what an absurdity!"</p>
<pb n="138      THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"It is so," said she. "I had not noticed it until Mrs. Gregg spoke, but I see it now. I don't know where my eyes have been. You look too well."</p>
<p>Randolph laughed. "Now, mother, don't you think that sounds foolish?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson continued to regard him with an expression of maternal love and severity, which pierced externals more keenly than an X-ray. "No," said she, I do not think it is foolish. You look too well to be natural. You look this minute as young in your face as you did when I had you in petticoats."</p>
<p>Randolph laughed loudly at that, but his mother was quite earnest.</p>
<p>She was not satisfied, and continued arguing the matter until she became afraid of the increasing dampness and went into the house, and the son drew a breath of relief. The mother little dreamed, with all her astuteness, of what was really transpiring. She did not know that when she had seated herself beside her son on the porch she had displaced with her gentle, elderly materiality the sweetest phantom of a beloved young girl. She did not know that when she entered the house the delicate, evanescent thing returned swifter than thought itself, and filled with the sweet presence that vacuum in her son's heart which she herself had never filled, and nestled there through a delicious hour of the summer night. She did not dream, as she sat by the window, staring out drowsily into the soft shadows and heard no murmur from her son on the porch, that in reality the silence of his soul was broken by words and tones which she had never heard from his lips, although she had brought him into the world.</p>
<p>Anderson never admitted to himself the possibility of his dreams coming true. While his self-respect never wavered, while he viewed himself with no unworthy disparagement, he still saw himself as he was: verging
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      139"/>

towards middle age, unsuccessful according to the standard of the world. He was one of those inglorious failures, a man who has failed to follow out his chosen course of life. He was one who had turned back, overcome confessedly by odds. He told himself proudly and simply that his earning of money was, to one simple and honest end--the prolonging of existence on the earth for the good of one's fellow-beings, and one's own growth; that he was attaining that end more completely in his little grocery store than he had ever done in his law-office. Yet always he saw himself, in a measure, as others saw him, and the humility of his position in the eyes of the world asserted itself. While he felt not the slightest bend in the erectness of his own soul because of it, while it even amused him, he never forgot the supercilious courtesy of the girl's father towards him. He recognized, even while feeling himself on superior heights, the downward vision of the man who robbed him. It was true that he paid scorn for scorn, but he was forced to take as well as give.</p>
<p>He also was not in the slightest doubt as to Charlotte's own attitude towards him. He understood to the full the signification of the word grocer for her. He was, to her mind, hardly a man at all, rather a mechanical dispenser of butter and eggs for the needs of a superior race. But he understood also the childish innocence and involuntariness of this view of hers. He recognized even the ludicrousness of the situation which perverted tragedy to comedy, almost Cyrano fashion. He compared himself to Cyrano.</p>
<p>"As well consider the possibility of marriage with a girl of her training, even although it is on a false basis, with a monstrosity of nose on my face, as with the legend of retail grocery across my scutcheon," he told himself. He even laughed over it.</p>
<p>Therefore, being of a turn of mind which can rear for
<pb n="140     THE DEBTOR"/>

itself airy towers of delight over the values of insufficiency of life, and having an access of spirituality which enabled him to get a certain reality from them, he dreamed on, and let his new love irradiate his own life, like a man carrying a lantern on a dark path. There are those that are born to sunlit paths, and there are those whom a beneficent Providence has supplied with lanterns of compensation, and the latter are not always the unhappier nor the less progressive. Never admitting to himself the possibility of the actual presence of the girl in the house as his wife, he yet peopled the rooms with her. He rose up in spirit before her entering a door. There were especial nooks wherein his fancy could project her with such illusion that his heart would leap as if at the actual sight of her. In particular was there one window in the sitting-room which, being in a little projection of the house, overlooked a special little view of its own. From this window between the folds of the muslin curtains could be seen a file of blooming hollyhocks. Behind them a grassy expanse arose with a long ascent, and the rosette-like blossoms of pink and pale-gold, with gray-green bosses of leaves, lay against the green field like the design on a shield.</p>
<p>In this window was an old-fashioned rocking-chair cushioned softly with faded, rose-patterned chintz, and before it stood always a small footstool covered with dim-brown canvas on which was a wreath of roses done in cross-stitch by his mother in her girlhood. Anderson loved to see Charlotte sitting in this chair with her feet on the footstool, her pretty head leaning back against the faded roses of the chintz, the delicate curve of her cheek towards him, as she swayed gently back and forth and seemed to gaze peacefully out of the window at the hollyhocks blooming against the green hill. It was characteristic of the man's dreams that the girl's face in them was turned a little from him.
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      141"/>

She never saw him when he entered, she never broke the sweet silence of her own dreams within dreams, for him, and he never, even in dreams, touched the soft curve of that averted cheek, or even one of the little hands lying as lightly as flowers in her muslin lap. Anderson, the commonplace man in the grocery business, in the commonplace present, dreamed as reverently and spiritually of the lady of his love as Dante of his Beatrice, or Petrarch of his Laura. He would go down to the grave with his songs all unsung; but the man was a poet, as are all who worship the god, and not the likeness of themselves in him. As Anderson sat on the porch that summer night, to his fancy Charlotte Carroll sat on the step above him. Without fairly looking he could see the sweep of her white draperies and the mild fairness, producing the effect of luminosity, of her face in the dusk.</p>
<p>Then suddenly Charlotte herself dispelled the illusion. She passed by with her sister Ina and a young man. Anderson heard the low, sweet babble of girls' tongues and a hearty, boyish laugh before they came opposite the porch. He knew at once that Charlotte was one of the girls. He could not see them very plainly when they passed, for the moon had not yet risen and the shadows of the trees were dense. He had glimpses of pale contours and ruffling white draperies floating around the young man, who walked on the outside. He towered above them both with stately tenderness. He was smoking, and Anderson noted that with a throb of anger. He had an old-fashioned conviction that a man should not smoke when walking with ladies. He was sitting perfectly motionless when they came along-side, and all at once one of the girls, Ina, the eldest, perceived him, and started violently with an exclamation. All three laughed, and the young man said, raising his hat, "Good-evening, Mr. Anderson."</p>
<pb n="142      THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>Anderson returned the salutation. He thought, but was not quite sure, that Charlotte nodded. He heard, quite distinctly, Ina remark, when they were scarcely past, in a voice of girlish scorn and merry ridicule:</p>
<p>"Is the grocer a friend of yours, Mr. Eastman?"</p>
<p>Anderson was sure that he heard a "Hush! he will hear you!" from Charlotte, before young Frank Eastman replied, like a man:</p>
<p>"Yes, every time, Miss Carroll, if he will do me the honor to let me call him one. Mr. Anderson is a mighty fine gentleman."</p>
<p>The girl's voice said something in response with a slightly abashed but still jibing inflection, but Anderson could not catch it. They passed out of sight, the cigar-smoke lingering in their wake. Anderson inhaled it with no longer any feeling of disapprobation. He slowly lit a cigar himself, and smoked and meditated. The presence on the step above him was for the time dispelled by her own materiality. The dream eluded the substance. Anderson thought of the young man who had walked past with a curious feeling of something akin to gratitude. "Frank Eastman is a fine young fellow," he thought. He had known him ever since he had been a child. He had been one of the boys whom everybody knew and liked. He had grown up a village favorite. The thought flashed through Anderson's mind that here was a possible husband for Charlotte, and probably a good husband.</p>
<p>"He is an only son," he told himself; "he will have a little money. He is as good as and better than young men average, and he is charming, a man to attract any girl."</p>
<p>Anderson, when he had finished his cigar and one more, and had gone into the house to read a little before going to bed, quite decided that Charlotte Carroll was to marry young Frank Eastman. He walked remorse-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR        143"/>

lessly over the step where his fancy had placed her, and when he glanced at her pretty little nook in the sitting-room, as he passed through with his lamp and his book, it was vacant. Anderson felt a rigid acquiescence, and read his book with interest until after midnight.</p>
<p>In the mean time Charlotte, her sister Ina, and young Eastman sauntered slowly along through the shadowy streets of Banbridge. The girls held up their white gowns over their lace petticoats. They wore no hats, and their pretty, soft, dark locks floated like mist around their faces. The young man pressed Ina's arm as closely and lovingly as he dared. He was yet young enough and innocent enough to be in his heart of hearts as afraid of a girl as, when a child, he had been afraid of his mother. He thought Ina Carroll something wonderful; Charlotte he scarcely thought of at all except with vague approbation because she was Ina's sister. He took the girls into Andrew Drew's drug store for ice-cream soda. He watched, with happy proprietorship, the girls dally daintily with the long spoons in the sweet, cold mixture. Seen in the electric light of the store, they had a bewildering and fairly dazzling splendor of youth and bloom. Their faces, freshened to exquisite tints by the damp night air, shone forth from the floating film of dark hair with the unquestioning delight of the passing moment. There was in these young faces at the moment no shadow of the past or future. They were pure light. Young Eastman, eating his ice-cream, looked over his glass at Ina Carroll and realized the dazzle of her in his soul. She felt his look and smiled at him pleasantly, yet with a certain gay defiance. Charlotte caught both looks. She stirred her ice-cream briskly into the liquid and drank it.</p>
<p>"Come, honey," she said to Ina. "It is time to go home."</p>
<pb n="144       THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>A man stood near the door as they passed and raised his hat eagerly.</p>
<p>"Who is that man?" Ina said to young Eastman when they were on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"His name is Lee."</p>
<p>When the party had gone out, Lee turned with his self-conscious, consequential air. Ray, the postmaster, was standing at the counter. Little Willy Eddy also was there. He lingered about the soda-fountain. Nobody knew how badly he wanted a drink of soda. He was like a child about it, but he was afraid lest his Minna should call him to account for the five cents.</p>
<p>"Pretty fine-looking girls," observed Lee to Ray and Drew.</p>
<p>"Yes," assented Ray. "You know them?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, not directly, but Captain Carroll and I are quite intimate in a business way."</p>
<p>The druggist looked up eagerly. "You think he is good?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I have heard some queer things lately," said the postmaster.</p>
<p>Lee faced them both. "Good?" he cried. "Good? Arthur Carroll good? Why, I'd be willing to risk every dollar I have in the world, or ever hope to have. He's the smartest business man I ever saw in my life. I tell you he's A No. I. He's got a business head equal to any on the Street, I don't care who it is. Well, all I have to say, I am not afraid of him! No, sir!"</p>
<p>"I heard he had some pretty promising stock to sell," said the postmaster.</p>
<p>"Promising? No, it is not promising! Promising is not the word for it. It is sure, dead sure."</p>
<p>Little Willy Eddy drew very near.</p>
<p>"What is it selling at?" asked Ray.</p>
<p>"One dollar and sixty cents," replied Lee, with an intonation of pride and triumph.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR        145"/>

<p>"Cheap enough," said Ray.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, one dollar and sixty cents, and it will be up to five in six months and paying dividends, and up to fifty, with ten-per-cent. dividends, in a year and a half.</p>
<p>Little Willy Eddy had in the savings-bank a little money. Before he left he had arranged with Henry Lee to invest it through his influence with the great man, Carroll, and say nothing about it to any one outside. Willy hoped fondly that his Minna might know nothing about it until he should surprise her with the proceeds of his great venture. Then Willy Eddy marched boldly upon the soda-fountain.</p>
<p>"Give me a chocolate ice-cream soda," he said, like a man.</p>
<pb n="146"/>

CHAPTER XIII

<p>THREE days later, at dinner, Charlotte Carroll said something about the difficulty she had had about getting the check cashed.</p>
<p>"It is the queerest thing," said she, in a lull of the conversation, pausing with her soup-spoon lifted, "how very difficult it is to get a check for even a small amount cashed in Banbridge."</p>
<p>Carroll's spoon clattered against his plate. "What do you mean?" he asked, sharply.</p>
<p>Charlotte looked at him surprised. "Why, nothing," said she, "only I went to every store in town to get your check for twenty-five dollars cashed, and then I had to go to Anderson's finally. I should think they must be very poor here. Are they, papa?"</p>
<p>Carroll went on with his soup. "Who gave you the check to cash?" he said, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Aunt Anna," replied Charlotte. "Why?"</p>
<p>Anna spoke quite eagerly, and it seemed apologetically. "Arthur," said she, "the girls were very anxious to go to the City."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Ina," I really had to go that day. I wanted to get that silk. I had that charged; there wasn't money enough; but it has not come yet. I don't see where it is."</p>
<p>"I let Charlotte take the check," Anna Carroll said again, still with an air of nervous apology, "but I saw no reason why--I thought--"</p>
<p>"You thought what?" said Carroll. His voice was exceedingly low and gentle, but Anna Carroll started.

<p>146</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      147"/>

<p>"Nothing," said she, hastily. "Nothing, Arthur."</p>
<p>"Well, I just went everywhere with it," Charlotte said again; "then I had to go to Anderson, after all. I just hated to. I don't like him. He laughed when Eddy and I went there to take back the candy."</p>
<p>"He laughed because we took it back--a little thing like that," said Eddy.</p>
<p>Carroll looked at him, and the boy cast his eyes down and took a spoonful of soup with an abashed air.</p>
<p>"He was the only one in Banbridge that seemed to have as much as twenty-five dollars in his money-drawer," said Charlotte. "I began to think that Ina and I should have to give up going to New York."</p>
<p>"Don't take any more checks around the shops here to cash, honey," said Carroll. "Come to me; I'll fix it up some way. Amy, dear, are you all ready for the drive?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," said Mrs. Carroll. She looked unusually pretty that night in a mauve gown of some thin, soft, wool material, with her old amethysts. Even her dark hair seemed to get amethystine shadows, and her eyes, too.</p>
<p>Carroll regarded her admiringly.</p>
<p>"Amy, darling, you do get lovelier every day," he said.</p>
<p>The others laughed and echoed him with fond merriment.</p>
<p>"Doesn't she?" said Ina.</p>
<p>"Amy's the prettiest girl in this old town," said Eddy, and all the Carrolls laughed like children.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm glad you all admire me so much," Mrs. Carroll said, in her sweet drawl, "because--"</p>
<p>"Because what, honey ?" said Carroll: The boy and the two girls looked inquiringly, but Anna Carroll smiled with slightly vexed knowledge.</p>
<p>"Well," said Mrs. Carroll, "you must all look at me

in my purple gown and get all the comfort you can out of it; you must nourish yourselves through your esthetic sense, because this soup is all you will get for dinner, except dessert. There is a little dessert."</p>
<p>Poor little Eddy Carroll made a slight, half-smothered exclamation. "Oh, shucks!" he said, then he laughed with the others. None of them looked surprised. They all laughed, though somewhat ruefully.</p>
<p>"Anna came this forenoon and asked me what she should do," Mrs. Carroll said, in her soft tone of childlike glee, as if she really enjoyed the situation. "Poor Anna looked annoyed. This country air makes Anna hungry. Now, as for me, I am not hungry at all. If I can have fruit and salad I am quite satisfied. It is so fortunate that we have those raspberries and those early pears. Those little pears are quite delicious, and they are nourishing, I am sure. And then it is providential that we have lettuce in our own garden. And the grocer did not object in the least to letting last week's bill run and letting us have olive-oil and vinegar. I have plenty, so I can regard it all quite cheerfully; but Anna, poor darling, is hungry like a pussy-cat for real, solid meat. Well, Anna comes, face so long"--Mrs. Carroll drew down her lovely face, to a chorus of admiring laughter, Anna Carroll herself joining. Mrs. Carroll continued. "Yes, so long," and made her face long again by way of encore. "And I said, 'Why, Anna, honey, what is the matter?' 'Amy,' said she, 'this is serious, very serious. Why, neither the butcher nor the egg-man will trust us. We have only money enough to part pay one of them, just to keep them going,' says she,'and what shall I do, Amy?' 'It's either 'to go without meat or eggs,' says I. 'Yes, Amy, honey,' says she. 'And you can't pay them each a little?' says I, 'for I am real wise about that way of doing, you know.'" Mrs. Carroll said the last with the air of a precocious
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      149"/>

child; she looked askance for admiration as she said it, and laughed herself with the others. "'No,' says poor Anna--'no, Amy, there is not enough money for two littles, only enough for one little.' What shall we do, Amy?' 'Well,' says Amy, 'we had chops for lunch.' 'Those aren't paid for, and that is the reason we can't have beef for dinner,' says Anna. 'Well,' says Amy, 'we had those chops, didn't we? And the butcher can't alter that, anyway; and we are all nourished by those chops, and dear Arthur has had his good luncheon in the City, and there is soup-stock in the house, and things to make one of those delicious raspberry-puddings, and we cannot starve, we poor but honest Carrolls, on those things; and eggs are cheaper, are they not, honey, dear?' 'Yes,' says Anna, with that sort of groan she has when her mind is on economy--'yes, Amy, dear.' 'And,' says I, 'Arthur always wants his eggs for breakfast, and he does not like cold meat in the morning, and if he went to business without his eggs, and there was an accident on his empty stomach, only think how we would feel, Anna. So we will have,' says Amy, 'soup and pudding for dinner, and eggs for breakfast, and we will part pay the egg-man and not the butcher.' And then Amy puts on her new gown and does all she can for her family, to make up for the lack of the roast."</p>
<p>"Did you say it was raspberry-pudding, Amy?" asked Eddy, anxiously.</p>
<p>"Yes, honey, with plenty of sauce, and you may have some twice if you want it."</p>
<p>"Ring the bell, dear," said Carroll.</p>
<p>"You don't mind, Arthur, do you?" Mrs. Carroll asked, with a confident look at him.</p>
<p>Carroll smiled. "No, darling, only I hope none of you are really going hungry."</p>
<p>They all laughed at him. "Soup and pudding are all

one ought to eat in such hot weather," Charlotte said, conclusively.</p>
<p>She even jumped up, ran to her father, and threw her arms around his neck and kissed him, to reassure him. "You darling papa," she whispered in his ear, and when he looked at her tears shone in her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Carroll's own face turned strangely sober for a second, then he laughed. "Run back to your seat and get your pudding, sweetheart," he said, with a loving push, as the maid entered.</p>
<p>People thought it rather singular that the Carrolls should have but one maid, but there were reasons. Carroll himself, when he first organized his Banbridge establishment, had expressed some dissent as to the solitary servant.</p>
<p>"Why not have more?" he asked, but Anna Carroll was unusually decided in her response.</p>
<p>"Amy and I have been talking it over, Arthur," said she, "and we have decided that we would prefer only Marie."</p>
<p>"Why, Anna?" Carroll had asked, with a frown.</p>
<p>"Now, Arthur, dear, don't look cross," his wife had cried. "It is only that when the truce is over with the butcher and baker--and after a while the truce always is over, you know, you poor, dear boy, ever since you--ever since you were so badly treated about your business, you know, and when the butcher and the baker turn on us, Anna and I have decided it would be better not to have a trust in the kitchen. You know there has always been a trust in the kitchen, and two or even three maids saying they will not make bread and roast and wash the dishes, and having a council of war on the back stoop with the baker and grocer, are so much worse than one maid, don't you know, precious?"</p>
<p>"The long and the short of it is, Arthur," Anna
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      151"/>

Carroll said, quite bluntly, "it is much less wearing to get on with one maid who has not had her wages, and much easier to induce her to remain or forfeit all hope of ever receiving them, than with more than one."</p>
<p>Only the one maid was engaged, and now Anna's prophecy had come to pass, and she was remaining for the sake of her unpaid wages. She was a young girl, and pretty for one of her sisterhood, who perpetuate, as a rule, the hard and strenuous lineaments and forms held to hard labor, until they have attained a squat solidity of ungraceful muscle. This little Hungarian Marie was still not overdeveloped muscularly, although one saw her hands with a certain shock after her little, smiling face, which still smiled, despite her wrongs. Nothing could exceed the sweetness of the girl's disposition, although she came of a fierce peasant line, quick to resort to the knife as a redresser of injuries, and quick to perceive injuries.</p>
<p>Marie still danced assiduously about her tasks, which were manifold, for not one of the Carroll women had the slightest idea of any accountability in the matter of household labor. It never occurred to one of them to make her bed, or even hang up her dress, but, instead, to wonder why Marie did not do it. However, if Marie really had an ill day, or, as sometimes happened, was up all night at a ball, they never rebelled or spoke an impatient word. The beds simply remained unmade and the dresses where they had fallen. The ladies always had a kindly, ever-caressing smile or word for little Marie. They were actually, in a way, fond of her, as people are fond of a pretty little domestic beast of burden, and Marie herself adored them. She loved them from afar, and one of her great reasons for wishing to stay for her wages was to buy some finery after the fashion of Charlotte's and Ina's. Marie had not asked for her wages many times, and never of Captain Carroll, but to-night
<pb n="152     THE DEBTOR"/>

she took courage. There was a ball that week, Thursday, and her poor, little, cheap muslin of last season was bedraggled and faded until it was no longer wearable. Marie waylaid Captain Carroll as he was returning from the stable, whither he had been to see a lame foot of one of the horses. Marie stood in her kitchen door, around which was growing lustily a wild cucumber-vine. She put her two coarse hands on her hips, which were large with the full gathers of her cotton skirt. Around her neck was one of the garish-colored kerchiefs which had come with her from her own country. It was an ugly thing, but gave a picturesque bit of color to her otherwise dingy garb.</p>
<p>"Mr. Captain," said Marie, in a very small, sweet, almost infantile voice. It was frightened, yet with a certain coquetry in it. This small Hungarian girl had met with very few looks and words in her whole life which were not admiring. In spite of her poor estate she had the power of the eternal feminine, and she used it knowingly, but quite artlessly. She knew exactly how to speak to her "Mr. Captain," in such a way that a smile in response would be inevitable.</p>
<p>Carroll stopped. "Well, Marie?" he said, and he smiled down into the little face precisely after the manner of her calculation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Captain," said she again, and again came the feeler after a smile, the expression of droll sweetness and appeal which forced it.</p>
<p>"Well, Marie," said Carroll, "what is it? What do you want?"</p>
<p>Marie went straight to the point. "Mine vages," said she, and a bit of the coquetry faded, and her small smile waxed rather piteous. She wanted that new dress for the ball sadly.</p>
<p>Carroll's face changed; he compressed his mouth. Marie shrank a little with frightened eyes on his face.</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      153"/>

<p>"How much is it, Marie?" asked Carroll.</p>
<p>"Tree mont vage, Mr. Captain," answered Marie, eagerly, "I haf not had."</p>
<p>Carroll took out his pocket-book and gave her a ten-dollar note.</p>
<p>Marie reached out for it eagerly, but her face fell a little. "It is tree mont, Mr. Captain," she ventured.</p>
<p>"That is all I can spare to-night, Marie," said Carroll, quite sternly. "That will have to answer to-night."</p>
<p>Marie smiled again, eying him timidly. "Yes, it will my dress get for the ball, Mr. Captain."</p>
<p>Marie stood framed in her wild cucumber-vine, regarding the captain with her pretty ingratiation, but not another smile she got. Carroll strolled around to the front of the house, and in a second the carriage rolled around from the stable. Marie nodded to the coachman; there was never a man of her acquaintance but she had a pretty, artless salutation always ready for him. She shook her ten-dollar note triumphantly at him, and laughed with delight.</p>
<p>"Got money," said she. Marie had a way of ending up her words, especially those ending in y, as if she finished them up with a kiss. She pursed up her lips, and gave a most fascinating little nip to her vowels, which, as a rule, she sounded short. "Money," said she again, and the ten-dollar note fluttered like a green leaf from between the large thumb and forefinger of her coarse right hand.</p>
<p>The coachman laughed back in sympathy. He was still smiling when he drove up beside his employer at the front-door. He leaned from his seat just as the flutter of the ladies' dresses appeared at the front-door, and said something to Carroll, with a look of pleased expectation. That money in Marie's hand had cheered him on his own account.</p>
<p>Carroll looked at him gently imperturbable. "I am
<pb n="154      THE DEBTOR"/>

sorry, Martin. I shall be obliged to ask you to wait a few days," he said, with the utmost courtesy.</p>
<p>The man's honest, confident face fell. "You said--" he began.</p>
<p>"What did I say?" Carroll asked, calmly.</p>
<p>"You said you would let me have some to-night."</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember," Carroll said, "but I have had an unexpected demand since I returned from the City, and it has taken every cent of ready money. I must ask you to wait a few days longer. You are not in serious need of anything, Martin?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," said the man, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"I was going to say that if you were needing any little thing you might make use of my credit," said Carroll. As the ladies, Mrs. Carroll and Miss Carroll, came up to the carriage, Carroll thrust his hand in his pocket and drew forth a couple of cigars, which he handed to the coachman with a winning expression. "Here are a couple of cigars for you, Martin," he said.</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the coachman.</p>
<p>He put the cigars in his pocket and took up the lines. As he drove down the drive and along the shady Banbridge road he was wondering hard if Marie had got the money which Carroll had intended to pay him. He did not mind so much if she had it. Marie was Hungarian, and Martin had not much use for outlandish folk on general principles, but he had a sneaking admiration for little Marie. "Now she can go to her ball," thought he. Marie said the word as if it had one 1 and a short a-bal. Martin smiled inwardly at the recollection, though he did not allow his face of important dignity to relax.</p>
<p>He thought, further, that, after all, he need not worry about his own pay. Carroll had paid Marie and would pay him. He thought comfortably of the cigars, which were sure to be good. His original respect and admira-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      155"/>

tion for his employer swelled high in his heart. He felt quite happy driving his high-stepping horses over the good road. The conversation of the ladies at his back, and of Carroll at his side, passed his ears, trained not to hear, as unintelligibly as the babble of the birds. Martin had no curiosity.</p>
<p>While their elders were driving, the Carroll sisters and the brother were all out on the front porch. Ina was rocking in a rattan chair, Charlotte sat on the highest step of the porch leaning against a fluted white pillar, the boy sprawled miserably on the lowest step.</p>
<p>"It's awful dull," he complained.</p>
<p>Charlotte looked down at him commiseratingly from her semicircle of white muslin flounces. "I'll play ball with you awhile, Eddy, dear," said she.</p>
<p>The boy sniffed. "Don't want to play ball with a girl," he replied.</p>
<p>Charlotte said nothing.</p>
<p>Eddy twitched with his face averted. Then suddenly he looked up at his sister. "Charlotte, I love to play ball with you," said he, sweetly, "only, you see, I can't pitch hard enough, your hands are so awful soft, and I feel like I could pitch awful hard to-night."</p>
<p>"Well, I tell you what you may do, dear," said Ina.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Go down to the post-office and get the last mail."</p>
<p>Eddy started up with alacrity. "All right," said he.</p>
<p>"And you may run up-stairs to my room," said Charlotte, "and hunt round till you find my purse, and get out ten cents and buy yourself an ice-cream."</p>
<p>Eddy was up and out with a whoop.</p>
<p>"Are you expecting a letter, honey?" asked Charlotte of her sister.</p>
<p>Ina laughed evasively. "I thought Eddy would like to go," said she.</p>
<pb n="156     THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"Now, Ina, I know whom you are expecting a letter from; you can't cheat me."</p>
<p>Ina laughed rather foolishly; her face was pink.</p>
<p>Charlotte continued to regard her with a curious expression. It was at once sad, awed, and withal confused, in sympathy with the other girl. "Ina," said she.</p>
<p>"Well, honey?"</p>
<p>"I think you ought to tell me, your own sister, if you are--"</p>
<p>"What--"</p>
<p>"Ina, I really think--"</p>
<p>"Oh, hush, dear!" Ina whispered. "Here comes Mr. Eastman."</p>
<p>Young Frank Eastman, in his light summer clothes, came jauntily around the curve of the drive, his straw hat in hand, and the sisters fluttered to their feet to greet him. Then Eddy reappeared with the dime securely clutched, and inquired anxiously of Charlotte if she cared whether he bought soda or candy with it. Young Eastman ran after him down the walk and had a whispered conference. When the boy returned, which was speedily, he had a letter for his sister Ina and a box of the most extravagant candy which Banbridge afforded. The young people sat chatting and laughing and nibbling sweets until nearly ten o'clock. Then young Eastman took his leave.</p>
<p>He was rather desirous to be gone before Captain Carroll returned. Although Carroll always treated him with the most punctilious courtesy, even going out of his way to speak to him, the young man always felt a curious discomfort, as if he realized some covert disapprobation on the elder's part.</p>
<p>"They are late," Ina said, after the caller's light coat had disappeared behind the shrubbery.</p>
<p>"I suppose they waited for the moon to rise," Char-
<pb n="THE DEBTOR        157"/>
lotte replied. "You know Amy dearly loves to drive by moonlight."</p>
<p>"Well, let's go to bed, and not wait," Ina said, with a yawn. "I'm so sleepy." She had sat with her letter unopened in her lap all evening.</p>
<p>"All right," assented Charlotte.</p>
<p>"I'm going to sit here till they come," said Eddy.</p>
<p>"Very well," said Charlotte, "but mind you don't stir off the porch."</p>
<p>The two girls went up to their own rooms. They occupied adjoining ones. Charlotte slept in a small room out of the larger one which was Ina's.</p>
<p>Charlotte came in from her room brushing out her hair, and Ina was reading her letter. She looked up with a blushing confusion and crumpled the paper involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't start so," said Charlotte. "I know whom the letter is from. It's that old Major Arms."</p>
<p>"He is not old. He is no older than papa, and you don't call him old," Ina retorted, resentfully.</p>
<p>"I don't call him old for a father, but I would for--"</p>
<p>"Well, he isn't a--yet."</p>
<p>"Ina, you ought to tell me."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm going to marry Major Arms, so there!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Ina!"</p>
<p>The two girls stood staring at each other for a moment, then they ran to each other. "Oh, Charlotte! oh, Charlotte!" sobbed Ina, convulsively.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ina! oh, honey!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to, Charlotte. Oh, I am going to!"</p>
<p>"Ina, do you, do you--"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Love that old Major Arms?" Charlotte spoke out, in a tone of almost horror.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Oh, I don't know," sobbed Ina.</p>
<p>"Ina, you don't love--Mr. Eastman better?"</p>
<pb n="158        THE DEBTOR"/>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Ina, in a tone of utter conviction. "Charlotte, do you know what would happen if I married Mr. Eastman? Do you?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't."</p>
<p>"All my life long I would be at war with the butcher and baker, just as--just as we always are."</p>
<p>" Ina Carroll, you aren't getting married just for that? Oh, that is dreadful!"</p>
<p>"No, I am not," said Ina. "You call Major Arms old, and you don't see--you don't see how a girl can ever fall in love with him, but--I think he's splendid. Yes, I do. You can laugh, Charlotte, but I do. And it is a good deal to marry a man you can honestly say you think is splendid! But you can do a thing, for a very good, even a noble reason, and all the time know there is another reason not quite so noble, that you can't help but take some comfort in. And that is the way I do with this. Charlotte, poor papa does just the best he can, and there never was a man like him; Major Arms isn't anything in comparison with papa. I never thought he was, but there is one thing I am very tired of in this world, and I can't help thinking with a good deal of pleasure that when I am married I will be free from it."</p>
<p>"What is that, honey?" The two girls had sat down on Ina's window-seat, and were nestling close together, with their arms around each other's waist, and the two streams of dark hair intermingling.</p>
<p>"I am heartily tired," said Ina, in a tone of impatient scorn, "of this everlasting annoyance to which we are subjected from the people who want us to pay them money for the necessaries of life. We must have a certain amount of things in order to live at all, and if people must have the money for them, I want them to have it, and not have to endure such continual persecution."</p>
<pb n="THE DEBTOR      159"/>

<p>"Ina," said Charlotte, in a piteous, low voice, "do you think papa is very poor?"</p>
<p>"Yes, honey, I am afraid he is very poor."</p>
<p>Charlotte began to weep softly against her sister's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, honey," soothed Ina. "You can come and stay with me a great deal, you know."</p>
<p>"Ina Carroll, do you think I would leave papa?" demanded Charlotte, suddenly erect. "Do you think--I would? You can, if you want to, but I will not."</p>
<p>"It costs something to support us, dear," said Ina. "Don't be angry, precious."</p>
<p>"I will never have another new dress in all my life," said Charlotte. "I won't eat anything. I tell you I never will leave papa, Ina Carroll."</p>

CHAPTER XIV

<p>IT was about a week later when Anderson, going into the drug store one evening, found young Eastman in the line in front of the soda-fountain. A girl in white was with him, and Anderson thought at first glance that she was Charlotte Carroll, as a matter of course--he had so accustomed himself to think of the two in union by this time. Then he looked again and saw that the girl was much larger and fair-haired, and recognized her as Bessy Van Dor, William Van Dorn's daughter. The girl's semi-German parentage showed in her complexion and high-bosomed, matronly figure, although she was so young. She had a large but charming face, full of the sweetest placidity; her eyes, as blue as the sky, looked out upon the world with amiable assent to all its conditions. It required no acuteness to predict this as an ideal spouse for a man of a nervous and irritable temperament; that there was in her nature that which could supply cushioned fulnesses to all the exactions of his. She sat on a high stool and sipped her ice-cream soda with simple absorption in the pleasant sensation. She paid no attention whatever to her escort beside her, who took his soda with his eyes fixed on her. Her chin overlapping in pink curves like a rose, was sunken in the lace at her neck as she sipped. She did not sit straight, but rested in her corsets with an awkward lassitude of enjoyment. It was a very warm night, but she paid no attention to that. She was without a hat, and the beads of perspiration stood

<pb n="161"/>
THE DEBTOR

all over her pink forehead, and her thin white muslin

clung to her plump neck and arms. There was some-

thing almost indecent about the girl's enjoyment of her

soda. Hardly a man in the shop but was watching her.

Anderson gazed at her also, but with covert disgust and

a resentment which was absurd. He scowled at the

young fellow with her. He felt like a father whose

daughter has been flouted by the man of her choice.

"What the devil does the boy mean, taking soda here

with that Van Dorn girl?" he asked himself. He felt

like a reckoning with him, and chafed at the impossi-

bility of it. When the couple rose to go Anderson met

the young man's salutation with such a surly response

and such a stern glance that he fairly started. The

men stared as the two went out, their shoulders touching

as they passed through the door. The girl was round-

shouldered from careless standing, but she moved with

a palpitating grace of yielding, and the smooth, fair

braids which bound her head shone like silver.

"Guess that's a go," a man said, with a chuckle; "a

narrower door would have suited them just as well"

"Mighty good-looking girl," said Amidon.

"Healthy girl," said another. "If more young fel-

lows had the horse-sense to marry girls like that, I'd

give up medicine and go on a ranch." The Banbridge

doctor said that. He was rather young, and had been

in the village about five years. He had taken the

practice of an old physician, a distant relative who had

died six months before. Dr. Wilson was called a re-

markably able man in his profession. He had been

having several prescriptions filled, and kept several

waiting. He was a large man with a coarsely handsome

physique and a brutal humor with women. He was

not liked personally, but the people rather bragged

about their great physician and were proud when he

was called to the towns round about.

THE DEBTOR

"There's no getting Dr. Wilson, for a certainty, he

has such an enormous practice!" they said, with pride.

"That girl is as handsome and healthy as an Alderney

cow," he added, now, and the men laughed.

"She's a stunner," said Amidon.

Anderson went out abruptly without waiting to make

his purchase. He felt as repelled as only a man of his

temperament can feel. No woman could equal his

sense of utter disgust, first with the quite innocent girl

herself, next with the young physician for his insistence

upon the subject. His wrath against young Eastman,

his unreasoning and ridiculous wrath, swelled high as

he dwelt upon the outrage of his desertion of a girl like

his little Charlotte, that little creature of fire and dew,

for this full-blown rose of a woman-the outrage to her

and to himself. When he got home, his mother inquired

anxiously what the matter was.

"Nothing, dear," he replied, brusquely.

"You look as if something worried you," said she.

She had been taking a little evening toddle on her tiny,

slippered feet out in the old-fashioned flower-garden

beside the house, and she had a little bunch of sweet

herbs, which she dearly loved, in her hand. She fast-

ened a sprig of thyme in his coat as she stood talking to

him, and the insistent odor seemed as real as a presence

when he breathed. "Nothing has gone wrong with

your business, has there ?" she inquired, lovingly.

"No, mother," he replied, and moved away from her

gently, with the fragrance of the thyme strong in his

consciousness.

His mother put her sweet nosegay in water. Then

she went to bed, and Anderson sat on the stoop. Young

Eastman and the Van Dor girl passed after he sat

there, and he thought with a loving passion of pro-

tection of poor little Charlotte alone at home. "I'll

warrant the poor child is watching for that good-for-

THE DEBTOR

nothing scoundrel this minute," he told himself. He

would have liked to knock young Eastman down; it

would have delighted his soul to kick him; he would have

given a good deal to have had him at the top of the

steps.

The weather was intensely warm. He heard his

mother fling her bedroom blinds wide open to catch all

the air. The sky was clear, but all along the northwest

horizon was a play of lightning from a far-distant storm.

Anderson lit another cigar. The night seemed to grow

more and more oppress ve. When a breath of wind came,

it was like a hot breath of some fierce sentiency. A dis-

agreeable odor from something was also borne upon it.

The odors of the flowers seemed in abeyance. The play

of blue-and-rosy light along the northwest horizon con-

tinued. Anderson got a certain pleasure from watching

it. Nature's spectacularity diverted him, as if he had

been a child, from his own affairs, which seemed to give

him a dull pain. Between the flashes he asked himself

why.

"It is just right," he told himself; "just what I de-

sired. Why do I feel this way?"

Presently he decided with self-deception that it was

because of the recent scene in the drug store. He re-

membered quite distinctly the young man's gaze at the

stout, blue-eyed girl, "What right had the fellow to

look at another girl after that fashion ?" he said to him-

self. Then it struck him suddenly as being perhaps

impossible for him ever to look at Charlotte in just that

fashion. He thought with a thrill of indignant pride

that there was a maiden who would have the best of

love as her right. Then sitting there he heard a quick

tread and a trill of whistle as meaningless as that of a

robin, and young Eastman himself came alongside. He

stopped before the gate.

"Hullol" he said, suddenly.

<pb n="164"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Hullo!" responded Anderson.

"Got a match?" said Eastman.

"Sure."

Eastman sprang up the steps until he came in reach

of Anderson's proffered handful of matches. "Hotter 'n

blazes," he remarked, as he scratched a match on his

trousers leg.

" Hottest night of the season so far, I think," respond-

ed Anderson.

"I'm about beat out with it," said Eastman, lighting

his cigar with no difficulty in the dead atmosphere.

He threw himself sprawling on the step at Anderson's

feet, without any invitation. "Whewl" he sighed.

"It '11 be hotter than hades in the City to-morrow,"

he remarked, after a moment's silence.

Anderson muttered an assent. He was considering

as nervously as a woman whether he should say anything

to this boy. While he was hesitating, young Eastman

himself led up to it.

" Saw you in the drug store just now," he remarked.

"Yes; you were with-"

"Bessy Van Dorn -yes. Pretty girl?"     Eastman

spoke with the insufferable air of patronizing criticism

of extreme masculine youth towards the opposite sex.

"Very," replied Anderson, dryly.

The young fellow gave a furious puff at his cigar. The

smoke came full in Anderson's face. "Passed here

the other evening with two other young ladies while

you were sitting here," young Eastman remarked, in a

curious tone. It was full of pain, but it had a reckless,

devil-may-care defiance in it also.

"Yes," said Anderson, "I think you did. About a

week ago, wasn't it?"

"Week ago yesterday. Well, I suppose you've heard

the news. It's all over town."

"You mean-"

THE DEBTOR

"She's engaged."

Anderson felt bewildered. "Yes?" he replied, ques-

tioningly.

"She's engaged," the young fellow repeated, with

a sobbing sigh, which he ended in a laugh. "They all

do it, sir."

Anderson was too puzzled to say anything.

"Suppose you've heard about the man?" said East-

man, in a nonchalant voice. He inhaled the smoke

from his cigar with an air of abstract enjoyment.

Anderson unassumedly stared at him. "Why, I

thought it was-"

"Who?" asked the young fellow, eagerly.

Anderson hesitated.

"Who did you think it was?" Eastman persisted.

He had a pitiful wistfulness in his face upturned to the

older man. It became quite evident that he had a

desire to hear himself named as the accepted suitor.

"Why, I thought that. you were the man!" Anderson

answered.

"Everybody thought so, I guess," the young fellow

said, with an absurd and childlike pride in the sem-

blance in the midst of his grief over the reality. " But-"

He hesitated, and Anderson waited, looking above at

the play of lightning in the sky and smoking. "She's

gone and got engaged to a man old enough to be her

father. Lordl I guess he's older than her father-old

enough to be her grandfather!" cried the young fellow,

with a burst of grief and rage and shame. "Yes, sir,

old enough to be her grandfather," he repeated. His

voice shook. His cigar had gone out. He struck a

match and the head flew off. He swore softly and struck

another. Sometimes a match refusing to ignite changes

mourning to wrath and rebellion. The third match

broke short in two and the burning head flew down on

the sidewalk. "Wish I had hold of the man that made

x65

'em," young Eastman said, viciously; and in the same

breath: "What can the girl be thinking of, that she

flings herself away like that? Hang it all, is a woman a

devil or a fool ?"

Anderson removed his cigar long enough to ask a

question, then replaced it. "Who is the man?" he

inquired, in a slow, odd voice.

"Oh, he is an old army officer, a major-Major Arms,

I believe his name is. He's somebody they've known a

long time. He lives in Kentucky, I believe, in the same

place where the Carrolls used to live and where she went

to school. Oh, it's a good match. They're just tickled

to death over it. Her sister feels rather bad, I guess,

but, Lordl she'd do the same thing herself, if she got

the chance. They're all alike." The boy said the last

with a cynical bitterness beyond his years. IIe sneered

effectively. He crossed one leg over the other and

puffed his relighted cigar. The last match had ignited.

Anderson said nothing. He was accommodating his

ideas to the change of situation. Presently young

Eastman spoke again. "Well," he said, in a tone of

wretched conceit, "girls are as thick as flowers, after all,

and a lot alike. Bessy Van Dorn is a beauty, isn't

she ?"

" I don't think she's much like the other," said Ander-

son, shortly.

"She's full as pretty."

Anderson made no reply.

"I don't believe Bessy would go and marry a man

old enough to be her grandfather," said the boy, with a

burst of piteous challenge. Then suddenly he tossed

his cigar into the street and flung up his hands to his

head with a despairing gesture. "Oh, my God!" he

groaned.

"Be a man," Anderson said, in a kind voice.

"I am a man, ain't I ? What do you suppose I care

i66








<pb n="167"/>
THE DEBTOR

about it? I don't want to marry and settle down yet,

anyway. I like to fool with the girls, but as for any-

thing else-  I am a-man. If you think I am broken

up over this, if anybody thinks I am-  Lord-" The

young fellow rose and squared his shoulders. He

looked down at Anderson. "There's one thing I want

to say," he added. "I don't want you to think-I

don't want to give the impression that she-that she

has been flirting, or anything like that. She hasn't.

Of course she might have been a little franker, I will

admit that, for I have been there a good deal, but I

don't suppose she thought it was anything serious, and

it wasn't. She was right. But she did not flirt. Those

girls are not that sort. Great Scott  I should like to

see a man venture on any little familiarities with them-

holding hands, or a kiss, or anything. They respect

themselves, those girls do. They have been brought

up better than the Banbridge girls. Oh no, she hasn't

treated me badly or anything, and of course I don't care

a damn about her getting married, only I'll be hanged

if I like, on general principles, to see a pretty young girl

throwing herself away on a man old enough to be her

father. It's wrong-it's indecent, you know." Again

the boy's voice seemed bursting with wrath and grief

and shame.

Anderson rose, went into the house, and was out again

in a few seconds. He had a cigar-box in his hand.

"Try one of these," he said. "It's a brand new to me,

and I think it fine. I think you'll agree with me."

"Thanks," said Eastman, with a sound in his voice

like a heart-broken child's. He almost sobbed, but

he took the cigar gratefully. "Well, I must be going,"

he said. "Mother '11 wonder where I am. It was too

deuced hot to go to bed, so I've been strolling around.

But I've got to turn in sometime. These nights are

too hot to sleep, anyhow."

lI                  167

THE DEBTOR

"Yes, they are pretty tough," said Anderson. "Wish

we could have a shower."

"So do I. Say, this cigar is a dandy."

"I thought you'd like it. Of course it isn't a cigar

that everybody would like. It requires some taste,

perhaps a cultivated taste."

"Yes, that's so," replied the boy, with a pleased air.

"I guess it does. I shouldn't say every man would ap-

preciate this."

"Have another," said Anderson, and he pressed a

couple into the hot young hand, which was greedily

reached out for a little solace for its owner's wounded

heart and self-love.

"Thanks. I suppose I have quite a good taste for a

good cigar. I don't believe it would be very easy to

palm off a cheap grade on me. Good-night, Mr. Ander-

son."

"Good-night," said Anderson, and was conscious of

pity and amusement as the boy went away and his foot-

steps died out of hearing. As for himself, he was in

much the same case as before, only the time had evi-

dently arrived for him to dismiss his dreams and the

lady of them. He did not think so hardly of her for

being willing to marry the older man as the disappointed

young man did. He considered himself as compara-

tively old, and he had a feeling of sympathy for the other

old fellow who doubtless loved her. He was prepared

to think that she had done a wiser thing than to engage

herself to young Eastman, especially if the man was

rich enough to take care of her. The position would be

good, too. He thought generously of that consideration,

although it touched him in his tenderest spot of vanity.

"She will do well to marry an ex- army officer," he

thought. "She will have the entree to any society."

Presently he arose and went up-stairs to bed. He

passed roughly by the nook where he had so often

I68








<pb n="169"/>
THE DEBTOR

fancied her sitting, and closed, as it were, the door of

his fancy against her with a bang. He set a lamp on a

table at the head of his bed and read his political econo-

my until dawn. It was, in fact, too hot for any nervous

person to sleep. Now and then his thoughts wandered,

the incessant drone of the night insects outside seemed

to distract his attention from his book like some per-

sistent clamor of nature recalling him to his leading-

strings in which she had held him from the first. But

resolutely he turned again to his book. At dawn he

fell asleep, and woke an hour later to another steaming

day.

CHAPTER XV

"I THINK we shall have thunder-showers to-day,"

Mrs. Anderson remarked, as she poured the coffee at the

breakfast-table. Even this old gentlewoman, carefully

attired in her dainty white lawn wrapper, had that

slightly dissipated, bewildered, and rancorous air that

extreme heat is apt to impart to the finest-grained of us.

Her fair old face had a glossy flush, her white hair,

which usually puffed with a soft wave over her temples,

was stringy. She allowed her wrapper to remain open

at the neck, exposing her old throat, and dispensed

with her usual swathing of lace. She confessed that she

had not been able to sleep at all; still she kept her trust

in Providence, and would scarcely admit to discomfort.

"I am sure there will be showers, and cool the air,"

she said, with her sweet optimism. As she spoke she

fanned herself with the great palm-leaf fan with a green

bow on the stem, which she was never without during

this weather. "It is certainly very warm so early in

the season. One must feel it a little, but it is al-

ways so delightful after a shower that it compen-

sates."

"You are showing a lovely Christian spirit, mother,"

Anderson returned, smiling at her with fond amuse-

ment, "but don't be hypocritical."

"My son, what do you mean?"

"Mother, dear, you don't really like this weather.

You only pretend to because man did not make it."

"Randolph!"

170








<pb n="171"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Only think how you would growl if the mayor and

aldermen, or even the president, made this weatherl"

"My son, they did not," Mrs. Anderson responded,

solemnly.

"No, and that settles it, I suppose. If they did, you

would say at once they ought to be forced to resign from

their offices. Now, mother, be resigned all you like,

but don't be pleased, for you can't cheat the Providence

that made this beastly heat, and must know perfectly

well how beastly it is, better than you or I do, and won't

think any more of us for any pretence in the matter."

"You shock me, dear. And, besides, I did not say

that I liked it. I said I liked the weather after a shower.

You look pale this morning, dear, and you don't talk

quite like yourself. I do wish you would take an um-

brella when you go to the office to-day. It is so very

warm." Mrs. Anderson had a chronic fear of sunstroke.

* When Randolph went away without his umbrella, as

he usually did, being, dearly as he loved his mother,

impervious to some of her feminine demands, she

watched him, standing in the doorway and shaking her

head with a dubious air.

That noon she was quite contented, for he did actu-

ally carry his umbrella. The sky in the northwest was

threatening, although the sun still shone fiercely in the

south. She herself sat on the doorstep in the shade, and

fairly panted like a corpulent old dog. Her mouth was

open and her tongue even lolled a little. She was, in

reality, suffering frightfully. She had both flesh and

nerves, and, given these two adverse conditions to en-

durance, and the mercury ninety in the shade, there is

torture although the spirit is strong.

Although the sky was threatening all the afternoon,

it was not until four o'clock that the northwest sky

grew distinctly ominous and the rumble of the thunder

was audible. Then Mrs. Anderson called her maid, and

17'








<pb n="172"/>
THE DEBTOR

they proceeded to close tightly all the windows against

the rising wind.

"It is very dangerous indeed to have a draught in

the house in a thunder-shower," Mrs. Anderson always

said while closing them.

Then she hurriedly divested herself of the white lawn

wrapper which she had worn all day, and put on her

black summer silk gown, with a wrap and a bonnet and

an umbrella at hand. Mrs. Anderson was not afraid of a

thunder-shower in the ordinary sense, but her imagina-

tion never failed her. Therefore she was always dressed,

in case the worst should happen and she be forced to

flee from a stricken house. She also had her small and

portable treasures ready at hand. Then she sat down

in the middle of the sitting-room well out of range of

the chimney, and prayed for her own and her son's

safety, and incidentally for the safety of the maid, who

was in the adjoining room with the door open, and for

the house and her son's store. She always did thus in a

thunder-shower, but she never told any one this inno-

cent childish secret of an innocent old soul.

She thought with a sort of undercurrent of faithless-

ness of the great draught in her son's store if the large

front doors and the office door were both open, as

there was a strong probability of their being. She

thought uneasily that her son might be that very mo-

ment in that draught, as indeed he was. He stood in

the strong current of fresh storm-air, with its pungent

odors, more like revelations than odors, of things which

had been in abeyance for some time past in the drought.

The smell of the wet green things was like a paean of

joy. It was a call of renewed life out of concealed

places of fainting and hiding. There were scents of

flowers and fruits. and another strange odor, like the

smell of battle, from all the ferment on the earth which

had precipitated the storm. It was quite a severe

172








<pb n="173"/>
THE DEBTOR

thunder-shower. The rain had held off for a fierce

prelude, then it came in solid cataracts. Then it was

that Charlotte Carroll rushed into the store. She was

dripping, beaten like a flower, by the force of the liquid

flail of the storm. She had pulled off the rose-wreathed

hat which was dear to her heart, and she had it under her

dress skirt, which she held up over her lace-trimmed

petticoat modestly, with as little revelation as might

be. Her dark head glistened with the rain.

Anderson stepped forward quickly. "Pray come into

the office, Miss Carroll," he said.

But she remained standing in front of the door, having

removed her hat furtively from its shelter. "No, thank

you," said she, "I would rather stay here. I like to

watch it."

Anderson fetched a chair from his office, but she

thanked him and said that she preferred standing.

"I thought I had time to get to Madame Griggs's on

the other side of the street," said she, "but all at once

it came down."

Anderson felt her ungraciousness, but she herself did

not seem to realize it at all. Presently she gave a little

sidewise smile at him, and comprehended in the smile

the old clerk and the boy who hovered near.

"It is a fine shower," said she, with a kind of con-

fidential glee. As she spoke she looked out at the

snarl of rain shot with lances of electric fire, and there

was a curious elation, almost like intoxication, in her

expression. She was in a fine spiritual excitement.

"Yes," said Anderson. "We needed rain."

Just then the world seemed swimming in blue light

and there was a terrific crash. Anderson, who never

thought of any personal fear in a tempest, looked rather

apprehensively at the girl. He recalled his mother's

fear of draughts.

"Perhaps you had better move back a little; that was

i73








<pb n="174"/>
THE DEBTOR

quite near," he said. Somehow the little fears and

precautions which he scorned for himself seemed to

apply quite reasonably to this little, tender, pretty

creature with the lightning playing around her and the

thunder breaking over her defenceless head.

Charlotte laughed. "Oh, I am not afraid," said she.

Then she added, quite innocently, with more of personal

appeal than she had ever used towards him, "Are you?"

" No," said Anderson.

"I like it," said she, staring out at the swaying,

brandishing maples, and the street which ran like a

river, with now and then a boiling pool.

"I am afraid you are wet," said Anderson.

"Yes," said she, "but that is nothing. My dress

won't hurt. It is just white lawn, you know. All that

would be hurt is my hat, and that is hardly damp. I

took it off." She held it up carefully on one hand, and

gazed solicitously at it. "It is my best hat," said she,

simply. "No, I don't think it is hurt at all." She

looked sharply towards the counter. "The counter is

clean, isn't it?" said she. "I might lay my hat there.

I don't want to put it on until my hair gets dry."

The old clerk smiled covertly, the boy grinned at

her in a fascinated way. Anderson regarded her with

worshipful amazement. This little, artless revelation

of the innermost vanity of a woman's heart touched him.

It was to him inconceivable that she should so care for

the welfare of that flower-bedecked oval of straw, and

yet he thought it adorable of her to care. He stared at

the hat as if it had been a halo, then he turned and

looked anxiously at the counter.

"Get a sheet of clean paper," he ordered the boy, and

frowned at him for his grin.

The boy obeyed solemnly.

"I think that will not soil your hat," Anderson said,

when the preparations were complete.

I74








<pb n="175"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Oh, thank you," she said, and handed him the hat.

Anderson touched it gingerly as if it were alive, and

placed it upside down on the clean sheet of paper.

"The other way up, please," said she, and Anderson

changed it in alarm.

"I hope I have not injured it," he said.

She was laughing openly at him. "No," she replied,

"but you put it right on the roses. Men don't know

how to handle girls' hats, do they?"

"No; I fear they don't," replied Anderson.

He remained leaning against the counter near the

door; the old clerk lounged against the next one, on

the end of which Sam Riggs was perched. Charlotte

remained standing in the doorway, leaning slightly

against the post, and they all watched the storm, which

was fast reaching its height. The flashes of lightning

were more frequent, the crashes of thunder followed

fast, sound overlapping sight. The rain became a flood.

The girl watched, with the intense, self-forgetful delight

of a child, the plash of the great blobs of rain on the

macadamized road outside. They came to look to her

exactly like little figures chasing one another in an un-

intermittent race of annihilation. She smiled, watching

them. Anderson, looking from the rain to her, saw the

smile, and thought with a little pang that she was prob-

ably thinking of her own happiness when she smiled to

herself like that. He kept his eyes fixed upon her for a

moment, her glistening dark head, her smooth cheek,

her smiling mouth, her shoulders faintly pink through

her thin white gown, which, being wet, clung to them.

Charlotte's shoulders were thin, but the hollowing curve

from the throat to the arm was ravishing. Anderson's

face hardened a little. He looked away again at the rain.

All at once Charlotte glanced up from the dancing

flight of the rain- drops on the road, and laughed.

"Why," she cried, "there is Ina! There is my sisterl"

I 75








<pb n="176"/>
THE DEBTOR

Anderson looked, and in a second-story window op.

posite was a girl's head in a violet-trimmed hat. She

was smiling and nodding. Charlotte waved her hand

to her.

"I'll be over as soon as it holds up a little," she cried

out. "Did you get wet?"

The girl in the window hollowed a slim hand over an

ear.

"Did you get caught in the shower? Did you get

wet?" called Charlotte.

The girl in the window shook her head gayly.

"She didn't," Charlotte said, with an absurd but

charming confidence to Anderson; "but, anyway, she

didn't have on her very best hat."

"I am very glad," Anderson replied, politely. He

read a sign fastened beneath the window which framed

the girl's head-"Madame Estelle Griggs, Modiste."

He reflected that she was the Banbridge dressmaker,

and that Charlotte was probably having her trousseau

made there, which was a deduction that only a mascu-

line mind of vivid imagination could have evolved.

Charlotte was gazing eagerly across at her sister.

"It does not rain nearly so hard now," said she. "I

think I might venture." She looked irresolutely at

her hat on the counter.

"I can let you have an umbrella," said Anderson.

"Thank you," said Charlotte, "but my hair is still

so wet, and my hat is lined with pink chiffon, you know."

"Yes," said Anderson, respectfully. He did not

know what pink chiffon was, but he understood that

water would injure it.

"If I might leave my hat here," said Charlotte, "until

I come back-"

"Certainly," replied Anderson.

"Then I think I can go now. No, thank you; I

won't take the umbrella. I am about as wet as I can

176








<pb n="177"/>
THE DEBTOR

be now, and, besides, I like to feel the rain on my shoul-

ders."

With a careful but wary gathering up of her white

skirts, with chary disclosures of lace and embroidery

and little skipping shoes, she was gone in a snowy whirl

through the mist across the street. She seemed to fly

over the puddles. The girl's head disappeared from the

opposite window and Anderson heard quite distinctly

the outburst of laughter and explanation.

"You had better get a sheet of tissue-paper and put

it over that," he said to Sam Riggs, and he pointed at

Charlotte's hat on the counter. Then he went back

to his office and wrote some letters. He resolved that

he would not see Charlotte when she returned for her

hat.

Presently the sun shone into the office, and a new light

seemed to come from the rain-drenched branches out-

side the window. Anderson continued to write, feeling

all the time unhappiness heavy in his heart. He also

had a sense of injury which was foreign to him. He

was distinctly aware that he had an unfair allotment

of the good things of life. Yet there was a question

dinning through his consciousness: "Why should I have

so little?" Then the world-old query considering per-

sonal responsibility for misery swept over him. "What

have I done?" he asked himself, and answered him-

self, with a fierce challenge of truth, that he had done

nothing. 'Then the habit of his life of patience, which

was at the same time a habit of bravery, asserted itself.

He wrote his letters carefully and closed his ears to the

questions.

It was about half an hour later, and he was thinking

about going home, when Sam Riggs came to the office

door and informed him that Mrs. Griggs wanted to see

him.

Mrs. Griggs was Madame nowhere except on her sign

I77








<pb n="178"/>
THE DEBTOR

and in the mouths of a few genteel patrons who con.

sidered that Madame had a more fashionable sound than

Mrs.

"Ask her to come in here," Anderson said, and di-

rectly the dressmaker appeared. She was a tiny, thin,

nervous creature with restless, veinous little hands, and

a long, thin neck upon which her small frizzled head vi-

brated constantly like the head of a bird. Anderson

knew her very well. Back in his childhood they had

been schoolmates. He remembered distinctly little Stel-

la Mixter. She had been a sharp, meagre, but rather

pretty little girl, with light curls, and was always dressed

in blue. She wore blue now, for that matter - blue

muslin, ornate with lace and ribbons. She had had a

sad and hard life, but her spirit still asserted itself.

Her husband had deserted her; she had lost her one

child; she worked like a galley-slave, but she still frizzed

her hair carefully, and never neglected her own costume

even in her greatest rush of business, and that in a dress-

maker showed deathless ambition and self-respect.

Anderson greeted her and offered her a chair. She

seated herself with a conscious elegance, and disposed

gracefully around her thin knees her blue muslin flounces.

There was a slight coquetry in her manner, although she

was evidently anxious about something. She looked

around and spoke in a low voice.

" I want to ask you something," she said, in a whisper.

"Certainly," said Anderson.

"You used to be a lawyer, and I don't suppose you

have forgotten all your law, if you are in the grocery

business now." There was about the woman the very

naivet6 of commonplaceness and offence.

Anderson smiled. "I trust not, Mrs. Griggs," he

replied.

" Well"-she lowered her voice still more-" I wanted

to ask you-   I've got a big job of work for-that

178








<pb n="179"/>
THE DEBTOR

Carroll girl that's going to be married, and I've heard

something that made me kind of uneasy. What I

want to know is, do you s'pose I'm likely to get my

pay?"

" I know nothing whatever about the family's financial

standing," Anderson replied, after a slight pause. He

spoke constrainedly, and did not look at his questioner.

"You don't know whether I'm likely to get my pay

or not?"

Anderson looked at her then, the little, nervous,

overworked, almost desperate creature, fighting like a

little animal in her bay of life against the odds which

would drive her from it, and he felt in a horrible per-

plexity. He felt also profane. Why could not he be

left out of this? he inquired, with concealed emphasis.

Finally he said that he would rather not advise in a case

about which he knew so little.

"I'm willing to pay," said the dressmaker, with her

artless vulgarity.

"It is not that," Anderson said, quickly, with some

asperity.

"I don't know," said the dressmaker, innocently

deepening the offence, "but what you didn't feel as if

you could give law-advice for nothin', even if you had

quit the law. I s'pose it cost you a good deal to learn

the law, and I know you didn't git your money back."

She spoke with the kindest sympathy.

"That has nothing to do with it," Anderson repeated,

with an inflection of irritated patience. "I cannot give

any advice because I know nothing whatever about the

matter."

"Can't you find out?"

"That belongs to the business which I have given up."

"Well, I s'pose it does," admitted Madame Griggs,

with a sigh. "I wouldn't have bothered you if I hadn't

been at my wit's end."

I79








<pb n="180"/>
THE DEBTOR

"I am willing to do anything in my power-" began

Anderson, with a softened glance at the absurdly pa-

thetic little figure, "but-"

"Then you think I had better not trust them?"

"No; I said-"

" You think I had better send her word I've changed

my mind, and can't do her work?"

Anderson winced. "No; I did not say so," he replied,

vehemently. "I merely said that you must settle-"

"Then you think I had better keep on with it?"

"If you think best," said Anderson, emphatically.

"Really, Mrs. Griggs, I cannot settle this matter for you.

You often trust people in your business. You must

decide yourself."

The dressmaker arose. "Well, I guess it's all right,"

said she. "She's a lovely girl, and so are they all.

Her mother seems sort of childish, but she's real sweet-

spoken. I guess it's all right, but I'd heard some

things, and I thought I would ask you what you thought.

I thought it wouldn't do any harm. Now I feel a good

deal easier about it. Good-afternoon. What a tempest

we've had!"

"Yes," said Anderson. "Good-afternoon." He was

conscious of a mental giddiness as he regarded her.

"We needed it, and I do think it has cooled the air a

little. I'm very much obliged. I don't suppose there

is any use in my offering to pay you, now you're in the

grocery business?"

"Certainly not. I have done nothing to admit of

any question of payment," replied Anderson, curtly.

"Well, I s'pose you throw it in along with the butter

and eggs," said Madame Griggs, with a return of her

slight coquetry. "By-the-way, I wish you'd send over

five pounds of that best butter. Good-afternoon."

"Good-afternoon."

The dressmaker turned in the doorway and looked

I80








<pb n="181"/>
THE DEBTOR

back. "I'm so glad to have my mind settled about it,"

she said, with a pathos which overcame her absurdity

and vulgarity. "I do work awful hard, and it doesn't

seem as if I could lose my money." She appeared sud-

denly tragic in her cheap muslin and her frizzes. She

looked old and her features sharpened out rigidly.

Anderson, looking after her, felt both bewilderment

and compunction. He thought for a moment of going

after her and saying something further; then he heard a

flutter and a quick sweet voice, and he knew that Char-

lotte had come for her hat. He heard her say: "Where ?

Oh, I see; all covered up so nicely. Thank you. I

did not come before, because the trees were dripping.

Thank you." Then there was a silence.

Anderson got his hat and went out through the store.

The old clerk was fussing over some packages on the

counter.

"That young lady came for her hat," he remarked.

"Did she?"

"Yes. She's a pretty-spoken girl. Her sister's goin'

to git married before long, I hear."

Anderson stopped and stared at him. "No; this is

the one."

"No; her sister. I had it straight."

Anderson went out. Everything was wonderful out-

side. The world was purified of dust and tarnish as a

soul of sin. The worn prosaicness of nature was adorned

as with jewels. Everything glittered; a thousand rain-

bows seemed to hang on the drenched trees. New

blossoms looked out like new eyes of rapture; every

leaf had a high-light of joy. Anderson drew a long

breath. The air was alive with the breath of the sea

from which the fresh wind blew. He walked home with

a quick step like a boy. He was smiling, and fast to his

breast, like a beloved child, he clasped his dream again.

CHAPTER XVI

THERE had been considerable discussion among the

ladies of the Carroll family with regard to the necessary

finery for Ina's bridal.

"It is all very well to talk about Ina's being married

in four weeks," said Anna Carroll to her sister-in-law,

one afternoon directly after the affair had been settled.

" If a girl gets married, she has to have new clothes, of

course-a trousseau."

"Why, yes, of course! How could she be married if

she didn't have a trousseau? I had a very pretty trous-

seau, and so would you if you had been married, Anna,

dear."

Anna laughed, a trifle bitterly. "Good Lord," said

she, "if I had to think of a trousseau for myself, I should

be a maniac! The trousseau would at any time have

seemed a much more difficult matter than the bride-

groom. "

" Yes, I know you have had a great many very good

chances," assented Mrs. Carroll, and it would have

seemed most of the time much easier to have just man-

aged the husband part of it than the new clothes, because

one doesn't have to pay cash or have good credit for a

husband, and one does for clothes."

" Well," said Anna Carroll, "that is the trouble about

Ina. It was easy enough for her to get the husband.

Major Arms has always had his eye on her ever since she

was in short dresses; but what isn't at all easy is the

new clothes."

"I don't see why, dear."

"Well, how is it to be managed, if you will be so

good as to inform me, Amy?"

"How? Why, just go to the dressmaker's and order

them, of course."

"What dressmaker's, dear?"

"Well, I think that last New York dressmaker is the

best. She really has imagination like a French dress-

maker. She doesn't copy; she creates. She is really

quite an artist."

"Madame Potoffsky. you mean?"

"Yes, dear. The dressmaker whose husband they

say was a descendant of the Polish patriot. They say

she herself is descended from a Russian princess who

eloped with the Polish patriot, and I can believe it.

There is something very unusual about her. She always

makes me a little bit nervous, because one does get to

associating Russians, especially those that run away

with patriots, with bombs and things of that kind, but

she is a wonderful dressmaker. I certainly think it

would be wise to patronize her for Ina's trousseau,

Anna."

Anna laughed, and rather bitterly, again. "Well,

dear, I have my doubts about our ability to patronize

her," she said, "and, granting that we could, you might

in reality encounter the bomb as penalty."

"Anna, dear, what-"

"Amy, don't you know that Madame Potoffsky

simply will not give us any further credit?"

"Oh, Anna, do you think so?"

"I know. Amy, only think of the things we owe her

for now -my linen, my pongee, my canvas, your two

foulards, Ina's muslin, Charlotte's 6tamine! It is im-

possible."

"Oh, dear! Do we owe her for all those?"

"We do."

"Well, then, I fear you are right, Anna," Mrs. Carroll

said, ruefully.

The two women continued to look at each other.

Mrs. Carroll had a curious round-eyed face of consterna-

tion, like a baby; Anna looked, on the contrary, older

than usual. Her features seemed quite sharpened out

by thought.

"What do you think we can do, Anna?" asked Mrs.

Carroll, at length. " Do you suppose if we told Madame

Potoffsky just how it was, how dear Ina was going to

be married, and how interested we all were in having

her look nice and have pretty things that she would-"

"No, I don't think so," Anna said, shortly. "What

does Madame Potoffsky care about Ina and her getting

married, except for what she makes out of it?"

"But, Anna, she is very rich. Everybody says so.

She has a beautiful house, and a country-house, and

keeps a carriage to go to her shop in."

"Well, what of that?"

"I thought the Russians believed that rich people

ought to do things for people who were not rich, or else

be blown up with bombs."

"Don't be silly, Amy, darling."

"I am quite in earnest, Anna, I really thought so."

"Well, you thought wrong then, dear. There is no

reason in the world why a dressmaker, if she is as rich

as a Vanderbilt, should make Ina's wedding-clothes for

nothing, and she won't."

"Well, I suppose you are right, Anna, but what is to

be done? How about Miss Sargent? She was very

good."

"Miss Sargent, Amy dear!"

"Do we owe her much, Anna?"

"Owe her much? We owe her everything!"

"Madame Rogers?"

"Madame Rogers! The last time I asked her to do

184








<pb n="185"/>
THE DEBTOR

anything she insulted me. She told me to my face she

did not work for dead-beats."

"She was a very vulgar woman, Anna. I don't think

I would patronize her under any circumstances."

"No, I would not either, dear. But that finishes the

New York dressmakers."

"How about the Hillfield one?"

"Amy!"

"Well, I suppose you are right; but what-"

"We shall have to go to a dressmaker in Banbridge.

We have never had any work done here, and there can

be no difficulty about it."

"But, Anna, how can we have her married with a

trousseau made in Banbridge?"

"It is either that or no trousseau at all."

Mrs. Carroll seldom wept, but she actually shed a

few tears over the prospect of a shabbily made trousseau

for Ina. "And she will go in the best society'in Ken-

tucky, too," she said, pitifully. "They'll attribute it

all to the lack of taste in the North," Anna said.

Ina herself made no objection whatever to employing

the Banbridge dressmaker; in fact, she seemed to have

little interest in her clothes at first. After a while she

became rather feverishly excited over them.

"I have always wondered why girls cared so much

about their wedding-clothes," she told her sister after

two weeks, when the preparations were well under way,

"but now I know."

"Why?" asked Charlotte. The two were coming

home from the dressmaker's, where Ina had been trying

on gowns for an hour. It was late in the afternoon and

nearly time for Captain Carroll's train.

"Why?" repeated Charlotte, when Ina did not an-

swer at once.

"In order to keep from thinking so much about the

marriage itself," said Ina, tersely. She did not look

185








<pb n="186"/>
THE DEBTOR

at her sister, but kept her eyes fixed on the road ahead

of her.

Charlotte, however, almost stopped. "Ina," said

she, in a distressed tone-" Ina, dear, you don't feel

like that?"

"Why not?" inquired Ina, defiantly.

" Oh, Ina, you ought not to get married if you feel like

that!"

"Why not? All girls feel like that when they are

going to be married. They must."

"Oh, Ina, I know they don't!"

"How do you know? You were never going to get

married."

That argument was rather too much for Charlotte,

but she continued to gaze at her sister with a shocked

and doubtful air as they walked along the shady side-

walk towards home. "I am almost sure it isn't right for

a girl to feel so, anyhow," she said, persistently.

"Yes, it is, too," Ina said, laughing easily. "Char-

lotte, honey, I really think my things are going to do

very well. I really think so. That tan canvas is a

beauty, and so is the red foulard. She is really a very

good dressmaker."

"I think so too, dear," Charlotte agreed. "I like the

wedding-gown, too."

"Yes, so do I; it is very pretty, though that does not

so much matter."

"Why, Ina Carroll!"

Ina laughed mischievously. "Now I have shocked

you, dear. Of course it matters in one way, but I shall

never wear it again after the ceremony; and you know

I don't care much about the Banbridge people, and

they will be the only ones to see me in it, and only that

once."

"But, Ina, he-your-Major Arms."

Ina laughed again. "Oh, well, he thinks me per-

I86








<pb n="187"/>
THE DEBTOR

fectly beautiful anyway," said she, in the tone of one to

whom love was as dross because of the superabundance

of it.

"Ina," said Charlotte, with a solemn and timidly

reflective air, "I don't believe you think half as much

of him as you would if he didn't think so much of you."

"Yes, I do think just as much," said Ina, "but things

always seem worth rather more when they are in a show-

case and marked more than one can ever pay." Then

she started, and exclaimed: "Good gracious, there he

is now!" She flushed all over her face and neck; then

she turned pale and cast a half-wild look around her as

if she wanted to run somewhere.

Indeed, at 'that moment the Carroll carriage drew

up beside them, and on the back seat sat Captain Carroll

and a very handsome man apparently about his own

age, although at first glance he looked older because

of snow-white hair and mustache. He was as tall as

Carroll, and thinner, and less punctiliously attired, al-

though he wore his somewhat slouching clothes with a

certain careless assurance of being the master of them

which Carroll, with all his elegance, did not excel.

"Here we are!" called Carroll. He was smiling, al-

though he had a slightly worried look. The other man's

black eyes were fixed with a sort of tender hunger on

Ina, who hung back a little as she and Charlotte ap-

proached the carriage. It was actually Charlotte who

shook hands first with Major Arms, although she tried

to give her sister precedence.

Ina blushed a good deal, and smiled rather tremulously

when her turn came and her little hand was enveloped

in the man's eager one.

"I-didn't know-I didn't-" she stammered.

"No, you didn't, did ye, honey?" said the major, in

the broadest of Southern drawls. "No, ye didn't.

The old fellow thought he'd surprise ye, honey." The

187








<pb n="188"/>
THE DEBTOR

man's face and voice were as frankly expressive of de-

lighted love as a boy's. "Arthur," said he, "over with

ye to the front seat and let me have my sweetheart in

here with me. I want my arms around her. Not an-

other minute can I wait. Over with ye, boy!"

Carroll threw open the carriage door and sprang out.

"Jump in, Ina," he said, and placed a hand under his

daughter's arm. She gave a smiling and not altogether

unhappy, but still piteous, look at him, and hung back

slightly. "Jump in, dear," he said, again; and Ina was

in the carriage, and there was a sweep of a long gray-

clad arm around her and the sound of kisses.

"Now, Charlotte," said Carroll, "get in the front

seat. I will walk the rest of the way."

"No, papa," Charlotte replied, "I will walk with you.

I would rather." So the carriage rolled on, and Char-

lotte and Carroll followed on foot.

"Did you expect him, papa?" asked Charlotte.

"No, honey. The first thing I knew he came up to

me on the ferry. He came on this morning; he has been

in New York all day. I guess he wanted to buy some-

thing for Ina."

"Her ring ?" asked Charlotte, in a slightly awed

tone.

"Very likely."

"Papa, is Major Arms rich?" asked Charlotte.

"Quite, I think, dear. I don't know how much he

has in reality, but he has his pay from the government-

he is on the retired list--and he owns considerable

property. He has enough and to spare, there is no

doubt about that."

"So if Ina has things and people trouble her for pay-

ment she can pay them," remarked Charlotte, thought-

fully.

"Yes," said Carroll, shortly. He quickened his pace,

and Charlotte made a little run to get into step again.

i88








<pb n="189"/>
THE DEBTOR

"That will be very nice," said she. "Do you think

he will be good to her, papa?"

"Sure as I am of anything in this world, dear."

"It would be dreadful if he wasn't. Whatever else

Ina or any of us haven't had, we've always had that.

We've always lived with folks that loved us and were

good to us. That would kill Ina and me quickest of

anything, papa."

"He will be good to her, dear," said Carroll, pleasant-

ly. He looked down at Charlotte and laughed. " It's

all right, baby," he said. " She's got one man in a thou-

sand-one worth a thousand of your old dad."

"No, she hasn't," said Charlotte, with indignation.

She caught her father's arm and clung to it lovingly.

"There is nobody in the world so good as you," she said,

with fervor. "I wouldn't leave you for any man in the

world, papa."

"You wait," Carroll said, laughing.

"Papa, you don't wish I were going to be married

too? You don't want me to go away like Ina?" Char-

lotte demanded, with a sudden grieved catch in her

voice.

"I never want you to go, darling," Carroll replied,

and he looked down with adoration at the little face

whose whole meaning seemed one of innocent love for

and belief in him. He realized the same terror at

the mere fancy of losing this artless and unquestion-

ing devotion as one might feel at the fancy of losing his

only prop from the edge of a precipice. The man really

had for an instant a glimpse of a sheer descent in his

own nature which might be ever before his sickened

vision if this one little faith and ignorance were removed.

In a curious fashion a man sometimes holds an innocent

love between himself and himself, and Carroll so held

Charlotte's.

"I will never leave you for any other man. I don't

189








<pb n="190"/>
THE DEBTOR

care who he is," Charlotte reiterated, and this time her

father let her assertion go unchallenged. He pressed

the little, clinging hand on his arm closer.

Charlotte looked at him as she might have looked

at a king as he walked along in his stately fashion. She

was unutterably proud of him.

The carriage had reached the house some time before

they arrived. The man was just driving round to the

stable when they came up to the front door. The guest

and Ina were nowhere to be seen, but on the porch stood

Mrs. Carroll and Anna. They were both laughing, but

Anna looked worried in spite of her laugh.

"What do you think, Arthur," whispered Mrs. Car-

roll, with a cautious glance towards a chamber window.

" Here he has come, the son-in-law, and there is no meat

again for dinner." Mrs. Carroll burst into a peal of

laughter.

"I don't see much to laugh at," said Anna, but she

laughed a little.

Carroll made a step to the side of the porch and called

to the coachman. "Martin," he called, "don't take

the horse out. Come back here. We must send for

something," he declared, a little brusquely for him.

"It is all very well to send, Arthur," said Mrs. Carroll,

"but the butcher won't let us have it if we do send."

"It is no use, Arthur," Anna Carroll said. "We

cannot get a thing for this man's dinner, and not only

to-day, but to-morrow and while he stays, unless we

pay cash."

Carroll turned to the coachman, who had just come

alongside. "Martin," he said, "you will have to drive

to New Sanderson before dinner. We cannot get the

meat which Mrs. Carroll wishes, and you will have to

drive over there. Go to that large market on Main

Street and tell them that I want the best cut of porter-

house with the tenderloin that he has. Tell him it is

I90








<pb n="191"/>
THE DEBTOR

for Captain Carroll of Banbridge. "And I want you to

get also a roast of lamb for to-morrow."

"Yes, sir," said the coachman. He gathered up the

lines, but sat looking hesitatingly at his employer.

"What are you waiting for?" asked Carroll. "Drive

as fast as you can. We are late as it is."

"Shall I pay, sir?" asked the man, timidly, in a low

voice.

Carroll took out his pocket-book, then replaced it.

"No, not to-night," he said, easily. "Tell him it is

for Captain Carroll of Banbridge."

The man still looked doubtful and a trifle alarmed,

but he touched his hat and drove out of the grounds.

Carroll turned and saw his wife and sister staring at him.

"Oh, Arthur, dear, do you think the butcher will let

him have it?" whispered Mrs. Carroll.

"Yes, honey," said Carroll.

"If he shouldn't-"

"Don't worry; he will."

" It is one of your coups, isn't it, Arthur?" said Anna,

sarcastically, but rather admiringly. She and Mrs. Car-

roll both laughed.

"We have never bought any meat in New Sanderson,

so maybe Martin can get it," Mrs. Carroll said, as she

seated herself in one of the large willow-rockers on the

porch.

Dinner was very late that night at the Carrolls'.

Even with a fast horse, driving to New Sanderson and

back consumed some time, but Martin finally returned

triumphant. When he drove into the yard it was dusk

and the family and the guest were all seated on the

porch. There was a steady babble of talk and laughter

on the part of the ladies, who were nervously intent on

concealing, or at least softening, the fact that dinner

was so late that Major Arms might well be excused for

judging that there was to be no dinner at all.

I91








<pb n="192"/>
THE DEBTOR

Once, Ina had whispered to Charlotte, when the con-

versation among the others swelled high: "What is the

matter? Do you know?"

"Hush! Poor papa had to send to New Sanderson

for meat," whispered Charlotte.

Ina made a face of consternation; Charlotte looked

sadly troubled.

"I'm afraid he is awfully hungry," whispered Ina.

"I pity him."

"I pity papa," whispered Charlotte. She kept

glancing at her father with loving sympathy and under-

standing as the time went on. His face was quite un-

disturbed, but Charlotte saw beneath the calm. When

at last she heard the carriage-wheels her heart leaped

and she turned pale. Then she dared not look at her

father. Suppose Martin should not have been suc-

cessful. The eyes of all the family except Carroll him-

self, who was talking about the tariff and politely sup-

porting the government against a hot-headed rebellion

on the part of the ex-army officer, were on him. Not

an inflection in his voice changed when Martin drove

past the porch, but the others, even Eddy, who was

seated at his sister's feet on the porch-step, eyed the

arrival with undisguised eagerness. A brown-paper

parcel was distinctly visible on the seat beside Martin.

"Thank God!" Mrs. Carroll whispered, under her

breath to her sister. "He's got it."

Eddy gave vent to a small whoop of delight which

he immediately suppressed with a scared glance at his

father. However, he could not refrain from sniffing

audibly with rapture when the first fragrance of the

broiling beefsteak spread through the house to the

porch. Mrs. Carroll giggled, and so did Ina, but Char-

lotte looked severely at her brother.

"After all, though, the excessive tax on articles pur-

chased by travellers abroad and brought to this country

192








<pb n="193"/>
THE DEBTOR

serves as a legitimate balance-wheel," said Carroll, cool-

ly. One would not have thought that he was in the

least conscious of what was going on around him. "It

is mostly the very wealthy who go abroad and purchase

articles of foreign manufacture," he added, gently, " and

it serves to even up things a little for those who can-

not go. It marks a notch higher on the equality of

possessions."

"Equality of fiddlesticks!" said the other man.

"What the devil do the masses of the poor in this coun-

try care about the foreign works of art, anyhow? They

don't want 'em. And what is going to compensate

this country for not possessing works of art which it

will never produce here, and which would tend to the

liberal education of its citizens?"

"Not many of its citizens in the broader sense would

ever see those works of art when they were here and

shrined in the drawing-rooms of the millionaires," said

Carroll, smiling; "and as far as that goes, the million-

aires have them, anyhow. They are not stopped by

the tariff."

"Yes, they are, too, more than you think," declared

the major; " and not the millionaires alone are defrauded.

Suppose I go over now, as I may do"-he cast a glance

at Ina--"as I may do, I say. Now there are things

over there that I want in my home-things that are not

to be had for love nor money in this country. Nothing

of the sort is or ever will be manufactured here. I am

doing nothing whatever to injure home industries if I

bring them over. On the contrary, I am benefiting the

country by bringing to it articles which are, in a way,

an education which may serve as a stimulus to the

growth of art here. I enable those who can never go

abroad, and to whom they will be otherwise forever

unknown, an opportunity to become acquainted with

them. But I have to leave them over there because I

I93








<pb n="194"/>
THE DEBTOR

cannot afford to pay this government for the privilege

of spending my own money and gratifying my own

taste."

Anna Carroll, to cover her absorption in the beef-

steak and the dinner, joined in the conversation with

feminine daring of conclusion. "I suppose," said she,

with a kind of soft sarcasm, "that the government

would not need to charge so much for its citizens' priv-

ilege of buying little foreign vases and mosaics and

breastpins and little Paris frills if it did not conduct so

many humanitarian wars."

"The humanitarian wars are all right, all right," said

the major, hastily; "so far as that goes, all right."

"I suppose," said Mrs. Carroll, "that it would cost so

much to bring home gowns from Paris that no one can

do it unless they have a great deal of money. I under-

stand that it costs more than it did."

"Yes," replied the major, "and this government

can't see or won't see that even in the matter of women's

clothes it would pay in the end to bring over every

frill and tuck free of duty until our dressmakers here

had caught on to their tricks. Then we could pay

them back in their own coin. But, no; and the conse-

quence is that we shall be dependent on France for our

best clothes for generations more."

"It does seem such a pity," said Mrs. Carroll. "It

would be so nice to have Ina's things made in Paris if

it didn't cost anything to get them over here-wouldn't

it?"

"I would just as soon have my dresses made in Ban-

bridge," said Ina. "Madame Griggs is as good as a

French dressmaker."

"She is fine," said Charlotte.

Ina blushed as the major looked at her with a look

that penetrated the dusk. Very soon Marie appeared in

the doorway, and they went in to dinner.

I94








<pb n="195"/>

"How lucky it is that Anderson does not object to

trusting us and we can have canned soup and pease,"

whispered Mrs. Carroll to Anna.

It was a very good dinner at last, and the guest was

evidently hungry, for he did justice to it. There were

no apologies for the delay. Carroll did not believe in

apologies for such things. There was a salad from their

own garden, and a dessert of apple-pudding from an

early apple-tree in the grounds. The coffee was good,

too. There was no lack of anything which could be

purchased at the grocery.

"That grocer must be a very decent sort of man as

grocers go," Mrs. Carroll was fond of remarking in those

days. "I really don't know what we should do if it

were not for him."

After dinner was over it was nearly nine o'clock;

Carroll and Major Arms walked up and down the road

before the house, smoking, leaving the ladies on the

porch. The ex-army officer had something which he

wished to discuss with his prospective father-in-law.

He opened upon the subject when they had gone a piece

down the flagged sidewalk and turned towards the

house.

"What kind of arrangements have the ladies planned

with regard to"-he hesitated and stammered a bit

boyishly, for this was his first matrimonial venture, and

he felt embarrassed, veteran in other respects as he was

-"to the-ceremony?" he finished up. Ceremony did

not have the personal sound that marriage did.

Carroll looked at him, smiling. "It is quite a venture

for you, old fellow, isn't it?" he said, laughingly, and

yet his voice sounded exceedingly kind and touched.

"Not with that child, Arthur," replied the other

man, simply.

"Well, Ina is-a good girl," assented Carroll. "Both

of them are good girls. She will make you a good wife."

T95








<pb n="196"/>

"Nobody knows how sure I am of it, and nobody

knows how I have looked forward to this for years,"

said the other, fervently.

"I could not wish anything better for my girl," said

Carroll, gently and soberly.

"What about the matter of the-ceremony?" asked

Arms, returning to the first subject.

"I think they have decided that they would prefer

the wedding in the church, and a little reception at

the house afterwards. Of course we are comparatively

strangers in Banbridge, but there are people one can

always ask to a function of the sort, and I think Ina-"

"Arthur, there is something I would like to pro-

pose."

"What, old fellow?"

Major Arms hesitated. Carroll waited, smoking as

he sauntered along. The other man held his cigar,

which had gone out, in his mouth; evidently he was

nervous about his proposition. Finally he blurted it

out with the sharpness of a pistol-shot. "Arthur, I

want to defray the expenses of the wedding," he said.

Carroll removed his cigar. "See you damned first,"

said he, coolly, but with emphasis, and then replaced it.

Major Arms turned furiously towards him, but he re-

strained himself. "Why?" he said, with forced calm.

"Because if I cannot pay my daughter's bridal ex-

penses she never marries you nor any other man," said

Carroll.

Then the Major blazed out. He stopped short and

moved before Carroll on the sidewalk. "If," said he-

"if-you think I marry your daughter if her father goes

in debt for the wedding expenses, you are mistaken."

Carroll said nothing. He stood as if stunned. The

other went on with a burst of furious truth: "See here,

Arthur Carroll," said he, "I like you, and you know

how I feel about your girl. She is the one thing I have

I96

wanted for my happiness all my life, and I know I can

take care of her and make her happy; and I like you

in spite of - in spite of your outs. I'm ashamed of

myself for liking you, but I do; but you needn't think

I don't see you, that I don't know you, because I do.

I knew when you went to the dogs after you failed in

your mine, just as well as you did yourself. You went

to the dogs, and you've been at the dogs' ever since;

you're there now, and you've dragged your family with

you so far as they're the sort to be dragged. They

aren't, altogether, lucky for them; the girls especially

aren't, at least not so far. Lord knows when it would.

come to them. But I'm going to take Ina away from

the dogs, out of sound of a yelp even of 'em; and, as for

me, I'll be hanged if you get me there! I know you for

just what you are. I know you've prowled and preyed

like a coyote ever since you were preyed on yourself.

I know you, but I love Ina. But I tell you one thing,

Arthur Carroll, now you can take your choice. Either

you let me pay the wedding expenses or you give up the

wedding."

"Ina," began Carroll, in a curious, helpless fashion,

"she has set her heart on the wedding-her-dress and

everything."

"I can't help that," said Arms, sternly. "This is of

more importance even than her pleasure. Take your

choice. Let me pay or let us be married in the quietest

manner possible."

"I consent to the latter," Carroll said, still in that

beaten tone.

He seemed to shrink in stature, standing before the

other man's uprear of imperious will.

"All right," said Major Arms.

The two walked on in silence for a moment. Arms

relit his cigar. Suddenly Carroll spoke.

"No, I will not, either," he said, abruptly.

197








<pb n="198"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Will not what?"

"I will not consent to the quiet wedding. Ina shall

not be disappointed. This means too much to a girl.

Good God! it is the one occasion of a woman's life, and

women are children always. It is cruelty to children."

"Then I pay," Arms said.

"No, I pay," said Carroll.

"You pay?"

"I pay," Carroll repeated, doggedly.

"How?"

"Never mind how. I tell you I give you my word of

honor I pay every dollar of those expenses the day after

the wedding."

"You will rob Peter to pay Paul, then," declared

Major Arms, incredulously and wrathfully.

Carroll laughed in a hard fashion. "I would kill

Peter, besides robbing him, if it was necessary," he

said.

" If you think I'll have that way out of it-"

"I tell you I will pay those expenses, every dollar, the

next day, and Ina shall have her little festival. What

more do you want?" demanded Carroll. "See here,

Arms, you will take care of the girl better than I can. I

am at the dogs fast enough, and the dogs' is not a de-

sirable locality in which to see one's family. You can

take care of Ina, and God knows I want you to have her,

but have her you shall not unless you can show some

lingering confidence in her father. Even at the dogs' a

man may have a little pride left. Either we have the

wedding as it is planned, and you trust me to settle the

bills for it, or you can give up my daughter."

Arms stood silent, looking at Carroll. "Very well,"

he said, finally.

"All right, then," said Carroll.

Arms remained staring at Carroll with a curious,

"Good God! Arthur, how do you ever stand it living

this sort of life?" he cried, suddenly.

"I have to stand it," replied Carroll. "As well ask a

shot fired from a cannon how it likes being hurled

through the air. I was fired into this."

"You ought to have had some power of resistance,

some will of your own."

" There are forces for every living man for which he

has no power of resistance. Mine hit me."

"If ever there was a damned, smooth-tongued scoun-

drel-" said Arms, retrospectively.

"Where is he?" Carroll asked, and his voice sounded

strange.

"There."

"How is he?"

"Prospering like the wicked in the psalms. There

was one respect in which you showed will and self-

control, Arthur-that you didn't shoot him!"

"I was a fool," said Carroll.

"He wasn't worth hanging for," said the major,

shortly.

"I'd hang five times over if I could get even with

him," said Carroll.

"I don't wonder you feel so."

"Feel so! You asked me just now how I stood this

sort of life. I believe my hate for that man keeps me up

like a stimulant. I believe it keeps me up when I see

other poor devils that I-"

Suddenly Arms reached out his hand and grasped

Carroll's. "Good God! old fellow, I'm sorry for you!"

he said. "You are too good for the dogs."

"Yes, I know I am," said Carroll, calmly.

The two men returned to the house and sat on the

porch with the ladies. About half-past ten Anna Carroll

said good-night, then Mrs. Carroll. Then Charlotte rose,

and Ina also followed her up-stairs.

"Ina," cried Charlotte, in a sort of angry embarrass-

ment, when they had reached her chamber, "you've

got to go back; indeed you have."

"I suppose I ought." Ina was blushing furiously,

her lip quivered. She was twisting a ring on her en-

gagement-finger.

"You have even kept the stone side in, so nobody

could see that beautiful ring he brought you. You are

mean-mean!" said Charlotte.

"You just imagine that," said Ina, feebly. As she

spoke she held up her hand, and a great diamond flashed

rose and green and white.

"No, I don't imagine it. I have not seen it once like

that. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You

must go straight back down-stairs. People when they

are engaged always sit up alone together. You are not

doing right coming up here with me."

"What are you scolding me for? Who said I was not

going back?" returned Ina, with resentful shame.

"You know you were not."

"I was."

"Well, good-night, honey," said Charlotte, in a softer

tone.

"Good-night."

Charlotte kissed her sister, and saw her leave the room

and go down to her lover with a curious mixture of pity

and awe and wrath and wistful affection. It almost

seemed to her that Ina was happy, although afraid and

ashamed to be, and it made her seem like a stranger

to the maiden ignorance of her own heart.

CHAPTER XVII

THERE was a good deal of talk in Banbridge when

Ina Carroll's wedding-invitations were out. There were

not many issued. When it came to making out the list,

the number of persons who, from what the family con-

sidered as a reasonable point of view, were possible, was

exceedingly small.

"Of course we cannot ask such and such a one,"

Mrs. Carroll would say, and the others would acquiesce

simply, with no thought of the possibility of anything

else.

"There's that young man who goes on the train every

morning with papa," said Charlotte. "His name is

Veazie-Francis Veazie. He has called here. They live

on Elm Street. His father is that nice-looking old gen-

tleman who walks past here every day, on his way to

the mail, a little lame."

"Charlotte, dear," said Ina, "don't you remember

that somebody told us that that young man was a floor-

walker in one of the department stores?"

"Oh, sure enough," said Charlotte, "I do remember,

dear."

"There are really very few indeed in a place like

Banbridge whom it is possible to invite to a wedding,"

said Mrs. Carroll.

Banbridge itself shared her opinion. Those who

were bidden to the wedding acquiesced in their selected-

ness and worthiness; those who were not bidden, with a

very few exceptions of unduly aspiring souls, acquiesced

20I

THE DEBTOR

calmly in their own ineligibility. Banbridge, for a vil-

lage in the heart of a republic, had a curious rigidity of

establishment and content as to its social conditions.

For the most part those who were not invited would

have been embarrassed and even suspicious at receiving

invitations. But they talked. In that they showed

their inalienable republican freedom. They moved

along as unquestioningly as European peasants, in

their grooves, but their tongues soared. In speech,

as is the way with an American, they held nothing

sacred, not even the institutions which they propped,

not even themselves. They might remain unquestion-

ingly, even preferredly, outside the doors of superiority,

but out there they raised a clamor of self-assertion.

Their tongues wagged with prodigious activity utterly

unleashed. In the days before Ina Carroll's wedding all

Banbridge seethed and boiled like a pot with gossip,

and gossip full of malice and sneer, and a good deal of

righteous indignation. Anderson heard much of it.

Neither he nor his mother was asked to the wedding.

The Carrolls had not even considered the possibility of

such a thing. Mrs. Anderson spoke of it one evening at

tea.

"I hear they are going to have quite a wedding at

those new people's," said she; "a wedding in the church,

and reception afterwards at the house. Miss Josie

Eggleston and Agnes and Mrs. Monroe were in here this

afternoon, and they were speaking about it. They said

the young lady was having her trousseau made at Mrs.

Griggs's, and everybody thought it rather singular.

They are going to the wedding and reception. They

inquired if we were going, and I said that we had not

been invited, that we had not called. I have been in-

tending to call ever since they came, but now, of course,

it is out of the question until after the wedding." Mrs.

Anderson spoke with a slight regret. A mild curiosity

202








<pb n="203"/>
THE DEBTOR

was a marked trait of hers. "I suppose we could go to

the church even if we had no invitation; I suppose many

will do that," she said, a little wistfully, after a pause.

"Do you think it wise, without an invitation?" asked

Anderson, rather amusedly.

"Why, I don't know, really, dear, that it could do any

harm-that is, lower one's dignity at all. Of course it

is not as if we had called. If we had called and then

received no invitation, the slight would have been

marked. But of course we were not invited simply be-

cause we had not called-"

"Still, I think I should rather not go, under the cir-

cumstances, mother," Anderson said, quietly.

"Well, perhaps you are right, dear," said his mother.

"It seems to me that you may be a trifle too punctilious;

still, it is best to err on the safe side, and, after all, these

are new people; we know very little about them, after

all." Nothing was further from Mrs. Anderson than

the surmise that, even had she called, no invitation

would have come from these unknown new people to

the village grocer and his mother. Mrs. Anderson, even

with her secret and persistent dissent to her son's giving

up his profession and adopting trade, never dreamed

of any possible loss of social prestige. She considered

herself and her son established in their family traditions

beyond possibility of shaking by such minor matters.

Anderson did not enlighten her.

"Mrs. Monroe said that she had heard that the Car-

rolls were owing a good deal," said she, presently.

" She said she heard that Blumenfeldt said he must have

cash for the flowers for the decorations. They have

ordered a great many palms and things. She said she

heard that Captain Carroll told him that the money

would be forthcoming, and scared him out of his wits,

he was so high and mighty, and the florist just gave

right in and said he should have all he wanted. She

203








<pb n="204"/>
THE DEBTOR

said Mr. Monroe was in there and heard it. I hope

Mrs. Griggs will get her pay. They don't owe you, I

hope, dear?"

"Don't worry about me, mother?" Randolph replied,

smiling. However, she had placed a finger upon a

daily perplexity of his. The Carrolls indeed owed him,

and every day the debt was increasing. He felt that his

old clerk regarded him with wonder at every fresh

entry on the books. That very day he had come into

the office to inform him, in a hushed voice, that the

Carrolls had sent for a pail of lard and a box of butter,

besides a bag of flour, and to inquire what he should

do about supplying them.

" The girl hasn't brought any money," said he, further,

in an ominous whisper.

Anderson, glancing out, saw the small, sturdy, and

smiling face of the Hungarian girl employed by the

Carrolls. She was gazing straight through at him in

the office with a shrewd expression in her untutored

black eyes. "Send the order," Anderson replied, in a

low voice.

"But," began the clerk.

"It's all right," said Anderson. He dipped his pen

in the ink and went on with the letter he was writing.

The clerk retreated with a long, anxious, wondering look,

which the other man felt.

The Hungarian girl plodded smiling forth with the

promise to have the groceries sent at once. Stepping

flat-footedly and heavily through the door, she caught

her cotton skirt on a nail, and, lo! a rent. The boy, who

was a gallant soul for all femininity in need, hurried

to her aid with some pins gathered from the lapel of his

gingham coat. Little Marie, with a coquettish shake of

her head and a blush and smile began repairing the

damage.

"It is the cloth that is easy broke," explained she,

204








<pb n="205"/>
THE DEBTOR

when she lifted her suffused but still smiling face, "and

I a new one will have when I haf my money, my vage."

With that Marie was gone, her poor gown scalloping

around her heavy, backward heels, her smiling glance of

artless coquetry over her shoulder to the last, and the boy

and the old clerk looked at each other. The boy whistled.

Just then the delivery-wagon drove up in front of the

store. The driver, who was a young fellow in the first

stages of pulmonary consumption, got down with weakly

alacrity from the seat and came in to get the new orders.

He coughed as he entered, but he looked radiant. He

was driving the delivery-wagon in the hope of recovering

his health by out-of-door life, and he was, or flattered

himself that he was, perceptibly gaining.

"Where's the next delivery?" he inquired, hoarsely.

"Wait a minute," said the old clerk, and again in-

vaded the office.

"They 'ain't paid their hired girl," he said, in a whis-

per. "Had we better-"

"Better what?" said Anderson, impatiently, though

he looked confused.

"Better send them things to the Carrolls' ?"

"Didn't I tell you? What-"

"Oh, all right, sir," said the clerk, and retreated

hastily. At times he had an awe of his employer.

"Goin' to take all that truck to the Carrolls'?" in-

quired the consumptive deliverer.

"Yep," replied the boy, lugging out the flour-bag.

"Credit," whispered the man.

The boy nodded.

The man essayed a whistle, but he coughed. "Well,

it's none of my funeral," he declared, when he got his

breath, "but I hear he's a dead - beat. I s'pose he

knows what he is about."

"If he don't, nobody is goin' to tell him, you bet,"

said the boy, succinctly.

205








<pb n="206"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Well, it's none of my funeral," said the man, and he

coughed again, and gathered up the reins, and drove

away in a cloud of dust down the street. It had not

rained for two weeks and the roads gave evidence of it.

Anderson, back in his office, heard the sound of the

retreating wheels with a feeling of annoyance, even

scorn of himself for his gullibility, and his stress upon

the financial part of the affair.

He was losing a good deal of money, and he did not

wish to do so. "I am a fool," he told himself, with

that voice of mentality which sounds the loudest, to

the consciousness, of any voice on earth. He frowned,

then he laughed a little, and began mounting a fine

new butterfly specimen. "Other men marry and spend

their hard earnings in that way, on love," said he.

"Why should I not spend mine after this fashion if I

choose ?"

That noon, as he passed out of the store on his way

home to dinner, Ina and Charlotte came out of the

dressmaker's opposite. They looked flushed and hap-

pily excited. Charlotte carried a large parcel. They

rushed past without seeing him at all, as he gained the

opposite sidewalk. He walked along, grave and self-

possessed. Nobody seeing him would have dreamed

of his inward perturbation, that spiritual alienation as

secret as the processes of the body.

Nobody could have suspected how his fond thought

and yearning followed one of those small, hurrying,

girlish figures. In a way the man, even with his frus-

trated aims in the progress of life, was so superior to

the little, unconscious feminine thing whose chief assets

of life were her youth and innocence, and even those

of slight weight against the man's age and innocence,

that it seemed a pity.

It was not a case of pearls before swine, but seemingly

rather of pearls before canary-birds or butterflies, which

206








<pb n="207"/>
THE DEBTOR

would not defile them, but flutter over them unheed-

ingly.

However, it may be better to cast away one's pearls

of love before anything, rather than keep them. An-

derson, walking along home to his dinner in the summer

noon, loving foolishly and unreasonably this young girl

who would never, probably, place the slightest value on

his love, was not actively unhappy. After he had turned

the corner of the street on which his house stood he heard

the whistle of the noon-train, and soon the carriages from

the station came whirling in sight.

Samson Rawdy came first, driving a victoria in which

sat the gentleman who had been pointed out to him as

Ina Carroll's fiance. He glanced at him approvingly,

and the thought even was in his mind that had this

stranger been going to marry Charlotte, instead of her

sister, he could have had nothing to say against his

appearance. Suddenly, Major Arms in the victoria

looked full at him and bowed, raising his hat in his

soldierly fashion. Anderson was surprised, but returned

the salutation promptly.

"Who was that gentleman bowing to you?" his

mother asked, as he went up the front steps. She was

standing on the porch in her muslin morning panoply.

"He is the gentleman who is to marry the eldest

daughter of Captain Carroll," replied Anderson.

"Do you know him?"

"No."

"He bowed."

"I suppose he thought he recognized me."

"He looks old enough to be her grandfather, but he

looks like a fine man. I hope she will make him a good

wife. It is a risk for a man of his age, marrying a little

young thing. I wonder why Samson Rawdy was bring-

ing him from the station. Strange the Carroll carriage

didn't meet him, wasn't it?"

207








<pb n="208"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Perhaps they were not expecting him," replied

Randolph, which was true.

The carriage occupied by Major Arms and Samson

Rawdy overtook Ina and Charlotte before they had walked

far, in front of Drake's drug-store. They had stopped in

there for soda, in fact, and were just coming out.

"Why, there's Major Arms!" cried Charlotte, so loud-

ly that some lounging men in the drug- store heard

her. Drake, Amidon, and the postmaster, who had

just stopped, stood in the doorway, with no attempt to

disguise their interest, and watched Major Arms spring

out of the carriage like a boy, kiss his sweetheart, utterly

unmindful of their observance, then assist the sisters to

the back seat, and spring to the front himself.

"Pretty spry for an old boy," remarked the post-

master as the carriage rolled away.

"Oh, he's Southern," returned Amidon, easily.

"That is why. Catch a Yankee his age with joints as

limber. The cold winters here stiffen folk up quick

after they get middle-aged."

"You don't seem very stiff in the joints," said Drake,

jocularly. "Guess you are near as old as that man."

"I'm a right smart stiffer than I'd been ef I'd stayed

South," replied Amidon.

Then the postmaster wondered, as Mrs. Anderson had

done, why Major Arms was driving up with Samson

Rawdy rather than in the Carroll carriage, and the

others opined, as Randolph had done, that they had not

expected him.

"I don't see, for my part, what they get to feed him

on when he comes," said Amidon, wisely.

The postmaster and Drake looked at him with ex-

pressions like hunting-dogs, although a certain wisdom

as to his meaning was evident in both faces.

"I suppose it's getting harder and harder for them to

get credit," said Drake.

208








<pb n="209"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Harder," returned Amidon. "I guess it is. I had

it from Strauss this morning, that he wouldn't let them

have a pound of beef without cash, and I know that

Abbot stopped giving them anything some time ago."

"How do they manage, then?" asked the postmaster.

"Strauss says sometimes they send a little money and

get a little, the rest of the time he guesses they go with-

out; live on garden-sauce-they've got a little garden,

you know, or grocery stuff."

"Can they get trusted at the grocer's?"

"Ingram won't trust 'em, but Anderson lets 'em have

all they want, they say."

"S'pose he knows what he's about."

"Lawyers generally do," said Drake.

"He wasn't much of a lawyer, anyhow," said Amidon.

"That's so. He didn't set the river afire," remarked

the postmaster.

"I don't believe, if Anderson trusts him, but he

knows what he is about," said the druggist. "I guess

he knows he's goin' to get his pay."

"Mebbe some of those fine securities of his will come

up sometime," Amidon said. "I heard they'd been

slumpin' lately. Guess there's some Banbridge folks

got hit pretty bad, too."

"Who?" asked Drake, eagerly.

"I heard Lee was in it, for one, and I guess there's

others. I must light out of this. It's dinner-time.

Where's that arrow-root ? My wife's got to make arrow-

root gruel for old Mrs. Joy. She's dreadful poorly. Oh,

there it is!"

Amidon started, and the postmaster also. In the

doorway Amidon paused. "Suppose you knew Carroll

was away?" he said.

"No," said Drake.

"Yes, he's been gone a week; ain't coming home till

the day before the wedding. Their girl told ours.

209








<pb n="210"/>
THE DEBTOR

We've got a Hungarian, too, you know. Carroll's girl

can't get any pay. It's a dam'ed shame."

"Why don't she leave?"

"Afraid she'll lose it all, if she does. Same way with

the coachman."

"Where's Carroll gone?" asked the postmaster.

"Don't know. The girl said he'd gone to Chicago on

business."

"Guess he'll want to go farther than Chicago on busi-

ness if he don't look out, before long. I don't see how

he's goin' to have the weddin', anyway. I don't be-

lieve anybody '11 trust him here, and, unless I miss my

guess, he won't find it very easy anywhere else."

"They say the man the girl's goin' to marry is rich.

Maybe he'll foot the bills," said Drake.

"Mebbe he is," assented Amidon. Then he went out

in earnest, and the postmaster with him.

"Look at here," said Amidon, mysteriously, as the

two men separated on the next corer. "I'll tell you

something, if you want to know."

"What?"

"I believe Drake trusts those Carrolls a little."








<pb n="211"/>
CHAPTER XVIII

THERE was in Banbridge, at this date, almost univer-

sal distrust of Carroll, but very little of it was expressed,

for the reason, common to the greater proportion of

humanity: the victims in proclaiming their distrust

would have proclaimed at the same time their victimiza-

tion. It was quite safe to assume that the open de-

tractors of Carroll had not been duped by him; it was

also quite safe to assume that many of those who either

remained silent or declared their belief in him had suf-

fered more or less. The latter were those who made it

possible for the Carrolls to remain in Banbridge at all.

There were many who had a lingering hope of securing

something in the end, who did not wish Carroll to depart,

and who were even uneasy at his absence, although the

fact of his family remaining and of the wedding prepara-

tions for' his daughter going on seemed sufficient to allay

suspicions. It is generally true that partisanship, even of

the few, counts for more than disparagement of the many,

with all right-intentioned people who have a reasonable

amount of love for their fellow-men. Somehow partisan-

ship, up to a certain limit, beyond which the partisan

appears a fool to all who listen to him, seems to give

credit to the believer in it. At all events, while the

number of Arthur Carroll's detractors was greatly in

advance of his adherents, the moral atmosphere of

Banbridge, while lowering, was still very far from cy-

clonic for him. He got little credit, yet still friendly,

admiring, and even obsequious recognition.

211








<pb n="212"/>
THE DEBTOR

The invitations to his daughter's wedding had bee

eagerly accepted. The speculations as to whether ti

bills would be paid or not added to the interest. I

those days the florist and the dressmaker were quil

local celebrities. They looked anxious, yet rather plea

antly self-conscious. The dressmaker bragged by da

and lay awake by night.  Every time the florist fe

uneasy, he slipped across to the nearest saloon and g

a drink of beer. After that, when asked if he did nc

feel afraid he would lose money through the Carrc

wedding, he said something about the general estee

in which people should be held who patronized loc

industries, in his thick German-English, grinned, an

shambled back, his fat hips shaking like a woman's, I

his hot-houses, and pottered around his geraniums an

decorative palms.

On the Sunday morning before the wedding thei

were an unusual number of men in the barber-shop-

old Eastman, Frank's father, who generally shaved hin

self, besides Amidon, Drake, the postmaster, Tappan tI

milkman, and a number of others. Amidon was in tl

chair, and spoke whenever it did not seem too hazardou

He had just had his hair cut also, as a delicate conce

sion to the barber on the part of a free customer on

busy morning, and his rather large head glistened like

silver ball.

" Reckon Carroll must have gone out West promoti

to raise a little wind for the weddin'," he said.

"I haven't seed him, and I atropined he had not con

back yet," remarked the barber.

Lee looked up from his Sunday paper-all the me

except young Willy Eddy were provided with Sunda

papers; he waited patiently for a spare page finishe

and thrown aside by another. Besides the odors (

soap and perfumed oils and bay-rum and tobacco

smoke, that filled the little place, was the redolence 

212








<pb n="213"/>
THE DEBTOR

fresh newspapers, staring with violent head-lines, and

as full of rustle as a forest.

Lee looked up from his paper, and gave his head a

curious, consequential toss. He had been shaved him-

self, and his little tuft of yellow beard was trimmed to

a nicety. He looked sleek and well- dressed, and he

had always his indefinable air of straining himself fur-

tively upon tiptoe to reach some unattainable height.

Lee's consequentiality had something painful about it

at times.

"I guess Captain Carroll hadn't any need to go out

West promoting. I rather think he can find all the

business he wants right here," he said.

Tappan the milkman, bearded and grim, looked up

from an article on the coal strike. "Guess he can find

about fools enough right here to work on, that's right,"

said he, and there was a laugh.

Lee's small blond face colored furiously; his voice was

shrill in response. "Perhaps those he doesn't work, as

you call it, are bigger fools than those he does," said he.

"Say," said the milkman, with a snarling sort of

humor. He fastened brutally twinkling eyes on Lee.

Everybody waited; the little barber held the razor

poised over Amidon's chin. "When do your next divi-

dends come in?" he inquired.

Lee gave an angry sniff, and flirted up his paper before

his face.

"Why don't ye say?" pressed Tappan, with a hard

wink at the others.

" I don't know that it is any of your business," replied

Lee.

"Ask when the millennium's comin'," said Amidon,

in the chair.

"I wish I was as sure of the millennium as I am of

those dividends," declared Lee, brought to bay.

"Glad you've got faith in that dead - beat. He's

213

THE DEBTOR

owin' me for fifteen dollars' worth of milk-tickets, and I

can't get a dam'ed penny of it," said Tappan. He gave

the sheet of paper he held a vicious crumple and flung

it to the floor, whence little Willy Eddy timidly and soft-

ly gathered it up. "Gittin' up at four o'clock in the

mornin'," continued the milkman, in a cursing voice,

"an' milkin' a lot of dam'ed old kickin' cows, and gittin'

on the road half-dead with sleep, to make a present to

whelps like him, goin' to the City dressed up like Mor-

gan hisself, ridin' to the station in a carriage he 'ain't

paid for, with a man drivin' that can't git a cent out

of him. Talk about coal strikes! Lord! I could give

them miners points. Strikin' for eight hours a day!

Lord! what's that? Here I've got to go home an' hay,

if it is Sunday. to git enough for them dam'ed cows to

eat in the winter! Eight hours! Hm! I work eighteen

an' I 'ain't got anybody over me to strike again', 'cept

the Almighty, an' I ruther guess He wouldn't make

much account of it. Guess he'd starve me out ef I

quit work, and not make much bones of it. I can stop

peddlin' milk to sech as Carroll, but the milk sours, an'

hanged if I know who suffers most. Here's my wife

been makin' dam'ed little pot-cheeses out of the sour

milk as 'tis, and sellin' 'em for two cents apiece. They're

hangin' all over the bushes tied up in little rags. She's

got to work all day to-day makin' butter to save the

cream, and then I s'pose I've got to hustle round and

find somebody to give the butter to. Carroll ain't the

only one. I wish they all had to work as hard as I do

one day for the things they git for nothin', the whole

bilin' lot of 'em. He's the worst, though. What business

did he have settlin' down on us here in Banbridge, I'd

like to know? If he'd got to steal to feather his nest,

why didn't he go to some other place, confound him ?"

The milkman's voice and manner were malignant.

The barber looked at him with some apprehension,

214








<pb n="215"/>
THE DEBTOR

but he spoke, still holding his razor aloft. "Now I

rather guess you are jumpin' at exclusions too hasty,

Mr. Tappan," said he, in an anxiously pacific voice. "I

don't know about them dividends Mr. Lee's talkin'

about. Captain Carroll, he gave me a little dip." The

barber winked about mysteriously. "He told me he'd

tell me when to come in, and he ain't told me yet, but

I ain't no disprehension, but he's all right. Captain

Carroll is a gentleman, he is." Flynn's voice fairly

quivered with affectionate championship. There were

tears in his foolish eyes. He bent over Amidon's face,

which grinned up at him cautiously through the lather.

"Let him pay me them milk-tickets, then, if he's all

right," Tappan said, viciously.

"He will when he's disembarrassed and his advent-

ures are on a dividend-paying adipoise," said the barber,

in a tearful voice.

"I think he is all right," said the druggist.

Then little Willy Eddy added his pipe. He had been

covertly smoothing out Tappan's crumpled newspaper.

" He's real nice-spoken," said he. " I guess he will come

right in time."

Tappan turned on him and snatched back his news-

paper. "Here, I ain't done with that," he said; "I've

got to take it home to my wife." Then he added,

"For God's sake, you little fool, he ain't been swipin'

anything from you, has he?"

Then the barber arose to the situation. He advanced,

razor in hand. He strode up to the milkman and stood

dramatically before him, arm raised and head thrown

back. "Now, look at here," he proclaimed, in a high

falsetto, "I ain't agoin' to hear no asparagusment of

my friends, not here in this tonsorial parlor. No, sir!"

There was something at once touching, noble, and ab-

surd about the demonstration. The others chuckled,

then sobered, and watched.

Tappan stared at him a second incredulously. Then

he grinned, showing his teeth like a dog.

"Lord! then that jailbird is one of your friends, is

he ?" he said. He had just lit his pipe. He puffed at it,

and deliberately blew the smoke into the little barber's

face.

Flynn bent over towards him with a sudden motion,

and his mild, consequential face in the cloud of smoke

changed into something terrible, from its very absurdity.

His blue eyes glittered greenly; he lifted the razor and cut

the air with it close to the other man's face. Tappan

heard the hiss of it, and drew back involuntarily, his

expression changing.

"What the devil are you up to?" he growled, with

wary eyes on the other's face.

The barber continued to hold the razor like a bayonet

in rest, fixed within an inch of the other's ncje. "I'm up

to kickin' you out of my parlor if you don't stop speak-

in' individuously disregardin' my friends," said he, with

an emphasis which was ridiculous and yet impressive.

The other men chuckled again, then grew grave.

"Come back here and finish up my job, John," Amidon

called out; yet he watched him warily.

"Here, put up that razor!" the postmaster called out.

"I'll put it up when you stop speakin' mellifluously of

my friends," declared the barber. "There ain't nobody

in this parlor goin' to speak a word against Captain Car-

roll if I'm in hearin'; there ain't an honester man in this

town."

The barber's back was towards the door. Suddenly

Tappan's eyes stared past him, his grin widened inex-

plicably. Flynn became aware of a pregnant silence

thoughout the shop. He turned, following Tappan's gaze,

and Arthur Carroll stood there. He had entered silently

and had heard all the last of the discussion. Every face

in the shop was turned towards him; he stood looking at

them with the curious expression of a man taken complete-

ly off guard. All the serene force and courtesy which

usually masked his innermost emotions had, as it were,

slipped off; for a flash he stood revealed, soul-naked, for

any one who could see. None there could fully see, al-

though every man looked, sharpened with curiosity and

suspicion. Carroll was white and haggard, unsmiling, de-

spairing, even pathetic; his eyes actually looked suffused.

Then in a flash it was over, and Arthur Carroll in his

usual guise stood before them-it was like one of those

metamorphoses of which one reads in fairy tales. Car-

roll stood there smiling, stately, gracefully, even con-

fidentially condescending. It was as if he appealed

to their sense of humor, that he, Carroll, stood among

them addressing them as their equals.

"Good-day, gentleman," he said, and came forward.

Little Willy Eddy sprang up with a frightened look

and gave him his chair, murmuring in response to Car-

roll's deprecating thanks that he was just going; but

he did not go. He remained in the doorway staring.

He had a vague idea of some judgment descending upon

them all from this great man whom they had been

slandering.

"Well, how are you, captain?" said Lee, speaking

with an air of defiant importance. It became evident

that what had gone before was to be ignored by every-

body except Tappan, who suddenly rose and went out,

muttering something which nobody heard. Then the

lash of a whip was heard outside, a "g'lang," with the

impetus of an oath, and a milk wagon clattered down

the street.

Carroll replied to Lee, urbanely: "Fine," he said,

"fine. How are you, Mr. Lee?"

"Seems to me you are not looking quite up to the

mark," Lee remarked, surveying him with friendly so-

licitude.

The little barber had returned to Amidon in the chair,

and was carefully scraping his cheek with the razor.

"Then my looks belie me," Carroll replied, smiling.

He offered a cigar to Lee and to the druggist, who sat

next on the other side.

"Been out of town?" asked the druggist.

"Yes," replied Carroll.

Drake looked at him hesitatingly, but Amidon, speak-

ing stiffly and cautiously, put the question directly:

"Where you been, cap'n?"

"A little journey on business," Carroll answered,

easily, lighting his cigar.

"When did you get home?" asked Amidon.

"This morning."

"You certainly look as if you had lost flesh," said Lee,

with obsequious solicitude.

"Well, it is a hard journey to Chicago-quite a hard

journey," remarked the druggist, with cunning.

"Not on the fast train," said Carroll.

"So you went on the flyer?" said the postmaster.

Carroll was having some difficulty in lighting his cigar,

and did not reply.

"Did you go on the flyer?" persisted the postmaster.

"No, I did not," replied Carroll, with unmistakable

curtness.

The postmaster hemmed to conceal embarrassment.

He had been shaved and had only lingered for a bit of

gossip, and now the church-bells began to ring, and he

was going to church, as were also Lee, the druggist, and

most of the others. They rose and lounged out, one

after another; little Willy Eddy followed them. Flynn

finished shaving Amidon, who also left, and finally he

was left alone in the shop with Carroll, who arose and

approached the chair.

"Sorry to keep you waitin', Captain Carroll," said

Flynn, preparing a lather with enthusiasm.

"The day is before me," said Carroll, as he seated

himself.

"I hope," said Flynn, beating away his hand in a

bowl of mounting rainbow bubbles-" I hope that-that

-your feelings were not hurt at-at-our eavesdrop-

ping."

"At what?" asked Carroll, kindly and soberly.

"At our eavesdropping," reported the barber, with a

worshipful and agitated glance at him.

"Oh!" answered Carroll, but he did not smile. "No,"

he said, "my feelings were not hurt." He looked at the

small man who was the butt of the town, and his ex-

pression was almost caressing.

Flynn continued to beat away at the lather, and the

rainbow bubbles curled over the edge of the bowl.

"You said that you would devise me when the time had

come for me to invest that money," he said, diffidently,

and yet with a noble air of confidence and loyalty.

"It hasn't come yet," Carroll replied.

CHAPTER XIX

As Ina Carroll's wedding- day drew nearer, the ex-

citement in Banbridge increased. It was known that

the services of a New York caterer had been engaged.

Blumenfeldt was decorating the church, Samson Rawdy

was furbishing up all his vehicles and had hired supple-

mentary ones from New Sanderson.

"No girl has ever went from this town as that Carroll

girl will," he told his wife, who assisted him to clean the

carriage cushions.

"I s'pose the folks will dress a good deal," said she,

brushing assiduously.

"You bet," said her husband.

"Well, they won't get no dirt on their fine duds off

your carriage-seats," said she. She was large and per-

spiring, but full of the content of righteous zeal. She

and Samson Rawdy thoroughly enjoyed the occasion,

and he was, moreover, quite free from any money anx-

iety regarding it. At first he had been considerably

exercised. He had come home and conferred with his

wife, who was the business balance-wheel of the

family.

"Carroll has been speakin' to me about providin'

carriages for his daughter's weddin', an' I dunno about

it," said he.

"How many does he want?" inquired his wife. He

had sunk on his doorstep on coming home at dusk, and

sat with speculative eyes on the pale western sky, while

his wife sat judicially, quite filling with her heated bulk

220

a large rocking-chair, placed for greater coolness in front

of the step, in the middle of the slate walk.

"He wants all mine and all I can hire in New Sander-

son," replied Rawdy.

"Lord!" ejaculated his wife. "All them?"

"All them," replied Rawdy, moodily triumphant.

"Well," said his wife, "that ain't the point."

"No, it ain't," agreed Rawdy.

"The point is," said she, "is he agoin' to or ain't he

agoin' to pay."

"That's so," said Rawdy.

"He's a-owin' everybody, ain't he?" said the wife.

"Pooty near, I guess."

"Well, you ain't goin' to let one of your cerridges go,

let alone hirin', unless he pays ahead."

"Lord! Dilly, how'm I goin' to ask him?" protested

Rawdy.

"How? Why, the way anybody would ask him.

'Ain't you got a tongue in your head?" demanded

she.

"You dunno what a man he is. I asked him the

other night when I drove him up, and it wa'n't a job I

liked, I can tell you."

"Did he pay you?"

"Paid me some of it."

"He's owin' you now, ain't he?"

"Well, he ain't owin' much, only the few times their

cerridge 'ain't been down. It ain't much, Dilly."

"But it's something."

"Yes; everythin' that ain't nothin' is somethin', I

s'pose."

"And now you're goin' right on an' lettin' him have

all your cerridges, and you'll be wantin' me to help clean

the seats, too, I'll warrant, and you're agoin' to hire

into the bargain, with him owin' you and owin' every-

body else in town."

22I








<pb n="222"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Now, Dilly, I didn't say I was agoin' to." protested

Rawdv.

"An' me needin' a new dress, and 'ain't had one to

my back for two years, and them Carroll women in a

different one every time they appear out, and the girl

having enough clothes for a Vanderbilt. I guess Stella

Griggs will rue the day. She's a fool, and always was.

If you can afford to give that man money you can

afford to get me a new dress. I'd go to the weddin'-

it's free, in the church-if I had anything decent to

wear."

"Now, Dilly, what can I do? I leave it to you,"

asked Samson Rawdy, with confessed helplessness.

"Do?" said she. "Why, tell him he's got to pay

ahead or he can't have the cerridges. If you're afraid

to, I'll ask him. I ain't afraid."

"Lord! I ain't afraid, Dilly," said Rawdy.

"You'd better clean up, after supper, an' go up there

and tell him," said Dilly Rawdy, mercilessly.

In the end Rawdy obeyed, having shaved and washed,

and set forth. When he returned he was jubilant.

"He's a gentleman, I don't care what they say," said

he, "and he treated me like a gentleman. Gave me a

cigar, and asked me to sit down. He was smokin',

himself, out on the porch. The women folks were in

the house.

"Did he pay you?" asked Mrs. Rawdy.

Then Rawdy shook a fat roll of bills in her face.

"Look at here," said he.

"The whole of it?"

"Every darned mill; my cerridges and the New

Sanderson ones, too."

"Well, now, ain't you glad you did the way I told you

to?"

"Lord! he'd paid me, anyway," declared Rawdy.

He's a gentleman. Women are always dreadful scart."

222








<pb n="223"/>
THE DEBTOR

"It's a pity men wasn't a little scarter sometimes,"

said his wife.

Rawdy, grinning, tossed a bill to her. "Wa'n't you

sayin' you wanted a dress?" said he.

"I ruther guess I do. I 'ain't had one for two years."

"I guess I'd better git a silk hat to wear. I suppose

I shall have to drive some of the Carrolls' folks," said

Rawdy, with a timid look at his wife. A silk hat had

always been his ambition, but she had always frowned

upon it.

"Well, I would," said she, cordially.

Samson Rawdy told everybody how Carroll had paid

him in advance-" every cent, sir; and he didn't believe,

for his part, half the stories that were told about him.

He guessed that he paid, in the long run, as well as any-

body in Banbridge. Carroll wa'n't the only one that

hadn't paid him, not by a long-shot. He guessed some

of them that talked about Carroll had better look to

home. He called Carroll a gentleman, and any time

when anything happened that his carriage wa'n't on

hand when the train come in, he was ready an' willin'

to drive him up, or any of his folks, an' if they didn't

have a quarter handy right on the spot, he wa'n't goin'

to lay awake sweatin' over it."

Rawdy's testimony prevented Blumenfeldt, the florist,

from asking for his pay in advance, as he had intended.

He and his son and daughter, who assisted him in his

business, decorated the church and the Carroll house,

and wagons laden with palms and flowers were constant-

ly on the road. Tuesday, the day before the wedding,

was unusually warm. Banbridge had an air of festive

weariness. Everybody who passed the church stopped

and stared at the open doors and the wilting grass leaves

strewn about.

skirt, with the tightest of fair braids packed above a

THE DEBTOR

round, pink face, with eyes so blue they looked opaque,

tied and wove garlands with the stolid radiance of her

kind. Her brother Franz worked as she did. Only

the father Blumenfeldt, who was of a more nervous

strain, flew about in excitement, his fat form full of

vibrations, his fat face blazing, contorting with frantic

energy.

"It iss ein goot yob," he repeated, constantly-"ein

goot yob." Not a doubt was left. When he came in

contact with Carroll he bowed to the ground; he was full

of eager protestations, of almost hysterical assertions.

All day long he was in incessant and fruitless motion,

buzzing, as it were, over his task, conserving force only

in the heat of his own spirit, not in the performance of

the work. Meanwhile the son and daughter, dogged,

undiverted, wrought with good results, weaving many

a pretty floral fancy with their fat fingers. Eddy Car-

roll had taken it upon himself to guard the church doors

and prevent people from viewing the splendors before

the appointed time. All the morning he had waged war

with sundry of his small associates, who were restrained

from forcible entry only by the fear of the Blumenfeldt

family.

"Mr. Blumenfeldt says he'll run anybody out who

goes in, and kick 'em head over heels all the way down

the aisle and down the steps," Eddy declared, menda-

ciously, to everybody, even his elders.

"I think you are telling a lie, little boy," said Mrs.

Samson Rawdy, who had come with a timid female

friend on a tour of inspection. Mrs. Rawdy, in virtue

of her husband's employment, felt a sort of proprietor-

ship in the occasion.

"There won't be a mite of trouble about our goin' in

to see the church," she told the friend, who was a hum-

ble soul.

But Mrs. Rawdy reckoned without Eddy Carroll.

224








<pb n="225"/>
THE DEBTOR

When she told him that he was telling a lie, he smiled

sweetly at her.

"You're telling a lie yourself, missis," said he.

Mrs. Rawdy essayed to push past him, but as he stood

directly in the door, and she was unable, on account of

her stout habit of body, to pass him, and hardly ventured

to forcibly remove him, she desisted. "You are a sassy

little boy," said she, "and if your sister is as sassy as

her brother, I pity the man that's goin' to marry her."

In reply Eddy made up an impish face at her as she

retreated. Then he entered the church himself to in-

spect progress, returning immediately to take up his

position of sentry again. About noon Anderson passed

on his way to the post-office, and nodded.

"You can't come in," the boy called out.

"All right," Anderson responded. But then Eddy

made a flying leap from the church door and caught

hold of his arm.

"Say, you can, if you won't tell anybody about it,"

he whispered, as if the curious village was within ear-

shot.

"I am afraid I cannot stop now, thank you," Ander-

son replied, smiling.

"You ain't mad, are you?"

Anderson assured him that he was not.

"They didn't tell me to keep folks out," Eddy ex-

plained, "but I made up my mind I didn't want every-

body seeing it till it was done. It's going to be a stun-

ner, I can tell you. There's palms and pots of flowers,

and yards and yards of white and green ribbon tied in

bows, and the pews are all tied round with evergreen

boughs, and to-morrow the smilax is going up. I tell

you, it's fine."

"It must be," said Anderson. He strove to move on,

but could not break free from the boy's little, clinging

hand. "Just come up the steps and peek in," pleaded

225








<pb n="226"/>
THE DEBTOR

Eddy. So Anderson yielded weakly and let himself be

pulled up the steps to the entrance of the church.

"Ain't it handsome?" asked Eddy, triumphantly.

"Very," replied Anderson.

"Say," said Eddy, "was it as handsome when you

were married yourself ?"

"I never was married," replied Anderson, laughing.

"You weren't?" said Eddy, staring at him. "Why,

I thought you were a widow man."

"No," said Anderson.

"Well, why were you never married?" asked Eddy,

sharply.

"Oh, for a good many reasons which I have never

formulated sufficiently to give," replied Anderson.

"I hate big words," said Eddy, "and I didn't think

you would do it. It's mean."

"So it is," said Anderson, with a kindly look at him.

"Well, all I meant was I couldn't give my reasons with-

out thinking it over."

"Perhaps you'll tell me when you get them thought

over," said Eddy, accepting the apology generously.

" Perhaps."

Anderson turned to go, after saying again that the

church was very handsomely decorated, and Eddy still

kept at his side.

"You didn't stay not married because you couldn't

get a girl to marry you, anyhow, I know that," said

he, "because you are an awful handsome man. You

are better-looking than Major Arms. I should think

Ina would a heap rather have married you."

"Thank you," said Anderson.

"You are going to the wedding, aren't you?" asked

Eddy.

"No, I think not."

"Why not?"

"I am very busy."

226








<pb n="227"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Why, you don't keep your store open Wednesday

evening?" asked Eddy, regarding him sharply.

"I have letters to write," replied Anderson.

"Oh, shucks! let the letters go!" cried the boy.

"There's going to be stacks of fun, and lots of things

to eat. There's chicken salad and lobster, and sand-

wiches, and ice-cream and cake, and coffee and cake,

and-" The boy hesitated; then he spoke again in a

whisper of triumph that had its meaning of pathos:

"They are all paid for. I know, for I heard papa tell

Major Arms. The carriages are paid for, too, and the

florist is going to be paid."

"That's good," said Anderson.

"Yes, sir, so the things are sure to be there. They

won't back out at the last minute, as they do sometimes.

Awful mean, too. Say, you'd better come. Your

mother can come, too. She likes ice-cream, don't she?"

Anderson said that he believed she did.

"Well, she'll be sure to get all she can eat," said

Eddy. "Tell her to come. I like your mother." He

clung closely to the man's arm and walked along the

street with him, forgetting his post as guardian of the

church. "You'll come, won't you?" he said.

"No. I shall be too busy, my son," said Anderson,

smiling; and finally Eddy retreated dissatisfied. When

he went home an hour later he burst into the house with

a question.

"Say," he asked Charlotte, "I want to know if Mr.

Anderson and his mother were asked to the wed-

ding."

Charlotte was hurrying through the hall with white

and green ribbons flying around her, en route to trim

the bay-window where the bridal couple were to stand

to receive the guests. "Oh, Eddy, dear," she cried, "I

can't stop now; indeed I can't. I don't know who was

invited and who not."

227








<pb n="228"/>
THE DEBTOR

"But, Charlotte," Eddy persisted, "I want to know

particularly. Please tell me, honey."

Then Charlotte stopped and looked back over her

great snarl of white and green ribbon. "Who did you

say, dear?" she asked. "Hurry! I can't stop."

"Mr. Anderson," repeated Eddy. "Mr. Anderson

and his mother."

"Mr. Anderson and his mother?" repeated Charlotte,

vaguely, and just then Anna Carroll came with a little

table which was to support a bowl of roses in the bay-

window.

"Mr. Anderson," said Eddy again.

"I don't know who you mean, Eddy, dear," said

Charlotte.

"Why, yes, you do, Charlotte, Mr. Anderson and his

mother."

"What is it ?" asked Anna Carroll. "Eddy, you must

not stop us for anything. We are too busy.

"You might just tell me if they are asked to the

wedding," said Eddy, in an aggrieved tone. "That

won't take a minute.   Mr. Anderson.  He keeps

store."

"Gracious!" cried Anna Carroll. "The child means

the grocer! No, dear, he isn't asked."

"Why, I never thought!" said Charlotte. "No, dear,

he isn't asked."

"Why not?" asked Eddy.

"We couldn't ask everybody, honey," replied Anna.

"Now you must not hinder us another minute."

But Eddy danced persistently before them, barring

their progress.

"He isn't everybody," he said. "He's the nicest

man in this town. Why didn't you ask him? Didn't

you think he was nice enough, I'd like to know?"

"Of course he is nice, dear, said Charlotte; "very

nice." She flushed a little.

228








<pb n="229"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Why didn't you ask him, then?" demanded Eddy.

"I call it mean."

Anna took Eddy by his small shoulders and set him

aside.

"Eddy," she said, sternly, "not another word. We

could not ask the grocer to your sister's wedding. Now,

don't say another word about it. Your sister and I are

too busy to bother with you."

"I don't see why you won't ask him because he's a

grocer," Eddy called, indignantly, after her. "He's the

nicest man here, and he always lets us have things,

whether we pay him or not. I have heard you say so.

I think you are awful mean to take his groceries, and

eat 'em, and use them for Ina's wedding, and then not

ask him, just because he is a grocer."

Anna's laughter floated back, and the boy wondered

angrily what she was laughing at. Then he went by

himself about righting wrongs. He hunted about until

he found on his mother's desk some left-over wedding-

cards, and he sent invitations to both the wedding and

reception to Randolph Anderson and his mother, which

were received that night.

Randolph carried them home, and his mother ex-

amined them with considerable satisfaction.

"We might go to the ceremony," said she, with doubt-

ful eyes on her son's face.

"I really think we had better not, mother."

"You think we had better not, simply to the cere-

mony? Of course I admit that we could not go to the

reception at the house, since we have not called, but the

ceremony ?"

"I think we had better not; this very late invita-

tion-"

"Oh, Randolph, that is easily accounted for. It is

so easy to overlook an invitation."

But Randolph persisted in his dissent to the proposi-

229








<pb n="230"/>
THE DEBTOR

tion to attend. He was quite sure how the invitation

had happened to come at all, and later on in the day he

was confirmed in his opinion when Eddy Carroll made

a rush into his office and inquired, breathlessly, if he

had received his invitation and if he was coming.

"Because I found out you hadn't been asked, and I

told them it was mean, and I sent you one myself,"

said he, with generous indignation.

Anderson finally compromised by going with him to

the church and viewing the completed decorations. He

also presented him with a package of candy from his

glass jars when he followed him back to the store.

"Say, you are a brick," Eddy assured him. "When

I am a man I am going to keep a grocery store. I'd a

great deal rather do that than have a business like papa's.

If you have the things yourself in your own store, you

don't have to owe anybody for them. Good-bye. If

you should get those letters done, you come, and your

mother, and I'll look out you have everything you want;

and I'll save seats in the pew where I sit, too."

"Thank you," said Anderson, and was conscious of

an exceedingly warm feeling for the child flying out of

the store with his package of sweets under his arm.








<pb n="231"/>
CHAPTER XX

CARROLL had arrived home very unexpectedly that

Sunday morning. The family were at the breakfast-

table. As a usual thing, Sunday-morning breakfast at

the Carrolls' was a desultory and uncertain ceremony,

but when Major Arms was there it was promptly on the

table at eight o'clock. He had not yet, in the relaxation

of civilian life, gotten over the regular habits acquired

in the army.

"It isn't hard you'll find the old man on you, sweet-

heart," he told Ina, "but there's one thing he's got to

have, and that is his breakfast, and a good old Southern

one, with plenty to eat, at eight o'clock, or you'll find

him as cross as a bear all day to pay for it."

Ina laughed and blushed, and sprinkled the sugar on

her cereal.

"Ina will not mind," said Mrs. Carroll. "She and

Charlotte have never been sleepy-heads."

Eddy glanced resentfully at his mother. He was a

little jealous in these days. He had never felt himself

so distinctly in the background as during these prepara-

tions for his sister's wedding.

"I am not a sleepy-head, either, Amy," said he.

"It is a pity you are not," said she, and everybody

laughed.

" Eddy is always awake before anybody in the house,"

said Ina, "and prowling around and sniffing for break-

fast."

"And you bet there is precious little breakfast to

16                2231








<pb n="232"/>
THE DEBTOR

sniff lately, unless we have company," said Eddy, still

in his resentful little pipe; and for a second there was

silence.

Then Mrs. Carroll laughed, not a laugh of embarrass-

ment, but a delightful, spontaneous peal, and the others,

even Major Arms, who had looked solemnly nonplussed,

joined her.

Eddy ate his cereal with a sly eye of delight upon the

mirthful faces. "Yes," said he, further. " I wish you'd

stay here all the time, Major Arms, and stay engaged to

Ina instead of marrying her; then all the rest of us

would have enough to eat. We always have plenty

when you are here."

He looked around for further applause, but he did

not get it. Charlotte gave him a sharp poke in the side

to institute silence.

"What are you poking me for, Charlotte?" he asked,

aggrievedly. She paid no attention to him.

"Don't you think it is strange we don't hear from

papa?" said Charlotte.

Major Arms stared at her. "Do you mean to say

you have not heard from him since he went away?" he

asked.

"Not a word," replied Mrs. Carroll, cheerfully.

"I am a little uneasy about papa," said Ina, but she

went on eating her breakfast quite composedly.

"I should be if I had ever known him to fail to take

care of himself," said Mrs. Carroll.

"It's the other folks that had better look out," re-

marked Eddy, with perfect innocence, though would-

be wit. He looked about for applause.

Arms's eyes twinkled, but he bent over his plate

solemnly.

"Eddy, you are talking altogether too much," Anna

Carroll said.

"You are unusually silly this morning, Eddy," said

232








<pb n="233"/>
THE DEBTOR

Charlotte. "There is no point in such a remark as

that."

"You said Arthur had gone to Chicago?" Arms said

to Mrs. Carroll.

"Well, the funny part of it is, we don't exactly know

whether he has or not," replied Mrs. Carroll, "but we

judge so. Arthur had been talking about going to

Chicago. He had spoken about the possibility of his

having to go for some time, and all of a sudden that

morning came a telegram from New York saying that

he was called away on business."

"Amy, of course he went to Chicago," Anna Carroll

said, quickly. " You know there is no doubt of it. " He

said he might have to go there on business, and he had

carried a dress-suit case in to the office, to have it ready,

and he had given you the Chicago hotel address."

"Yes, so he did, Anna," assented Mrs. Carroll. "I

suppose he must have gone to Chicago."

"You have written him there, I suppose?" said Arms,

who was evidently perturbed.

" Oh yes," replied Mrs. Carroll, easily, " I have written

three times."

"Did you put a return address on the corner of the

envelope in case he was not there?"

"Oh no! I never do. I thought only business men

did that."

"Amy doesn't even date her letters," said Ina.

"I never can remember the date," said Mrs. Carroll,

"and I never can remember whether it is Banbridge or

Banridge, so I never write the name of the place, either."

"And she always signs her name just Amy," said

Charlotte.

"Yes, I do, of course," said Mrs. Carroll, smiling.

Arms turned to Anna Carroll. "You have not felt

concerned?" said he to her.

"Not in the least," she replied, calmly. "I have no

233

THE DEBTOR

doubt that he has gone to Chicago, and possibly his busi-

ness has taken him farther still. I think nothing what-

ever of not hearing from him. Arthur, with all of his

considerateness in other respects, has always been singu-

larly remiss as to letters."

"Yes, he has, even before we were married," agreed

Mrs. Carroll. " Not hearing from Arthur was never any-

thing to worry about."

"And I think with Amy that Arthur Carroll is per-

fectly well able to take care of himself," said Anna,

further, with her slight inflection of sarcasm.

"I understood that he was going to Chicago, from

something he said to me some time ago," Arms said,

thoughtfully.

"Of course he has gone there," Anna Carroll said

again, with a sharp impatience.

And then there was a whirring flash of steel past the

window, and the fiercely hitching curve of a boy's back.

"It's Jim Leech on his wheel, and he's got a telegram,"

proclaimed Eddy, and made a dash for the door.

There was a little ripple of excitement. Charlotte

jumped up and followed Eddy, but he re-entered the

room dancing aloof with the telegram. In spite of her

efforts to reach it, he succeeded in tearing it open.

Charlotte was almost crying and quite pale.

"Eddy," she pleaded, "please give it to me-please."

"Eddy, bring that telegram here," commanded his

aunt, half rising from her seat.

"It is only from Arthur, saying he is coming, of

course," said Mrs. Carroll, calmly sipping her coffee.

"Arthur always telegraphs when he has been away

anywhere and is coming home."

"Eddy!" said Charlotte.

But Eddy essayed reading the telegram with an effect

of being in the air, such was his defensive agility. " He's

coming, I guess," he said. "I don't think anything

234








<pb n="235"/>
THE DEBTOR

very bad has happened. I don't think it's an accident

or anything, but the writing is awful. I should think

that telegraph man would be ashamed to write like

that."

"Eddy, bring that telegram to me," said Anna;

"bring it at once." And the boy finally obeyed.

Anna read the telegram and her nervous forehead

relaxed. "It is all right," said she; then she read the

message aloud. It was dated New York, the night

before:

" Am in New York. Shall take the first train home in the

morning."

"He sent it last night at eight o'clock, and we have

only just got it," said Ina.

"He is all right," repeated Anna.

"Of course he is all right," said Mrs. Carroll. "Why

doesn't Marie bring in the eggs ? We have all finished

the cereal?"

"Eggs! Golly!" cried Eddy, slipping into his chair.

"Why, it must be time for him now!" Charlotte said,

suddenly.

Arms looked at his watch. "Yes, it is," he agreed.

It was not long before Samson Rawdy drove into the

grounds, and everybody sprang up at the sound of the

wheels.

"There's papa!" cried Eddy, and led the way to the

door, slipping out before the others.

Carroll was engaged in a discussion with the driver.

He nodded his head in a smiling aside in response to

the chorus of welcome from the porch, and went on con-

ferring with the liveryman, who was speaking in a low,

inaudible voice, but gesticulating earnestly. Presently

Carroll drew out his pocket-book and gave him some

money.

235








<pb n="236"/>
THE DEBTOR

"My!" said Eddy, in a tone of awe, "papa's paying

him some money."

Still the man, Samson Rawdy, did not seem quite

satisfied. Something was quite audible here about the

rest of the bill, but finally he smiled in response to Car-

roll's low, even reply, raised his hat, sprang into his

carriage, and turned round in a neat circle while Carroll

came up the steps.

"Arthur, dear, where have you been ?" asked his wife,

folding soft, silken arms around his neck and putting

up her smiling face for his kiss. "We have not heard

a word from you since you went away."

"You got my telegram?" replied Carroll, interroga-

tively, kissing her, and passing on to his daughters.

Eddy, meantime, was clinging to one of his father's hands

and making little leaps upon him like a pet dog.

"Yes," cried everybody together, "the telegram just

came-just a minute ago."

Anna had kissed her brother, then stepped quietly

into the house. The others moved slowly after her.

"How are you, old man ?" Carroll asked Major

Arms.

"First rate," replied Arms, grasping the proffered

hand, yet in a somewhat constrained fashion.

"Why didn't you write, Arthur dear?" Mrs. Carroll

asked, yet not in the least complainingly or reproachful-

ly. On the contrary, she was smiling at him with the

sweetest unreserve of welcome as she entered the dining-

room by his side.

"Breakfast is getting cold, papa," said Charlotte.

"Come right in."

"We have got a bully breakfast. No end to eat,"

said Eddy, as he danced at his father's heels.

Carroll need not have answered his wife's question

then, for her attention was diverted from it, but he did.

"I was very busy, dear," he said, rather gravely. "You

236








<pb n="237"/>
THE DEBTOR

were no less in mind. In fact, I never had you all any

more in mind."

"You must have had a hard night's journey, papa,"

Charlotte said, as they all sat down at the table, and

Marie brought in the eggs.

"Yes, I had a very hard night," Carroll replied, still

with a curious gravity.

Charlotte regarded him anxiously. "Why, papa,"

she said, "aren't you well?"

"Very well indeed, honey," Carroll replied, and he

smiled then.

The others looked at him. "Why, papa, you do

look sick!" cried Ina.

"Arthur, dear, you look as if you had been ill a month,

and I never noticed it till now, I was so glad to see

you," cried Mrs. Carroll. Suddenly she jumped from

her seat and passed behind her husband's chair and

drew his head to her shoulder. "Arthur, dearest, are

you ill?"

"No, I am not, sweetheart."

"But, Arthur, you have lost twenty poundsl"

"Nonsense, dearl"

"Haven't you had anything to eat, papa?" Eddy

asked, with sharp sidewise eyes on his father.

Then Anna Carroll spoke. "Can't you see that

Arthur wants his breakfast?" said she, and in her tone

was a certain impatience and pity for her brother.

Major Arms, however, was not a man to take a hint.

He also was scrutinizing Carroll. "Arthur," he sud-

denly exclaimed, "what on earth is the matter, lad?

You do look pretty well knocked up."

Carroll loosened his wife's arm and gave her an ex-

ceedingly gentle push. He laughed constrainedly at

the same time. "Anna is about right," he said. "I

am starved. Wait until I have eaten my breakfast

before you pass judgment on my appearance."

237








<pb n="238"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Haven't you eaten anything since you left Chicago,

papa?" asked Ina.

"Never mind, dear," he replied, in an odd, curt tone,

and she looked a little grieved.

"Did you come on the flyer, papa?" asked Eddy.

"What are you nudging me for, Charlotte?"

"Papa doesn't want any more questions asked. He

wants his breakfast," said Charlotte.

"No. I did not come on the flyer," Carroll answered,

in the same curt tone. Then for a moment there was

silence, and Carroll ate his breakfast.

It was Major Arms who broke the silence. "You

got in last night," he said, with scarcely an inflection of

interrogation.

But Carroll replied, "I was in the hotel at midnight."

"We have been frightfully busy since you left, Arthur

dear," said Mrs. Carroll. "It is a tremendous under-

taking to make a wedding."

"How do the preparations go on?" asked Carroll,

while Ina bent over her plate with a half-annoyed, half-

pleased expression.

"Very well," replied Mrs. Carroll. "Ina's things are

lovely, and the dressmaker is so pleased that we gave

her the trousseau. It will be a lovely wedding."

"Where have you been all the week?" Carroll asked

of Arms, who was gazing with an utter openness of hon-

est delight at Ina.

"Here some of the time, and in New York. I had to

run up to Albany on business for two days. I got home

Wednesday night too late to come out here, and I went

into Proctor's roof-garden to see the vaudeville show."

"Did you?" remarked Carroll, in an even voice. He

sugared his cereal more plentifully.

"Yes. I had the time on my hands. It was a warm

night and I did not feel like turning in, and I was trail-

ing about and the lights attracted me. And, by Jovel

238








<pb n="239"/>
THE DEBTOR

I was glad I went in, for I saw something that carried

me back-well, I won't say how many years, for I'm

trying to be as much of a boy as I can for this little girl

here-but, by Jove! it did carry me back, though."

"What was it?" asked Charlotte.

"Well, dear, it was nothing except a dance by a nig-

ger. Maybe you wouldn't have thought so much of it.

I don't know, though; it did bring down the house. He

was called back I don't know how many times. It was

like a dance an old fellow on my father's plantation used

to dance before the war. Arthur, you must have seen

old Uncle Noah dance that. Why, now I think of it,

you used to dance it yourself when you were a boy, and

sing for the music just the way he did. Don't you re-

member ?"

Carroll nodded laughingly, and went on eating.

" Used to-I guess you did! I remember your dancing

that at Bud Hamilton's when Bud came of age. Old

Noah must have been gone then. It was after the war."

"Oh, papa," cried Eddy, in a rapture, "do dance it

sometime, won't you?"

"I'll tell you what we will all do," cried Major Arms,

with enthusiasm, "we'll all go to the City to-morrow

night, and we'll see that dance. I tell you it's worth it.

It's a queer thing, utterly unlike anything I have ever

seen. It is a sort of cross between a cake-walk and

an Indian war-dance. Jove! how it carried me back!"

Arms began to hum. "That's it, pretty near, isn't it,

Arthur?" he asked.

"Quite near, I should say," replied Carroll.

"Oh, papa, won't you sing and dance it after break-

fast?" cried Eddy.

"Now, hush up, my son," said Arms. "Your father

has the dignity of his position to support. A gentle-

man doesn't dance nigger dances when he is grown up

and the head of a family. It's all very well when he is

239








<pb n="240"/>
THE DEBTOR

a boy. But we'll all go to New York to-morrow night

and we'll see that dance."

"There is a great deal to do," Anna Carroll remarked.

"Nonsense!" said the major. "There's time enough.

Where are the Sunday papers? I'll see if it is on to-

morrow. Have they come yet?"

"I am going down to get shaved, and I will bring

them up," Carroll said.

"Don't they bring them to the door in Banbridge ?"

asked Arms, wonderingly.

"They used when we first came here," said Eddy.

"I guess-" Then he stopped in obedience to a look

from his aunt.

"I will bring them when I come home," repeated

Carroll.

"Well, we'll all go in to-morrow night, and we'll see

that dance," said the major.

But when Carroll, on his return from the barber's

shop, brought the papers, Major Arms discovered, much

to his disappointment, that that particular attraction

had been removed from the roof-garden. There was a

long and flattering encomium of the song and dance

which upheld him in his enthusiasm.

"Yes, it was a big thing; you can understand by what

it says here," said he, "I was right. I'm mighty sorry

it's off."

CHAPTER XXI

ANDERSON on Wednesday evening sat on the porch

and saw the people stream by to the wedding. Mrs.

Anderson, although it was a very pleasant and warm

evening, did not come outside, but sat by the parlor

window, well-screened by the folds of the old damask

curtain. The wedding was at eight, and by quarter-

past seven the people began to pass; by half-past seven

the street was quite full of them. It seemed as if all

Banbridge was gathering. A church wedding was quite

an unusual festivity in the town, and, besides, there had

always been so much curiosity with regard to the Car-

rolls that interest was doubled in this case. His mother

called to him softly from the parlor. " There are a great

many going, aren't they?" said she.

"Yes, mother," replied Anderson.  He distinctly

heard a soft sigh from the window, and his heart smote

him a little. He realized dimly that a matter like this

might seem important to a woman. Presently he heard

a soft flop of draperies, and his mother stood large and

white and mild behind him.

"They are nearly all gone who are going, I think?"

said she, interrogatively.

Anderson looked at his watch, holding it towards

the light of the moon, which was just coming above

the horizon. The daylight had paled with sudden-

ness like a lamp burning low from lack of oil. "Yes;

they must be all gone now," said he. "It is eight

o'clock."

241








<pb n="242"/>
THE DEBTOR

He rose and placed a chair for his mother, and she

settled into it.

"I thought I would not come out here while the peo-

ple were passing," said she. "I have my matinee on,

and I am never quite sure that it is dress enough for the

porch."

Anderson looked at the lacy, beribboned thing which

his mother wore over her black silk skirt, and said it

was very pretty.

"Yes, it is," said she, "but I am never sure that it is

just the thing to be out of my own room in. I suppose

the dresses to-night will be very pretty. Miss Carroll

ought to make a lovely bride. She is a very pretty girl,

and so is her sister. I dare say their dresses will be pret-

tier than anything of the kind ever seen in Banbridge."

There was an indescribable wistfulness in Mrs. Ander-

son's voice. Large and rather majestic woman that she

was, she spoke like a disappointed child, and her son

looked at her with wonder.

"I don't understand how a woman can care so much

about seeing pretty dresses," he said, not unkindly, but

with a slight inflection of amused scorn.

"No," said his mother, "I don't suppose you can,

dear. I don't suppose any man can." And it was as

if she regarded him from feminine heights. At that

moment the longing, never quite stilled in her breast, for

a daughter, a child of her own kind, who would have

understood her, who would have gone with her to this

wedding, and been to the full as disappointed as she

was to have missed it, was strong upon her. She was

very fond of her son, but at the moment she saw him

with alien eyes. "No, dear, I don't suppose you can

understand," she repeated; "you are a man."

"If you had really cared so much, mother-if I had

understood," he said, gently, "you might have gone.

You could have gone with the Egglestons."

242








<pb n="243"/>
THE DEBTOR

"There was no reason why we could not have gone

by ourselves," said she, " and sat with the invited guests,

where we could have seen everything nicely, since we

had an invitation."

Anderson opened his mouth to tell his mother of

the true source of the invitation; then he hesitated.

He had a theory that it was foolish, in view of the

large alloy of bitterness in the world, to destroy the

slightest element of sweet by a word. It was quite

evident that his mother, for some occult reason, took

pleasure in the invitation. Why destroy it? So he

repeated that she might have gone, had she cared so

much; and feeling that he was showing a needless hu-

mility in his own scruples, he added that he would have

gone with her. Then his mother declared that she did

not, after all, really care, that it was a warm night and

she would have been obliged to dress, and after fanning

herself a little while, went in the house and to bed, leav-

ing him marvelling at the ways of women. The prob-

lem as to whether his mother had really wished very

much to go to the wedding and whether he had been

selfish and foolish in opposing her wish or not, rather

agitated him for some minutes. Then he gave it up,

and relegated women to a place with the fourth dimen-

sion on the shelf of his understanding. The moon was

now fairly aloft, sailing triumphant in a fleet of pale

gold and rosy clouds. The night was very hot, the night

insects were shrieking in their persistent dissonances all

over the street. Shadows waved and trembled over

the field of silver radiance cast by the moon. No one

passed. He could not see a window-light in any of the

houses. Everybody had gone to the wedding, and the

place was like a deserted village. Anderson felt unut-

terably lonely. He felt outside of all the happy doors

and windows of life. Discontent was not his failing,

but all at once the evil spirit swept over him. He

243








<pb n="244"/>
THE DEBTOR

seemed to realize that instead of moving in the broad

highway trod by humanity he was on his own little side-

path to the tomb, and injury and anger seized him. He

thought of the man who was being married so short

a distance away, and envy in a general sense, with no

reference even to Charlotte, swept over him. He had

never been disturbed in very great measure with long-

ing for the happiness that the other man was laying hold

of, but even that fact served to augment his sense of

injury and resentment. He felt that it was due to cir-

cumstances, in a very large degree to the inevitable

decrees of his fate, that he had not had the longing, and

not to any inherent lack of his own nature. He felt

that he had had a double loss in both the hunger and

the satisfaction of it, and now, after all, had come at

last this absurd and hopeless affection which had lately

possessed him. To-night the affection, instead of seem-

ing to warm the heart of a nobly patient and reasonable

man, seemed to sting it.

Suddenly out of the hot murk of the night came a

little puff of cool wind, and borne on it a faint strain of

music. Anderson listened. The music came again.

"It cannot be possible that the wedding is just about

to begin," he thought, "not at this hour."

But that was quite possible with the Carrolls, who,

with the exception of the head of the family, had never

been on time in their lives. It was nearly nine o'clock,

and the guests had been sitting in a subdued impatience

amid the wilting flowers and greens in the church, and

the minister had been trying to keep in a benedictory

frame of mind in a stuffy little retiring-room, and now

the wedding-party were just entering the church. A

sudden impulse seized Anderson. He stole inside the

house, and looked and listened in the hall. Everything

was dark up-stairs, and silent. Mrs. Anderson always

fell asleep like a baby immediately upon going to bed.

244








<pb n="245"/>
THE DEBTOR

Anderson got his hat from the hall-tree, and went out,

closing the door with its spring- lock very cautiously.

Then he slipped around the house and listened. He

could hear a soft, cooing murmur of voices from the

back stoop. The servant, as usual, was keeping tryst

there with her lover. He walked a little farther and

came upon their consolidated shadow of love under the

wild- cucumber vine which wreathed over the trellis-

hood of the door. The girl gave a little shriek and a

giggle, the man, partly pushed, partly of his own volition,

started away from her and stood up with an incoherent

growl of greeting.

"Good-evening," said Anderson. "Jane, I am going

out, and my mother has gone up-stairs. If you will

be kind enough to have a little attention in case she

should ring." Anderson had fixed an electric bell in his

mother's room, which communicated with the kitchen.

"Yes, sir," said the girl, with a sound between a gasp

and a giggle.

"I have locked the front-door," said Anderson.

"Yes, sir," said the girl, again.

Anderson went around the house, and the sound of

an embarrassed and happy laugh floated after him. He

felt again the sense of injury and resentment, as if he

were shut even out of places where he would not care

to be, even out of the humblest joys of life, out of the

kitchens as well as the palaces.

Anderson strolled down the deserted street and turned

the corner on to Main Street. Then he strolled on until

he reached the church. It was brilliantly lighted. Peer-

ing people stood in the entrance and the sidewalk before

it was crowded. There was a line of carriages in waiting.

But everything was still except for the unintermittent

voices of the night, which continued like the tick of a

clock measuring off eternity, undisturbed by anything

around it. From the church itself a silence which could

245








<pb n="246"/>
THE DEBTOR

be sensed seemed to roll, eclipsing the diapason of an

organ. Not a word of the minister's voice was audible

at that distance. Instead was that tremendous silence

and hush. Anderson wondered what that pretty, igno-

rant little girl in there was, to dare to tamper with this

ancient force of the earth ? Would it not crush her? If

the man loved her would he not, after all, have simply

tried to see to it that the fair little butterfly of a thing

had always her flowers to hang over: the little sweets

of existence, the hats and frocks and ribbons which she

loved, and then have gone away and left her? A great

pity for the bride came over him, and then a flood of

yearning tenderness for the other girl, greater than he

had ever known.

In his awe and wonder at what was going on all his

own rebellion and unhappiness were gone. He felt only

that yearning for, and terror for, that little, tender soul

that he loved, exposed to all the terrible and ancient

solemn might of existence, which the centuries had

rolled up until her time came. He longed to shield her

not only from sorrow, but from joy. He took off his

hat and stood back in the shadow of a door on the op-

posite sidewalk. It seemed to him that the ceremony

would never end. It was, in fact, unusually long, for the

Banbridge minister had much to say for the edification

of the bridal pair, and for his own aggrandizement. But

at last the triumphant peal of the organ burst forth, and

the church swarmed like a hive. People began to stir.

All the heads turned. The rustle of silk was quite

audible from outside, also a gathering sibilance of whis-

pers and rustling stir of curious humanity, exactly like

the swarming impetus of a hive. Fans fluttered like

butterflies over all this agitation of heaving shoulders

and turning heads in the church. Outside, the people

standing about the steps and on the sidewalk separated

hurriedly and formed an aisle of gaping curiosity. A

246








<pb n="247"/>
THE DEBTOR

carriage streaming with white ribbons rolled up, the

others fell into line. Anderson could see Samson Rawdy

on the white-ribboned wedding-coach, sitting in majesty.

He was paid well in advance; his wife, complacent and

beaming in her new silk waist, was in the church. The

contemplation of the new marriage had brought a wave

of analogous happiness and fresh love for her over his

soul. He was as happy with his own measure of hap-

piness as any one there. Every happiness as well as

every sorrow is a source of centrifugal attraction.

Anderson, watching, saw presently the bridal party

emerge from the church. To his fancy, which naturally

looked for similes to his beloved pursuits of life, he saw

the bride like a white moth of the night, her misty veil,

pendant from her head to her feet, carrying out the pale,

slanting evanescence of the moth's wings. She moved

with a slight wavering motion suggestive of the flight

of the vague winged thing which flits from darkness to

darkness when it does not perish in the candle beams.

This moth, to Anderson, was doing the latter, fluttering

possibly to her death, in the light of that awful primaval

force of love upon which the continuance of creation

hangs. Again, a great pity for her overwhelmed him,

and a very fierceness of protection seized him at the

sight of Charlotte following her sister in her bridesmaid's

attire of filmy white over rose, with pink roses in her

hair.

Anderson stood where he could see the faces of the

bridal party quite plainly in the glare of the electric

light. Charlotte, he saw, with emotion, had an awed,

intensely sober expression on her charming face, but the

bride's, set in the white mist of her thrown-back veil,

was smiling lightly. He saw Arms bend over and whis-

per to her, and she laughed outright with girlish gayety.

Anderson wondered what he said. Arms had smiled,

yet his face was evidently moved. What he had said

17                 247








<pb n="248"/>
THE DEBTOR

was simple enough: "Fighting Indians is nothing to get-

ting married, honey."

Ina laughed, but her husband's lips quivered a little.

She herself realized a curious self - possession greater

than she had ever realized in her whole life. It is pos-

sible that the world is so old and so many women have

married in it that a heredity of self-control supports

them in the midst of an occasion which has quickened

their pulses in anticipation during their whole lives.

But the bridegroom was not so supported. He was

manifestly agitated and nervous, especially during the

reception which followed the ceremony. He stood

with forced amiability responding to the stilted con-

gratulations and gazing with wondering admiration

at his bride, whose manner was the perfection of

grace.

"Lord, old man!" he whispered once to Carroll, "this

part of it is a farce for an old fellow like me, standing

in a blooming bower, being patted on the head like a

little poodle-dog."

Carroll laughed.

"She likes it, now," whispered Arms, with a fond,

proud glance at Ina.

"Women all do," responded Carroll.

"Well, I'd stand here a week if she wanted to, bless

her," Arms whispered back, and turned with a success-

ful grimace to acknowledge Mrs. Van Dorn's carefully

worded congratulations. As she turned away she met

Carroll's eyes, and a burning blush overspread her face

to her pompadour crest surmounting her large, middle-

aged face. She suddenly recalled, with painful acute-

ness, the only other occasion on which she had been in

the house; but Carroll's manner was perfect, there was

in his eyes no recollection whatever.

Mrs. Carroll was lovely in pale-mauve crape embroid-

ered with violets, a relic of past splendors, remodelled

248








<pb n="249"/>
THE DEBTOR

for the occasion in spite of doubts on her part, and her

beautiful old amethysts. Anna had urged it.

"I shall wear my cream lace, which no one here has

ever seen, and I think, Amy, you had better wear that

embroidered mauve crape," she said.

"But, Anna," said Mrs. Carroll, "doesn't it seem as

if Ina's mother ought not to wear an old gown at the

dear child's wedding? I would as lief, as far as I am

concerned, but is it doing the right thing?"

"Why not?" asked Anna, rather tartly. Lately her

temper was growing a little uncertain. Sometimes she

felt as if she had been beset all her life by swarms of

gnats. "No one here has ever seen the dress," said

she. "And what in the world could you have prettier,

if you were to get a new one?"

"Oh, this Banbridge dressmaker is really making

charming things," said Mrs. Carroll, rather eagerly.

She had a childish fondness for new clothes. " She would

make me a beautiful dress, so far as that goes, Anna,

dear."

"She has all she can do with Ina's things."

"I reckon she could squeeze in one for me, Anna.

Don't you think so?"

"Then there is the extra expense," said Anna.

"But she does not hesitate in the least to trust us,"

said Mrs. Carroll. "But maybe you are right, Anna.

That embroidered mauve is lovely, and perfectly fresh,

and it is very warm to fuss over another, and then my

amethysts look charming with that."

Therefore, Mrs. Carroll wore the mauve and the

amethysts, and was by many considered handsomer

than either of her daughters. There had been some dis-

cussion about giving the amethysts to Ina for a wedding-

gift, but finally a set of wonderful carved corals, which

she had always loved and never been allowed to wear,

were decided upon. Anna had given a pearl brooch,

249








<pb n="250"/>
THE DEBTOR

which had come down from her paternal grandmother,

and Carroll had presented her with a large and evidently

valuable pearl ring which had excited some wonder in

the family.

"Why, Arthur, where did you get it?" his wife had

cried, involuntarily; and he had laughed and refused to

tell her.

Ina herself, while she received the ring with the great-

est delight, was secretly a little troubled. "I am

afraid poor papa ought not to have given me such

a present as this," she said to Charlotte, when the

two girls were in their room that night. As she

spoke she was holding the pearl to the lamp-light and

watching the beautiful pink lights. It was a tinted

pearl.

"It is a little different, because you are going away,

and papa will never buy you things again," said Char-

lotte. "I should not worry, dear." For the few days

before her marriage, Charlotte had gotten a habit of

treating her sister with the most painstaking considera-

tion for her nerves and her feelings, as if she were an

invalid. She was herself greatly troubled at the thought

that her father had overtasked his resources to purchase

such a valuable thing, but she would not for worlds have

intimated such a thing to Ina.

"Well, I do worry," said Ina. "I cannot help it.

It was too much for poor papa to do." She even shed

a few tears over the pearl, and Charlotte kissed and

coddled her a good deal for comfort.

"It is such a beauty, dear," she said. "Look at it

and take comfort in it, darling."

"Yes, it is a beauty," sobbed Ina. "I never saw

such a pearl except that one of poor papa's, the one he

has in his scarf-pin that belonged to that friend of his

who died, you know."

"Yes, dear," said Charlotte, "I know. It is another

250

THE DEBTOR

just such a beauty. Don't cry any more, honey.

Think how happy you are to have it."

But Charlotte herself, after she had gone to bed in

her own little room, had sobbed very softly lest her

sister should hear her, until Ina was asleep. Her sister's

remarks had brought a suspicion to her own mind.

"Poor papa!" she kept whispering softly, to herself.

"Poor papa!" It seemed to her that her heart was

breaking with understanding of and pity for her father.

Charlotte's own gift to Ina had been some pieces of

embroidery. She was the only one in the family who

excelled in any kind of handicraft. "Ina will like this

better than anything," she had told her aunt Anna,

"and then it will not tax poor papa, either. It will

cost nothing."

Her aunt had looked at her a minute, then suddenly

thrown her arms around her and kissed her. "Charlotte,

you little honey, you are the best of the lot!" she had

said.

Charlotte herself, the night of the wedding, was look-

ing rather pale and serious. Many observed that she

was the least good-looking of the family. Several Ban-

bridge young men essayed to make themselves agreeable

to her, but she did not know it. She was very busy.

Besides their one maid there were the waiters sent by

the caterer, and Eddy was exceedingly troublesome.

He was a nervous boy, and unless directly under his

father's eye, almost beyond restraint when impressed,

as he was then, with an exaggerated sense of his own

importance. His activities took especially the form of

indiscriminate and superfluous helping the guests to

refreshments, until the waiters waxed fairly murderous,

and one of them even appealed to Anna Carroll, in-

timating in Eddy's hearing that unless the young gentle-

man left matters to them the supply of salad would run

short.

251








<pb n="252"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Why didn't we have more, then?" inquired Eddy,

quite audibly, to the delight of all within ear-shot. "I

thought we were going to have plenty for everybody

this time."

"Eddy dear," whispered Charlotte, taking his little

arm, "come with me into the hall and help me put back

some roses that have fallen out of the big vase. I am

afraid I shall get some water on my gown if I touch them,

and I noticed just now that some one had brushed

against them and jostled some out."

"Charlotte, why didn't we have salad enough?" per-

sisted Eddy, as he followed his sister, pulling back a lit-

tle at her leading hand.

"Hush, dear; we have enough, only you had better

leave it to the waiters, you know."

"Everybody has taken it that I have passed it to,"

said Eddy. "I have given that gentleman over there

four plates heaped up."

"Oh, hush, Eddy dear!" whispered Charlotte, in an

agony.

By this time they were in the hall, and Eddy, still

full of grievances, was picking up the scattered roses.

"I suppose there won't be enough salad for my friend

and his mother when they come," said he, further.

"Who are your friend and his mother, darling?"

"Mr. Anderson and his mother," declared Eddy,

promptly. "He is the best man in this town, and so

is his mother."

"Mr. Anderson, dear?"

"Yes. You know who I mean. You ought to know.

He always lets us have all we want out of his store. He

and his mother are the nicest people in this town except

us."

Charlotte looked at her little brother and her face

flushed softly. "But, dear," she whispered, "they did

not have any invitations to the reception."

252








<pb n="253"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Yes, they did," declared Eddy, triumphantly.

"Why, who sent them?"

"I did," said Eddy.

Charlotte regarded her little brother with a curious

expression. It was amused, and yet strangely puzzled,

but more as if the puzzle were in her own mind than

elsewhere. It was as if she were trying to remember

something.

"Don't you think he is a nice man?" asked Eddy,

looking sharply at her.

"Yes, dear, I think so. I don't know anything to the

contrary."

"Don't vou think he is handsome?"

Suddenly Charlotte saw   Anderson's face in her

thoughts for the first time very plainly. "Yes," she

said, "of course. Let us go in the other room, Eddy,

and see if Amy doesn't want anything." She led Eddy

forcibly into the parlor.

"It is so late, I am afraid he won't come," the little

boy said, disappointedly, when the clock on the mantel

struck eleven just as they entered.

It was not long after that when the company began

to disperse. The bride and groom were to take a mid-

night-train, and the bride and her sister stole away up-

stairs for the changing of the bridal for the travelling

costume.

Charlotte unfastened her sister's wedding-gown, and

she was striving her best to keep the tears back. Ina,

on the contrary, was gayer than usual.

"It is very odd," said she, as Charlotte hooked the

collar of her gray travelling-gown, "how a girl looks for-

ward to getting married, all her life, and thinks more of

it than anything else, and how, after all, it is nothing

at all. You can remember that I said so, Charlotte, when

you come to get married. You needn't dread it as if it

were some tremendous undertaking. It isn't, you know."

253








<pb n="254"/>
THE DEBTOR

"You speak exactly as if you had died, and were tell-

ing me not to dread dying," said Charlotte. She laugh-

ed, and the laugh was almost a sob.

"What an idea!" cried Ina, laughing. "Of course I

am very sad at leaving home and you all, you darling,

but the getting married is not so much, after all. You

will find that I am right."

"I shall never get married," said Charlotte.

"Nonsense, honey! 'Deed you will."

"No, I shall not. I shall stay with papa."

"Yes, you will. Say, honey, Robert"-Ina said

Robert quite easily and prettily now-"Robert has a

stunning cousin, young enough to be his son. His name

is Floyd-Floyd Arms. Isn't that a dear name? And

his father has just died, and he has the next place to

ours."

"Don't be foolish, dear."

"Robert says he is a fine fellow."

"I know all about him. I have seen Floyd Arms,"

said Charlotte, rather contemptuously.

"Oh, so you have! He was home that last time you

were in Acton, wasn't he? You spoke of him when you

came home."

"Yes, the last term I was at school," said Charlotte.

"Let me pin your veil, sweetheart."

"Don't you think he was handsome?"

"No, I don't, not so very," said Charlotte.

"Oh, Charlotte, where did you ever see a handsomer

man, unless it was papa or Robert?"

"I have seen much handsomer men," declared Char-

lotte, firmly, as she carefully pinned her sister's veil.

"Well, I would like to know where? Not in this

town ?"

"Yes, in this town."

"Who ?"

"Mr. Anderson."

254








<pb n="255"/>
THE DEBTOR

"The grocer?"

"Yes," said Charlotte, defiantly. The veil was pinned,

and Ina turned and looked at her, a rosy vision behind

a film of gray lace. "You look lovely," said Charlotte,

who had a soft pink in her cheeks.

"I think this hat is a beauty," said Ina. "Wasn't

it lucky that New Sanderson milliner was so very good,

and did not object to giving credit? Why, Mr. Ander-

son is the grocer! That is the man you mean, isn't it,

honey ?"

"Yes," replied Charlotte, still with defiance.

"Oh, well, that doesn't count," said Ina, turning for

a last view of herself in the glass. "This dress fits

beautifully."

"I don't see what that has to do with it," said Char-

lotte, as they left the room. She felt, even in the midst

of parting, and without knowing why, a little indigna-

tion with her sister.

On the threshold, Ina paused suddenly and flung her

arms around the other girl. "Oh, honey," she said,

with a half-sob-" oh, honey, how can we talk of who is

handsome and who isn't, whether he is the butcher, the

baker, or the candlestick-maker, when, when-"  The

two clung together for a minute, then Charlotte put her

sister gently away.

"You will muss your veil, dearest," said she, "and it

is almost time to go, and Amy and papa will want the

last of you."

That night, after the bridal pair had departed and

everybody else had gone to bed, Anna Carroll and her

brother had a little conference in the parlor amid the

debris of the wedding splendor. The flowers and greens

were drooping, the room and the whole house had that

peculiar phase of squalidness which comes alone from

the ragged ends of festivities; the floors were strewn

with rice and rose leaves and crumbs from the feast;

255








<pb n="256"/>
THE DEBTOR

plates and cups and saucers or fragments stood about

everywhere; the chairs and tables were in confusion.

Anna, who had been locking up the silver for the night,

had come into the parlor, and found her brother stand-

ing in a curious, absent-minded fashion in the middle of

the floor.

"Why, Arthur!" said she. "I thought you had gone

to bed."

"I am going," said he, but he made no move.

Anna looked at him, and her expression was weary

and a little bitter. "Well, it is over," said she.

Carroll nodded. "Yes," he said, with a half-suppress-

ed sigh.

Anna glanced around the room. "This house is a

sight for one maid to wrestle with," said she; and her

brother, beyond a glance of the utmost indifference

around the chaotic room, did not seem to notice her re-

mark at all. However, that she did not resent. In-

deed, she herself was so far from taking the matter to

heart that she laughed a little as she continued to sur-

vey the ruins.

" Well, it went off well; it was a pretty wedding," said

she, with a certain tone of pleasure.

Carroll turned to her quite eagerly. "You think Ina

was pleased?" he said. "It was all as she wished it to

be?"

"What could a girl have wished more?" cried Anna.

"Everything was charming, just as it should be. All

I think about is-"

"What?" asked her brother.

"We have danced," said Anna. "What I want to

know is, is the piper to be paid, or shall we have to dance

to another tune by way of reprisal."

"The piper is paid," replied Carroll, shortly. He

turned to go, but his sister stepped in front of him.

"How?" she said.

256








<pb n="257"/>
THE DEBTOR

Carroll looked down at her.

"Yes, you are quite right, Arthur," said she. "I am

afraid. You are, or may reasonably be, rather a des-

perate man. You have never taken quite kindly to

straits. If the piper is paid, I want to know how, for

my own peace of mind. By the piper I mean the

creditors for all this"--she glanced around the room-

"the wedding flowers and feast and carriages."

"I earned enough honestly," replied Carroll. He had

a strangely straightforward, almost boyish way of meet-

ing her sharp gaze.

"How ?"

."You had better not press the matter, Anna."

"I do. I am afraid." She responded to his look

with a certain bitter, sarcastic insistence. "I have rea-

son to be," said she. "You know I have, Arthur Car-

roll. We are all on the edge of a precipice, but I, for

one, do not intend to let you drag me over, and I do

not intend that Amy and the children shall go, either,

if I can help it. I want to know where you got the

money to pay for the wedding expenses, and I want to

know where you got that pearl ring you gave Ina. It

never cost a cent under three hundred dollars."

Carroll, looking at her, smiled a little sadly.

"It was then," said she, "Hart Lee's pearl that he

left you when he died-your scarf-pin."

Carroll smiled. Anna's face changed a little.

"I noticed that you had not worn it lately," said

she.

"Sooner or later it would have been the child's. It

might as well be sooner," said Carroll, with a slightly an-

noyed air.

" Eddy should have had it," Anna said, with a jealous

air.

"That child?"

"When he was older, of course."

257








<pb n="258"/>
THE DEBTOR

"That is a long way ahead," said Carroll. He moved

to go, but again Anna stood before him.

"Arthur," said she, solemnly, I am living with you

and doing all I am able. I am giving my strength for

you and yours. You know that as well as I do. You

know upon whom the brunt here falls. I do not com-

plain. The one who has the best strength should bear

the burden, and I have the strength, such as it is. None

of us Carrolls need brag of strength, God knows. But

I want to know how you came by that money. Yes, I

suspect, and I am not ashamed. I have a right to sus-

pect. How did you get that money?"

"I sang and danced for it in a music-hall, blackened

up as a negro," said Arthur Carroll."

"Then that was you, Arthur!" gasped Anna.

"Yes. It was the one thing I could do to get that

money honestly and pay the bills, and I did it. I would

not let Arms pay."

"I should think not," cried Anna. "We have not

fallen quite so low as that yet. But you-"

"Yes, I," said Carroll. "Now let us go to bed, Anna."

Anna stood aside, but as her brother turned to pass

her she suddenly put up her arms, and as he stooped

she kissed him. He felt her cheek wet against his.

"Good-night, Arthur," she said, and all the bitterness

was gone from her voice.

CHAPTER XXII

IT was a week to a day after the wedding, and Ander-

son had been to the office for the morning mail, and was

just returning to the store when a watching face at a

window of Madame Griggs's dress-making establishment

opposite suddenly disappeared, and when Anderson was

mounting the steps of the store piazza he heard a pant-

ing breath and rattle of starched petticoats, and turned

to see the dress-maker.

"Good-morning," she gasped.

"Good-morning, Mrs. Griggs," returned Anderson.

"Can I see you jest a minute on business? I have

been watching for you to come back from the office. I

want to buy a melon, if it ain't too dear, before I go,

but I want to see you jest a-minute in the office first,

if you ain't too busy."

"Certainly. Come right in," responded Anderson;

but his heart sank, for he divined her errand.

The dress-maker followed him into the office with a

nervous teeter and a loud rattle of starched cottons.

That morning she was clad in blue gingham trimmed

profusely with white lace, and her face looked infinitesi-

mal and meagre in the midst of her puffs of blond frizzes.

"I should think that woman was dressed in paper

bags by the noise she makes," Sam Riggs remarked to

the old clerk when the office door had closed behind her.

"I should think it would kinder take her mind off

things she starts out to do," remarked Price. The

rattle of the oscillating petticoats had distracted his

259








<pb n="260"/>
THE DEBTOR

own mind from a nice calculation as to the amount of

a bill for a fractional amount of citron at a fractional

increase in the market-price. The old clerk was about

to send a cost slip with some goods to be delivered to

a cash customer.

"Yep," responded Sam Riggs. "I should think she'd

git rattled with sech a rattlin' of her petticoats." The

boy regarded this as so supernaturally smart that he

actually blushed with modest appreciation of his own

wit, and tears sprang to his eyes when he laughed. But

when he glanced at his fellow-clerk, Price was calculat-

ing the cost of the citron, and did not seem to have

noticed anything unusual in the speech. Riggs, who

was easily taken down, felt immediately humiliated, and

doubtful of his own humor, and changed the subject.

"Say," he whispered, jerking his index-finger towards

the office door, "you don't suppose she is settin' her

cap at the boss, do you?"

"Well, I guess she'd have to take it out in settin',"

replied the old clerk, in scorn. He had now the price

of the citron fixed in his head, and he trotted to the

standing desk at the end of the counter to enter it.

"I guess so, too," said Riggs. "Guess she'd have to

starch her cap stiffer than her petticoats before she'd

catch him." Again Riggs thought he must be funny,

but, when the other clerk did not laugh, concluded he

must have been mistaken.

The conference in the office was short, and Price had

hardly gotten the slip made out when Madame Griggs

emerged. Indeed, she had not accepted Anderson's

proffer of a chair.

"No," said she, "I can't set down. I 'ain't got but

a minute. Two of my girls is went on their vacation,

an' I 'ain't got nobody but Bessie Starley, an' I've prom-

ised Mis' Rawdy she should have her new silk skirt

before Sunday to wear to Coney Island. Mr. Rawdy

260








<pb n="261"/>
THE DEBTOR

has made so much on hiring his carriages for the weddin'

that he has bought his wife a new black silk dress, an'

now he is goin' to take her to Coney Island Sunday,

and hire the Liscom boy to take his place drivin'. Now

what I come in here for was-" Madame Griggs lowered

her voice; she drew nearer Anderson, and her anxious

whisper whistled in his ear. "What I want to know

is," said she, "here's Mr. Rawdy, an' I hear the caterer,

were paid in advance, an' Blumenfeldt was paid the day

after the weddin', an' I ain't, an' I wonder if I'm goin'

to be."

"Have you sent in your bill yet?" inquired Ander-

son.

"No, I 'ain't, but Captain Carroll asked Blumenfeldt

for his bill an' he paid the others in advance, an' he 'ain't

asked for my bill."

"I do not see why you distress yourself until you

have sent in your bill," Anderson said, rather coldly.

"Now, don't you think so?"

"I certainly do not."

"Well," said she, "to tell the truth, I kinder hated

to send it too quick. I hated to have it look as if I was

scart. It's a pretty big bil~t-too, an' they seem like

real ladies, an' the sister, the one that ain't married, is

as nice a girl as I ever see-nicer than the other one,

accordin' to my way of thinkin'. She ain't stuck up a

mite. The rest of them don't mean to be stuck up,

but they be without knowin' it. Guess they was brought

up so; but Charlotte ain't. Well, I kinder hated, as I

say, to send that bill, especially as it is a pretty big

one. I made everything as reasonable as I could, but

she had a good many things, an' Charlotte had her

bridesmaid's dress, too, an' it's mounted up to consider-

able, an' I hated to have 'em think I was dreadful scart.

I 'ain't never been in the habit of sendin' in a bill to

nobody, not for some weeks after the things was did,

26I








<pb n="262"/>
THE DEBTOR

an' I didn't like to this time. But I says to myself, as

long as there had been so much talk round 'mongst folks

about the Carrolls not payin' their bills, I'd wait a week

an' then I'd send it in. Now it's jest a week ago to-day

since the weddin', an' there ain't a word. I thought

mebbe they'd ask for the bill the way they did with

Blumenfeldt, an' now I want to know if you think I

had better send the bill or wait a little while longer."

Anderson replied that he thought it would do no

harm, that he did not like to advise in such a case.

The dress-maker eyed him sharply and with a certain

'resentment. "Now, I want to know," said she. "I

want you to speak right out and tell me, if you think

I'm imposin'."

"I don't quite understand what you mean," Ander-

son replied, in bewilderment. He was horribly annoyed

and perplexed, but his manner was kind, for the mem-

ory of poor little Stella Mixter with her shower of blond

curls was strong upon him, and there was something

harrowingly pathetic about the combination of little,

veinous hands twitching nervously in the folds of the

blue gingham, the painstaking frizzes, the pale, screwed

little face, and the illogical feminine brain.

But the dress-maker's next remark almost dispelled

the pathos. "I want you to tell me right cut," said

she, "if it would make any difference if I paid you. Of

course I know you've given up law, an' I 'ain't thought

of offerin' you pay for advice. I've traded all I can in

your store, though I always think you are a little dearer,

and I didn't know but you'd think that made it all

right; but-"

"I do think it is all right," Anderson returned, quick-

ly, "I assure you, Mrs. Griggs, and I have never dream-

ed of such a thing as your paying me. Indeed, I have

given you no advice which I should have felt justified

in sending in a bill for, if I were practising my profession."

262








<pb n="263"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Well, I didn't think you had told me anything worth

much," said Madame Griggs, "but I know how lawyers

tuck on for nothin', and I didn't know but you might

feel-"

"I certainly do not," said Anderson.

"Well," said Madame Griggs, "I am very much

obliged to you. I'll send the bill a week from to-day,

and I feel a great deal better about it. I don't have

nobody to ask, and sometimes I feel as if I didn't have

a friend or a brother to ask whether I'd better do any-

thing or not, I should give up. I'm very much obliged,

Mr. Anderson."

* "You are very welcome to anything I have done,"

replied Anderson, looking at her with a dismay of be-

wilderment. It was as if he had witnessed some mental

inversion which affected his own brain. Anderson al-

ways pitied Madame Griggs, but never, after his con-

ferences with her concerning the Carrolls, did he in his

heart of hearts blame her husband for running away.

Madame Griggs's coquettish manner developed on the

threshold of the office. She smirked until her little,

delicate-skinned face was a net-work mask, and all the

muscles quivered to the sight through the transparent

covering. She moved her thin, crooked elbows with a

flapping motion like wings as she smirked and thanked

him again.

"I should think you'd like the grocery business a heap

better than law," said she, amiably, as she went out.

"Oh, I want to get a melon if they ain't too dear." She

evidently expected Anderson himself to wait upon her,

and was a little taken aback that he did not follow her.

She lingered for a long time haggling with Price, with a

watchful eye on the office door, and finally departed

without purchasing.

Shortly after she had gone, Sam Riggs came for An-

derson to inspect some vegetables which had been

18                263








<pb n="264"/>
THE DEBTOR

brought in by a farmer. " He's got some fine potatoes,"

said he, "but he wants too much for 'em, Price thinks.

He's got cabbages, too, and them's too high. Guess

you had better look at 'em yourself, Price says."

So Anderson went out to interview the farmer, sparse-

ly bearded, lank, and long-necked and seamy-skinned,

his face ineffectual yet shrewd, a poor white of the South

strung on wiry nerves, instead of lax muscles, the out-

come of the New Jersey soil. He shuffled determinedly

in his great boots, heavy with red shale, standing guard

over his fine vegetables. He nodded phlegmatically

at Anderson. He never smiled. Occasionally his long

facial muscles relaxed, but they never widened. He

was indefinably serious by nature, yet not melancholy,

and absolutely acquiescent in his life conditions. The

farmer of New Jersey is not of the stuff which breeds

anarchy. He is rooted fast to his red-clinging native

soil, which has taken hold of his spirit. He is tenacious,

but not revolutionary. He was as adamant on the

prices of his vegetables, and finally Anderson purchased

at his terms.

"You got stuck," Price said, after the farmer, in his

rusty wagon, drawn by a horse which was rather a fine

animal, had disappeared down the street.

"Well, I don't know," Anderson replied. "His vege-

tables are pretty fine."

"Folks won't pay the prices you ought to ask to

make a penny on it."

"Oh, I am not so sure of that. People want a good

article, and very few raise potatoes or cabbages or even

turnips in their own gardens."

"Ingram is selling potatoes two cents less than you,

and I rather think turnips, too."

"Not these turnips."

"No, guess not. He has his from another man, but they

look pretty good, and half the folks don't know the dif."

264








<pb n="265"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Well," Anderson replied, "sell them for less, if you

have to, rather than keep them. Selling a superfine

article for no profit is sometimes the best and cheapest

advertisement in the world."

Anderson stood a while observing the display of

vegetables and fruit piled on the sidewalk before his

store and in the store window. He took a certain hon-

est pleasure of proprietorship, and also an artistic de-

light in it. He observed the great green cabbages, like

enormous roses, the turnips, like ivory carvings veined

with purplish rose towards their roots, the smooth russet

of the potatoes. There were also baskets of fine grapes,

the tender pink bloom of Delawares, and the pale emer-

ald of Niagaras, with the plummy gloss of Concords.

There were enormous green spheres of watermelons,

baskets of superb peaches, each with a high light of

rose like a pearl, and piles of bartlett and seckel pears.

There was something about all this magnificent plenty

of the fruits of the earth which was impressive. It

was to an ardent fancy as if Flora and Pomona had been

that way with their horns of plenty. The sordid ques-

tion of market value, however, was distinctly irritat-

ing, and yet it was justly so. Why should not a man

sell the fruits of the earth for dollars .and cents with

artistic and honorable dignity as anything else? All

commodities for the needs of mankind are market-

able, are the instruments of traffic, whether they be

groceries or books, boots and shoes, dishes or furniture,

or pictures; whether they be songs or sermons or corn

plasters or shaving-soap; whether they be food for the

mind or the body. What difference did it make which

was dispensed? It was all a question of need and sup-

ply. The minister preached his sermons for the welfare

of the soul; the Jew hawked his second-hand garments;

everything was.interwoven. One must eat to live, to

hear sermons, to hear songs, to love, to think, to read.

265








<pb n="266"/>
THE DEBTOR

One must be clothed to tread the earth among his fel-

lows. There was need, and one supplied one need, one

another. All need was dignified by the man who pos-

sessed, all supply was dignified if one looked at it in

the right way. There was a certain dignity even about

his own need of two cents more on those turnips, which

were actually as beautiful as an ivory carving. Ander-

son finally returned to his office, feeling a little impa-

tient with himself that, in spite of his own perfect con-

tentment with his business, he should now and then

essay to justify himself in his contentment, as he un-

doubtedly did. It was like a violinist screwing his in-

strument up to concert-pitch, below which it would drop

from day to day.

Anderson had not been long in his office before he

heard a quick patter of feet outside, the peculiar clap-

ping sound of swift toes, which none but a child's feet

can produce, and Eddy Carroll entered. The door was

ajar, and he pushed it open and ran in with no cere-

mony. He was well in the room before he apparently

remembered something. He stopped short, ran back to

the door, and knocked.

Anderson chuckled. "Come in," he said, in a loud

tone, as if the door was closed.

Then Eddy came forward with some dignity. "I

remembered after I got in that I ought to have knock-

ed," said he. "I hope you'll excuse me."

"Certainly," said Anderson. "Won't you have a

seat ?"

Eddy sat down and swung his feet, kicking the round

of the chair, with his eyes fastened on Anderson, who

was seated in the other chair, smoking. "How old were

you when you began to smoke?" the boy inquired, sud-

denly.

"Very much older than you are," replied Anderson.

Eddy sighed. "Is it very nice to smoke?" said he.

266








<pb n="267"/>
THE DEBTOR

Anderson was conscious that he was distinctly at a

loss for a reply, and felt like a defaulting Sunday-school

teacher as he cast about for one.

"Is it?" said Eddy again.

"Different people look at it differently," said Ander-

son, and the best way is for you to wait until you are a

man and decide for yourself."

"Is it nicer to be a man than it was to be a boy?"

inquired Eddy.

"That, also, is a matter of opinion," said Anderson.

"You can do lots of things that a boy can't," said

Eddy. "You can smoke, and you can keep store, and

have all the candy you want." Eddy cast an innocent

glance towards the office door as he spoke.

"Sam!" called Anderson; and when the young clerk's

grinning face appeared at the door, "Will you bring

some of those peppermint - drops here for this young

man."

"I'd rather have chocolates, if you can't sell 'em any

better than the peppermint-drops," Eddy said, quickly.

When Sam reappeared with chocolates in a little

paper bag, Eddy was blissful. He ate and swung his

feet. "These are bully," said he. "I should think as

long as you can have all the chocolates you want, you'd

rather eat those than smoke a pipe."

"It is a matter of taste," replied Anderson.

"I'm always going to eat chocolates instead of smok-

ing," said Eddy. " He gave me a lot. Say, I don't see

how a boy can steal candy, do you?"

"No. It is very wrong," said Anderson.

"You bet 'tis. I knew a boy in New York State,

where we used to live before we came here, that stole

candy 'most every day, and he used to bring it to school

and give the other boys. He used to give me much as

a pound a day. Some days he used to give me much

as five pounds." Then Eddy Carroll, after delivering

himself of this statement, could not get his young, black

eyes away from the fixed regard of the man's keen, blue

ones, and he began to wriggle as to his body, with his

eyes held firm by that unswerving gaze. "What you

looking at me that way for?" he stammered. "I don't

think you're very polite."

" How much candy did that boy give you every day ?"

asked Anderson.

Eddy wriggled. "Well, maybe he didn't give me

more 'n half a pound," he muttered.

"How much?"

"Well, maybe it wasn't more 'n a quarter. I don't

know."

"How much?" persisted Anderson.

"Well, maybe it might have been three pieces; it was

a good many years ago. A fellow can't remember every-

thing."

"How much?" asked Anderson, pitilessly.

"One piece."

"How much ?"

"Well, maybe it wasn't any at all," Eddy burst out,

in desperation, "but I don't see what odds it makes.

I call it an awful fuss about a little mite of candy, for

my part."

"Now about that boy?" inquired Anderson.

"Oh, shucks, there wasn't any boy, I s'pose." Eddy

gazed resentfully and admiringly at the man. "Say,"

he said, without the slightest sarcasm, rather with affec-

tion and perfect seriousness, "you are awful smart, ain't

you?"

Anderson modestly murmured a disclaimer of any

especial smartness.

"Yes, you are awful smart," declared Eddy. "Is it

because you used to be a lawyer that you are so smart ?"

"The law may make a difference in a man's skill for

finding out the truth," admitted Anderson.

268








<pb n="269"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Say," said the boy, "I've been thinking all along

that when I was a man I would rather be a grocer than

anything else, but I don't know but I'd rather be a

lawyer, after all. It would be so nice to be able to

find out when folks were not telling the truth, and try-

ing to hide when they had been stealing and doing bad

things. 'No, you don't,' I'd say; 'no, you don't, mister.

I see right through you.' I rather think I'd like that

better. Say ?"

"What is it?" asked Anderson.

"Why didn't you come to the wedding? I saved a

lot of things for you."

"I told you I thought I should not be able to come.

I was very much obliged for the invitation," said An-

derson, apologetically.

"I looked for you till eleven o'clock. You ought

to have come, after I took all that trouble to get an

invitation for you. I don't think you were very

polite."

"I am very sorry," murmured Anderson.

"I think you ought to be. You don't know what you

missed. Ina looked awful pretty, but Charlotte looked

prettier, if she wasn't the bride. Don't you think Char-

lotte is an awful pretty girl ?"

"Very," replied Anderson, smiling.

"You'd better. I heard her say she thought you

was an awful handsome man, the handsomest man in

this town. Say, I think Charlotte would like to get

married, now Ina is married. I guess she feels kind of

slighted. Why don't you marry Charlotte?"

"Wouldn't you like some of those molasses-pepper-

mints, now you have finished the chocolates?" asked

Anderson.

"No, I guess not, thank you. I don't feel very well

this morning. Say, why don't you? She's an awful

nice girl-honest. And maybe I would come and live

269








<pb n="270"/>
THE DEBTOR

with you. I would part of the time, anyway, and I

would help in the store."

"You had better run out and ask Sam to give you

some peppermints," repeated Anderson, desperately.

"No, thank you. I'm real obliged, but I guess I

don't feel like it now. But I tell you what I had a

good deal rather have?"

"What is that?"

"What are you going to have for dinner?"

"Now, see here, my son," said Anderson, laughing.

"We are going to have a fine dinner, and I should be

exceedingly glad to have you as my guest, but this time

there must be no dining with me without your mother's

knowledge."

"Oh, Amy won't care."

"Nevertheless, you must go home and obtain per-

mission before I take you home with me," said Ander-

son, firmly.

"I don't think you are very polite," said Eddy; but

it ended in his presently saying that, well, then, he would

go home and ask permission; but it was not of the slight-

est use. "They would all want me to stay, if they

thought anything of me. I know Amy would. Amy

said this morning I was the worst off of them all, be-

cause I had such a misfortunate appetite." The boy's

ingenuous eyes met the man's fixed upon him with a

mixture of amusement and compassion. "You see,"

added Eddy, simply, "all the things left over from the

wedding, the caterers let us have; papa said not to ask

him, and Amy wouldn't, but Aunt Anna did, and there

was a lot, though folks ate so much. There was one

gentleman ate ten plates of salad-yes, he did. I saw

him. He was the doctor, so I suppose he wasn't ill

afterwards. But there was a lot left. Of course the. ice-

cream melted, but it was nice to drink afterwards, and

there was a lot of salad and cake and rolls. The cakes

270








<pb n="271"/>
THE DEBTOR

and rolls lasted longest. I got pretty tired of them.

But now those are all gone, and the butcher won't let

us have any more meat, though he trusted us two days

after the wedding, because he heard papa paid the florist

and the liveryman, but now he has stopped again. Of

course we have things from here, butt you don't keep

meat. Why don't you keep meat?" \

The absurd pathos of the whole was almost too much

for Anderson. He rose and went to the window and

looked out as he replied that it was not unusual for a

grocer to include meat in his stock of trade.

"I know it isn't," said Eddy, "but it would be so

nice for us if you did, and all the poor people the butcher

wouldn't trust. Did you ever get real hungry, and

have nothing except crackers and little gingersnaps and

such things ?"

"No, I don't know that I ever did."

"Well, it is awful," said Eddy, with emphasis. He

started up. "Well," he said, "I'm going to run right

home and ask Amy. She'll let me come. What did

you say you were going to have for dinner?"

"Roast beef," replied Anderson.

"Goodyl" cried the boy, and was off.

Anderson, left alone, sat down and thought disturbed-

ly. The utter futility of any efforts to assist such a

family was undeniable. Nothing could be done. For

a vivid instant he had an idea of rushing to the market

and setting up surreptitiously a term of credit for the

Carrolls, by paying their bills himself, but the absurd-

ity of the scheme overcame him. The ridiculousness

of his actually feeding this whole family because of his

weakness in giving credit when not another merchant

in the town would do so struck him forcibly. Yet

what else could he do? He had done a foolish thing

in allowing his thoughts and imaginations which were

not those of a youth, and were susceptible of control

271








<pb n="272"/>
THE DEBTOR

had he made the effort, to dwell upon this girl, who

had never even thought of him in the same light. It

was romance gone mad. He, an older man who had

passed beyond the period when dreams are a part of

the physical growth, and unrestrainable, had indulged

himself in dreams, and now he must pay in foolish

realities. He thought uneasily what a laughing-stock

he would become if by any means the fact of his con-

tinued credit to this non-paying family were to become

known, and he saw no earthly reason why it should

not become known. However, no one could possibly

suspect the reason for his unbusiness-like credulity. It

was simply impossible that it should enter into any

one's head to suspect him of a passion for that little

Carroll girl, as they would express her. If he had been

extending sentimental credit to the Egglestons, people

might have been quick to discover the reason in a

lurking and extremely suitable affection for one of

them, but this was out of the question.

However, Anderson had not a very long time for his

reflections, for Eddy Carroll was back, beaming. "Yes,

Amy says I can come," he announced.

"That is good," Anderson replied, hospitably, but he

eyed him sharply. "You went very quickly," said he.

"Got a ride on the ice wagon," said he. "The ice-

man is a good feller. I asked him why he had stopped

bringing us ice, and he said if he was running the busi-

ness, instead of jest carting for the boss, he'd give us

all the ice we wanted for nothing. He was going up

past our house, and when we got there he gave me a

big chunk of ice, and I went and got Marie, and we

lugged it into the kitchen together. Lucky Aunt Anna

or Charlotte didn't see me."

"Why?" asked Anderson.

"Oh, nothing, only they wouldn't have let me take

it. Say, Marie was crying. Her eyes looked as red as

272








<pb n="273"/>
THE DEBTOR

a rabbit's. I asked her what the matter was, and she

said she hadn't been paid her wages. Say, isn't it too

bad everybody makes such a fuss about being paid. It

worries Aunt Anna and Charlotte awfully. Women are

dreadful worriers, ain't they?"

"Perhaps they are," replied Anderson, and got out a

book with colored plates of South American butterflies.

" I think you will like to look at these pictures," said he.

"I have some letters to write."

"All right," said Eddy, and spread his little knees to

form a place for the big book. "I am glad I wasn't a

girl," he said, in pursuance of his train of thought.

"Golly, what a whopper butterfly!"

"Yes, that is a big fellow," said Anderson.

"I caught one once twice as big as that in a place

where we used to live."

"Don't talk any more, son," said Anderson.

"All right," returned Eddy, generously, and turned

the pages in silence.

It was nearly noon when Sam Riggs came to the office

door to announce Charlotte; but she followed closely be-

hind, and saw her brother over the butterfly-book. She

was so surprised that she scarcely greeted Anderson.

"Why, Eddy Carroll, you here?" said she.

'Yes, Charlotte," replied Eddy, with a curious meek-

ness.

"How long have you been here, dear?"

" Oh, quite a while. Charlotte. Mr. Anderson has given

me this beautiful book to look at. It's full of butterflies."

"That is very kind," said Charlotte. "You must be

very careful."

"Yes, I am," replied Eddy. "I ate up the candy

before I touched it. Mr. Anderson gave me some bully

candy, Charlotte."

"That was kind," Charlotte replied, smiling a little

uneasily, Anderson thought.

273

Then she turned to him. She had been all the time

fumbling with a dainty little green purse, and Anderson

saw, with a comical dismay, a check appear. She held

it fluttering between a rosy thumb and finger in his

direction. "Mr. Anderson, I brought in this check,"

she began, a little hesitatingly, "and-"

"You would like it cashed?" asked Anderson.

"No, not this time," said she. "Papa left it this

morning for my mother, and I- Mr. Anderson, I know

we are owing you, and this is a check for twenty-five

dollars, and I should like to pay it to you for your bill."

At the last Charlotte's hesitation vanished. She spoke

with pride and dignity. In reality the child felt that

she was doing a meritorious and noble thing. She was

taking money which had been left to spend, to pay a

bill. Moreover, she had not the slightest idea that the

twenty-five dollars did not discharge the whole of the

indebtedness to Anderson. She had quite a little dis-

pute with her mother to obtain possession of it for that

purpose.

"I think you are very foolish, dear," Mrs. Carroll had

said. "You might get Mr. Anderson to cash it, and

then go to New York and get yourself a new hat. You

really need a new hat, Charlotte."

"I would rather pay that bill," Charlotte replied.

" But I don't see why, dear. It would really be much

wiser to pay the butcher's bill, and then we could have

some meat for dinner. All we have is eggs. Don't you

think Charlotte is very foolish, Anna?"

"I have nothing to say," replied Anna Carroll.

"Why not, Anna? You act very singularly lately,

dear."

"I want Charlotte to do as she thinks best, and as

you think best, Amy," replied Anna Carroll, who was

looking unusually worn, in fact ill, that morning.

"I think Charlotte had much better get the check

274








<pb n="275"/>
THE DEBTOR

cashed and go to New York and buy herself a new hat,"

said Mrs. Carroll.

"No, I don't need a new hat," said Charlotte, and it

ended in her going with the check to Anderson to pay

his bill.

In spite of his annoyance, the utter absurdity of the

whole thing was too much for Anderson. He had little

doubt that the check was no more valuable than its

predecessors, and now in addition this was supposed to

liquidate a bill of several times the amount which it

was supposed to represent. But his mind was quickly

made up. Rather than have brought a cloud over the

happy, proud face of that girl, he would have sacrificed

much more. He cast a glance around. Luckily Price,

the elder clerk, was engaged in the front of the store,

and Riggs was assisting the man who delivered the

goods to carry some parcels to the wagon. Therefore

no one witnessed this folly.

"Thank you, Miss Carroll," he said, pleasantly, and

took the check from the hand which trembled a little.

Charlotte was pale that morning. It was quite true

that she had not sufficient nourishing food for several

days. But she was very proud and happy now, and

she looked at Anderson as he received the check with a

different expression from any which her face had hither-

to worn for him. In fact, for the first time, although

she was in reality simple and humble enough, she real-

ized him on a footing with herself. And she could not

have told what had led to this reversion of her feelings,

nor would it have been easy for any one to have told.

The forces which stir human emotions to one or another

end are as mysterious often as are the sources of the

winds which blow as they list. The check was indorsed by

Anna Carroll, to whom it had been made payable. She

had taken it from her brother that morning with a fierce

nip of thumb and finger, as if she were a mind to tear

275








<pb n="276"/>
THE DEBTOR

it in two. She had no idea that it was of any value,

but, in fact, at the moment of her receiving it the money

was in the bank. Before Anderson had sent it in the

account was again overdrawn. Arthur Carroll was get-

ting in exceedingly deep waters, to which his previous

ventures had been as shallows.

Charlotte smiled at Anderson as he took the check.

She did not think of a receipt, and Anderson did not carry

the matter to the farcial extent of giving her one. He

put the check in his pocket-book and inquired whether

she had any orders to give, and she did order some crack-

ers, cheese, and eggs, which he called to Riggs to carry

to the delivery wagon.

After that was settled, Charlotte turned again to

Eddy. "When are you coming home, dear?" said

she.

"Pretty soon," replied Eddy, with an uneasy hitch.

Anderson, who had had his suspicions, spoke. "I

have invited your brother to dine with me, and he has

been home to ask permission, he tells me," said Ander-

son, and Eddy cast a bitterly reproachful glance at him,

as if he had been betrayed by an accomplice.

"Did you go home to ask permission, Eddy?" asked

Charlotte, gravely.

Eddy nodded and hitched.

"Whom did you ask?"

Eddy hesitated. He was casting about in his mind

for the lie likely to succeed.

"Whom?" repeated Charlotte.

"Amy."

"Amy just asked me if I knew where you were," said

Charlotte, pitilessly.

Eddy looked intently at his butterfly-book. "This

is a whopper," said he.

"Come, Eddy," said Charlotte.

"This is the biggest one of all," said Eddy.

276








<pb n="277"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Eddy," said Charlotte.

Eddy looked up. "I'm going to dinner with Mr.

Anderson," said he.

"Aunt Anna said I might."

"You said Amy said you might," said Charlotte.

"Eddy Carroll, don't you say another word. Come

right home with me."

Then suddenly the boy broke down. All his bravado

vanished. He looked from her to Anderson and back

again with a white, convulsed little face. Eddy was a

slight little fellow, and his poor shoulders in their linen

blouse heaved. Then he wept like a baby.

"I-want to-go," he wailed. "Charlotte, I want

to-g-o. He is going to have-roast beef for dinner,

and I-am hungry."

Charlotte turned whiter than Eddy. She marched up

to her brother. She did not look at Anderson. "Beg-

ging!" said she. "Begging! What if you are hungry?

What of it? What is that? Hunger is nothing. And

then you have no reason to be hungry. There is plenty

in the house to eat-plenty!" She glanced with angry

pride at Anderson, as if he were to blame for having

heard all this. "Plenty!" she repeated, defiantly.

"Plenty of old cake left over from Ina's wedding, and

dry old crackers, and not enough eggs to go round,"

returned Eddy. "I am hungry. I am, Charlotte.

All I have had since yesterday noon is five crackers

and three pickles and one egg and a piece of chocolate

cake as hard as a brick, besides one little, round, dry cake

with one almond on top in the middle. I'm real hungry,

Charlotte. Please let me go!"

Anderson quietly went out of the office. He passed

through the store door, and stood there when presently

Charlotte and Eddy passed him.

"Good-morning," said Charlotte, in a choked voice.

Eddy looked at him and sniffled, then he flung out,

277








<pb n="278"/>
THE DEBTOR

angrily, "What you going to take to our house?" he

demanded of the consumptive man gathering up the

reins of the delivery-wagon.

"Hush!" said Charlotte.

"I won't hush," said Eddy. "I'm hungry. What

are you taking up to our house? Say!"

" Some crackers and cheese and eggs," replied the man,

wonderingly.

"Crackers and cheese and old store eggs!" cried Eddy,

with a howl of woe, and Charlotte dragged him forcibly

away.

"What ails that kid?" Riggs asked of the man in the

wagon.

"I believe them folks are half starved," replied the

man.

Riggs glanced cautiously around, but Anderson had

returned to his office. "I don't believe anybody in

town but us trusts 'em," said he, in a whisper.

"Well, I'm sorry for his folks, but he'd ought to be

strung up," said the man. "Why in thunder don't he

go to work. I guess if he was coughin' as bad as I be at

night, an' had to work, he might know a little something

about it. I ain't in debt, though, not a dollar."

CHAPTER XXIII

WHEN a strong normal character which has conscious-

ly made wrong moves, averse to the established order of

things, and so become a force of negation, comes into

contact with weaker or undeveloped natures, it some-

times produces in them an actual change of moral fibre,

and they become abnormal. Instead of a right quan-

tity on the wrong track, they are a wrong quantity, and

exactly in accordance with their environments. In the

case of the Carroll family, Arthur Carroll, who was in

himself of a perfect and unassailable balance as to the

right estimate of things, and the weighing of cause and

effect, who had never in his whole life taken a step

blindfold by any imperfection of spiritual vision, who

had never for his own solace lost his own sense of re-

sponsibility for his lapses, had made his family, in a

great measure, irresponsible for the same faults. Ex-

cept in the possible case of Charlotte, all of them had a

certain measure of perverted moral sense in the direc-

tion in which Carroll had consciously and unpervertedly

failed. Anna Carroll, it is true, had her eyes more or

less open, and she had much strength of character; still

it was a feminine strength, and even she did not look at

affairs as she might have done had she not been under

the influence of her brother for years. While she at

times waxed bitter over the state of affairs, it was more

because of the constant irritation to her own pride, and

her impatience at the restraints of an alien and dishonest

existence, than from any moral scruples. Even Char-

19                 279








<pb n="280"/>
THE DEBTOR

lotte herself was scarcely clear-visioned concerning the

family taint. The word debt had not to her its full

meaning; the inalienable rights of others faded her

comprehension when measured beside her own right of

existence and of the comforts and delights of existence.

Even to her a new hat or a comfortable meal was some-

thing of more importance than the need of the vender

thereof for reimbursement. The value to herself was

the first value, her birthright, indeed, which if others

held they must needs yield up to her without money and

without price, if her purse happened to be empty. Her

compunction and sudden awakening of responsibility

in the case of Randolph Anderson were due to an entirely

different influence from any which had hitherto come

into her life. Charlotte, although she was past the very

first of young girlhood, being twenty, was curiously un-

developed emotionally. She had never had any lovers,

and the fault had been her own, from a strange persist-

ence of childhood in her temperament. She had not

attracted, from her own utter lack of responsiveness.

She was like an instrument which will not respond to the

touch on certain notes, and presently the player wearies.

She was a girl of strong and jealous affections, but

the electric circuits in her nature were not yet estab-

lished. Then, also, she had not been a child who had

made herself the heroine of her own dreams, and that

had hindered her emotional development.

"Charlotte," one of her school-mates, had asked her

once, "do you ever amuse yourself by imagining that

you have a lover?"

Charlotte had stared at the girl, a beautiful, early

matured, innocently shameless creature. "No," said

she. "I don't understand what you mean, Rosamond."

"The next moonlight night," said the girl, "imagine

that you have a lover."

"What if I did?"

280








<pb n="281"/>
THE DEBTOR

"It would make you very happy, almost as happy as

if you had a real one," said the girl, who was only a

child in years, though, on account of her size, she had

been put into long dresses. She had far outstripped the

boys of her own age, who were rather shy of her.

Charlotte, who was still in short dresses, looked at her,

full of scorn and a mysterious shame. "I don't want

any lover at all," declared she. "I don't want an

imaginary one, or a real one, either. I've got my papa,

and that's all I want." At that time Charlotte still

clung to her doll, and the doll was in her mind, but she

did not say doll to the other girl.

"Well, I don't care," said the other girl, defiantly.

"You will sometime."

"I sha'n't, either," declared Charlotte. "I never

shall be so silly, Rosamond Lane."

"You will, too."

"I never will. You needn't think because you are

so awful silly everybody else is."

"I ain't any sillier than anybody else, and you'll be

just as silly yourself, so now," said Rosamond.

After that, when Charlotte saw the child sitting sunk-

en in a reverie with the color deepening on her cheeks,

her lips pouting, and her eyes misty, she would pass in-

dignantly. She remembered her in after years with

contempt. She spoke of her to Ina as the silliest girl

she had ever known.

Now the child's words of prophecy, spoken from the

oldest reasoning in the world, that of established se-

quence and precedent, did not recur to Charlotte, but

she was fulfilling them.

Ina's marriage and perhaps the natural principle of

growth had brought about a change in her. Charlotte

had sat by herself and thought a good deal after Ina

had gone, and naturally she thought of the possibility

of her own marriage. Ina had married; of course she

281








<pb n="282"/>
THE DEBTOR

might. But her emotions were very much in abeyance

to her affections, and the conditions came before the

dreams were possible.

"I shall never marry anybody who will take me far

away from papa!" said Charlotte. "Perhaps I shall be

less of a burden to poor papa if I am married, but I shall

never go far away."

It followed in Charlotte's reasoning that it must be

a man in Banbridge. There had been no talk of their

leaving the place. Of course she knew that their stay

in one locality was usually short, but here they were

now, and it must be a man in Banbridge. She thought

of a number of the crudely harmless young men of the

village; there were one or two not so crude, but not so

harmless, who held her thoughts a little longer, but she

decided that she did not want any of them, even if

they should want her. Then again the face of Randolph

Anderson flashed out before her eyes as it had done be-

fore. Charlotte, with her inborn convictions, laughed

at herself, but the face remained.

"There isn't another man in this town to compare

with him," she said to herself, "and he is a gentleman,

too." Then she fell to remembering every word he

had ever said to her, and all the expressions his face

had ever taken on with regard to her, and she found

that she could recall them all. Then she reflected how

he had trusted them, and had never failed to fill their

orders, when all the other tradesmen in Banbridge had

refused, and that they must be owing him.

"I shouldn't wonder if we were owing him nearly

twenty-five dollars," Charlotte said to herself, and for

the first time a thrill of shame and remorse at the con-

sideration of debt was over her. She had heard his

story. "There he had to give up his law practice be-

cause he could not make a living, and go into the gro-

cery business, and here we are taking his goods and

282








<pb n="283"/>
THE DEBTOR

not paying him," thought she. "It is too bad." A

feeling of indignation at herself and her family, and of

pity for Anderson came over her. She made up her

mind that she would ask her father for money to pay

that bill at least.  "The butcher can wait, and so

can all the others," she thought, "but Mr. Anderson

ought to be paid."  Besides the pity came a faint real-

ization of the other side of the creditor's point of

view. "Mr. Anderson must look down upon us for

taking his property and not paying our bills," she

thought. She knew that some of the wedding bills had

been paid, and that led her to think that her father

might have more money than usual, but she overheard

some conversation which passed between Carroll and his

sister on the morning when he gave her the check.

"Now about that?" Anna had asked, evidently refer-

ring to some bill.

" I tell you I can't, Anna," Carroll replied. " I used the

money as it came on those bills for the wedding. There

is very little left." Then he had hurriedly scrawled

the check, which she took in spite of her incredulous-

ness of its worth. Therefore Charlotte, when the check

had been offered her for a new hat, for Anna had care-

lessly passed it over to her sister - in - law, had eagerly

taken it to pay Anderson.

"I paid the grocery bill," Charlotte told her aunt

when she returned.

Anna was in her own room, engaged in an unusual

task. She was setting things to rights, and hanging her

clothes regularly in her closet, and packing her bureau

drawers. Charlotte looked at her in astonishment after

she had made the statement concerning the grocery bill.

"What are you doing, Anna?" said she.

Anna looked up from a snarl of lace and ribbons and

gloves in a bureau drawer. "I am putting things in

order," said she.

283








<pb n="284"/>

Then Mrs. Carroll crossed the hall from her opposite

room, and entered, trailing a soft, pink, China-silk dress-

ing-gown. She sank into a chair with a swirl of lace

ruffles and viewed her sister-in-law with a comical air

of childish dismay. "Don't you feel well, Anna, dear?"

asked she.

"Yes. Why?" replied Anna Carroll, folding a yard

of blue ribbon.

"Nothing, only I have always heard that if a person

does something she has never done before, something

at variance with her character, it is a very bad sign,

and I never knew you to put things in order before,

Anna, dear."

"Order is not at variance with my character,.' said

Anna. "It is one of my fundamental principles."

"You never carried it out," said Mrs. Carroll. "You

know you never did, Anna. Your bureau drawers have

always looked like a sort of chaos of civilization, just

like mine. You know you never carried out the principle,

Anna, dear."

"A principle ceases to be one when it is carried out,"

said Anna.

"Then you don't think you are going to die because

you are folding that ribbon, honey?"

Anna took up some yellow ribbon. "There is much

more need to worry about Charlotte," said she, in the

slightly bitter, sarcastic tone which had grown upon her

lately.

Mrs. Carroll looked at Charlotte, who had removed

her hat and was pinning up her hair at a little glass in

a Florentine frame which hung between the windows.

The girl's face, reflected in the glass, flushed softly, and

was seen like a blushing picture in the fanciful frame,

although she did not turn her head, and made no re-

joinder to her aunt's remark.

"What has Charlotte been doing?" asked Mrs. Carroll.

284

"She has been doing the last thing which any Carroll

in his or her senses is ever supposed to do," replied

Anna, in the same tone, as she folded her yellow ribbon.

"What do you mean, Anna, dear?"

"She has been paying a bill before the credit was

exhausted. That is sheer insanity in a Carroll. If there

is anything in the old/Scotch superstition, she is fey, if

ever anybody was." /

"What bill?" asked Mrs. Carroll.

"Mr. Anderson's," replied Charlotte, faintly, still with-

out turning from the glass which reflected her charming

pink face in its gilt, scrolled frame.

"Mr. Anderson's?"

"The grocer's bill," said Charlotte.

"Oh! I did not know what his name was," said

Mrs. Carroll.

"He probably is well acquainted with ours, on his

books," said Anna.

Mrs. Carroll looked in a puzzled way from her to

Charlotte, who had turned with a little air of defiance.

"Had he refused to let us have any more groceries?"

said she.

"No," said Charlotte.

"I told you he had not," said Anna, shaking out a

lace handkerchief, which diffused an odor of violet

through the room.

"Then why did you pay him, honey?" asked Mrs.

Carroll, wonderingly, of Charlotte.

"I paid him just because he had trusted us," said

she, in a voice which rang out clearly with the brave

honesty of youth.

Suddenly she looked from her mother to her aunt

with accusing eyes. "I don't believe it is right to go

on forever buying things and never paying for them,

just because a gentleman is kind enough to let you,"

said she.

285








<pb n="286"/>

"I thought you said it was the grocer, Charlotte,

honey," said Mrs. Carroll, helplessly.

"He is a gentleman, if he is a grocer," said Charlotte,

and her cheek blazed.

Anna Carroll looked sharply at her from her drawer,

then went on folding the handkerchief.

"He is a lawyer, and as well - educated as papa,"

Charlotte said, further, in her clear, brave voice, and

she returned her aunt's look unflinchingly, although

her cheeks continued to blush.

Mrs. Carroll still looked bewildered. "How much

did you pay him, Charlotte, dear?" she asked.

"Twenty-five dollars."

"The whole of the check Arthur gave you?"

"Yes, Amy."

"But you might have bought yourself a hat, honey,

and you did need one. I can't quite understand why

you paid the grocer, when he had not refused to let us

have more groceries, and you might have bought a

hat."

Anna, packing the drawer, began to laugh, and Char-

lotte, after frowning a second, laughed also.

"My hat with the roses looks very nice yet, Amy,

dear," said she, sweetly and consolingly.

"But it is getting so late for roses," Mrs. Carroll re-

turned.

"The milliner in New York where Ina got her hats

has been paid; maybe she will trust Charlotte for a hat.

Don't worry, Amy," said Anna, coolly.

Mrs. Carroll brightened up. "Sure enough, Anna,"

said she. "She was paid because she wouldn't trust

us, and maybe now she will be willing to again. I will

go in to-morrow, and I think I can get a hat for my-

self."

"I saw the dress-maker looking out of the window,"

said Charlotte.

286








<pb n="287"/>
THE DEBTOR

"She did very well," said Mrs. Carroll.

"I suppose there is no money to pay her?" said

Charlotte.

"No, honey, I suppose not, but dear Ina has the

dresses and you have your new one."

"That makes mejfink. I think her bill is on the

table. It came two or three days ago. I haven't

opened it, because it looked like a bill. Eddy brought

it in when I was in here. Yes, there it is." Charlotte,

near the table, took up the envelope and opened it. " It

is only one hundred and fifty-eight dollars," said she.

"That is very cheap for so many pretty dresses,"

said Mrs. Carroll, "but I suppose it is all clear profit.

I should think dress-makers would get rich very easily."

That night Charlotte was the last to go to her room-

that is, the last except her father. He was still smok-

ing in the little room on the left of the hall. They had

been playing whist in there; then they ha4 had some

sherry and crackers and olives. Major Arms had sent

out a case of sherry before the wedding, and it was not

all gone. Now Carroll was smoking a last cigar before

retiring, and the others except Charlotte had gone.

She lingered after she had kissed her father good-night.

"Papa," said she, tentatively. She looked very slim

and young in her little white muslin frock, with her

pretty hair braided in her neck.

"Well, sweetheart, what is it?" asked Carroll, with a

tender look of admiration.

Charlotte hesitated. Then she spoke with such de-

sire not to offend that her voice rang harsh. "Papa,"

said she, "do you think-"

"Think what, honey?"

"Do you think you can pay the dress-maker's bill?"

"Pretty soon, dear," said Carroll, his face changing.

"To-morrow?"

"I am afraid not to-morrow, Charlotte."

287








<pb n="288"/>
THE DEBTOR

"She worked very hard over those dresses, and she

bought the things, and it is quite a while. I think she

ought to be paid, papa."

"Pretty soon, dear," said Carroll again.

Charlotte turned without another word and went out

of the room. Her silence and her retreat were full of

innocent condemnation. Carroll smoked, his face set

and tense. Then there was a flutter and Charlotte was

back. She did not speak this time, but she ran to her

father, threw her slight arms, around his neck, and kiss-

ed him, and it was the kiss of love which follows the

judgment of love. Then she was gone again.

Carroll removed his cigar and sat staring straight

ahead for a moment. Then he gave the cigar a fling

into a brass bowl and put his head on his arms on the

table.








<pb n="289"/>
CHAPTER XXIV

CHARLOTTE, before her sister was married, had been

in the habit of taking long walks with her. Now she

went alone.            /

The elder women of the family never walked when

they could avoid doing so. Mrs. Carroll was, in con-

sequence, putting on a soft roundness of flesh like a

baby, and was daily becoming a creature of more curves

and dimples. Anna did not gain flesh, but she moved

more languidly, and her languor of movement was at

curious odds with the subdued eagerness of her eyes.

In these days Anna Carroll was not well; her nerves

were giving way. She slept little and ate little.

"You are losing your appetite, Anna, dear," Mrs.

Carroll said once at the dinner-table.

"A fortunate thing, perhaps," retorted Anna, with

her little, veiled sting of manner, and at that Carroll rose

abruptly and left the table.

"What is the matter, Arthur?" his wife called after

him. "I don't see what ails Arthur lately," she said,

with a soft tone of complaint, when the door had closed

behind him and he had made no response.

Charlotte adored her Aunt Anna, and seldom took

any exception to anything which she said or did, but

then she turned upon her.

"Poor papa is hurt by what Aunt Anna said," she

declared, severely, "and I don't wonder. Here he

cannot afford to buy as much to eat as he would like,

and hasn't enough to pay the butcher, and Aunt Anna

289








<pb n="290"/>
THE DEBTOR

says things like that. I don't wonder he is hurt. It

is cruel." Tears flashed into Charlotte's eyes. She

looked accusingly at her aunt, who laughed.

"I think as much of your father as you do," said she,

"and I know him better. Don't fret, honey."

"Your aunt is ill, dear," said Mrs. Carroll, who always

veered to the side of the attacked party, and who, more-

over, seldom grasped sarcasm, "and besides, sweet-

heart," she added, "I don't see what she said that could

have hurt Arthur's feelings." Just then Carroll passed

the window towards the stable. "There," she cried,

triumphantly, "he is just going around to order the

carriage. He had finished his luncheon. He never did

care much for that kind of pudding. You are making

too much of it, Charlotte, dear."

"No, I am not," said Charlotte, firmly. "Papa did

not like the way Anna spoke; he was hurt. It was

cruel." She got up and left the table also, and a soft

sob was heard as she closed the dining-room door be-

hind her.

"That dear child is so sensitive and nervous, and she

thinks so much of Arthur," Mrs. Carroll said. "Give

me the pudding sauce, Marie."

Eddy, who had been busily eating his pudding, looked

up from his empty plate. "Aunt Anna did mean it

was fortunate she had lost her appetite, because there

wasn't enough to eat," he declared, in his sweet treble.

"You ain't very sharp, Amy. She did mean that, and

that was the reason papa went out. But it was true,

too. There isn't enough to eat. I haven't had near

enough pudding, and it is all gone. The dish is scraped.

There is none left for Marie and Martin, either."

"I want no pudding," said Marie, unexpectedly, from

behind Mrs. Carroll's chair. She spoke with a certain

sullenness, and her eyes were red. She had a large,

worn place in the sleeve of her white shirt-waist, and

290








<pb n="291"/>
THE DEBTOR

she was given to lifting her arm and surveying it with

an air of covert injury and indignation.

"The omelet is all gone, too," said Eddy. "Marie and

Martin haven't got anything to eat."

"Oh, hush, dear!" said Mrs. Carroll. "Marie can

cook another omelet." The Hungarian girl opened her

mouth as if to speak, then she shut it again. An in-

describable expression was on her pretty, peasant face,

the face of a down-trodden race, who yet retained in

spirit a spark of rebellion and resentment. Marie, in

her ragged blouse, with her countenance of inscrutable

silence, standing behind her mistress's chair, surveying

the denuded table, was the embodiment of a folk-lore

song. She had been in America only a year and a half,

and the Lord only knew what she had expected in that

land of promise, and what bright visions had been dis-

pelled, and how roughly she had been forced back upon

her old point of view of the world. The girl was

actually hungry. She had no money; her clothes were

worn. Her naive coquetry of expression had quite

faded from her face. Her cheek-bones showed high,

her mouth was wide and set, her eyes fixed with a sort

of stolid and despairing acquiescence. The salient

points of the Slav were to the surface, the little wings

of her hope and youth folded away. She had fallen in

love, moreover, and been prevented from attending a

wedding-feast where she would have met him that day,

on account of a lack of money for a new waist, and car

fare. She knew another girl who was gay in a new

gown, and at whom the desired one had often looked

with wavering eyes. Her heart was broken as she

stood there. She was one of the weariest of the wheels

within wheels of Arthur Carroll's miserable system of

life.

"I don't believe there are any more eggs to make

an omelet," said Eddy.

29I








<pb n="292"/>
THE DEBTOR

"The grocer still trusts us," said Mrs. Carroll; "be-

sides, he has been paid. Eddy, dear, you must not

speak so to your aunt. Run out, if you have finished

your luncheon, and ask your father when he is going to

drive."

Carroll had not gone, as usual, to the City that day.

Mrs. Carroll and Anna rose from the table and went

into the den on the left of the hall.

"You must not mind the children speaking so, Anna,

dear," Mrs. Carroll said. "They would fly at me just

the same if they thought I had said anything to hurt

Arthur."

" I don't mind, Amy," Anna replied, dully. She threw

herself upon the divan with its Oriental rug, lying flat

on her back, with her hands under her head and her

eyes fixed upon a golden maple bough which waved

past the window opposite. She looked very ill. She

was quite pale, and her eyes had a strange, earnest

depth in dark hollows.

Mrs. Carroll looked a little more serious than was her

wont as she sat in the willow rocker and swayed slowly

back and forth. "I suppose," she said, after a pause,

"that it will end in our moving away from Banbridge."

"I suppose so," Anna replied, listlessly.

"You don't mind going, do you, Anna, dear?"

"I mind nothing," Anna Carroll said. "I am past

minding."

Mrs. Carroll looked at her with a bewildered sym-

pathy. "Why, Anna, dear, what is the matter ?" she said.

"Nothing, Amy."

"You are feeling ill, aren't you?"

"Perhaps so, a little. It is nothing worth talking

about."

"Are you troubled about anything, honey?"

Anna did not reply.

"I can't imagine what you have to trouble you, Anna.

292








<pb n="293"/>
THE DEBTOR

Everything is as it has been for a long time. When we

move away from Banbridge there will be more for a

while. I can't see anything to worry about."

"For God's sake, keep your eyes shut, then, Amy,

as long as you can," cried Anna, suddenly, with a tone

which the other woman had never heard before. She

gazed at her sister-in-law a minute, and her expression

of childish sweetness and contentment changed. Tears

came in her eyes, her mouth quivered.

"I don't know what you mean, Anna," she said,

pitifully, like a puzzled child.

Anna sprang up from the divan and went over to her

and kissed her and laughed. "I mean nothing, dear,"

she said. "There is no more to worry about now than

there has been all along.  People get on somehow.

We are in the world, and we have our right here, and if

we knock over a few people to keep our footholds, I

don't know that we are to blame. It is nothing, Amy.

I have felt wretched for a few days, and it has affected

my spirits. Don't mind anything I have said. We

shall leave Banbridge before long, and, as you say, we

shall get on better."

Mrs. Carroll gave two or three little whimpers on her

sister-in-law's shoulder, then she smiled up at her. "I

guess it is because you don't feel well that you are look-

ing on the dark side of things so," said she. "You will

feel better to go out and have a drive."

"Perhaps I shall," replied Anna.

" We shall go for a long drive. There will be plenty of

time, it is so early. How lovely it would be if we had

our automobile, wouldn't it, Anna? Then we could go

any distance. Wouldn't it be lovely?"

"Very," replied Anna.

Then Eddy burst into the room. "Say, Amy," he

cried, "there's a great circus out in the stable. Papa

and Martin are having a scrap."

293








<pb n="294"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Eddy, dear," cried Mrs. Carroll, "you must not say

scrap."

"A shindy, then. What difference does it make?

Martin he won't harness, because he hasn't been paid.

He just sits on a chair in the door and whittles a stick,

and don't say anything, and he won't harness."

"We have simply got to have an automobile," said

Mrs. Carroll.

"How do you know it is because he hasn't been paid,

Eddy?" asked Anna.

"Because he said so; before he wouldn't say any-

thing, and began whittling. Papa stands there talking

to him, but it don't make any difference."

"With an automobile it wouldn't make any differ-

ence," said Mrs. Carroll. "An automobile doesn't have

to be harnessed. I don't see why Arthur doesn't get

one."

Anna Carroll sat down on the nearest chair and laugh-

ed hysterically.

Mrs. Carroll stared at her. "What are you laughing

at, Anna?" said she, with a little tone of injury. "I

don't see anything very funny. It is a lovely day, and

I wanted to go to drive, and it would do you good. I

don't see why people act so because they are not paid.

I didn't think it of Martin."

"I'll go out and see if he has stirred yet," cried Eddy,

and was off, with a countenance expressive of the keen-

est enjoyment of the situation.

Out in the stable, beside the great door through which

was a view of the early autumn landscape - a cluster

of golden trailing elms, with one rosy maple on a green

lawn intersected by the broad sweep of drive-sat the

man in a chair, and whittled with a face as impertur-

bable as fate. Carroll stood beside him, talking in a low

tone. He was quite pale. Suddenly, just as the boy

arrived, the man spoke.

294








<pb n="295"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Why in thunder, sir," said he, with a certain respect

in spite of the insolence of the words-" why in thunder

don't you haul in, shut up shop, sell out, pay your debts,

and go it small?"

"Perhaps I will," Carroll replied, in a tone of rage.

His face flushed, he raised his right arm as if with an

impulse to strike the other man, then he let it drop.

"Sell the horses, papa?" cried Eddy, at his elbow,

with a tone of dismay.

Carroll turned and saw the boy. "Go into the house;

this is nothing that concerns you," he said, sternly.

"Are the horses paid for, papa?" asked Eddy.

"I believe they ain't," said/the man in the chair, with

a curious ruminating impudence. Carroll towered over

him with an expression of ignoble majesty. But Eddy

had made a dart into a stall, and the tramp of iron

hoofs was suddenly heard.

"I can harness as well as he can," a small voice

cried.

Then Martin rose. "I'll harness," he said, sullenly.

"You'll get hurt"--to the boy. "She don't like chil-

dren round her." He took hold of the boy's small

shoulders and pushed him away from the restive horse,

and grasped the bridle. Carroll strode out of the stable.

"Say," said Eddy, to the man.

"'Well, what? I've got to have my pay. I've work-

ed here long enough for nothin'."

"When I'm a man I'll pay you," said Eddy, with

dignity and severity. "You must not speak to papa

that way again, Martin."

Martin looked from the tall horse to the small boy,

and began to laugh.

" I'll pay you with interest," repeated the boy, and the

man laughed again.

"Much obleeged," said he.

"I don't see, now, why you need to worry just be-

20                295








<pb n="296"/>
THE DEBTOR

cause papa hasn't paid you," said Eddy, and walked

out of the stable with a gait exactly like his father.

The man threw the harness over the horse and

whistled.

" He's harnessing," Eddy proclaimed when he went in.

His mother was pinning on her veil before the mirror

over the hall settle. Anna was just coming down-stairs

in a long, red coat, with a black feather curling against

her black hair under her hat.

"Where is Charlotte?" asked Mrs. Carroll.

"She has gone off to walk," said Eddy.

"Well," said Mrs. Carroll, "you must go after her

and walk with'her, Eddy."

"I don't want to, Amy," said Eddy. "I want to

go to drive."

Then Carroll came down-stairs and repeated his wife's

orders. "Yes, Eddy, you must go to walk with your

sister. I don't wish her to go alone," said he peremp-

torily. He still looked pale; he had grown thin during

the last month.

"I don't see why Charlotte don't get married, too,

and have her husband to go with her," said Eddy, as

he went out of the door. "Tagging round after a girl

all the time! It ain't fair."

"Eddy!" called Carroll, in a stern voice; but the boy

had suddenly accelerated his pace with his last words,

and was a flying streak at the end of the drive.

"Where 'm I goin' to find her?" he complained to

himself. He hung about a little until he saw the car-

riage emerge from the grounds and turn in the other

direction, then he went straight down to the main

street. Just as he turned the corner he met a small

woman, carefully dressed and frizzed, who stopped him.

"Is your mother at home, little boy?" she asked, in

a nervous voice. There were red spots on her thin

cheeks; she was manifestly trembling.

296








<pb n="297"/>
THE DEBTOR

The boy eyed her with a supercilious scorn and pity.

He characterized her in his own mind of extreme youth

and brutal truth as an ugly old woman, and yet he

noted the trembling and felt like reassuring her. He

took off his little cap. "No, ma'am," said he. "Amy

has gone to drive."

"I wanted to see your mother," said the woman,

wonderingly.

"Amy is my mother," replied the boy.

"Oh!" said the woman

"They have all gone,"/said Eddy.

"Then I shall have c call another time," said the

woman, with a mixture of ingratiation and despair.

The boy eyed her sharply. "Say," he said, "are

you the dressmaker that made my sister Ina's clothes

for her to be married?"

"Yes, I be," replied Madame Griggs.

"Then," said Eddy, "I can tell you one thing, "there

isn't any use for you to go to my house now to get any

money. I suppose you haven't been paid."

"No, I haven't," said Madame Griggs. Then she

loosened the flood-gates of her grievance upon the boy.

"No, I haven't been paid," said she, "and I've worked

like a dog, and I'm owing for the things I bought in

New York, and I'm owing my girls, and if I don't get

paid before long, I'm ruined, and that's all there is to

it. I 'ain't been paid, and it's a month since your sister

was married, and they'll send out to collect the bills

from the stores, if I don't pay them. It's a cruel thing,

and I don't care if I do say it." The woman was

flouncing along the street beside the boy, and she spoke

in a loud, shrill voice. "It's a cruel thing," she re-

peated. "If I couldn't pay for my wedding fix I'd

never get married, before I'd go and cheat a poor dress-

maker. She'd ought to be ashamed of herself, and so

had all your folks. I don't care if I do sty it. They

297








<pb n="298"/>
THE DEBTOR

are nuthin' but a pack of swindlers, that's what they

be."

Suddenly the boy danced in front of the furious lit-

tle woman, and stood there, barring her progress.

"They ain't!" said he.

"They be."

"They ain't! You can't pay folks if you 'ain't got

any money."

"You needn't have the things, then," sniffed Madame

Griggs.

"My sister had to have the things to get married,

didn't she? A girl can't get married without the

clothes."

"Let her pay for 'em, then."

"I'll tell you what to do!" cried Eddy, looking at her

with a sudden inspiration. "You are in debt, ain't

you ?"

"Yes, I be," replied Madame Griggs, hopping ner-

vously along by the boy's side, poor little dressmaker,

aping French gentility, holding her skirts high, with a

disclosure of a papery silk petticoat and a meagre ankle.

Even in her distress she felt of her frizzes to see if they

were in order after a breeze had struck her in the sharp,

eager face. "Yes, I be."

" Well," said the boy, delightedly, "I can tell you just

what to do, you know."

"What, I'd like to know?" Madame Griggs said, in a

snapping tone.

"Move away from Banbridge," said the boy.

"What for, I'd like to know?"

"Why, then, don't you see," explained Eddy Carroll,

"you would get away from the folks that you owe, and

other folks that you didn't owe would trust you for

things. You'd get along fine. That's the way we al-

ways do."

"Well, I neverl" said Madame Griggs. Then she

298








<pb n="299"/>
THE DEBTOR

turned on him with sudden fury. "So that's what your

folks are goin' to do, be they?" said she. "Go off and

leave me without payin' my bill! That's the dodge, is

it?"

Eddy was immediately on the alert. He was young

and innocent, but he had a certain sharpness. He was

quite well aware that a knowledge on the part of the

creditors of his family's fittings was not desirable. "I

'ain't heard them say a word about moving away from

Banbridge," declared he. "What you getting so mad

about, Missis?"

"I guess I've got some reason to be mad, if that's

your folks' game. The way I've worked, slavin' all

them hot days and nights on your sister's wedding fix.

I guess-"

"We ain't going to move away from Banbridge as

long as we live, for all I know," said Eddy, looking at

the bundle of feminine nerves beside him with a mixt-

ure of terror and scorn. "You don't need to holler so,

Missis."

"I don't care how loud I holler, I can tell you that."

"We ain't going to move; and if we did, I don't see

why you couldn't. I was just telling you what you

could do, if you owed folks and didn't have any money

to pay 'em, and you turn on a feller that way. I'm

going to tell my sister and mother, and they won't have

you make any more dresses for 'em." With that Eddy

Carroll made a dart into Anderson's grocery store,

which he had reached by that time. The dressmaker

remained standing on the sidewalk, staring after him.

She looked breathless; red spots were on her thin cheeks.

Eddy went straight through the store to the office.

The door stood open, and the little place was empty

except for the cat, which cast a lazy glance at him from

under a half-closed lid, stretched, displaying his claws,

and began to purr loudly. Eddy went over to the cat

299








<pb n="300"/>
THE DEBTOR

and took him up in his arms and carried him out into

the main store, where William Price stood behind the

counter. He was alone in the store.

"Say," said Eddy, "where's Mr. Anderson?"

"He's gone out," replied the clerk, with a kind look

at the boy. He had lost one of his own years ago, and

Eddy, in spite of his innocent superciliousness, appealed

to him.

" Where ?" asked Eddy. The cat wriggled in his arms

and jumped down. Then he rolled over ingratiatingly

at his feet. Eddy stooped down and rubbed the shining,

furry stomach.

"He took the net he catches butterflies with," re-

plied the old clerk, "and I guess he's gone to walk in

the fields somewhere."

"I should think it was pretty late for butterflies,"

said Eddy. He straightened himself and looked very

hard at the glass jar of molasses-balls on the shelf be-

hind the clerk.

"There might be a stray one," said William Price.

"It's a warm day."

"Shucks!" said Eddy. "Say, how much are those a

pound ?"

The clerk glanced around at the jar of molasses-balls.

"Twenty-five cents," replied he.

"Guess I'll take a pound," said Eddy. "I 'ain't got

any money with me, but I'll pay you the next time I

come in."

The old clerk's common face turned suddenly grave,

and acquired thereby a certain distinction. He turned

about, took off the cover of the glass jar, and gath-

ered up a handful of the molasses-balls and put them in

a little paper bag. Then he came forth from behind

the counter and approached the boy. He thrust the

paper bag into a little grasping hand, then he took hold

of the small shoulders and looked down at him steadily.

The blue eyes in the ordinary face of an ordinary man,

unfitted for any work in life except that of an underling,

were full of affection and reproof. Eddy looked into

them, then he hitched uneasily.

"What you doing so for?" said he; then he looked

into the eyes again and was still.

"It's jest this," said William Price. "Here's a little

bag of them molasses-balls, I'll give 'em to ye; but

don't you never, as long as you live, buy anything you

'ain't either got the money to pay for in your fist, ready,

or know jest where it's comin' from. It's stealin', and

it's the wust kind of stealin', 'cause it ain't out an' out.

I had a boy once about your size."

"Where's he now?" asked Eddy, in a half-resentful,

half-wondering fashion.

"He's dead; died years ago of scarlet-fever, and I'd

a good deal rather have it so, much as I thought of him-

as much as your father thinks of you-than to have

him grow up and steal and cheat folks."

"Didn't he ever take anything that didn't belong to

him?'" asked Eddy.

"Never. I guess he didn't. John wasn't that kind

of a boy. I'd have trusted him with anythin'."

"Then he must have gone to heaven, I suppose,"

said Eddy. He looked soberly into the old clerk's eyes.

"Thank you for the molasses - balls," he said. "I

meant to pay for 'em, but I don't know just when I'd

have the money, so I guess it's better for you to give

them to me. Mr. Anderson won't mind, will he?"

"No, he won't, for I shall put five cents into the cash-

drawer for them," replied the old clerk, with dignity.

"I wouldn't want to have you take anything that

Mr. Anderson wouldn't like," said Eddy.

"I shouldn't," replied the old clerk, going back to his

place behind the counter, as a woman entered the store.

Eddy looked back as he went out, with a very sweet

301








<pb n="302"/>
THE DEBTOR

expression. "The first five-cent piece I get I'll pay

you," he said. He had popped a molasses-ball into

his mouth, and his utterance was somewhat impeded.

"I thank you very much, indeed," he said, "and I'm

sorry your boy died."

"Have you just lost a boy ?" asked the woman at the

counter.

"Twenty years ago," replied the clerk.

"Land!" said the woman. She looked at him, then

she turned and looked after Eddy, who was visible on

the sidewalk talking with Madame Griggs, and her face

showed her mind. Madame Griggs had waited on the

sidewalk until Eddy came out of the store. Now she

seized him by the arm, which he promptly jerked away

from her.

" When will your folks be home? That's what I want

to know!" said she, sharply.

"They'll be home to-night, I guess," replied Eddy.

"Then I'll be up after supper," said Madame Griggs.

"All right," said Eddy.

"You tell 'em I'm comin'. I've got to see your ma

and your pa."

"Yes, ma'am," replied Eddy. He raised his little

cap as the dressmaker flirted away, then he started on

a run down the street, sucking a molasses-ball, which is

a staying sweet, and soon he left the travelled road and

was hastening far afield.

CHAPTER XXV

IT was September, but a very warm day. Charlotte

had walked along the highway for some distance; then

when she came to a considerable grove of oak-trees, she

hesitated a moment, and/finally left the road, entered

the grove, and sat down on a rock at only a little dis-

tance from the road, yet out of sight of it. She was

quite effectually screened by the trees and some under-

growth. Here and there the oaks showed shades of

russet-and-gold and deep crimson; the leaves had not

fallen. In the sunlit spaces between the trees grew

clumps of blue asters. She saw a squirrel sitting quite

motionless on a bough over her head, with bright eyes

of inquisitive fear upon her. She felt a sense of delight,

and withal a slight tinge of loneliness and risk. There

was no doubt that it was not altogether wise, perhaps

not safe, for a girl to leave the highway, or even to walk

.upon it if it were not thickly bordered by dwellings, in

this state. Charlotte was fearless, yet her imagination

was a lively one. She looked about her with keen en-

joyment, yet there was a sharp wariness in her glance

akin to that of the squirrel. When she heard on the

road the rattle of wheels, and caught the flash of revolv-

ing spokes in the sun, she had a sensation of relief.

There was not a house in sight, except far to the left,

where she could just discern the slant of a barn roof

through the trees. Everything was very still. While

there was no wind, it was cool in the shade, though hot

in the sunlight. She pulled her jacket over her shoul-

303








<pb n="304"/>
THE DEBTOR

ders. She leaned against a tree and remained perfectly

quiet. She had on a muslin gown of an indeterminate

green color, and it shaded perfectly into the coloring of

the tree-trunk, which was slightly mossy. Her dark

head, too, was almost indistinguishable against the tree,

which at that height was nearly black. In fact, she

became almost invisible from that most curious system

of concealment in the world, that of assimilation with

nature. She was gathered so closely into the arms

of the great mother that she seemed one with her. And

she was not alone in the shelter of those mighty arms;

there was the squirrel, as indistinguishable as she. And

there was another.

Charlotte with her bright, wary eyes, and the little

animal with his, in the tree, became aware of another

sentient thing besides themselves. Possibly the squir-

rel had been aware of it all the time.

Suddenly the girl looked downward at her right and

saw within a stone's -throw a man asleep.  He was

dressed in an ancient, greenish-brown suit, and was prac-

tically invisible. His arm was thrown over his weather-

beaten face and he was sleeping soundly, lying in a

position as grotesquely distorted as some old tree-root.

He was, in fact, distorted by the storms of life within

and without. He was evidently a tramp, and possibly

worse. His sleeping face could be read like a page of

evil lore.

When Charlotte perceived him she turned pale and

her heart seemed to stop. Her first impulse was to

rise and make a mad rush for the road. Then she be-

came afraid to do that. The road was lonely. She

heard no sound of wheels thereon. It was true that she

had entered the grove and seated herself without awak-

ening the man; he might quite possibly be in a drunk-

en sleep, difficult to disturb, but she might not be so

fortunate a second time. Her slightest motion might

304








<pb n="305"/>
THE DEBTOR

awaken him now. So she sat perfectly still; she did

not move a finger; it seemed to her she did not breathe.

When a slight breeze rustles the tree-boughs over her

head, and ruffled the skirt of her dress, her terror made

her sick. When the breeze struck him, the sleeping tramp

made an uneasy motion, and she felt overwhelmed.

Soon, however, he began to breathe heavily. Before

his breathing had been inaudible. He was evidently

quite soundly asleep, yet if a breeze could disturb him,

what might not her rise and flight do? It seemed to her

that she must remain there forever. But the time would

come when that sleeping terror would awake, whether

she disturbed him or not, when that distorted caricature

of man, as grotesque as a gargoyle on the temple of life,

would stretch those twisted legs and arms, and open

his eyes and see her; and then? She became sure, the

longer she looked, that this was not one of the harmless

wanderers over the earth, one of the Ishmaels, whose

hand is turned only against himself. The great dark,

bloated face had a meaning that could not be mistaken

even by eyes for whom its meaning was written in a

strange language. Innocence read guilt by a strange

insight of heredity which came to her from the old be-

ginning of things. She dared not stir. She felt petri-

fied. She realized that her one hope was in the passing

of some one on the road. She made up her mind that

if -she heard wheels she would risk everything. She

would spring up and run for her life and scream. Then

she wondered how loudly she could scream. Charlotte

was not one of the screaming kind of girls who lifts up

her voice of panic at everything. She tried to remem-

ber if she had ever screamed, and how loudly. She kept

her ears strained for the sound of wheels, her eyes on the

sleeping tramp. She dared not look away from him.

Even the squirrel remained motionless, with his round

eyes of wariness fixed. It was as if he too were afraid

305








<pb n="306"/>
THE DEBTOR

to stir. He retained his attitude of alert grace, sitting

erect on his little haunches, an acorn in his paws, his

bushy tail arching over his back like a plume.

Then slowly the man opened his eyes with a dazed

expression, at first a blur of consciousness. Then grad-

ually the recognition of himself, of his surroundings, of

his life, came into them, and that self-knowledge was

unmistakable. There was no doubt about the man

with his twisted limbs and his twisted soul. He lay

quite still a while longer, staring. Charlotte, with her

eyes upon him, and the squirrel with his eyes upon him,

never stirred. Charlotte heard her heart beat, and

wished for some way to stifle it, but that she could not

do. It seemed to her that the beating of her heart was

like a drum, as if it could be heard through all the grove.

She realized that she could not hear the sound of pass-

ing wheels on the road, because of this terrible beating

of her heart. It seemed inevitable that the man would

hear it. She felt then that she should take her one lit-

tle chance, that she should scream on the possibility of

some one passing on the road, and run, but she realized

the futility of it. Before she could move a step the

man would be upon her. She felt, moreover, paralyzed.

She remained as perfectly motionless as the tree against

which she leaned, with her eyes full of utmost terror and

horror upon the waking man. He still looked straight

ahead, and his eyes were still retrospective, fixed in-

ward rather than outward. He still saw only himself

and his own concerns.

Then he yawned audibly and spoke. "Damn it all!"

he said, in a curious voice, of rather passive rage. It

was the voice of one at variance with all creation, his

hand against every man and every man against him,

and yet the zest of rebellion was not in it. In fact, the

man had been so long at odds with life that a certain

indifference was upon him. He had become sullen.

306








<pb n="307"/>
THE DEBTOR

As he lay there he thrust a hand in his pocket, and

again he spoke his oath against all outside, against all

creation. He had thought absently that he might find

a dime for a drink. Now that he had waked, he was

thirsty, but there was none. Then he yawned, stretched

out his stiff, twisted limbs with a sort of muffled groan,

rested his weight upon one elbow, and shambled up as

awkwardly as a camel. The girl sat still in the clutch

of her awful fear. She no longer heard her heart beat.

She was casting about in her mind for a weapon. A great

impulse of fight was stirring in her. She felt suddenly

that her little fingers were like steel. She felt that she

should kill that man if he touched her. The fear never

let go its clutch on her heart, but a fierceness as of any

wild thing at bay was over her. She realized that in

another minute, when he should see her, she would

gather herself up, and spring, spring as she had read of

a tarantula springing; that she would be first before the

man, that she would kill him. Something which was

almost insanity was firing her brain.

The man, when he had stood up, it seemed to Char-

lotte, looked directly at her. She was always sure that

he did. But if he did, it was with unseeing eyes. His

brain did not compass the image of her sitting there,

leaning against the tree, a creature of incarnate terror

and insane fury. He seemed to keep his eyes fixed

upon her for a full second. Charlotte's nerves and

muscles were tense with the restrained impulse to spring.

Then he slowly shuffled away. As he passed, the squir-

rel slid like swiftness itself down the tree, and across

an open space to another. The girl sank limply upon

herself in a dead faint, and the tramp gained the road

and trudged sullenly on towards Ludbury.

When Charlotte came to herself she was still sitting

there limply. She could not realize all at once what

had happened. Then she remembered. She looked at

307








<pb n="308"/>
THE DEBTOR

the place where the tramp had lain, and so forcibly did

her terrified fancy project images that it was difficult

to convince herself that he was really gone. She seemed

to still see that gross thing lying there. Then she re-

membered distinctly that he had gone.

She got up, but she could scarcely stand. She had

never fainted before, and she wondered at her own

sensations. "What ails me ?" she thought. She strain-

ed her eyes around, but there was no sign of the terrible

man. She was quite sure that he had gone, and yet

how could she be sure? He might have gone out to

the road and be sitting beside it. A vivid recollection

of tramps sitting beside that very road, as she had been

driving past, came over her. She became quite posi-

tive that he was out on the road, and a terror of the

road was over her. She looked behind her, and the

sunny gleam of an open field came through the trees.

The field was shaggy with blue asters and golden-rod

gone to seed, and white tufts of immortelles. Charlotte

stared through the trees at the field, and suddenly a

man crossed the little sunny opening. A great joy swept

over her; he was Randolph Anderson. Now she was

sure that she was safe. She stumbled again to her feet,

and ran weakly out of the oak grove. There was a

low fence between the grove and the field, and when

she reached that she stopped. She felt this to be insur-

mountable for her trembling limbs. "Oh, dear!" she

said, aloud, and although the man was holding his

butterfly-net cautiously over the top of a clump of

asters so far away that it did not seem possible that he

could hear her, he immediately looked up. Then he

hastened towards her. As he drew near a look of

concern deepened on his face. He had had an inkling

at the first glimpse of her that something was wrong.

He reached the fence and stood looking at her on the

other side.

308








<pb n="309"/>
THE DEBTOR

"I am afraid I can't get over," Charlotte said, faintly.

She never knew quite how she was over, lifted in some

fashion, and Anderson stood close to her, looking at her

with his face as white as hers.

"What is it?" he asked. "Are you ill, Miss Carroll?

What is it?"

"I have been frightened," said she. Without quite

knowing what she did, she caught hold of his arm and

clung to him tightly.

" What frightened you?" asked Anderson, fairly trem-

bling himself and looking ,own at her.

"There was a man aslep in the grove, in there," ex-

plained Charlotte, falteringly-she still felt faint and

strange-" and-and-I sat down there, and did not see

him, and then he-he woke up and-"

Anderson seized her arm in a fierce clutch. "What ?"

he cried. "Where is he? What? For God's sakel"

"He went away out in the road and did not seem to

see-me. I sat still," said Charlotte. Then she was

very faint again, for he, too, frightened her a little.

Anderson caught her, supporting her, while he tore

off his coat. Then he half carried her over to a ledge

of rocks cropping out of the furzy gold-and-blue under-

growth, and sat down beside her there. Charlotte sat

weakly where she was placed. She was deadly white

and trembling. Anderson hesitated a moment, then

he put an arm around her, removed her hat, and drew

her head down on his shoulder.

"Now keep quiet a little while until you are better,"

he said. "You are perfectly safe now. You say the

man did not see you?"

Charlotte shook her head against his shoulder. She

closed her eyes; she was really very near a complete

swoon, and scarcely knew where she was or what was

happening; only a vague sense of another will thrust

under her sinking spirit for a support was over her.

309








<pb n="310"/>
THE DEBTOR

As for the man, he looked down at the little, pale face,

with the dark lashes sweeping the soft cheeks, at the

mouth still trembling to a sob of terror and grief, and

a mighty wave of emotion was over him. He realized

that he held in his arms not only the girl whom he loved,

towards whom his whole being went out in protection

and tenderness, but himself, his whole future, even in

some subtle sense his past. He was like one on some

height of the spirit, from which he overlooked all that

was, all that had gone before, and all that would come.

He was on the Delectable Mountain. Within himself

he comprehended the widest vision of earth, that which

is given through love. The man's face, looking at the

woman's on his shoulder, became transfigured. It was

full of uttermost tenderness, of protection as perfect as

that of a father for his child. His heart, as he looked

at her, was at once that of a lover and a father. He

unconsciously held her closer, and bent his face down

over hers softly, as if she had been indeed a child.

"Poor little soul!" he whispered, and his lips almost

touched her cheek.

Then a wave of color came over the girl's face. "I

am better," she said, and raised herself abruptly. An-

derson drew back and removed his arm. He feared

she was offended, and perhaps afraid of him. But she

looked piteously up in his face, and, to his dismay, be-

gan to cry. Her nerves were completely unstrung.

She was not a strong girl, and she had, in fact, been

through a period of mental torture which might have

befitted the Inquisition. She could still see the man's

evil face; her brain seemed stamped with the sight;

terror had mastered her. She was for the time being

scarcely sane. The terrible imagination of ill which

had possessed her, as she sat there gazing at the sleep-

ing terror, still held her in sway. She was not naturally

hysterical, but now hysterics threatened her.

310








<pb n="311"/>
THE DEBTOR

Anderson put his arm around her again and drew her

head to his shoulder. "You must not mind," he said,

in a grave, authoritative voice. "You are ill and

frightened. You must not mind. Keep your head on

my shoulder until you feel better. You are quite safe

now." Anderson's voice was rather admonishing than

caressing. Charlotte sobbed wildly against his shoul-

der, and clung to him with her little, nervous hands.

Anderson sat looking down at her gravely. "Is your

mother at home?" he asked, presently.

"No," sobbed Chalotte; "they have all gone to

drive."

"Nobody in the house?"

"Only Marie."

Anderson reflected. He was much nearer his own

home than hers, and there was a short-cut across the

field; they would not need to strike the road at all. He

rose, with a sudden resolution, and raised the weeping

girl to her feet.

"Come," said he, in the same authoritative voice, and

Charlotte stumbled blindly along, his arm still around

her. She had an under - consciousness that she was

ashamed of herself for showing so little bravery, that

she wondered what this man would think of her, but

her self-control was gone, because of the too tense strain

which had been put upon it. It was like a spring too

tightly compressed, suddenly released; the vibrations of

her nerves seemed endless. She tried to hush her sobs

as she was hurried along, and succeeded in some meas-

ure, but she was still utterly incapable of her usual

mental balance. Once she started, and clutched An-

derson's arm with a gasp of fear.

"Look, look!" she whispered.

"What is it?" he asked, soothingly.

"The man is there. See him?"

"There is nothing there, child," he said, and hurried

2a                 311








<pb n="312"/>
THE DEBTOR

et over the place where her distorted vision had seen

again the object of her terror, in his twisted sleep in the

grass.

Anderson began to be seriously alarmed about the

girl. He did not know what consequences might come

from such a severe mental strain upon such a nervous

temperament. He hurried as fast as he dared, almost

carrying her at times, and finally they emerged upon

the garden at the right of his own house. The flowers

were thinning out fast, but the place was still gay with

marigolds and other late blossoms. As he passed the

kitchen door he was aware of the maid's gaping face of

stupid surprise, and he called out curtly to her: "Is my

mother in the house?"

"Yes, sir. She's in the sitting-room," replied the

maid, with round eyes of curiosity upon the'pair.

Charlotte was making a desperate effort to walk by

herself, to recover herself, but Anderson was still al-

most carrying her bodily. She wondered dimly at the

strange trembling of her limbs, at the way the bright

orange and red of the marigolds and nasturtiums swam

before her eyes, and once again she saw quite distinctly

the evil face of the man peer out at her from among

them; but this time she said nothing, for her subcon-

sciousness of delusion was growing stronger.

AndersQn went around to the front of the house, and

his mother's wondering face gazed from a window, then

quickly disappeared. When he reached the door she

was there, filling it up with her large figure in its volu-

minous white draperies.

"What-" she began, but Randolph interrupted her.

"Mother, this is Miss Carroll," he said. "She is not

hurt, but she has had a terrible fright and shock. Her

people are all away from home, and I brought her here;

it was nearer. I want her to have some wine, and rest,

and get over it before she goes home."

312








<pb n="313"/>
THE DEBTOR

Mrs. Anderson hesitated one second. It was a pause

for the gathering together of wits suddenly summoned

for new and surprising emergencies; then she rose to the

occasion. She had her faults and her weaknesses, but

she was one of the women in whom the maternal in-

stinct is a power, and this girl appealed to it. She

stretched forth her white-clad arms, and she drew her

away almost forcibly from her son.

"You poor child!" said she, in a voice which harked

back to her son's babyhood. "Come right in. You go

and get a glass of that port-wine," said she to Randolph,

and she gave him a little push. She enveloped and per-

vaded the girl in a voluminous embrace.

Charlotte felt the soft panting of a mother's bosom

under her head as she was led into the house. "You

poor, blessed child," a soft voice cooed in her ear, a

soft voice and ye' a voice of strength. Charlotte's own

mother had never been in the fullest sense a mother to

her; a large part of the spiritual element of maternity

had been lacking; but here was a woman who could

mother a race, if once her heart of maternal love was

awakened.

Charlotte was not led; that did not seem to be the

action. She felt as if she were borne along by sustain-

ing wings spread under her weakness into a large, cool

bedroom opening out of the sitting-room. Then her

dress was taken off, in what wise she scarcely knew;

she was enrobed in one of Mrs. Anderson's large, white

wrappers, and was laid tenderly in a white bed, where

presently she was sipping a glass of port-wine, with Mrs.

Anderson sitting behind her and supporting her head.

"No, you can't come in, Randolph," she heard her

say to her son, and her voice sounded almost angry.

After Charlotte had swallowed the wine, she lay back

on the pillow, and she heard Mrs Anderson talking soft-

ly to her in a sort of delicious dream, caused partly by

313








<pb n="314"/>
THE DEBTOR

the wine, which had mounted at once to her head, and

partly by the sense of powerful protection and perfect

peace and safety.

"Poor lamb!" Mrs. Anderson said, and her voice

sounded like the song of a mother bird. "Poor lamb;

poor, blessed child! It was a shame she was so fright-

ened, but she is safe now. Now go to sleep if you can,

dear child; it will do you good."

Charlotte smiled helplessly and gratefully, and after

a happy stare around the room, with its scroll-work of

green on the walls, reflecting green gloom from closed

blinds, and another look of childish wonder into the

loving eyes bent over her, she closed her own. Present-

ly Mrs. Anderson tiptoed out into the sitting - room,

where Randolph was waiting, standing bolt-upright in

the middle of the room staring at the bedroom door.

She beckoned him across the hall into the opposite room,

the parlor. The parlor had a musty smell which was

not unpleasant; in fact, slightly aromatic. There were

wooden shutters which were tightly closed, all except

one, through an opening in which a sunbeam came and

transversed the room in a shaft of glittering motes.

"What scared her so?" demanded Mrs. Anderson.

She had upon her a new authority. Anderson felt as

if he had reverted to his childhood. He explained.

"Well," said his mother, "the poor child has had an

awful shock, and she is lucky if she isn't down sick

with a fever. I don't like to see anybody look the

way she did. But I'm thankful the man didn't see

her."

"He might have been harmless enough," said Ander-

son.

Mrs. Anderson sniffed. "I don't see many harmless-

looking ones round here," said she. "An awful-looking

tramp came to the door this morning. I shouldn't won-

der if it was the same one. I guess she will be all right

314








<pb n="315"/>
THE DEBTOR

now. She looked quieted down, but she had an awful

shock, poor child."

"I wonder when I ought to take her home," said

Anderson.

"Not for two hours," said his mother, decidedly.

"She is going to stay here till she gets rested and is a

little over it."

"Perhaps she had better," said Anderson; "her folks

may have gone on a long drive, too."

"Did you know her before?" asked his mother, sud-

denly, and a sharp expression came into her soft, blue

eyes.

"I have seen her in the store," replied Anderson, and

he was conscious of coloring.

"She knew you, then?" said his mother.

"Yes. She was in the store this morning."

"It was lucky you were there."

"Oh, as for that, she was in no danger," said Ander-

son, coolly. "The tramp had gone."

"If you hadn't been there, I believe that poor little

thing would have fainted dead away and lain there,

nobody knows how long. It doesn't do anybody any

good to get such a fright, and she is a thin, delicate lit-

tle thing."

"Yes, she had quite a fright," said Anderson, walk-

ing over to the window with the defective shutter.

"This shutter must be fixed," said he.

"I think she is prettier than the one that got mar-

ried, but it is a pity she belongs to such a family," said

Mrs. Anderson. "Mrs. Ferguson was just in here, and

she says it is awful, that they are owing everybody."

"That is not the girl's fault," Anderson rejoined,

with sudden fire.

"No, I suppose not," said Mrs. Anderson, with an

anxious look at him. "Only, if she hasn't been taught

to think it doesn't matter if debts are not paid."

315








<pb n="316"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Well, I don't think that poor child is to be blamed,"

Anderson said.

"Do they owe you?"

"She came in and paid me this morning."

"Oh, I'm glad of that!" said his mother, and Ander-

son was conscious of intense guilt at his deception.

Somehow half a lie had always seemed to him more

ignoble than a whole one, and he had told a half one.

He turned to leave the room, when there came a loud

peal of the door-bell.

"Oh, dear, that will wake her up!" said his mother.

Anderson strode past her to the door, and there stood

Eddy Carroll. He was breathless from running, and

his pretty face was a uniform rose.

"Say," he panted, "is my sister in here?"

"Hush!" said Anderson. "Yes, she is."'

" I chased you all the way," said Eddy, "but I tumbled

down and hurt my knee on an old stone, and then I

couldn't catch up." Indeed, the left knee of Eddy's

little knickerbockers showed a rub and a red stain.

"Where's Charlotte?"

"She is lying down. She was frightened, and I

brought her here, and she has had some wine and is

lying down."

"What frightened her, I'd like to know? First

thing I saw you were lugging her off across the field.

What frightened her?"

Anderson explained.

Eddy sniffed with utmost scorn. "Just like a girl,"

said he, "to get scared of a man that was fast asleep,

and wouldn't have hurt her, anyway. Just like a girl.

Say, you'd better keep her awhile."

"We are going to," said Mrs. Anderson.

"If she stays to supper, I might stay too, and then

I could go home with her, and save you the trouble,"

said Eddy to Anderson.

CHAPTER XXVI

THERE had been a mutter as of coming storm in Wall

Street for several weeks, and this had culminated in a

small, and probably a sham, tempest, with more stage

thunder and lightning than any real. However, it was

on that very account just the sort of cataclysm to over-

whelm phantom and illusory ships of fortune like Arthur

Carroll's. That week he acknowledged to himself that his

career in the City was over, that it was high time for him

to shut up his office and to shake the dust of the City

from his feet, for fear of worse to come. Arthur Carroll

had a certain method in madness, a certain caution in

the midst of recklessness, and he had also a considerable

knowledge of law, and had essayed to keep within it.

However; there were complications and quibbles, and

nobody knew what might happen, so he retreated in

as good order as possible, and even essayed to guard as

well as might be his retreat. He told the pretty ste-

nographers, with more urbanity than usual, and even

smiling at the prettier one, as if the fact of her roselike

face did not altogether escape him, that he was feeling

the need of a vacation and would close the office for a

couple of weeks. At the end of that period they

might report. Carroll owed both of these girls; both

remembered that fact; both reflected on the possibility

of their services being no longer required, but such was

the unconscious masculine charm of the man ever their

foolish and irresponsible feminity that they questioned

nothing. Their eyes regarded him half-shyly, half-boldly

under their crests of blond pompadours. The younger

and prettier blushed sweetly, and laughed consciously,

as if she saw herself in a mirror; the other's face deepened

like a word under a strenuous pencil - the lines in it

grew accentuated. Going down-stairs, the pretty girl

nudged the other almost painfully in the side.

"Say," she whispered, "did you see him stare at me.

Eh?"

The other girl drew away angrily. "I don't know

as I did," she replied, in a curt tone.

"He stared like everything. Say, I don't believe

he's married."

"I don't see what difference it makes to you whether

he's married or not."

"Sho! Guess I wouldn't be seen goin' with a mar-

ried man. What do you take me for, Sadie Smith?"

"Wait till there's any question of goin' before you

worry. I would."

"Maybe I sha'n't have to wait long," giggled the

other. When she reached the sidewalk, she stood

balancing herself airily, swinging her arms, keeping up

a continuous flutter of motion like a bird, to keep warm,

for the wind blew cold down Broadway. She was really

radiant, vibrant with nerves and young blood, spark-

ling and dimpling, and bubbling over, as it were, with

perfect satisfaction with herself and perfect assurance

of what lay before her. The other stood rather soberly

beside her. They were both waiting for a car up Broad-

way. The young man who was in love with the pretty

one came clattering down the stairs. There had been

something wrong with the elevator, and it was being re-

paired. He also had to wait for a car, and he joined

the girls. He approached the pretty girl and timidly

pressed his shoulder against hers in its trim, light jacket.

She drew away from him with a sharp thrust of the

elbow.

318








<pb n="319"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Go 'long," said she, forcibly. She laughed, but she

was evidently in earnest.

The young man was not much abashed. He stood

regarding her, winking fast.

"Say," he said, with a cautious glance around at the

staircase, "s'pose the boss is goin' to quit?"

Both girls turned and stared at him. The elder turned

quite pale.

"What do you mean, talking so?" said she, sharply.

"Nothin', only I thought it was a kind of queer time

of year for a man to take a vacation, a man as busy as

the boss seems to be. And-it kind of entered my

head-"

"If anything entered your head, do, for goodness'

sake, hang on to it," said the pretty girl, pertly. Then

her car whirred over the crossing and ground to a stand-

still, and she sprang on it with a laugh at her own wit.

"Good-night," she called back.

The other two, waiting for another car, were left to-

gether. "You don't think Mr. Carroll means to give

up business?" the girl said, in a guarded tone.

"Lord, no! Why, he has so much business he can

hardly stagger under it, and he must be making money.

I was only joking."

"I suppose he's good pay," the girl said, in a shamed

tone.

"Good pay? Of course he is. He don't keep right

up to the mark-none of these lordly rich men like him

do-but he's sure as Vanderbilt. I should smile if he

wasn't."

"I thought so," said the girl. "I didn't mean to say

I had any doubt."

"He's sure, only he's a big swell. That's always the

way with these big swells. If he hadn't been such a

swell, now, he'd have paid us all off before he took his

vacation. But, bless you, money means so little to a

319








<pb n="320"/>
THE DEBTOR

chap like him that it don't enter into his head it can

mean any more to anybody else."

"It must be awful nice to have money enough so

you can feel that way," remarked the girl, with a cu-

rious sigh.

"That's so." The young man craned his neck for-

ward to look at an approaching car, then he turned again

to the girl. "Say," he whispered, pressing close to her

in the hurrying throng, and speaking in her ear, "she's

dead stuck on him, ain't she?" By two jerks, one of

his right shoulder, one of his left, with corresponding

jerks of his head, up the stairs and up Broadway, he

indicated his employer and the girl who had just left

on the car.

"She's a fool," replied the girl, comprehensively.

"Think she 'ain't got no show?"

The girl sniffed.

The young man laughed happily. "Well," he said,

"I rather think he's married, myself, anyhow."

"I don't think he's married," returned the girl,

quickly.

"I do. There's our car. Come along."

The girl climbed after the young man on to the

crowded platform of the car. She glanced back at the

office window as the car rumbled heavily up Broadway,

and it was a pathetic glance from a rather pathetic

young face with a steady outlook upon a life of toil and

petty needs.

William Allbright had lingered behind the rest, and

was in the office talking with Carroll, who was owing

him a month's salary. Allbright, respectfully and

apologetically, but with a considerable degree of firm-

ness, had asked for it.

" It is not quite convenient for me to pay you to-night,

Mr. Allbright," Carroll replied, courteously. "I was

expecting a considerable sum to-day, which would have

320








<pb n="321"/>
THE DEBTOR

enabled me to square off a number of other debts be-

side yours. You know that matter of Gates & Orms-

bee ?"

"Yes, sir," replied Allbright, rather evasively. He

had had curious misgivings lately about this very Gates

& Ormsbee, who figured in considerable transactions on

his books.

"Well," continued Carroll, rather impatiently, look-

ing at his watch, "you know they failed to meet their

note this morning, and that has shortened me with

ready money."

" How long do you expect to keep the office shut, sir ?"

inquired the clerk, respectfully, but still with a troubled

air, and with serious eyes with the unswerving intent-

ness of a child's upon Carroll's face.

"About two weeks," answered Carroll. "I must have

that much rest. I am overworked." It was, indeed,

true that Carroll looked fagged and fairly ill.

"And then you expect to resume business?" ques-

tioned Allbright, with a mild persistence. He still

kept those keen, childlike eyes of his upon the other

man's face.

"What else would you understand from what I have

already said?" said Carroll. He essayed to meet the

other man's eyes,. then he turned and looked out of the

window, and at that minute the girl who had worked

at the type-writer in the back office looked up at him

from the crowded platform of the car with her small,

intense face, whose intensity seemed to make it stand

out from the others around her as from a blurred back-

ground of humanity. "May I ask you to kindly wait

a moment, Mr. Allbright?" Carroll said, and went out

hurriedly, leaving Allbright standing staring in amaze-

ment. There had been something in his employer's

manner which he did not understand. He stood a

second, then presently made free to take up a copy of

321








<pb n="322"/>
THE DEBTOR

the Wall Street edition of the Sun, and sit down to glance

over the panic reports. It was not very long, however,

before he heard Carroll approaching the door. Carroll

entered quite naturally, and the unusual expression

which had perplexed the clerk was gone from his face.

His mind seemed to be principally disturbed by the

trouble about the elevator.

."It is an outrage," he said, in his fine voice, which

was courteous even while pronouncing anathema.

"The management of this block is not what it should

be."

Allbright had risen, and was standing beside the desk

on which lay the Sun. "It hasn't been acting right

for a week past," he said, referring to the elevator.

"I know it hasn't, and there might have been an

accident. It is an outrage. And they are taking twice

as long to repair it as they should. I doubt if it is in

working order by to-morrow." As he spoke, Carroll

was taking out his pocket-book, which he opened, dis-

closing neatly folded bank-notes. "By-the-way, Mr.

Allbright," he said, "I find I can settle my arrears with

you to-night, after all. I happened to think of a party

from whom I might procure a certain sum which was

due me, and I did so."

Allbright's face brightened. "I am very glad, sir,"

he said. "I was afraid of getting behind with the rent,

and my sister has not been very well lately, and there

is the doctor's bill."

"I am very glad also," said Carroll. "I dislike ex-

ceedingly to allow these things to remain unpaid." As

he spoke he was counting out the amount of Allbright's

month's salary. He then closed the pocket-book with

a deft motion, but not before the clerk had seen that

it was nearly empty. He also saw something else be-

fore Carroll brought his light overcoat together over his

chest. "It is really cold to-night," he said.

322








<pb n="323"/>
THE DEBTOR

"I am very much obliged to you, sir, for the money,"

Allbright said, putting the notes in his old pocket-book.

Then he replied to Carroll's remark concerning the

weather, that it was indeed cold, and he thought there

would be a frost.

"Yes, I think so," said Carroll.

Then Allbright put on his own rather shabby, dark

overcoat and his hat and took his leave. Much to his

surprise, Carroll extended his hand, something which

he had never done before.

"Good-bye," he said.

Allbright shook the extended hand, and felt a sudden,

unexplained emotion. He returned the good-bye, and

wished Mr. Carroll a pleasant vacation and restoration

to health.

"I am tired out and ill," Carroll admitted, in a weary

voice, and his eyes, as they now met the other man's,

were haggard.

"There's two weeks' vacation," Allbright told his

sister when he reached home that night, "and I don't

know, but I'm afraid business ain't going just to suit

Captain Carroll, and that's the reason for it."

"Has he paid you?" asked his sister, quickly, and

her placid forehead wrinkled. Her illness had made

her irritable.

"Yes," replied her brother. He looked at her medi-

tatively. He was about to tell her something - that

he was almost sure that Carroll had gone out and pawned

his watch to pay him-then he desisted. He reflected

that his sister was a woman, and would in all probabil-

ity tell the woman down-stairs and her son about it,

and that it would be none of their business whether he

worked for a man who was honest enough, or hard up

enough, to pawn his watch to pay him his month's

salary or not. He was conscious of sentiments of

loyalty both to himself and to Carroll. During the next

323








<pb n="324"/>
THE tDBTOR

two weeks he often strolled in the neighborhood of the

office and stood looking up at the familiar windows.

One day he saw some men carrying away a desk which

looked familiar, but he was not sure. He hesitated

about asking them from what office they had removed

it until they had driven away and it was too late. He

went up on the elevator and surveyed the office door,

but it looked just as usual, with the old sign thereon.

He tried it softly, but it was locked.

When he reached the sidewalk he encountered Har-

rison Day, the young clerk. He did not see him at first,

but a nervous touch on his arm arrested his attention,

and then he saw the young man's face with its fast-

winking eyes.

"Say," said Harrison Day, "it's all right, ain't it?"

"What's all right?" demanded Allbright, a trifle

shortly, drawing away. He had never liked Harrison

Day.

"Oh, nothin', only it's ten days since he went, and I

thought I'd look round to see how things were lookin'.

You s'pose he's comin' back all right?"

"I haven't any reason to think anything else."

"Well, I thought I'd look around, and when I saw

you I thought I'd ask what you thought. The girls

are kind of uneasy-that is, Sadie is-May don't seem

to fret much. Say!"

"What?"

"Did he pay you?"

"Yes, he did."

"Ain't he owin' you anything?"

"No, he is not."

The young man gave a whistle of relief. "Well, I

s'pose he's all right," he said. "He 'ain't paid the rest

of us up yet, but I s'pose it's safe enough."

A faithful, even an affectionate look came into the

other man's face. He remembered his suspicions

324








<pb n="325"/>
THE DEBTOR

about the watch, and reasoned from premises. "I

have no more doubt of him than I have of myself," he

replied.

"You s'pose the business is goin' on just the same,

then ?"

"Of course I do," Allbright replied, almost angrily.

And then a man who had just emerged from the street

door coming from the elevator accosted him.

"Can you tell me anything about a man by the name

of Carroll that's been running a sort of promoting

business up in No. 233," he asked, and his face looked

reddened unnaturally. The young man thought he

had probably been drinking, but Allbright thought he

looked angry. The young man replied before Allbright

opened his mouth.

"He's gone on a vacation," he said.

''Queer time of year for a vacation," snapped the

man, who was long and lean and full of nervous vibra-

tions.

"He was overworked," said Harrison Day.

"Guess he overworked cheating me out of two thou-

sand odd dollars," said the man, and both the others

turned and stared at him.

Then Allbright spoke. "That is a statement no

man has any right to make about my employer unless

he is in a position to prove it," he said.

"That is so," said Harrison Day. He was a very

small man, but he danced before the tall, lean one, who

looked as if all his flesh might have resolved to muscle.

The man looked contemptuously down at him and

spoke to Allbright. "So he is your employer?" he said,

in a sarcastic tone.

"Yes, he is."

"This young man's also, I presume."

"Yes, he is," declared Day. But the man only heed-

ed Allbright's response that he was.

32S








<pb n="326"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Well," said the man, "may I ask a question?"

"Yes, you may," said Day, pertly, "but it don't fol-

low that we are goin' to answer it."

"May I ask," said the man, addressing Allbright, "if

Captain Carroll has paid you your salaries?"

"He has paid me every dollar he owed me," replied

Allbright, with emphasis, and his own face flushed.

Then the man turned to Day. "Has he paid you?"

he inquired.

And Day, with no hesitation, lied. "Yes, sir, he has,

every darned cent," he declared, "and I don't know

what business it is of yours whether he has or not."

"When is he coming back?" asked the man, of All-

bright, not heeding Day.

"Next Monday," replied Allbright, with confidence.

"Where does he live?" asked the man.

Then for the first time an expression of confusion

came over the book-keeper's face, but Day arose to the

occasion.

"He lives in Orange," replied Day.

"What street, and number?"

"One hundred and sixty- three Water Street," re-

plied Day. His eyes flashed. He was finding an un-

wholesome exhilaration in this inspirational lying.

"Well," said the man, "I can tell you one thing, if

your precious boss ain't in this office Monday morning

by nine o'clock sharp, he'll see me at one hundred and

sixty-three Water Street, Orange, New Jersey, and he'll

hand over my two thousand odd dollars that he's

swindled me out of, or I'll have the law on him." With

that the man swung himself aboard a passing car, and

Allbright and Day were left looking after him.

"That feller had ought to have been knocked down,"

said Day.

Allbright turned and looked at him gravely. "So,

Captain Carroll lives in Orange?" he said.

326








<pb n="327"/>
THE DEBTOR

"He may, for all I know."

"Then you don't know?"

"Do you?".

"No; I never have known exactly."

"Well, I haven't, but I wasn't goin' to let on to that

chap. And he may live jest where I said he did, for

all I know. Say!"

"What?"

"You s'pose it is all right?"

Allbright hesitated. His eyes fell on three gold balls

suspended in the air over a door a little way down a

cross street. "Yes," he said. "I believe that Captain

Arthur Carroll will pay every man he owes every dollar

he owes."

"Well, I guess it's all right," said Day. "I'm goin'

to take the girls to Madison Square Garden to-night.

I'm pretty short of cash, but you may as well live while

you do live. I wonder if the boss is married."

"I don't know."

"I guess he is," said Day, "and I guess he's all right

and above board. Good-bye, Allbright. See you Mon-

day."

But Monday, when the two stenographers, the book-

keeper, and the clerk met at the office, they found it

still locked, and a sign "To let" upon the door.

"Mr. Carroll gave up his office last Saturday," said

the man in the elevator. "The janitor said so, and

they have taken his safe out for rent. Guess he bust

in the Wall Street shindy last week.

Out on the sidewalk the four looked at one another.

The pretty stenographer began to cry in a pocket-hand-

kerchief edged with wide, cheap lace.

"I call it a shame," she said, "and here I am owing

for board, and-"

"Don't cry, May," said Day, with a caressing gesture

towards her in spite of the place. "I guess it will be

~~22  ~327

all right. He has all our addresses, and we shall hear,

and you won't have a mite of trouble getting another

place."

"I think I am justified in telling you all not to worry

in the least, that you will be paid every dollar," said

Allbright; but he looked perplexed and troubled.

"It looks mighty black, his not sending us word he

was going to close the office," said Day; and then ap-

peared the tall, lean man who wanted his two thousand

odd dollars. He did not notice them at all, but started

to enter the office-building.

"Come along quick before he comes back," whis-

pered Day. He seized the astonished girls each by an

arm and hustled them up the street, and Allbright,

after a second's hesitation, followed them just as the

irate man emerged from the door.

CHAPTER XXVII

ARTHUR CARROLL, when he had started on his drive

with his wife and sister that afternoon, was in one of

those strenuous moods which seem to make one's whole

being tick with the clock-work of destiny and cause

everything else, all the environment, and the minor

happenings of life, to appear utterly idle. Even when

he talked, and apparently with earnestness, it was al-

ways with that realization of depths, which made his

own voice ring empty and strange in his ears. He

heard his wife and sister chatter with the sense of aloof-

ness of the inhabitant of another planet; he thought even

of the financial difficulties which harassed him, and had

caused this very mood, with that same sense of aloof-

ness. When Anna wondered where Charlotte had gone

to walk, and Mrs. Carroll remarked on the possibility of

their overtaking her, his mind made an actual effort to

grasp that simple idea. He was running so deep, and

with such awful swiftness, in his own groove of personal

tragedy, that the daughter whom he loved, and had

seen only a few moments ago, seemed almost left out of

sight of his memory. However, all the while the usual

trivialities of his life and the lives of those who belonged

to him went on with the same regularity and reality

as tragedy, and with as certain a trend to a catas-

trophe of joy or misery.

On that day when Charlotte had her fright from the

tramp, she remained at the Anderson's to supper.

Eddy had also remained. When Charlotte had waked

329








<pb n="330"/>
THE DEBTOR

from her nap, he followed Anderson into the sitting-

room, where was Charlotte in Mrs. Anderson's volumi-

nous, white frilly wrapper, a slight young figure scalloped

about by soft, white draperies, like a white flower, seated

comfortably in the largest, easiest chair in the room.

Mrs. Anderson was standing over her with another glass

of wine, and a china plate containing two great squares

of sponge-cake.

"Do eat this and drink the wine, dear," she urged.

"It is nearly an hour before supper now."

"Then I really must go home, if it is so late," Char-

lotte cried. She made a weak effort to rise. She was

still curiously faint when she essayed to move.

"You are going to stay here and have supper, and

after supper my son shall take you home. If you are

not able to walk, we shall have a carriage."

"I think I must go home, thank you," Charlotte re-

peated, in a sort of bewildered and grateful dismay.

"If you think your mother will feel anxious, I will

send and inform her where you are," said Mrs. Ander-

son, "but you must stay, my dear." There was about

her a soft, but incontrovertible authority. It was all

gentleness, like the overlap of feathers, but it was com-

pelling. It was while Mrs. Anderson was insisting and

the girl protesting that Anderson, with Eddy at his heels,

had entered the room.

"Why, Eddy dear, is that you?" cried Charlotte.

Eddy stood before her and surveyed her with com-

miseration and a strong sense of personal grievance and

reproach. "Yes, it's me," said he. "Papa told me to

go to walk with you, and I didn't know which way you

went, and I couldn't find out for a long time. Then I

saw Mr. Anderson taking you here, and I ran,- but I

couldn't catch up. He's got awful long legs." Eddy

looked accusingly at Anderson's legs.

"It was too bad," said Charlotte.

330








<pb n="331"/>
THE DEBTOR

"You were awful silly to get so scared at nothing,"

Eddy pursued. "I saw that tramp. He looked to

me like a real nice man. Girls are always imagining

things. You'd better eat that cake, Charlotte. You

look awful. That looks like real nice cake."

"Bless your heart, you shall have some," Mrs. An-

derson said, and Eddy accepted with alacrity the golden

block of cake which was offered him.

"Why, Eddyl" Charlotte said.

"Now, Charlotte, you know we never have cake like

this at home," Eddy said, biting into the cake. "Not

since the egg-man won't 'trust us any more. I know

this kind of cake takes lots of eggs. I heard Marie say

so when Amy asked her to make it."

Charlotte colored pitifully, and made another effort

to rise. "Indeed, I think we must go now," said she.

"Come, Eddy."

Mrs. Anderson turned to her son for support. "I tell

her she must not think of going until after tea," she

said. "Then if she is not able to walk, we will get a

carriage."

Eddy removed the fast-diminishing square of cake

from his mouth and regarded his sister with an expres-

sion of the most open ingenuousness. "Now, Charlotte,

I'll tell you something," he said.

"What, dear?"

"You might just as well stay, and I'll tell you why.

Papa and Amy and Anna won't be home until after

seven."

"Until after seven?"

"No. They are going to Addison."

"To Addison?"

Addison was a large town some fifteen miles from

Banbridge.

"Yes; and they are going to get dinner there."

"Eddy, are you sure?"

33I








<pb n="332"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Yes, of course I am sure," replied Eddy, with the

wide-open eyes of virtue upon his sister's face. "Amy

told me to tell you."

"Now, Eddy."

Eddy took another bite of his cake. "I think you

are pretty mean to speak that way. I never spoke to

you so," he said. " When you say a thing is so, I never

say 'Now, Charlotte!"' Eddy, having imitated his

sister's doubtful tone exactly, took another bite of

cake.

"Well, if Amy really said so," Charlotte returned,

and still with a faint accent of incredulity. It was very

seldom that the Carrolls took the drive to Addison.

However, it was an exceedingly pleasant day, and it

did seem possible.

"Well, she did," Eddy declared, stoutly; and there

was in his declaration a slight trace of truth, for Mrs.

Carroll had mentioned, on starting, that it was such a

lovely day, that if they had got an earlier start they

might have driven to Addison; and Anna had replied

that it was too late now, for they would not get home

in time for dinner if they went there. The rest Eddy

had manufactured to serve his own small ends-which

a stay at the Andersons' to tea, for which he had, re-

membering his dinner there, the pleasantest anticipa-

tions. "You had better stay, Charlotte," Eddy urged,

furthermore, "for you do look awful pale, and as if you

ought to have something nourishing to eat, and you

know we won't get much home. The mutton all went

this noon, and you know, unless papa got some in Addi-

son, we wouldn't be likely to get any here. I heard

Anna talking about the butcher only this morning.

Papa hasn't been able to pay him for a very long time,

you know, Charlotte."

Then Charlotte raised herself hastily. "We must go

home," she said, with a fierce emphasis; but the effort

3332








<pb n="333"/>
THE DEBTOR

was too much. She sank back, and Mrs. Anderson sent

her son for the camphor-bottle.

'" Now," said she to Anderson, "you had better take

him out and show him the dog. I'll fix it up." She

nodded assuringly towards the little pale face against

the rose-patterned chintz.

"Come along, son," said Anderson to the boy, and

led him out in the garden. "You must not talk quite

so much, young man," he said to him, when they were

on their way to the dog - kennel, which was backed up

against the terrace at the rear of the house, and before

which stood chained fast a large dog with a bad repu-

tation. "You had better not touch him," charged An-

derson, as they approached. Then he repeated, "No,

you must not talk quite so much."

"Why not?" demanded Eddy. "He don't look very

cross."

"Because," said the man, "there are certain things

in every family which it is better for a member of the

family not to repeat outside his home."

"What did I say?" asked Eddy, wonderingly. "He

is wagging his tail. He shakes all over. He wouldn't

do that unless his tail was wagging. I can't see his tail,

but it must be wagging. What did I say?"

"When it comes to the family's household affairs-"

Anderson said.

"Oh, you mean what I said about the butcher, huh?

Oh, that don't do any harm, Everybody in Banbridge

knows about those things. I don't see what difference

that makes. Folks have to have things, don't they?

I don't believe that dog would bite me. He is wagging

just as hard as he can. Don't they?"

"Yes, of course," agreed Anderson, "but-" 

"And if they don't have the money to pay for things,

what are they going to do? You wouldn't want all us

Carrolls to die, would you?"

333








<pb n="334"/>
THE DEBTOR

Anderson smiled, and stood between the boy and the

kennel.

"I ain't afraid of him," said Eddy. "You wouldn't,

would you?"

"Oh, of course not," replied Anderson.

"I shouldn't think you would, especially Charlotte.

Say, I think Charlotte is a real pretty girl, if she is my

sister. Say, why can't I pat him?"

"You had better not. He bit a boy about your size

once."

"Hm! I ain't afraid he'll bite me. Don't you

think she is? I don't think you are very polite not to

say right off."

"Very pretty, indeed," replied Anderson, laughing.

Then he spoke to the dog, a large mongrel with a mas-

terly air, and an evident strain of good blood under his

white and yellow hide.

"How much did you pay for that dog?" inquired

Eddy.

"I didn't pay anything," replied Anderson. "Some-

body left him in the street in front of my office when

he was a puppy, or he strayed there. I never knew

which."

"So you took him in?"

"Yes."

"Do you always keep him shut up here?"

"A great part of the time. Sometimes he stays in

my store nights. He is a very good watch-dog."

"You keep him shut up because he bit a boy?"

"Most of the time. He is a little uncertain in his

temper, I am afraid."

"Didn't he bite any one but that one boy?"

"NNO, not that I know of. But he has sprang at a

good many people and frightened them, and I have

either to keep him tied or shoot him."

"He didn't kill the boy?"

334








<pb n="335"/>
THE DEBTOR

Anderson laughed. "Oh no! He was not very

badly bitten."

"Well, I know one thing," said Eddy, with con-

viction. "I would not like a nice dog like that shut

up all his life because he had bitten me."

Before Anderson knew what he was about to do,

Eddy had made a spring, leaping up sideways in the

air like a kitten, and was close to the dog. And the

dog, upon whom there was no reliance to be placed,

except in the case of Anderson himself, hardly stopping

for a premonitory growl, had seized upon the boy's

little arm. Having a strain of pure bulldog in him, it

was considerable trouble to make him let go, and

Anderson had to use a good deal of force at his collar

and a thick stick. -

Eddy, meanwhile, made not a whimper, but kept his

whitening lips close shut. )Luckily he had on a thick

jacket, although the day was so warm, and when Ander-

son drew away at last from the furious, straining animal,

and examined the injured member, he found only a

slight wound. The marks of the dog's teeth were plain-

ly visible, and there were several breaks of the surface

and a little blood, but it was certainly not alarming,

and the animal's usual temper made it improbable that

any ultra consequences need be feared.

Eddy was trembling and very pale, but he still made

not a whimper, as Anderson examined his arm.

"Well, my son," said Anderson, who was as white as

the boy, "I think there is not much harm done. But

it is lucky you had on such a thick sleeve. I can tell

you that."

"That was because we have not paid the Chinaman,

and he wouldn't send home my blouses this week. It

was so warm I wanted to wear a blouse, but they were

all at the Chinaman's." Eddy's teeth chattered as he

spoke, his childish lips quivered, and tears were in his

335








<pb n="336"/>
THE DEBTOR

eyes. He continued to tremble violently, but he did

not for a moment give way. He even shook off the

protecting arm which Anderson placed around his little

shoulders.

"Come, we will go in the house and have this tied up,"

said Anderson.

But Eddy rebelled. "I don't want a lot of women

fussing over a little thing like this," said he, stoutly.

"It isn't anything at all."

"No, it is not very serious, but all the same it had

better be tied up, and I have something I want to put

on it. I tell you what we will do. We will go around

the back way. I will take you in the kitchen door and

up the backstairs to my room, and doctor it unknown

to anybody."

"I don't want Charlotte to know anything about it;

she will be just silly enough to faint away again. Girls

always do make such an awful fuss over nothing," said

Eddy.

"All right," said Anderson. "Come along, my

boy."

Anderson started, and the boy followed, but sud-

denly he stopped and ran back before Anderson dreamed

what he was about. He stopped in front of the kennel,

and danced on obviously trembling legs a dance of de-

fiance before the frantic dog.

Anderson grabbed him by the shoulders.

"Come at once," he said, quite sternly.

Eddy obeyed at once. "All right," he said. "I just

wanted him to see I wasn't afraid of him, that was all."

Eddy and Anderson entered the house through the

kitchen door, ascended the backstairs noiselessly, and

gained Anderson's room, where the wound was bound

up after an application of a stinging remedy which the

boy bore without flinching, although it was consider-

ably more painful than the bite itself, He looked

336








<pb n="337"/>
THE DEBTOR

soberly down at his arm, now turning black and blue

from the bruise of the dog's teeth, beside the inflamed

spots where they had actually entered, while Anderson

applied the violent remedy.

"Well," he said, "I suppose I was to blame. I ought

to have minded you."

"Yes, I suppose you ought, my son," assented An-

derson, continuing to handle the wound gently.

"And I suppose that is an exclusive dog. He doesn't

like everybody going right up to him. Say, I guess he

is a pretty smart dog, but I guess I should rather be

his master than anybody else. He never bit you, did

he?"

," No."

"I should think he would be an awful nice watch-

dog," said Eddy.

Anderson bound the arm tightly and smoothly with

a bandage. When the arm was finally dressed the

jacket-sleeve could go over it, much to Eddy's satis-

faction.

"Say, this jacket ain't paid for," he said. "Isn't it

lucky that the man where Amy bought it didn't know

we didn't have much money to pay for things lately

and trusted us. If I had on my old jacket, the sleeves

were so short and tight, because I had outgrown it,

you know, I'd been hurt a good deal worse, and it was

lucky we hadn't paid the Chinaman, too. It was real-

What do you call it?"

"I don't know what you mean?" said Anderson,

smiling.

"It was real- Oh, shucks! you know. What is it

folks say when they don't go on a railroad train, and

there's an accident, and everybody that did go is killed.

You know."

"Oh, providential?"

"Yes, it was real providential."

337








<pb n="338"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Suppose we go down."

"All right. Say, you mind you don't say a word

about this to your mother or Charlotte."

"Yes, I promise."

"Your mother is an awful nice lady," said Eddy, in

a whisper, descending the stairs behind Anderson, "but

I don't want her fussing over me as if I was a girl,

'cause I ain't."

When the two entered the sitting- room, Charlotte

started and looked at her brother.

"Eddy Carroll, what is the matter?" she cried.

"Nothing," declared the little boy, stoutly, but he

manifestly tottered.

"Why, the dear child is ill!" cried Mrs. Anderson.

"Randolph, what has happened?"

"Nothing!" cried Eddy, holding on to his conscious-

ness like a hero. "Nothing; and I ain't a dear child."

"it is nothing, mother," said Anderson, quickly com-

ing to his rescue.

Charlotte was eying wisely the knee of Eddy's knicker-

bockers. "Eddy Carroll," said she, with tender severity,

"your knee must be paining you terribly."

Eddy quickly grasped at the lesser evil. "It ain't

worth talking about," he responded, stoutly.

"I can see blood on your knee, dear. It must be bad

to make you turn so pale as that."

With a soft swoop like a mother hen, Mrs. Anderson

descended upon the boy, who did not dare resist that

gentle authority. She tenderly rolled up the leg of the

little knickerbockers and examined the bruised, childish

knee. Then she got some witch-hazel and bound it up.

While she was doing so, Eddy gazed over her head at

Anderson with the knowing and confidential twinkle

which one man gives another when tolerant of wom-

anly delusion. He even indulged in an apparently insane

chuckle when Mrs. Anderson finished, and smoothed his

338








<pb n="339"/>
THE DEBTOR

little, dark head, and told him that now she was sure

it would feel better.

"Eddy," cried Charlotte, "what are you doing so

for?"

"Nothing," replied Eddy. "I was thinking how

funny I looked when I tumbled down. "But he rolled

his eyes comically around at Anderson. His arm was

paining him frightfully, and it struck him as the most

altogether exquisite joke that Mrs. Anderson should

be treating his knee, which did not pain him at all, so

sympathetically.








<pb n="340"/>
CHAPTER XXVIII

DURING the progress of the tea at the Andersons'

Eddy kept furtively glancing at his sister with an ex-

pression which signified congratulation.

"Ain't you glad you stayed?" the expression said,

quite plainly.

"Did you ever have such nice things to eat? And

only think what a snippy meal we should have had at

home!"

Charlotte met the first of the glances with a covertly

chiding look and an imperceptible shake of her head;

then she refused to meet them, keeping her eyes away

from her exultant brother. She herself was actually

hungry, poor child, for the truth was that for the last

few days it had been somewhat short commons at the

Carrolls', and Charlotte was one of the sort who, under

such circumstances, are seized with a sudden loss of

appetite. She had really eaten very little for some

hours, and now, in spite of a curious embarrassment

and agitation, which under ordinary circumstances

would have lessened her desire for food, she herself ate

eagerly. The meal was both dainty and abundant.

Mrs. Anderson had always prided herself upon the meals

she set before guests. There was always in the house a

store of sweets to be drawn from on such occasions, and

while Anderson had been binding up Eddy's wound,

the maid had been sent to the market for a chicken to

supplement the beefsteak which had been intended for

the family supper, So there was fried chicken and

340








<pb n="341"/>
THE DEBTOR

celery salad, and the most wonderful cream biscuits, and

fruit and pound cake, and quince preserves-quarters

of delectable, long-drawn-out flavor in a rosy jelly-

and tea and thick cream and loaf-sugar in the old,

solid service with its squat pieces finished with bead-

ing. Eddy gloated over it all openly. He fairly for-

got his manners, for, after all, he was, although in a

desultory sort of way, a well-bred boy. The Carrolls,

as far as their manners went, were gentlefolk, and came

of a long line of gentlefolk. But it happened that the

china which had come to them from their forebears had

for the most part been broken in the course of their

wanderings from place to place, and in its place was an

ornate and rather costly, and unpaid - for, set. Eddy

now quite operly lifted the saucer of thin, pink-and-

gold china, in which his teacup rested, and held it to

the light.

"Whew, ain't it thin?" he ejaculated.

"Why, Eddy!" Charlotte cried, flushing with dismay.

"I don't care. It is awful thin," persisted the boy.

He held the saucer before his eyes. "I can see you

through it; yes, I can," said he.

But Mrs. Anderson, although her old-fashioned ideas

of the decorous behavior due from children at table were

somewhat offended, and she later told her son that it

did seem to her that the boy must have been somewhat

neglected, was yet very susceptible to flattery of those

teacups, which had descended to her from her own

mother, and which she had always regarded as superior

to any of the Anderson family china, of which there

was quite a store. So she merely smiled and remarked

gently that the china was very old, and she believed

quite rare, and it was, indeed, unusually thin, yet not a

piece of the original set had been broken.

"Why didn't we have china like this instead of that

we have?" demanded Eddy of Charlotte.

34I








<pb n="342"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Hush, dear," said Charlotte. "This china is so very

old and valuable, you know, that not every one could-

that we could not- I believe we had some very

pretty china in our family, but it all got broken," she

added.

"It didn't begin to be so pretty as this," said Eddy.

"I remember it. The cups were like bowls, and there

were black wreaths around them. There weren't any

handles, either. I don't see why we couldn't have got

some china as pretty as this. Suppose it was valuable.

Why, I don't believe that we have now is paid for.

What difference would it make?"

Charlotte blushed so that Mrs. Anderson felt an im-

pulse to draw the poor, little, troubled head upon her

shoulder and tell her not to mind.

"Let me give you some more of the quince preserve,

dear," she said, in the softest voice; and Charlotte, who

did not want it, passed her little glass dish to take ad-

vantage of the opportunity afforded her to cover her

confusion.

"What difference would it make, say, Charlotte?"

persisted Eddy.

"Hush, dear," said Charlotte, painfully.

' Here, son, pass your plate for this chicken," said

Anderson; and Eddy, with a shrewd glance of half-

comprehension from one to the other, passed his plate

and subsided, after a muttered remark that he didn't

see why Charlotte minded.

"Wasn't that a bully supper?" he whispered, press-

ing close to his sister when they entered the sitting-

room after the meal was finished.

"Hush, dear," she whispered back.

"Ain't you glad you stayed? You wouldn't, if it

hadn't been for me."

Charlotte turned and looked at him sharply. Mrs.

Anderson had lingered in the dining-room to give some

342








<pb n="343"/>
THE DEBTOR

directions to the maid, and Anderson had stepped out

on the porch for a second's puff at a cigar.

"Eddy Carroll," said she, in a whisper, "you didn't?"

Eddy faced her defiantly. "Didn't what?"

"You didn't tell a lie about that?"

Eddy lowered his eyes, frowned, and scraped one foot

in a way he had when embarrassed. "Amy did say

Something about it was such a pleasant day and Addi-

son," he replied, doggedly.

"But did she say they were really going there, and

would not be back?"

"Anna said if they went there they could not get

back."

"But did she say they were going? Tell me the

truth," Eddy Carroll."

Eddy scraped.

"I see they did not," said Charlotte, severely.

"Eddy, I don't know what papa will say."

"I know," said Eddy, simply, with a curious mixture

of ruefulness and defiance. Then he added: "If you

want to be mean enough to tell on a feller, after he's

been the means of your having such a supper as that

(and you were hungry, too; you needn't say you wasn't;

you ate an awful lot yourself), you can."

"I am not going to tell unless I am asked, when I

certainly shall not tell a lie," replied Charlotte; "but

papa will find it out himself, I am afraid, Eddy."

"I shouldn't wonder if he did," admitted Eddy.

"And then, you know-"

"Yes, I know; but I don't care. I have had that

bully supper, anyhow. He can't alter that. And, say,

Charlotte."

"What?" asked Charlotte, severely. "I am ashamed

of you, Eddy."

"I don't see why papa don't get a store, like him"-

he jerked an expressive shoulder towards the scent of

a3                 343








<pb n="344"/>
THE DEBTOR

the cigar smoke-"and then we could have things as

good as they do."

But then Charlotte turned on him with fierceness

none the less intense, although necessarily subdued.

"Eddy Carroll," she whispered, with a long - drawn

sibilance, "to turn on your father, a man like papa!

Eddy Carroll! Poor papa does the best he can, always,

always."

"I suppose he does," said Eddy, quite loudly. "My,

Charlotte, you needn't act as if you were going to bite

a feller. I've had enough of-"

"What?" asked Charlotte.

"Nothing," said Eddy. His arm was paining him

quite severely. It had been quite an ordeal for him to

manage his knife and fork at supper without betrayal.

"What were you going to say?" persisted Charlotte.

"Nothing," said Eddy, doggedly-" nothing at all.

Don't act so fierce, Charlotte. It isn't lady-like. Amy

never speaks so awful quick."

Charlotte began putting on her hat, which had been

left on the sitting-room table. "I am ashamed of you,"

she whispered again. "I was ashamed of you all tea-

time."

Eddy whistled in a mannish fashion. Charlotte con-

tinued adjusting her hat and smoothing her fluff of

dark hair. Her face, in the mirror which hung between

the two front windows, looked not so angry as sorrowful,

and with a dewy softness in the pretty eyes, and a

slight quiver about the soft mouth. Eddy glanced

several times at this reflected face; then he stole, with

a sudden, swift motion, up behind his sister, threw his

arms around her neck, although it hurt him cruelly,

and laid his boyish cheek against her soft, girlish one.

"No, you need not think that will make up," whis-

pered Charlotte. But she herself pressed her cheek

tenderly against his, and then laughed softly. "Try

344








<pb n="345"/>
THE DEBTOR

not to do so again, dear," she said. "It mortified me,

and it is not being a credit to papa. Think a little and

try to remember how you have been brought up."

"Charlotte," whispered Eddy, in the softest, most

furtive of whispers, casting a glance over his shoulder.

"What is it, dear?"

"I suppose they"-he indicated by a motion of his

shoulder his host and hostess-" are just as nice people

as-we are-as the Carrolls."

"Of course they are," replied Charlotte, hastily.

She pushed Eddy away softly and began to fuss again

with her hat. "We must go home right away," she

said, "or they will worry."

"There is no need of his going home with you, as

long as I am here," said Eddy.

"Of course not," replied Charlotte,

But it seemed that Anderson himself had other views,

and his mother also, for although a sudden and not al-

together easy suspicion had come to her, she whispered

aside to him that he must certainly accompany the

two home.

"It is quite dark already," she said, "and it is not

fit for that child to go alone with nobody but that boy,

after the fright .she has had this afternoon. She. is

just in the condition now when a ,shadow might up-

set her. You really must go with her, Randolph."

"I have no intention of doing anything else, mother,"

Randolph replied, laughing. He had been, indeed, tak-

ing his overcoat from the tree in the hall when his moth-

er had come out to speak to him. Charlotte had said,

on rising from the table, that she must go home at

once. 

Mrs. Anderson enveloped the girl in her large, gentle,

lavender-scented. embrace, and received with pleasant

disclaimers her assurances of obligations and thanks;

then she stood in the window and, with a little mis-

345








<pb n="346"/>
THE DEBTOR

giving and a ready imagination for future trouble,

watched them emerge from the little front yard and

disappear down the street under the low-growing maple

branches which were turning slowly, and flashed gold

over their heads in electric lights. She reflected judicial-

ly that while Charlotte was undoubtedly a sweet girl, and

very pretty, very pretty, indeed, and, while her own heart

was drawn to her, yet she would make no sort of wife

for her son. She remembered with a shudder Eddy's re-

marks at the table.

"He is a pretty little boy, too," she thought, with a

maternal thrill, remembering her own son at that age.

When she returned to the dining - room to wash the

pink-and-gold cups and saucers, in her little bowl of

hot water on the end of the table, as was her custom

when the best china had been used, the maid, who was

clearing the table, and who had been encouraged to

conversation from the lack of another woman in the

house, and her mistress's habit of gentle garrulity, spoke

upon the subject in her mind.

"Them was them Carrolls that lives in the Ranger

place, was they not ?" said she. The maid was a curious

product of the region, having somewhat anomalously

graduated at a high-school in New Sanderson before en-

tering service, and gotten a strange load of unassimilated

knowledge, which was particularly exemplified in her

English. She scorned contractions, but equally scorned

possessives and legitimate tenses. She wrote a beautiful

hand, using quite ambitious words, but she totally mis-

interpreted the meaning of these very words in current

literature, particularly the cook-book. Her bread was

as heavy with undigested facts as is the stomach of a

dyspeptic with food, but she was, in a way, a good ser-

vant, very faithful, attached to Mrs. Anderson, and a

guileless purveyor of gossip, which rendered her exceed-

ingly entertaining. She sniffed meaningly now in re-

346








<pb n="347"/>
THE DEBTOR

sponse to Mrs. Anderson's affirmative with regard to the

identity of the recent guests.

"They did not fail to eat enough," said she, present-

ly, packing up the plates and looking at her mistress,

who was drying carefully a pink-and-gold cup on a soft

towel.

"Yes, they seemed to relish the food," responded Mrs.

Anderson.

The maid sniffed again, and her sniff meant the grati-

fication of the cook who sees her work appreciated, and

something else--an indulgent scorn. "Well, I guess

there is reason enough for them relishing it," said she.

Mrs. Anderson made a soft, interrogatory noise, all

that was consistent with her dignity and her sense of

, honor as a recent hostess towards departed guests.

The maid went on. "They do say," said she, "them

as knows, that them Carrolls do not have enough to

eat."

Mrs. Anderson made a little exclamation expressive of

horror and pity.

"Yes, they do say so," the maid went on, solemnly.

"They do say, them that knows, that them Carrolls be

owing everybody in Banbridge, and have cheated folks

that have trusted in them awful."

"Well, I am sorry if it is so," said Mrs. Anderson,

with a sigh, "but of course this young lady who was

here to-night and her little brother can't be to blame in

any way, Emma."

The maid sniffed with a deprecating disagreement.

"Mebbe they be not," said she. She was rather a pretty

girl, in her late girlhood, thin and large - boned, with

a bright color on her evident cheek-bones, and with

small, sparkling, blue eyes. She was extremely neat and

trim, moreover, in her personal habits, and to-night was

quite gorgeously arrayed in a light silk waist and a

nice black skirt. She was expecting her beau to take

347








<pb n="348"/>
THE DEBTOR

her to evening prayer-meeting. She was a very religious

girl, and had reclaimed her beau, who had had a liking

for the gin-mills previous to keeping company with her.

"Of course they are not," said Mrs. Anderson, with

some warmth of partisanship, remembering poor little

Charlotte's pretty, anxious face and her tiny, soft, cling-

ing hands. She glanced, as she spoke, at the maid's

large, red-knuckled fingers with a mental comparison.

The maid was fixed in her own rendering of English

verbs, and had told her beau that her mistress did not

speak just right, like most old folks.

"Mebbe they be not," she said, with firm doubt.

Then she added, "It would not hurt them Carroll ladies,

that young lady, nor her mother, nor her aunt, if they

was to take hold, and do the housework them own selves,

instead of keeping a girl, who they do not never pay."

"Oh, dear! Do you know that?"

"Indeed I do know that! Ed, he told me. He had

it straight from them Hungarians who live in the house

back of his married sister's. The Carroll girl, she goes

there, and she told them, and them told Ed's sister."

"Perhaps she has had some of her wages. You don't

mean she has not been paid at all?" Mrs. Anderson said.

"I mean not at all," the maid said, firmly. "That

girl that works for them Carrolls has not been paid, not

at all."

"Why does she remain there, then?"

"She would have went a long time ago if she not

been afraid, lest, if she had went, it would have come

about that she would have lost all she was going to lose

as well as that which she had lost before," replied the

girl, and Mrs. Anderson, being accustomed to her method

of expression, understood.

"It is dreadful," she said.

"They say he has about ruined a great many of the

people in Banbridge who have trusted them," said the

348








<pb n="349"/>
THE DEBTOR

maid, with a sly, keen glance at her mistress. She had

heard that Mr. Anderson was one of the losers, and she

wondered.

"They have paid my son promptly, I believe," said

Mrs. Anderson, although a little reluctantly. She al-

ways disliked alluding to the store to her maid, much

more so than towards her equals. But that the maid

misunderstood. She often told her beau that Mrs.

Anderson was not a bit set up nor proud-feeling, if her

son did have a store. Therefore, to-night she under-

stood humility instead of pride from her mistress's tone,

and looked at her admiringly as she daintily polished the

delicate pink-and-gold cups.

"I am very glad, indeed, that Mr. Randolph has not

lost nothing through them," she replied.

"No, he has not," Mrs. Anderson repeated. "I dare

say it is all exaggerated. The young lady who was here

to-night seems like a very sweet girl."

Mrs. Anderson said that from a beautiful sense of

loyalty and justice, while in her mind's eye she saw

her beloved son walking along through the early night

with .the young lady on his arm, and perhaps falling des-

perately in love, even at this date, and beginning to

think of matrimony with a member of a family about

which such tales were told in Banbridge.

But the harm had been done long before she had

dreamed of it, and her son had been very much in love

with the girl on his arm before he had scarcely known

her by sight. Anderson that night felt in a sort of

dream. He was for the first time practically alone with

Charlotte, for Eddy accompanied them very much

after the fashion of an extremely lively little dog. He

ran ahead, he lagged behind, and made dashes ahead

with wild whoops. He hid behind trees, and sprang out

at.them when they passed. He was frequently start-

lingly obvious, but could not be said to actually be

349








<pb n="350"/>
THE DEBTOR

with them. He had wondered frankly, before they

started, as to why Anderson wished to accompany them

at all.

"I don't see why you want to go 'way up to our

house when Charlotte has got me," he said. "Ain't

you tired?"

Something in Anderson's persistency seemed to strike

him as significant, for he walked behind them quite

soberly, with his eye upon their backs in a speculative

fashion at first; then he seemed to be seized with wild

excitement, and began frantic demonstrations to attract

Anderson's attention. In reality the boy was jealous,

although nobody dreamed of such a thing.

"A man will never notice a feller when a pretty girl's

around; and she ain't so very pretty, either," he said to

himself. He regarded Anderson as his find, and was

naturally indignant with Charlotte. So all the way

home he darted and veered about them, in order to

divert the man's mind from the girl to the faithful lit-

tle boy, but with no avail. Once or twice Charlotte

spoke reproachfully to him, and that was all. Anderson

never spoke a word to him, and his grief and jealousy

grew.

Anderson, walking along the shadowy street with

Charlotte's little hand in his arm, would have been ob-

livious to much more startling demonstrations than

poor Eddy's. He was profoundly agitated, stirred to

the depths, and for that very reason he acquitted him-

self with more dignity and quiet calm than usual. He

held himself with such a tight rein that his soul ached,

but he never relaxed his hold. He told himself that

it would be monstrous if by a word or gesture, by a

tone of the voice, he betrayed anything to this little,

innocent, timid, frightened girl on his arm. He never

dreamed of the remotest possibility of dreams on her

part. The soul beside him, seemingly separated only

350








<pb n="351"/>
THE DEBTOR

by thin walls of flesh, was in reality separated by

an abyss of the imagination. But every minute his

heart seemed to encompass her more and more tenderly,

seemed to enfold her, shielding her from itself with its

own love. Now and then he looked down at her, and

the sight of the little, pale, flower-like face turned tow-

ards his with a serious, guileless scrutiny, like a baby's,

caused him to fairly tremble with his passion of pro-

tection and adoration. They talked very little. Char-

lotte, if the truth were told, in spite of the tender nurs-

ing she had received, was still feeling rather shaken, and

she had also a curious sense of timid and excited happi-

ness, which tied her tongue and wove her thoughts even

into an incoherent dazzle. When Anderson spoke, it

was very coolly, on quite indifferent topics, and Char-

lotte answered him in her soft, rather unsteady little

voice, and then conversation lagged again. It was on

Anderson's tongue to question her closely as to her

entire recovery from her fright of the afternoon, but

he did not even do that, being afraid to trust his voice.

As they drew near the Carroll house, a doubt and per-

plexity which had been haunting Charlotte, assumed

larger proportions, and Anderson himself had a thought

also of the complication. Charlotte was wondering if

she should ask him in. She was wondering what her

mother and aunt would think. She knew what they

would do, of course-that is, so far as their reception

of the man who had befriended her, and whose mother

had befriended her was concerned. They were gentle-

women. And she knew quite certainly about her father.

But she wondered as to their real attitude, their mental

attitude, and she wondered still more with regard to

Anderson. Would he expect to be invited in? In

what fashion did he read his own social status in the

village. Anderson also was considering, during the last

of the way, if he should enter the Carroll house and pre-

35I








<pb n="352"/>
THE DEBTOR

sent his apologies and his mother's for having urged the

fugitive members of the family to remain, and he won-

dered a good deal as to the desirable course for him to

adopt, even supposing he were invited. While he had

no consciousness whatever of any loss of prestige among

people whom he had always known in the village, while,

in fact, he never gave it a thought-yet he knew reason-

ably that outsiders might possibly look at matters dif-

ferently, that his own unshaken estimate of himself, the

estimate which was the same in a grocery-store as in

a lawyer's office, might not be accepted. He recognized

the fact with amusement rather than indignation, but

he recognized it. He wondered how the girl would look

at it all, whether she would ask him in to make the ac-

quaintance of her family, and whether, if she did so he

should accept.

But Charlotte came to have no doubt whatever that

she should ask him. Suddenly a great wave of loyalty

towards this new friend came over her, loyalty and great

courage.

"Of course I shall ask him, when he has done all he

has for me, he and his mother," she decided. "I shall,

and I don't care what they think. I don't care.  He

is a gentleman, as much a gentleman as papa." Char-

lotte walked more erect, the pressure of her hand on

Anderson's arm tightened a little unconsciously. When

they reached the Carroll grounds she spoke very sweet-

ly, and not at all hesitatingly.

"You will come in and let my family thank you for

your kindness to me, Mr. Anderson," she said.

Anderson smiled down at her, and hesitated. "I do

not require any thanks. What I have done was only a

pleasure," he said. In his anxiety to control his voice,

he overdid the matter, and made it exceedingly cool.

"He means he would have done just the same for

any other girl, and it is silly for me to think he needs to

352

THE DEBTOR

be thanked so much for it," thought Charlotte, like a

flash. She was full of the hair-splitting fancies of young

girlhood in their estimate of a man. Her heart sank,

but she repeated, still sweetly, though now a little more

formally: "Then please come in and meet my father and

mother and aunt. I should like to have you know them,

and I am sure it would be a great pleasure to them."

"Thank you, Miss Carroll," Anderson said, slowly.

Then, while he hesitated, came suddenly the sound of

a shrill, vituperating voice from the house, a voice

raised in a solo-like effect, the burden of which seemed

both grief and rage, and contumely.

Eddy, who had given one of his dashes ahead, when

they reached the grounds, came flying back. "Say,"

he said, "there's an awful shindy in the house. The

dressmaker is pitching into papa for all she is worth,

and there are some other folks, but she's goin' it loud-

est; but they are all going it! Crackyl Hear 'eml"

Indeed, at that second the solo became a chorus.

The house seemed all clamorous with scolding voices.

The door stood open, and the hall-light streamed out

in the hall.

"Marie, she's in there, too," said Eddy, in an odd

sort of glee, "and Martin. They are all pitching into

papa for their money, but he's enough for them." It

became evident why the boy's voice was gleeful. He

was pitting his father, with the most filial pride and

confidence, against his creditors.

Anderson held out his hand to Charlotte. "Good-

night," he said, hastily, "and I hope you will feel no

ill effects to-morrow from your fright." Then he was

gone before Charlotte could say anything more.

"It's an awful shindy," Eddy said, still in that tone

of strange glee, to his sister. To his great amazement,

she caught him suddenly by his arm, the hurt one, but

he did not flinch.

353

The girl began to cry. "Oh, Eddy!" she sobbed,

pitifully. "Oh, Eddy dear!"

"What are you crying for, Charlotte?" asked Eddy,

giving his head a rough caressing duck against hers.

"Papa's enough for them; you know that. He ain't a

mite scared."

CHAPTER XXIX

ANDERSON, as he went away that night, had before

his eyes Charlotte's little face, the intensity of which

had seemed to make it fairly luminous in the dim light,

as she had turned it towards him. There was in that

face at once unreasoning and childish anger that he

was there at all, and in a measure a witness of the dis-

tress and disgrace of herself and her family, and a

piteous appeal for help-at once a forbidding and a be-

seeching. For Anderson, naturally, the forbidding seem-

ed most in evidence as an impulse to action. He felt

that he must withdraw immediately and save them all

the additional mortification that he could. So he hur-

ried away down the road, with the girl's face before his

eyes, and the sound of the scolding voice in the house in

his ears. The voice carried far. In spite of the wrath in

it, it was a sweet, almost a singing, voice, high-pitched

but sonorous. It was the voice of little Willy Eddy's

German wife, and it came from a pair of strong lungs in

a well-developed chest, and was actuated by a strong

and indignant spirit. Arthur Carroll, listening to her,

was conscious of an absurdly impersonal sentiment of

something like admiration. The young woman was

really in a manner superb. The occasion was trivial,

even ignoble. Carroll felt contemptuous both for her

and for himself, and yet she dignified it to a degree.

Minna Eddy was built on a large scale; she was both

muscular and stout. Her short, blue-woollen skirt, in-

creasing with its fulness her firm hips, disclosed gen-

355








<pb n="356"/>
THE DEBTOR

erously her sturdy feet and ankles, which had a certain

beauty of fitness as pedestals of support for her great

bulk of femininity. She had come out just as she had

been about her household tasks, and her cotton blouse,

of an incongruous green-figured pattern, was open at

the neck, disclosing a meeting of curves in a roseate

crease, and one sleeve, being badly worn, revealed a

pink boss of elbow. Minna Eddy had a distinctly hand-

some face, so far as feature and color went. It was a

harmonious combination of curves and dimples, all

overspread with a deep bloom, as of milk and roses,

and her fair hair was magnificent. She had a marvel-

lous growth both for thickness and length, and it was

plaited smoothly, covering the back of the head as

with a mat. She had come out with a blue handker-

chief tied over her head, but she had torn it off, and

waved it like a flag of battle in one fat, muscular hand

as she lifted on high her voice of musical wrath. She

spoke good English, although naturally tinctured by

the abuses of the country-side. She had come to Ameri-

ca before she could talk at all, and all her training had

been in the country. The only trace of her German

descent was in the sounds of certain letters, especially

d and v. She said t for d, and f for v. Carroll noticed

that as he noticed every detail. His senses seemed un-

naturally acute, as possibly any animal's may be when

at bay, and when the baiting has fairly begun.

A little behind Minna Eddy, and at her right, stood

her husband, with a face of utter discomfiture and ter-

ror. Now .and then he reached out a small, twitching

hand and made an ineffectual clutch at her elbow as

she talked on. At times he rolled terrified and appeal-

ing eyes at Carroll. He seemed even to be begging for

his partisanship, although the absurdity of that was

obvious.

"Oh, you other man," his eyes seemed to say, "see

356








<pb n="357"/>
THE DEBTOR

how terrible a woman can bel What can we do against

such might as this?" The room was quite full of peo-

ple, but Minna Eddy had the platform.

"You, you, you!" she repeated before every para-

graph of invective, like a prelude and refrain. "You,

you, you!" and she fairly hurled the words at Carroll

-" you, you, you! gettin' my man "-with a fierce back-

ward lunge of her bare right elbow towards her hus-

band, who shrank away, and a fierce backward roll of

a blue eye-" gettin' my man to take all his money and

spend it for no goot. You, you, you! When I haf need

of it for shoes and stockings for the children, when

I go with my dress in rags. You, you, youl"    She

went on and on, with a curious variety in the midst of

monotony. The stream of her invective flowed on like

a river with ever-new ripples. There was a species of

fascination in it for the man who was the object of it,

and there seemed to be also a compelling quality for

the others in the room. There had been no precon-

certed movement among Carroll's creditors, but a num-

ber of them had that evening descended upon him in

a body. In the parlor were the little dressmaker; the

druggist; the butcher; Tappan, the milkman; the two

stenographers, and Harrison Day, the clerk, who had

come on the seven-o'clock train from New York; two

men with whom he had dealings in a horse-trade; an

old man who had made the garden the previous spring;

and another butcher who had driven over from New

Sanderson. In the dining-room door stood Marie, the

Hungarian maid, and behind her was the coachman.

Carroll stood leaning against the comer of the mantel-

piece; some of the others were defiantly yet deprecat-

ingly seated, some were standing. Anna Carroll, quite

pale, with an odd, fixed expression, stood near her

brother. When Charlotte entered the house, she took

up a position in the hall, leaning against the wall, near

357








<pb n="358"/>
THE DEBTOR

the door. She could hear every word, but she was

quite out of sight. She leaned heavily against the wall,

for her limbs trembled under her, and she could scarcely

stand. Her aunt had looked around as she entered,

and a question as to where she had been had shaped

itself on her lips: then her look of inquiry and relief had

died away in her expression of bitter concentration

upon the matter in hand. She had been alarmed about

Charlotte, as they had all been. Mrs. Carroll had

called softly down the stairs to know if Charlotte had

come, and the girl had answered, "Yes, Amy dear."

"Where have you been, dear?" asked the soft voice,

from an indistinct mass of floating white at the head

of the stairs.

"I'll tell you by-and-by, Amy dear."

"I was alarmed about you," said the voice, "it was

so late; about you and Eddy."

"He has come, too."

"Yes, I heard him." Then the voice added, quite

distinctly petulant, "I have a headache, but it is so

noisy I cannot get to sleep." Then there was a rustle

of retreat, and Charlotte leaned against the wall, listen-

ing to the hushed turmoil surmounted by that voice of

accusation in the parlor. Eddy stood full in the door-

way, in a boyish, swaggering attitude, his hands on his

hips, and bent slightly, with sharp eyes of intense en-

joyment on Minna Eddy. Suddenly, Carroll turned and

caught sight of him, and as if perforce the boy's eyes

turned to meet his father's. Carroll did not speak, but

he raised his hand and pointed to the hall with an up-

ward motion for the stairs, and Eddy went, with a faint

whimper of remonstrance. The scolding woman saw

the little, retreating figure, and directly the torrent of

her vituperation was turned into a new course.

"You, you, you!" she proclaimed; "dressin' your boy

up in fine clothes, while mine children have went in

358








<pb n="359"/>
THE DEBTOR

rags since you have came to Banbridge! You, you, you!

gettin' all my man's money, and dressin' up your boy

in clothes that I haf paid for! You, you, you!"

But Minna Eddy had unwittingly furnished the right

key-note for a whole chorus. Madame Griggs, who had

been rocking jerkily in a small, red-plush chair which

squeaked faintly, sprang up, and left it still rocking and

squeaking.

"Yes," said she, "yes, that is so. Look at the way

the whole family dress, at other people's expense!"

She was hysterical still, yet she had not lost her

sense of the gentility of self-restraint. That would come

later. Her face worked convulsively, red spots were on

her thin cheeks, but there was still an ingratiating, some-

what servile, tone in her voice, and she looked scorn-

fully at Minna Eddy. Then J. Rosenstein, who kept

the principal dry-goods store in Banbridge, bore his

testimony. His grievances were small, but none the

less vital. His business dealings with the Carrolls had

been limited to sundry spools of thread and kitchen

towellings and buttons, but they were as lead in his

estimate of wrong, although he had a grave, introspec-

tive expression, out of proportion to the seeming trivial-

ity of the matter in his mind. He held in one long hand

a slip of paper, and eyed Carroll with dignified accu-

sation.

"This is the fifth bill I have made out," he remarked,

and he raised his voice to the pitch of his brethren of

the Bowery when they hawk in the street. "The fifth

bill I have made out, and it is only for one dollar and

fifty-three cents, and I am poor."

Iis intellectual Semitic face took on an ignoble ex-

pression of one who squeezes justice to petty ends for

his own deserts. Iis whine penetrated the rising chorus

of the other voices, even of the butcher, who was a

countryman of his own, and who said something with

24                  359








<pb n="360"/>
THE DEBTOR

dolorous fervor about the bill for meat which had been

running for six weeks, and not a dollar paid. He was

of a more common sort, and rendered a trifle indifferent

by a recent visit to a beer-saloon. He was also some-

what stupefied by an excess of flesh, as to the true

exigencies of life in general. After he had spoken he

coughed wheezily, settled his swelling bulk more com-

fortably in the red-velvet chair, and planted his wide-

apart, elephantine legs more firmly on the floor, while

he mentally appraised the Oriental rug beneath his

feet, with a view to the possibility of his taking that in

lieu of cash, and making a profitable bargain for its

ultimate disposal with a cousin in trade in New York.

Looking up, he caught Rosenstein's eyes just turning

from a regard of the same rug, and the two men's

thoughts met with a mental clash. Then the New

Sanderson butcher, who was a great, handsome, blond

man with a foam of yellow beard, German, but not Jew,

strolled silently over to them, and with sharp eyes on

the rug, conferred with the other two in low, eager

whispers. From that time they paid little attention

to what was going on around them. They talked, they

gesticulated, they felt of the rug.

Madame Griggs, settling her skirts genteelly, spoke

again. "I guess my bill has been running fully as long

as anybody's here," she said, in her small, shrill voice.

She eyed the two stenographers as she spoke, with

jealous suspicion. There was a certain smartness about

their attire, and she suspected them of being City dress-

makers. She also suspected the strange young man

with them of being a City lawyer, whom they had

brought with them to urge their claims. Madame

Stella Griggs had a ready imagination. The two stenog-

raphers had not spoken at all. From time to time the

prettier wept, softly, in her lace-edged handkerchief;

the other looked pale and nervous. Whenever she

360








<pb n="361"/>
THE DEBTOR

looked at Carroll her mouth quivered. The young man

sat still and winked furiously. He had discovered

Carroll's address and informed the girls, and they had

planned this descent upon their employer. Now they

were there, they were frightened and intimidated and

distressed. They were a gentle lot, of the sort that

are born to be led. Their resentment and sense of in-

justice overwhelmed them with grief, rather than a de-

sire for retaliation. They were in sore straits for their

money, yet all would have walked again into the snare,

and they regarded Carroll with the same awed admira-

tion as of old. No one but felt commiseration for him,

and trust in his ultimate payment of their wages. They

regarded the other creditors with a sort of mild con-

tempt. They felt themselves of another kind, especial-

ly from the Germans and Jews. When Willy Eddy's

wife had declaimed, one stenographer had whispered

to the other, "How vulgar!" and the other had respond-

ed with a nod and curl of a lip of scorn. They met

Madame Griggs's hostile regard with icy stares. The

less pretty girl said to the young man that she thought

it was mean for a dressmaker to come there and hound

folks like that, and he nodded, winking disapprovingly

at poor Madame Griggs, who was just then cherishing

the wild idea of consulting him for herself in his supposed

capacity of a lawyer. The stenographer, turning from

her remark to the clerk, met the laughing but imperti-

nent gaze of one of the horse-trading men, and she

turned her back upon him with an emphasis that pro-

voked a chuckle from his companion.

"Got it in the shoulder then, Bill," he remarked,

quite audibly, and the other reddened and grinned fool-

ishly. They were rough-looking men with a certain

swagger of smartness. They regarded Carroll with a

swearing emphasis, yet with a measure of reluctantly

compelled admiration.

"I'll be damned if he ain't the first that ever got the

better of Jim Dickerson," one had said to the other, as

they had driven up to the house that evening. "I'll

be - damned if I see now how he got the better of

me," the other rejoined, with a bewildered expression.

As he spoke his mind revolved in the devious mesh of

trap which he had set for Carroll, and realized the clean

cutting of it by Carroll by the ruthless method of self-

interest. Neither man had spoken besides a defiant

response to Carroll's polite "Good-evening," when they

had entered. They sat and watched and listened.

Occasionally one raised a hand, and an enormous dia-

mond glowed with a red light like a ruby. In the four-

in-hand tie of the other a scarf-pin in the shape of a

horse's head with diamond eyes caught the light with

infinitesimal sparks of fire. Above it his clean-shaven,

keen, blue-eyed face kept watch, sharply ready to strike

anger as the diamonds struck light, and yet with a cer-

tain amusement. He had shown his teeth in a smile

when Willy Eddy's wife pronounced her tirade. He did

so again when she reopened, having regained her wind.

When she spoke this time, she glared at Anna Carroll

with a dazzling look of spite.

"There ain't no red silk dresses for me to rig out in,"

said she, and she pointed straight at Anna's silken skirts.

"No, there ain't, and there won't be, so long as my

man's money goes to pay for hers." She said "hers"

with a harder emphasis than if she said "yours."

Anna never returned her vicious look, she never moved

a muscle of her handsome face, nor changed color. She

continued to stand beside her brother, with a curious

expression of wide partisanship, and of regard for these

people as objects of offence as a whole, rather than as

individuals.

"Folks can pretend to be deaf if they want to," said

Minna Eddy, "but they hear, an' they'll hear more."

362








<pb n="363"/>
"That was fifteen dollars beside the findings, and they

amounted to twelve dollars and sixty-three cents more,"

said Madame Griggs, and this time she addressed the

young man whom she took to be a lawyer. She met

his nervous winks with a piteous smile of appealing

confidence. She wondered if possibly he might not be

willing to undertake her cause in connection with the

other supposed dressmakers' at a reduced rate. No-

body paid the slightest attention when she spoke, Anna

Carroll least of all.

Suddenly, Henry Lee tiptoed into the room. He came

in smiling and nervous. When he saw the assembled

company he started, and gave an inquiring glance at

Carroll, who regarded him in an absent-minded fashion,

as if he hardly comprehended the fact of his entrance.

It was the glance of a man whose mind is too crowded

to admit of more. But Lee went close to him, bowing

low to Anna, and extending his hand with urbanity,

flustered, it is true, yet still with urbanity.

"Good-evening, captain," he said, and even then, in

sore distress of mind as he was, he looked about at the

company for admiration for this proof of his intimacy

with such a man.

"Good-evening," Carroll said, mechanically, and he

shook hands. Anna Carroll also said "Good-evening,"

and smiled automatically.

"A fine evening," said Lee, but he got no rejoinder

to that. He looked at the company, and his small, smug,

fatuous face, which was somewhat pale and haggard,

frowned with astonishment. Again he looked for in-

formation into Carroll's unanswering face. He looked at

an empty chair near him; then he looked at Carroll and

his sister standing, and did not seat himself. He also

leaned against the mantel on the other corner from

Carroll, and endeavored to assume an unconcerned air,

as if it were quite the usual thing for him to drop into

363








<pb n="364"/>
THE DEBTOR

th9 house and encounter such a nondescript company.

He looked across at the druggist and postmaster, and

bowed with flourishing politeness. He said to Carroll,

endeavoring to make his voice so unobtrusive that it

would be unheard by the company, but with the non-

success usual to a nervous and self-conscious man, that

he had a word to say to him later on when he was at

liberty, some matter of business which he wished to

talk over with him.

"Very well," Carroll replied. Then Lee followed up

his remark, which had in a measure reassured him.

"Got a cigar handy, captain?" said he. "1 came off

without one in my pocket."

Carroll took out his cigar-case and extended it to

Lee, who took a cigar, bit the end off, and scratched a

match. Carroll handed the case mechanically to the

postmaster and Drake, who were near. They refused,

and he took one himself, as if he did not realize what

he was doing, and lit it, his calm, impassively smiling

face never changing, He might have been lighting a

bomb instead of a cigar, for all the actual realization of

the action which he had.. He accepted a light from Lee,

who had lit his first with trembling haste. At the first

puff which he gave, at the first evidence of the fragrant

aroma in the room, one turbulent spirit, which had

hitherto remained under restraint, burst bounds and

overwhelmed all besides. Even Minna Eddy, who was

fast warming to a new outburst, even Madame Griggs,

who had both hands pressed to her skinny throat be-

cause of a lump of emotion there, and whose sunken

temples were beating to the sight under the shade of her

protuberant frizzes, looked in a hush of wonder and

alarm at this furious champion of his own wrongs.

Even the two butchers and the dry-goods merchant

looked away from the glowing Oriental web upon which

they stood. The weeping stenographer sat with her

364

damp little wad of lace-edged handkerchief in her hand

and stared at him with her reddened eyes; the other

held her flaccid purse, and looked at the speaker. Now

and then she nudged violently the friend, who did not

seem to notice it.

Tappan, the milkman, arose to his feet. He had

been sitting with a stiff sprawl in the comer of a small

divan. He arose when the fragrance of that Havana

cigar smote his nostrils like the odor of battle. He was

in great boots stained with the red shale, for the roads

outside Banbridge were heavy from a recent rain. He

was collarless, his greasy coat hung loosely over his

dingy flannel shirt. He was unshaven, and his face

was at once grim and sardonic, bitter and raging. It

was the face of an impotent revolutionist, who cursed

his impotence, his lack of weapons, his wrong environ-

ments for his fierce spirit. He belonged in a country

at war. He had the misfortune to be in a country at

peace. He belonged in a field of labor wherein weapons

and armed men, sown by the need of justice, sprang

from the soil. He was in a bucolic pasture, with no

appeal. He was a striker with nothing save fate against

which to strike. He raged behind prison-bars of circum-

stance. Now, for once, was an enemy for his onslaught,

although even here he was restricted. He was held in

check by his ignoble need. He feared lest, in smiting

with all the force at his command, the blow recoil upon

himself. He feared lest he lose all where he might lose

only part. But when he began to speak his caution

left him. There was real fire in the grim, unshaven

man; the honest fire of resentment against wrong, the

spirit of self-defence against odds. He was big enough

to disregard self-interest in his defence; and he was im-

pressive. He sniffed as a preliminary to his speech,

and there was in that sniff fury, sarcasm; and malignancy.

Then he opened his mouth, and before the words came

365








<pb n="366"/>
THE DEBTOR

a laugh or the travesty of one. There was something

menacing in his laugh. Then he spoke.

"Cigar!" he said. "Have a cigar? Will you have

a cigar? Oh yes, a cigar." His voice was murder-

ously low and soft. He even lisped slightly. "A

cigar," he repeated. "A cigar. Oh, Lord! If men

like me git a hand of chewing-tobacco once a month,

they think they are damned lucky. Cigar, Lord!"

Then the soft was out of his voice. He cut his words

short, or rather he seemed to hammer them down into

the consciousness of his auditors. He turned upon

the others. " Want to know how that good-for-nothin'

liar an' thief gits them cigars?" he shouted. "Want to

know? Well, I'll tell you. I give 'em to him, an'

you did. How many of you can smoke cigars like

them, hey? Smell 'em. Ten or fifteen cents apiece;.

mebbe more. We give 'em to him. Yes, sir, that's

jest what we did. He took the money he owed us for

milk and meat and dress-makin' an' other things to buy

them cigars. You got up early an' worked late to pay

for 'em; he didn't. I got up at half-past three o'clock

in the mornin'-half-past three in the winter, when he

was asleep in his bed, damn him. The time will come

when he won't sleep more than some other folks. I

got up at half-past three o'clock, and I snatched a

mouthful of breakfast, fried cakes and merlasses, that

he'd 'a' turned up his nose at. He had beefsteak an'

eggs at our expense, he did, an' I had a cup of damned

weak coffee, cause I was too honest or too big a fool,

whichever you call it, to buy any coffee I couldn't pay

for. He'd 'a' turned up his nose at sech coffee. An'

I went without sugar in it, an' I went without milk,

so's to give it to him, so's he could git cigars. And as

for cream, cream, cream! Lord! Couldn't git enough

cream to give him. He was always yellin' for cream.

Cream! My wife an' me would no more of thought

of our puttin' cream in our coffee than we'd thought

of putting in five-dollar gold pieces to sweeten it. No,

we saved the cream for him. My wife don't look so

young and fat as his wife. His wife has been fed on

our cream." Tappan looked hard at Anna Carroll,

whom he evidently took for Carroll's wife. He took

notef of her dress. "My wife never had a silk gown,"

said he. "Lord! I guess she didn't! She had to git

up as early as I did, an' wash milk-pans, so we could

give milk to that man, an' he could save money on us

to git his wife a silk gown. Lord! Jest look-"

Then Madame Griggs spoke, her small, deprecatory

snarl raised almost to hysterical pitch. She was catch-

ing the infection of this bigger resentment and sense of

outraged justice.

"He didn't save money to git his wife that silk gown

with your milk money," said she, "for I made that

gown, an' I got the material, an' I 'ain't been paid a cent.

That was one of the gowns I made when Ina was mar-

ried. That silk cost a dollar and a quarter a yard. I

could have got it at ninety-eight cents at a bargain,

but that wa'n't good enough for her. He didn't take

your milk money for that. He didn't take any money

to pay anybody for anything he could run in debt for,

I can tell you that. He must have paid somebody that

wouldn't wait an' wouldn't be cheated."

"Must have been dealin' with a trust, then," said one

of the horsemen, with a loud laugh. "Guess he's been

cheatin' 'most everything else."

"And that lady ain't his wife, neither," said Madame

Griggs to Tappan. "That's his sister. I made an-

other gown for his wife, a lighter shade, an' I 'ain't been

paid for that, neither." Suddenly she burst into a

hysterical wail. "Oh, dear!" she sobbed. "Oh, dear!

the mornin' before light an' worked till most dawn, an'

.worked so hard to build. up my business, an' tried to

Oh, dear!" Suddenly she made a weak rush across the

room, her silk petticoat giving out a papery rustle, her

frizzes vibrating like wire under her hat, crested with

ostrich plumes. She danced up to Carroll and looked

at ;him with indescribable piteousness of accusation.

"Why couldn't you, if you had to cheat, cheat a man

an' not a woman like me?" she demanded, in her high-

pitched tremolo.

Carroll took his cigar from his mouth and looked at

her. His face was quite pale and rigid. Even Tappan

stopped, watching the two. Madame Griggs held up,

with almost a sublimity of accusation, her tiny, ner-

vous, veinous hands., The fingers were long and the

knuckles were slightly enlarged with strenuous pullings

of needles and handling of scissors: the forefinger was

calloused. "Look at my hands," said she. "See how

thin they be. I've worked them 'most to the bone for

your folks. I took a lot of pride in havin' your daughter

look: nice when she was married. If I was a man an'

goit'- to steal,- I'd steal from somebody besides a wom-

an with no more strength than I have, all alone in the

world', and that's been knocked hard ever since she can

remember." Then she brought a stiffly starched little

handkerchief from the folds of a small purse, and she

wept with'a low, querulous wail like a baby. Standing

before Carroll, "Oh, dear! Oh,' dear! Oh-dear!" she

wailed.

Carroll laid a hand on her shaking shoulder. It felt

to him like a vibrating bone, so meagre it was. He

bent over her and said something that the others did not

hear, but her wild rejoinder gave 'them the key. She

was fairly desperate; all her obsequiousness had disap-

peared. ,She was burning with her wrongs; she even

took a certain pleasure in letting herself loose. She

shook,;her shoulder free from his touch. She turned

on him, her tearful, convulsed face uncovered, her

frizzes tossing, as bold and unrestrained in her wrath

as was Minna Eddy, who came forward to her side as

she spoke.

"You needn't come wheedlin' around me," she cried.

"I don't believe a word of it, not a word. " I'll believe

it when I see the color of your cash. You're dreadful

soft-spoken, an' so is your wife an' your sister an' your

daughters. Dreadful soft-spoken! Plenty of soft soap

runnin' all over every time you open your mouth. I

don't want soft soap. Soft soap won't buy me bread

an' butter, nor pay my debts. Folks won't take any

soft soap from me instead of money. They want dol-

lars an' cents, an' that's what'I want every time, dol-

lars an' cents, an' not soft soap. Yes, it's dollars an'

-cents-and not so-ft soa-p."    Suddenly the dress-

maker, borne high on a wave of hysteria, disclosing the

innate coarseness which underlay all her veneer of

harmless gentility and fine manners, raised a loud, shrill

laugh, ending in a multitude of reverberations like a

bell. There was about this unnatural metallic laughter

something fairly blood-curdling in its disclosure of over-

strained emotion. She laughed and laughed, while the

room was silent except for that, and every eye was fixed

upon her. Poor, little Estella Griggs, of all that accus-

ing company of Arthur Carroll's petty creditors, had

the floor. She laughed and laughed. She threw back

her head. Her plumed hat was tilted rakishly one side;

her frizzes tossed high above her forehead, revealing the

meagre temples; her skinny throat seemed to elongate

abovea her ribboned collar; her thin cheeks, folded into

a fitltitude of lines by her distorting mirth, glowed

369








<pb n="370"/>
THE DEBTOR

with a hard red; her eyes gleamed with a glassy brilliance.

Then, suddenly, that long, skinny throat seemed to swell

visibly. She choked and gurgled, then came a wild burst

of sobbing. Hysteria had reached its second stage. It

was frightful.

"Good God!" said one of the horsemen, under his

breath.

"That's so," said the other. "Let's git out of this."

They elbowed their way out of the room. "See you

again," one of them said, curtly, to Carroll as he passed.

"See you to-morrow about that little affair of ours,

an' by G-, you've got to pony up, you can take your

oath on that, an' don't you forget it," whispered the

other in Carroll's ear, with a fierce emphasis, and yet

he half grinned with a masculine sympathy in this ultra

crisis.

"It's gitting too thick," said the other horseman.

"See you to-morrow, and, by G-, you've got to do

somethin' or there'll be trouble."

Carroll nodded. He was ashy white. He had strong

nerves, but he was delicately organized, man though he

was, and with unusual self-control. He felt now a set

of sensations verging on those displayed by the laugh-

ing, sobbing woman before him. He was conscious of

an insane desire to join in that laugh, in those sobbing

shrieks. His throat became constricted, his hands be-

came as ice. The tragic absurdity of the situation filled

him at once with a monstrous mirth and grief. The an-

titheses of emotion struggled together within him. He

looked at the little, frantic creature before him, and

opened his mouth to speak, but he said nothing. Anna

Carroll caught his elbow.

"Come away, Arthur," she whispered.

She was trembling herself, but she had been braced

to something of this kind from being a woman herself,

and was not so intimidated. Carroll strove to speak

37o

again. Minna Eddy suddenly joined in her torrent of

vituperation with the dress -maker's. She caught up

the soft-soap idea with a peal of laughter more sustained

than that of Madame Griggs, for she had a better poise

of mentality, and her wrath was untempered with the

grief and self-pity of a small, helpless woman who was

fitted by nature for petting rather than for warfare.

"Soft soap!" shouted Minna Eddy, while her small

husband vainly clutched at her petticoats. "Soft soap!

Lord! I makes my own soft soap. I has plenty to

clean with. I don't want no soft soap. I want money."

She laughed loud and long, a ringing, mocking peal.

Madame Griggs's loud sobbing united with it. The dis-

sonance of unnatural mirth and grief was ghastly.

"Good God! Hear them!" whispered Sigsbee Ray

to the druggist.

"I'd rather owe fifty men than one woman," the

druggist whispered back.

Lee edged nearer the women and strove to speak. He

had a purpose.

Carroll, gazing at the women in a fascinated way,

again opened his mouth in vain, and again Anna dragged

backward at his arm.

"For Heaven's sake, Arthur, come out of this," she

whispered, and he yielded for the second. He let him-

self be impelled to the door, then suddenly he recovered

himself and stepped forward with an accession of dig-

nity and authority which carried weight even in the

face of hysterical unreason. He raised his hand and

spoke, and there was a hush. Madame Griggs and

Minna Eddy remained quiet, like petrified furies, re-

garding the man's pale face of assertive will.

"I beg you to be quiet a moment and listen to me,"

he said. " I can do nothing for any of you to-night, and,

what is more, I will not do anything to-night. It is im-

possible for me to deal with you in such an unexpected

fashion as this, in such numbers. I have not gone into

bankruptcy; no meeting of my creditors had been called.

I have and you have no legal representative here. Now

I am going, and I advise you all to do likewise. I beg

you to excuse me. I know you all, I know the amount

of my indebtedness to you all, and I promise you all,

if I live, the very last dollar I owe you shall be paid.

You must, however, give me a little time, or nobody will

get anything. I will communicate with you all later on.

Nobody shall lose anything, I say. Now you must ex-

cuse me.

"Look at him; he's sick," whispered the pretty

stenographer to the other, whose soft, little sob of re-

sponse alone broke .the hush as Carroll went out with

his sister at his side. Their shadows moved across the

room as they ascended the stairs in the hall. The credi-

tors, left alone, regarded one another in a hesitating

fashion. The two women, Minna Eddy and- Estella

Griggs, remained quiet. Presently the two. butchers

and the dry-goods merchant, standing. about the Orienital

rug, quite a fine Bokhara, resumed their whispered, aol-

loquy regarding it, then they went out.  Lee began

talking to the druggist and the postmaster, with Willie

Eddy at his elbow listening eagerly., 

"Carroll's sick," said Lee, with a curious effect of

partisanship towards himself, as well as CarrolL . "He's

sick, and it is too bad. His. nerves are:a wreck."

"Well, our nerves are becoming wrecks," the post-

master rejoined, dryly..        .;            .

"That's so," said the druggist, with a worried. look.

"I don't know but I'll have to mortgage my stock. - I've

lost more than I can afford in that United Fuei," '.  ,

"I don't like to own up I've been bit," said the post-

master, "but when it comes to being sick, -and. nerves

being wrecks, there are others with full as much reason.as

Carroll."                      .           .  :  ,

"He'll pay up every cent," said Lee, eagerly.

"Maybe he will pay his debts," said the postmaster.

"I am not going to say he won't. I suppose he means

to. But when it comes to making things good, when

he has simply led you by the nose into disastrous specu-

lations, I don't know. Bigger men than Arthur Carroll

don't do it."

"That's so," said Drew. "It's one thing to pay your

butcher's bill in the long run, and be above stealing.

goods off the counter, but a man can cheat his fellow-

men in a stock trade and think pretty well of himself,

and other folks think well of him.

"That's so," said Sigsbee Ray.

"I haven't any doubt that he will arrange that," said

Lee. "And, for that matter, the United Fuel may look

up yet. I had a prospectus-"

"Prospectus be damned!" said the postmaster. He

seldom used an oath, and his tongue made a vicious

lurch over it.

Madame Estella Griggs, Willy Eddy, and his wife. The

coachman heard a noise of pounding in the stable and

ran out. Marie remained in the doorway looking at

the others with her piteous red eyes; Minna Eddy ad-

vanced towards her.

"They owe you your wages, don't they?" said she,

with no sympathy, but rather a menace.

Little Marie shrank back. "Yis," said she, pursing

her lips.

"You're a fool!" said Minna Eddy.

Marie smiled feebly at her.

Minna Eddy stood glaring around the room. Her

husband was at her elbow, watching her anxiously.

"Come home now, Minna," he pleaded.

But she stamped her foot suddenly. "I ain't goin'

to stand it!" she declared. "I'm goin' to take what I

can get, I be." Her eyes rested first upon one thing,

then another, then she looked hard at the Oriental rug,

which the three tradesmen had discussed. Then she

swooped upon it and began gathering it up from the

floor.

"Oh, Minna! Oh, Minna!" gasped little Willy Eddy.

"You lemme be," she said, fiercely. "I see'd them

men lookin' at this. It ain't handsome, but it's worth

good money. I heard something they said. I ain't

goin' to lose all that money. I'm goin' to take what I

can git, I be."

"Minna, you-"

"Lemme be."

"It ain't accordin' to law, Minna."

"What do you s'pose I care about the law?" She

turned to Estella Griggs, who was watching her eagerly,

with a gathering light of fierce greed in her eyes. "If

you take my advice you'll help yourself to something

while you have the chance," said she.

"Oh, Minna, it's stealin'! You'll be liable-"

374








<pb n="375"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Liable to nothin'. Stealin'! If folks don't steal

no more 'n I do, I'll risk 'em. I'm a-takin' my lawful

pay, I be. If you take my advice, you'll take some-

thin', too."

Minna Eddy moved from the room with the rug gath-

ered up in a roll in her arms, but Marie had been grad-

ually recovering herself. Now she came forward.

"You must not take that; that iss not your rug,"

said she. "You must not take that."

"Git out," said Minna Eddy. She thrust at the

Hungarian with her rug-laden arms, but the little peas-

ant was as strong as she. Marie caught hold of the

rug and pulled; Minna also pulled.

"You lemme go," said Minna, with a vicious voice,

but lowered, for obvious reason.

"You must not take that," said Marie. She was,

however, rather fainter-hearted than the other woman.

Minna suddenly got the mastery. The Hungarian

almost tumbled backward. Minna, with the rug, was

out of the room, her trembling, almost whimpering hus-

band at her heels. Madame Griggs looked at Marie.

Her distorted face was at once greedy, anguished, and

cunning. She began to gasp softly.

"Oh! Oh!" said she. "Oh!"

Marie regarded her in wondering agitation.

" Water! water! quick! Oh, get some water!" moaned

Madame Griggs. "I am faint! Water!" She sank

into a chair, her head fell back. She rolled her eyes at

the terrified girl; she gasped feebly between her parted

lips.

Marie ran. Then up rose Madame Estella Griggs.

She swept the tea-table of its little Dresden service and

some small, silver spoons. She gathered them up in a

little, lace-trimmed table-cover, and she fled with that

booty and a sofa-pillow which she caught from the

divan on her way out.

When Marie returned she stood gaping with the glass

of water. She was not over-shrewd, but she took in at

once the situation. She understood that the second

lady had fled like the first, with the teacups, the spoons,

the table-cover, and the sofa-pillow. She stood looking

desolately around the room, and her simple heart tasted

its own bitterness.

CHAPTER XXX

CHARLOTTE had followed her father and aunt up-

stairs that night, starting up softly like a shadow from

her place in the hall. She went silently behind them

until they reached the open door of Anna's room; then

her father turned and saw her.

"You here, Charlotte?" he said.

"Yes, papa," replied Charlotte, turning a pitiful but

altogether stanch little face up to his.

He put his arm around her; drew her head against his

shoulder, tipped up her face, and kissed her. "Go to

bed now, darling," he whispered.

"Papa, I can't; I-"

"There is nothing you can do, sweetheart; there is

nothing for you to worry about. Papa will take care

of you always, whatever happens. Go to bed now, and

go to sleep, honey."

"But, papa, I can't sleep. Let me stay and-"

"No, dear. There is nothing you can do. It will

only worry me to have you stay. Go to bed, and put all

this out of your mind. It will all come right in the end."

Carroll kissed Charlotte again, and put her gently

from him, and she disappeared in her own room with a

suppressed sob.

"I am glad Ina is out of the way," Anna said, but

with no bitterness.

"So am I," Carroll agreed, simply.

"I wish Charlotte had as good a man to look out for

her," said Anna,

377








<pb n="378"/>
THE DEBTOR

Carroll straightened himself with quick pride. "I

shall look out for her," he said. "You need not think

I am quite out of the running yet, when it comes to look-

ing out for my own flesh and blood."

"No, of course you are not, Arthur. I did not mean

to imply any such thing," Anna rejoined, hastily. "I

was only-   Come into my room. Amy is fast asleep

by this time, and if she is not she has a headache, and

you might as well try to consult with an infant in arms

as Amy with a headache. And something has to be

done."

"Yes, you are right, Anna," Carroll replied, with a

heavy sigh.

"Those people will all go when they get tired of wait-

ing. There is no use in our bothering with them any

more to-night. Come in."

Anna led the way into her room, and closed the door.

A lamp burned dimly on the dresser amid a confusion

of laces and ribbons. The whole room looked in a soft

foam of dainty disorder. Anna did not turn the light

up. She stood looking at her brother in the half-light,

and her face was at once angry and tender.

"Well?" said she, with a sigh of desperate inquiry.

"Well?" rejoined Carroll.

"What next?"

"The Lord knows!"

"Something has to be done. We are up against a

dead wall again. And for some reason it strikes me as

a deader wall than ever before."

Carroll nodded.

"We cannot stay in Banbridge any longer?" Anna

said, interrogatively.

"We may have to," Carroll replied, curtly.

"You mean?"

"There may be a little difficulty about getting out.

We could not leave the State, anyhow, and-"

378








<pb n="379"/>
THE DEBTOR

"And what? We can go somewhere else in the State,

I suppose. I am not particularly in love with this sec-

tion of the union, but it all makes little difference after

one reaches a certain point."

"Poor old girl!" said Carroll.

Anna looked at him, and her#yes suffused and her

mouth quivered. Then she smiled her usual smile of

mocking courage, even bravado. "Ohs well," said she,

"I have faced the situation and chewed my cud of ex-

perience for a good many years now, and I am used to

it. I may even end up by tasting the sweet in the

bitter."

"You had as hard an experience in another line as

I had. I don't know but it was harder."

"No harder, I reckon," Anna replied, almost indiffer-

ently. "It was the same thing-the doll stuffed with

sawdust, and all that; you with a friend, and I with a

lover. Well, it is all over now."

"It isn't; that is the worst of it," Carroll said, gloomily.

"I don't see why."

"A sequence is never over. There is even all eternity

for it."

"Well, the first of the sequence is over, anyhow.

All we have to consider is the succeeding stages."

"That is about enough."

Anna laughed. "I agree with you there, dear. Well,

I suppose the stage of the sequence fdr immediate con-

sideration is the feasibility of emerging into the next

stage. You think it is likely to be more difficult for

the wandering tribe of Carrollito make their exodus

with grace and dignity than usual?"

"It rather looks that way now."

"I suppose that promoting business, that business

transacted in the New York office, got you into rather

hotter waters than usual."

Carroll nodded,

379








<pb n="380"/>
THE DEBTOR

"There was an office, I suppose."

Carroll nodded again, laughing a little. Anna laughed

too. "One never knows," said she. "I suppose that

was a delegation from the office, to-night, the two pretty

girls and the winking young man."

"Yes," said Carroll.

Anna had flung herself into an easy-chair beside him.

Carroll remained standing. She leaned her head back

and crossed her hands behind her neck in a way she

had. She was a thing of lithe grace in her soft red silk.

The dim light obliterated all the worn lines in her face.

Carroll regarded her even in the midst of the distressful

stress of affairs with a look of admiration. It was an

absent-minded regard, very much as a mourner might

notice a stained-glass window in a church while a funeral

was in progress. It was the side-light of grace on

affliction involuntarily comprehended, from long train-

ing, by the exterior faculties. Carroll even said, half

perfunctorily:

"You look well to-night. That red gown suits you,

honey."

"The gown that that poor little beggar of a dress-

maker is not paid for," said Anna.

Carroll frowned. "I did not have enough for that,"

he said. "It was impossible. I paid the other bills."

"All dressmakers have to be cheated," said Anna.

"I never knew one that wasn't. I may as well reap

the benefit of a universal law of cause and result, as

some other woman." Her voice rang hard, but she

looked up affectionately at her brother. Suddenly she

reached out her hand, caught his, and kissed it. "There

is one thing we Carrolls pay in full, and never run in

debt for, and that is our affection for and belief in one

another," said she. "We have our hearts full of one

coin, anyway."

"I suppose the world at large would prefer our pock-

380








<pb n="381"/>
THE :DEBTOR

ets full of the coin of the realm," answered Carroll, but he

looked fondly down at his sister.

"I suppose so. If I had not worn this dress, I should

send it back to that dressmaker."

"But you have worn it." 

"Oh yes. Of course it is 'ut of the question now.

It is very pretty. Well, Arthur, if we go back far

enough we are not responsible for this dress. We are

responsible for none of the disasters whioh-follow in our

wake. That man down in Kentucky precipitated the

whole thing. Arthur, you do look like a fiend when-

ever I mention that man!"

"I feel like one," Carroll replied, coolly.

"Well, that man was directly responsible for the

whole wreck- the general wreck, I, mean,. My own

wreck is an individual matter, and, after :all, I never

fairly lowered my sails for that especial gale. I never

will own to it."                      *

"You were a brave girl, Anna," 

"But the other wreck, the whole wreck, that man of

yours is responsible for. And we were :nb1:half a bad

lot, Arthur.".                  . . 

"Maybe not; but when the ship breaks. up, it does

not make so much difference what the timbers were,

nor how she was built." 

"I suppose you are right. Well, what is to be done

with the old masts and sails and things?"

" I know what is to be done with a part of it."

"What part of it ?": :       -    -

" Well, to depart from similes, the female contingency."

"The female contingency ?"

"Yes, and the juvenile: You and Amy and Char-

lotte and Eddy."

"What do you mean, Arthur?"

"You are going down to Kentucky to the old place,

to spend the winter with Aunt Catherine."

38I








<pb n="382"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Aunt Catherine wrote you?"

"Yes."

"When?"

"I got the letter day before yesterday."

"She invited us?"

"Yes, honey."

"Not you?"

"There was no reason why she should invite me."

"Aunt Catherine never had any feeling for you."

"Perhaps she has had as much as I deserve. You

know I have, to put it frankly, rather broken the record

of an honorable family for-"

"For what?"

"For honor, dear."

Then Anna broke out, passionately. "I don't care!

I don't care!" she cried. " I don't care what she thinks;

I don't care what anybody thinks! I don't care what

you do or don't do, you are the best man that ever

lived, Arthur." She began to weep suddenly, feeling

blindly for her handkerchief.

Carroll pulled her head against his shoulder. " Dear,"

he whispered, don't; you must not, darling, you are worn

out. You are not well."

"Arthur, are you sure-are you sure that you have

not rendered yourself liable? Arthur, are you sure that

they cannot arrest you for anything you have done

this time ?"

"Quite sure, Anna."

"You have looked out for that?"

"Yes."

"They can't arrest you?"

"No. Anna, you are nervous."

"Martin was impudent yesterday, when you were out,

about his pay. He talked about going to a lawyer."

Carroll made an impatient movement. "If he does

not stop coming to you about it-"

382








<pb n="383"/>
THE DEBTOR

"He is afraid of you. Then Marie came and cried.

She says she has lost her lover, because she did not have

decent clothes to wear."

"Anna, they shall not trouble you again. Don't,

dear. Why, I never knew you to fret so before!"

"I never did. I never minded ijall so much before.

I think I am ill. There is a dull pai all the time in the

back of my neck, and I do not sleep at all well. Then

my mental attitude seems suddenly to have changed.

I was capable of defiance always, of seeing the humor

in the situation, even if it was such an oft-repeated joke,

and such a mighty poor one; but now, even if I start

with a glimpse of the funny side of it, suddenly I col-

lapse, and all at once I am beaten."

Carroll stroked her graceful, dark head. "There is

nothing for it but you must go, honey."

"Arthur, I will not. It may be better for the others,

but as for me, I will not."

"Yes, you will, Anna, honey."

"Arthur Carroll!"

"YQU must, dear. Frankly, Anna, you know how

I shall feel about parting with you all, but it will be a

load off my mind. If a man is not able to care for his

own, it is better for him and for them that they should

go where they will be cared for."

"You need not speak in that way, Arthur. You have

done all you could. All this would never have been if

it had not been for us, and your wanting us to have

everything. We have been a helpless lot. None of

us have ever blamed you or complained, not even Amy,

baby as she is."

"I know it, dear, but it is better for you all to go."

"You have done all you could, always," Anna re-

peated, in a curious, sullen fashion.

"Well, we will leave that. If Aunt Catherine takes

you all this winter, it will go hard if I do not pay her in

383








<pb n="384"/>
THE DEBTOR

some way later on; but the point is now, you must all

go."

Anna shook her head obstinately.

Carroll bent down and kissed her. "Good-night, dear,"

he said. "Try to sleep."

"I wonder if those people are all gone."

"Yes, I think so. I heard Marie lock the door. Good-

night."

Anna rose and threw her arms around her brother's

neck. "Whatever happens, you have got your old

sister left," she said, with a soft sob.

"Nobody is going to attach her for my debts," Car-

roll said, laughing, but stroking her head fondly.

"No, she is not an available asset. I never will go,

Arthur. The others may do as they think best. I will

not go."

"Not to-night, Anna, honey," Carroll said, as he went

out of the room.

Anna Carroll, left alone, rose languidly, unfastened

her red silk gown, and let it fall in a rustling circle around

her. She let down her soft, misty lengths of hair, in

which was a slight shimmer of white, and brushed it.

Standing before her dresser, using her ivory - backed

brush with long, even strokes, her reflected face showed

absolutely devoid of radiance. The light was out of it

-the light of youth, and, more than the light of youth,

the light of that which survives youth, even the soul

itself. And yet there was in this face, so unexpectant

and quiescent that it gave almost the effect of dulness,

a great strength and charm which were the result of an

enduring grace of attitude towards all the stresses'of

life. Anna Carroll carried about with her always, not

for the furbishing of her hair nor the embellishment of

her complexion, but for the maintenance of. the grace

and dignity of her bearing towards a hard and inscrutable

fate, a species of mental looking-glass. She never for

THE DEBTOR

a minute lost sight of herself as reflected in it. She had

not been a happy woman, but she had worn her unhap-

piness like a robe of state. She had had a most miser-

able love-affair in her late youth, but no one except her

brother could have affirmed with any certainty that it

had occasioned her a lnoment's pang.

She was hopeless as regarded any happiness for her-

self in a strictly personal sense. She knew that her

destiny as a woman had been unfulfilled, but she would

rather have killed herself than pitied herself. She was

as hard to herself and her own possible weakness as she

was to anybody on earth, possibly harder. She cheated

the dressmaker, she ate at the expense of others, as she

would have cheated herself had she known how. It

did not occur to her to go without anything which she

could by any means get; not because she wanted it so

keenly, as from another phase of the same feeling which

had led Minna Eddy to appropriate the rug, and Estella

Griggs the paraphernalia of the tea-table and the sofa-

pillow. She had herself been duped in a larger sense;

she was a creditor of Providence. She considered that

she had a right to her hard wages of mere existence,

when they came in her way, were they in the form of

red silk gowns or anything else. She would admit no

wrong in her brother, for the same reason, reserving

only the right to condemn him at times on the boy's

account. She began thinking about the boy as she

went on with her preparations for bed. Her face lit

up a little as she reflected upon the benefit it might be

to Eddy to be in Kentudky. She thought of the dire

possibility of serious complications for Arthur in this

culminating crisis of his affairs.

Eddy the epitome of his father, the inheritor of his

virtues and faults, and his retribution, his heir-at-large

by the inscrutable and merciless .law of heredity. "Yes,

it is better for Eddy to be out of it," she repeated to

herself, with the same reasoning that she might have

used had she been proposing to separate her brother's

better self from his worse. But she resolved more firm-

ly that she would, not go herself. She would urge the

others' going, but she would remain.

CHAPTER XXXI

BUT in spite of Anna Carroll's resolve, she went to

Kentucky with the others in two weeks' time. She had

had quite a severe attack of illness after that night, and

it had left her so weakened in body that she had not

strength to stand against her brother's urging. Then,

too, Mrs. Carroll had displayed an unexpected reluctance

to leave. She had evinced a totally new phase of her

character, as people who are unconquerable children al-

ways will when least expected to do so. Instead of

clinging to her husband and declaring that she could

not leave, with an underlying submission at hand, she

straightened herself and said positively that she would

not go. She was quite pale, her sweet face looked as

firm as her husband's.

"I am not going to leave you, Arthur," she said. "If

your sister stays with you, your wife can. Your sister

can go, and take Eddy, but your wife stays. I don't

care what happens. I don't care if Marie and Martin

do go. Marie is not cooking so well lately, anyway,

and I never did like the way Martin went around cor-

ners. We can get new servants I shall like much better.

I shall go into the City myself next week to the intelli-

gence office. I am not afraid to go. I don't like to

cross Broadway, but I can take a cab from the station.

I will sit there in a row all day with those other women,

until I get a good maid, if it is necessary. I don't care

in the least if Marie and Matin do go. You can get

another man who will turn the corners more carefully.

And I don't mind because somebody took that rug-

somebody - who was not paid. I think it was a very

rude thing to do. I think when you take things that

way it is no better than burglary, but I should not make

any fuss about it. Let the woman have the rug. Al-

though it does seem as if anybody had the rug, it ought

to be that man we bought it of in Hillfield. You know

he did not seem to like it at all, because he was not paid

for it. But maybe he did not come by it honestly him-

self. He was a singular- looking man - a Syrian or

Armenian or a Turk, and one never knows about peo-

ple like that. I don't mind in the least; it is all right.

And I don't care about the teacups and things. One

of the cups was nicked, and I really like Sevres much

better than Dresden. I should have got Sevres when

I bought them, only the man who had the Sevres I

wanted would not give us credit. We had no charge

account there. I don't mind in the least; but I think

that dressmaker was very impolite to take the things,

because, of course, we shall never feel that we can con-

scientiously give her any more of our custom; and we

have given her a great deal of work, with dear Ina's wed-

ding and Everything, more than anybody in Banbridge.

No, I don't mind in the least about these things. I can

rise above that when it is a question of my husband.

And when you talk of having to leave Banbridge, that

does not daunt me at all. On the whole, I would rather

leave Banbridge. I should like to live a little nearer the

City, and I should like more grounds, and a house with

more conveniences. For one thing, we have no butler's

pantry here, and that is really a great inconvenience.

Take it altogether, the house, and the distance from

New York, I shall not be at all sorry to move. And "

tly pouting mouth widened into a straight line; she had

that uncanny expression of docile and yielding people

when they assume a firm attitude), "I shall not go

away and leave you, Arthur," she repeated; "Anna shall

not stay here with you and I go to Aunt Catherine's.

If any one staytp I stay. I am your wife, and I am

the one to stay. I know my duty."

"Amy, dear," s4id Carroll, "it will really make me

happier to know that you are more comfortable and

happy than I can make you this winter."

"I shall not be comfortable and happy," said she.

"No, Arthur, you need not pet me; I am quite in ear-

nest. You treat me always as if I were a child. You

do, and all the rest, even my own children. And:I think

myself that two-thirds of me is a child, but one-third

is not, and now it is the one-third that is talking, and

quite seriously. It is I who am going to stay with you,

and not Anna."

' "Anna is not going to stay either, sweetheart,"

Carroll said.

A quick change came over Mrs. Carroll's. face. She

looked inquiringly at her sister-in-law. "Anna said she

would not go," she said.

"She has thought better of it," Carroll said, quietly.

"Yes, Amy, I am going," Anna said, wearily, "and

I don't think you had better -decide positively to-night

whether you will go or not. Leave it until to-morrow."

"But how could you get along without anybody to

keep house for you all winter, Arthur?" asked Mrs.

Carroll.

"As thousands of men get along," Carroll replied. "I

can take my meals at the inn, and somebody could be

got to come by the day and see to the furnace and the

house."

"I suppose somebody could," Mrs. Carroll agreed, a

frown of reflection on hEr smooth forehead.

She wept piteously when it came to parting, two

weeks later, but she went.

389








<pb n="390"/>
THE DEBTOR

They all started, early in the morning. Carroll ac-

companied them to the station, and was well aware

of an unusual number of persons being present to see

the train start. He knew the reason: a rumor had got-

ten about that he as well as his family was to leave

Banbridge and the State. He knew that if he had made

a motion to get on the train, there might have been a

scene, and he bade his family good-bye on the platform,

before his covert audience of creditors. Lee was there,

ostentatiously shaking hands with the ladies, but secret-

ly watchful. Tappan was surlily attentive, leaving his

milk-wagon tied in front of the station. Minna Eddy

and Willy had driven down in their wagon from their

little farm. Four children were huddled in behind.

Minna had gotten out and stood on the platform. Willy

sat on the seat holding the baby and the reins. There

had been a thaw; the roads outside were heavy, and

their old mule was harnessed up with their old horse.

Willy had been somewhat afraid to come.

"Suppose he should make a fuss about that," he

said, pointing to the Bokhara rug which adorned their

little sitting-room.

"I ain't afraid of his making any fuss about that

old mat," said Minna; "I guess he knows what he's

about. It's him that's afraid, an' not me. An old

mat that's worth about fifty cents! It ain't half so

pretty as one that Frank Olsen's wife got in New Sander-

son for four dollars and ninety-eight cents. I'm goin'

to have some more of them things, an' he ain't goin'

to git out of Banbridge, if I have to hang on to his coat-

tails. You lemme go, Willy Eddy."

Therefore they came, starting before daylight in the

frosty morning. Carroll was conscious of them all, of

the druggist and the postmaster; of the two horsemen

with whom he had had a half-settlement, and who were

now about to force the remainder; of the two butchers

390








<pb n="391"/>
THE DEBTOR

and the dry-goods merchant, who had been exceeding-

ly nasty about the rug, and persisted in thinking that

the Carrolls were responsible for its disappearance.

They had now other chattels in view, and were only

delayed from thing prompt measures by the uncer-

tainty as to what belonged to Carroll, or to his wife, or

to the owner of the house. There was also lurking

around the corer of the station, but quite ready for

immediate action should it be necessary, another man,

who represented the arm of the local law. There was

also Madame Estelle Griggs, and, curiously enough,

the sight of that little, meagre-bedecked figure and that

small, rasped, piteous face of nervous suspicion affected

Carroll more forcibly than did any of the others. He

was conscious of a sensation of actual fear as he caught

sight of the waving plume, of the wiry frizzes, of the

sharp, frost-reddened face, of those watchful, unhappy

eyes. He realized that if she should make a scene there,

i he should hear again that laugh and those wailing

sobs, he could not answer for what he might do. There

even flashed across his mind a mental picture of the

on-rush of the train, and of a man hurling himself be-

fore it, to get for once and all out of sight and sound

of the unspeakable, grotesque, unmanning shame of

the thing. It was when he saw her that he resolved

that he would not put his foot on the train, lest she

might think he meant to go. However, she would

*probably have made no manifestation. She was her-

self in mortal terror of retribution because of the things

which she had confiscated in payment of her debt.

She had little of Minna Eddy's strength of confidence in

her own proceedings. She had, however, consoled her-

self by the reflection that possibly nobody knew that

she had taken them. She had hiddenthem away under

her mattress, and slept uneasily on the edge of the bed,

lest she break the cups and saucers. If it had not been

26                 391








<pb n="392"/>
THE DEBTOR

so early in the morning, presumably too early for vis-

itors from the City, she would not have dared show her-

self at the station. In these days she sewed behind

closed doors, with her curtains down. She went to her

customer's houses for tryings-on, instead of having her

patrons come to her. She was always ready, working

with her eyes at the parting of the curtains, to flee

down a certain pair of outside back -stairs, and cut

across the fields, should men be sent out from the City

to collect money. Rosenstein's store was under her

little apartment, and she knew she could trust him not

to betray her. The dressmaker was in these days fairy

tragic in appearance, with a small and undignified, but

none the less real, tragedy. It was the despair of a

small nature over small issues, but none the less de-

spair. Carroll would have paid that bill first of all,

had he had the money, but none but himself knew how

little money he had. Had the aunt in Kentucky not

sent the wherewithal for the railway fares, it was hard

to be seen how the journey could have been taken at all.

It had even occurred to Carroll that some jewelry must

needs be sacrificed. He had made up his mind, in that

case, that Anna would be the one to make the sacrifice.

She had an old set of cameos from her grandmother,

which he knew were valuable if taken to the right place.

Anna had considered the matter, ai would have spared

him the suggestion had not the check come from the

aunt to cover all the expenses of the trip, with even

some to spare. With the extra, Mrs. Carroll insisted

upon buying a new hat for Charlotte. Charlotte that

morning showed little emotion. She was looking ex-

ceedingly pretty in the new hat and her little, blue

travelling-gown. Madame Griggs eyed that and re-

flected that she had not made it herself, that it must

have been a last winter's one, although it had kept well

in style, and she wondered if the dressmaker who made

392








<pb n="393"/>
THE DEBTOR

it had been paid. Charlotte in.parting from her father

showed no emotion. He kissed her, and she turned

away directly and entered the train. There was an odd

expression on her face. She had not spoken a word all

the morning except to whisper to Eddy to be still, when

he remarked, loudly, on the number of people present at

the station.

"All this crowd isn't going, is it?" he demanded.

"Hushl" Charlotte whispereds peremptorily, and he

looked curiously at her.           .

"What is the matter with you this morning, anyhow ?"

he inquired, loudly. Eddy had in a leash & small and

violently squirming puppy, which had latly strayed to

the Carroll place, and been found wagging and whining

ingratiatingly around the stable. Eddy had adopted

it, and even meditated riding in the baggage-car to re-

lieve its loneliness should the conductor- prove intrac-

table concerning its remaining in the passenger-coach.

Eddy, of the whole party of travellers, was the only one

who presented an absolutely undisturbed and joyously

expectant countenance. He had the innocent selfish-

ness of childhood. He could still be single-eyed as to

the future, and yet blameless. He loved his father,

but had no pangs at parting, when the wonders of the

journey and the new country were before him. His

heart also delighted in the-puppy, leaping and abortive-

ly barking at his side. He kissed his father good-bye as

the train approached, and was following the others, with

the little dog straining at his leash, when his onward

progress was suddenly arrested, another grimy little

hand tugged at the leash.

"Say, what you goin' off with my dog for?" de-

manded the owner of the hand, another boy, somewhat

older than Eddy, and one of his schoolmates.

Eddy, belligerent at once, faced about. He caught

up the wriggling puppy with such a quick motion that

393








<pb n="394"/>
THE DEBTOR

he was successful and wrenched the other boy's hand

from the leash.

"It isn't your dog. It's my dog. What you talking

about?" he growled back.

"You lie!"

"Lie yourself!"

"Gimme that dog!"

"It's my dog!"

"Where'd ye git it?" sneered the other, making

clutches at the puppy.

"My papa bought him for me in New York." 

"Hm! All the way your father could git a dog like

that is to steal him. Your father 'ain't got no money.

You stole him. You steal jest like your father. Gim-

me the dog."

The claimant boy laid such insistent hands on the

puppy, and Eddy so resisted, that the little animal

yelped loudly.

Carroll stepped up. His lips were ashy. This last

idiotic episode was unnerving him more than all that

had gone before. "Give that boy his dog," he com-

manded Eddy, sternly.

Eddy clung more tightly to the little dog, and began

to whimper. "But, papa-"

"Do as I tell you."

"He came to our stable, and he didn't have any collar

on, and alog without any collar on-"

"Do as I tell you."

But Eddy had found an unexpected ally. Anderson

had come on the platform as the train approached. He

was going on business to New Sanderson, and he had

furtively collared the owner of the puppy, thrust some-

thing into his hand, whispered something, and given him

a violent push. The boy fled. When Carroll turned, the

boy who had been imperiously aggressive at his elbow

was nowhere to be seen. Several of the by-standers were

394








<pb n="395"/>
THE DEBTOR

grinning. Anderson was moving along to be at the side

of his car, as the train approached. It had all happened

in a very few seconds. Eddy clung fast to the puppy.

There was no time for anything, and the female Carrolls

were pressing softly about for the last words.

"I don't think the puppy belonged to that boy," Mrs.

Carroll said. "He was just a little, stray dog."

She had seen nothing of what Anderson had done,

and neither had the others. There was manifestly noth-

ing more to be done. It was an absurdity for Carroll

to load himself up with that squirming puppy, when

the ownership seemed so prbblematic. He bade them

all good - bye again, and they got on the train. The

women's pretty, wistfully smiling faces appeared at

windows, also Eddy's, and the innocently wondering

visage of the puppy. Anderson was in the snoking-

car. As the train passed, Carroll saw his face at a win-

dow, and bowed, raising his hat half-mechanically.

Anderson was conscious of a distinct sensation of pity

for him, the more so that he was helpless and rebellious-

ly depressed himself. He meditated upon the advisabil-

ity of going into the other car, the Pullman, before the

arrival of the train at New Sanderson, and bidding Char-

lotte farewell. He finally decided not to do so. He had

no reason to think that she would care especially to have

him, and while his self - respect, in spite of his perfect

cognizance of the disadvantages of his position, was suf-

ficient not to make him hesitate on that account, he had_

had a feeling against intruding upon the possible sadness

of the ladies when making what they must recognize as

a forced exit from their home under humiliating circum-

stances. It did not occur to him that they might possi-

bly not feel so.

Carroll, left on the platform while the train steamed

out of sight, in its backward trail of smoke full of rain-

bow lights in the frosty air, turned to go home. He was

395

J^








<pb n="396"/>
THE DEBTOR

going to walk. Martin had driven the family to the sta-

tion, and had himself gotten on the rear car of the train.

He was about seeking employment in New Sanderson.

One of the horsemen had driven off with the rig; the

other was waiting for a word with Carroll. The discus-

sion was short, heated, and profane on one side; calm,

low, and imperturbable on the other.

"You'll have it in the end," Carroll said, as he turned

to go.

"The end has got to come pretty darned quick," the

other retorted, jumping into his little trotting-gig and

spinning off.

The others of the crowd had melted away rather quick-

ly. Minna Eddy had clambered into the wagon and

gathered up the reins, while her husband retained the

wailing baby. In truth, in spite of. her bravado, she had

some little doubts as to the wisdom of her confiscation of

the rug. Madame Griggs, actuated by aSimilar doubt,

also fluttered away swiftly down the street. The men

also, upon making sure that Carroll was not intending

to abscond, retreated. Carroll was quite alone when the

horseman spun away in his gig, with its swift spokes

flashing in blinding rings of light as he disappeared around

the curve. It was one of those mornings in the fall when

the air is so clear that the sunlight seems intensified.

There had been a hard frost the night before, and a deli-

cate rime was still over the ground, only melting in the

sunniest spots. Only the oak leaves, a brownish -red

shag mostly on the lower branches, were left on the trees.

The door-yards were full of dried chrysanthemums, the

windows gay with green-house plants. The air was full

of the smell of smokh and coffee and frying things, for it

was Banbridge's breakfast-hour. Men met Carroll on

their way to the next train to the City, walking briskly

with shoulders slightly shrugged before the keen wind.

They bowed to him with a certain reserve, He met

396








<pb n="397"/>
THE DEBTOR

one young girl carrying a music-roll, who wore on her

face an expression of joy so extreme that it gave the

effect of a light. Carroll noticed it absently, this alien

joy with which he had no concern. As the girl passed

him, he perceived a strong odor of violet from her

dainty attire, and it directly, although he was unaware

of the connection, caused him to remember the episode

of his discovering the two women, Mrs. Van Dor and

Mrs. Lee, spying out the secrets in 'his house. That

same odor had smote his nostrils when he entered the

door. He reviewed from that starting-point the suc-

ceeding stages of his stay in Banbridge, the whole mis-

erable, ignominious descent from a fictitious prosperity

to plain, evident disgrace and want. He Was returning

to his desolate house. Martin, had gone, wretchedly

and plainly incredulous of Carroll's promise to finally

pay him every cent he owed him. Marie had packed

her box, and tied two gay foreign handkerchiefs into

bags to contain her ragged possessions. He was to be

entirely alone. He could remain in the house prob-

ably only for a short time, until the owner should find

a new tenant. He walked along with his head up, re-

taining his old stately carriage. As he turned the street

comer on which his house stood, he saw a figure ad-

vancing, and his heart stood still. He thought he

recognized Charlotte, incredible although it was, since

he had just seen her depart on the train. But surely

that was Charlotte approaching, although she carried

strange parcels. The girl was just her height, she even

seemed to walk like her, and she surely wore a dress of

which Charlotte was very fond. It was of a dusky red

color, the skirt hanging in soft pleats. The hat was

also red with a white wing. There was fur on the coat,

and Carroll could see the fluff of it over the girlish shoul-

ders. He could see the stiff white gleam of the wing.

Then he saw who it was-Marie, with a yellow hand-

397








<pb n="398"/>
THE DEBTOR

kerchief gathered into a bag in one hand, and a little

kitten which she had cherished, in a paper bag in the

other. The kitten's black head protruded, and it was

mewing shrilly. Marie was radiant with smiles, and she

wore Charlotte's dress. She had stolen up- stairs and

viewed herself in the mirror in Mrs. Carroll's room, and

she had hopes of herself in that costume even without

any money in her pocket. She was dreaming her hum-

ble little leve-dream again. She smiled up at Carroll in

a charming fashion as they met.

"Good-bye," said she, with her pretty little purse of

the mouth. They had already had an interview con-

cerning her wages that morning.

Carroll said good-bye with a stiff motion of his mouth.

He realized that Charlotte had given Marie her dress.

Somehow the sight of Marie in that dress almost made

a child of the man.








<pb n="399"/>
CHAPTER XXXII

CARROLL, when he reached his house, went up to the

front door, unlocked it, and entered. At once there

smote upon his consciousness that strange shock of

emptiness and loneliness which has the effect, for a

sensitive soul entering a deserted house, of a menacing

roar of sound. He went through the hall to the little

smoking-room or den on the right, opposite the dining-

room, and the first thing which he saw on the divan

was Charlotte's little chinchilla muff which she had for-

gotten. He regarded it with the concern of a woman,

reflecting that she would miss it; and he must send it

to her, and was wondering vaguely about a suitable

box, when he became aware of a noise of insistent knock-

ing mounting in a gradual crescendo from propitiatory

timidity to confidence. The knocking was on the kitch-

en door, and Carroll went hurriedly through the house.

When he reached the door it was open, and a tramp

was just entering, with head cautiously thrust forward.

When he saw Carroll, the unshaven, surly face manifest-

ly became dismayed. He turned to go, with a mutter

which savored of appeal, excuse, and defiance, but Car-

roll viciously accelerated his exit with a thrust between

the shoulders.

"What the devil are youdoing here ?"demandedCarroll.

The man, rolling surly yet intimidated eyes o' er his

shoulder, after a staggering recovery from a fall, mut-

tered something in an unintelligible patois, the grov-

elling, slurring whine of his kind.

399








<pb n="400"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Well, get out of this!" shouted Carroll.

The man went, shuffling along with a degree of speed,

lifting his clumsily shod feet with a sort of painful alac-

rity as if they were unduly heavy. His back, in its green-

ish-brown coat, was bent. He was not a very young man,

although vigorous. Carroll stood looking at the inglori-

ous exit of this Ishmael, and he was conscious of a feel-

ing of exhilaration. He felt an agreeable tingling in his

fists, which were still clinched. The using of them upon

a legitimate antagonist in whose debt he was not, and

never had been, acted like a tonic. Then suddenly some-

thing pathetic in that miserable retreating back struck

the other man, who also had reason to turn his back on

and retreat from his kind; a strange understanding came

over him. He seemed to know exactly how that other

man, slinking away from his door, felt.

"Hullo, you!" he called out. 

The man apparently did not hear, or did not think

the shout meant for him. He kept on.

Carroll shouted again. "Hullo, you! Come back

here!"

Then the man turned, and his half-scared, half-defiant

face fronted Carroll. He growled an inarticulate in-

quiry.

"Come back here!" repeated Carroll.

The tramp came slowly, suspiciously, one hand slyly

lifted as one sees a wary animal with a paw ready for

possible attack.

"Wait here," said Carroll, indicating the stoop with

a gesture, and I will see if I can find something for you

to eat."

The man reached the door and paused, and remained

standing, still with that wary lift of hand and foot in

readiness for defence or flight, while Carroll rummaged

in the pantry, which was a lean larder. At last he

emerged with half a pie and a piece of cake. He ex-

400








<pb n="401"/>
THE DEBTOR

tended them to the tramp, who viewed them critically

and mumbled something about meat.

"Take these and clear out, or leave them and clear

out!" shouted Carroll, and again the sense of exhilara-

tion was over him.

The man took the proffered food and slunk rapidly

out of the yard.

Carroll laughed, and closed and bolted the kitchen

door, which Marie had left unlocked. Then he returned

to the den and sat down with the morning paper and

a cigar. He skimmed over the contents, the rumors of

wars, and cruelties, the Wall Street items, the burg-

laries, the fires, the defalcations, the suicides, the stresses

of the world, creation old, enduring in their fluctuations

and recurrences like the sea, beating with the same force

upon the hearts of every new generation. Carroll, as

he sat there idly smoking, fell to thinking, abstractedly

in that vein. He had a conception of a possible ocean

of elemental emotion, of joy and passion, of crime and

agony and greed, ever swelling and ebbing upon the

shores of humanity. He had a mind of psychological

cast, although it had been turned of a necessity into

other channels. Finally he turned wholly to himself

and his own difficulties, which had reached possibly the

worst crisis of his life. He had never been in such a

hard place as this.; He had heretofore seen a loop-hole

out, into another labyrinth, in the end, it is true, still a

way out. Now he saw none except one; that was into

a fiery torture, and whether it was or was not the tort-

ure of beneficial sacrifice he could not tell.

As he sat there his face grew older with the laboring

of his mind over the track of his failures and over the

certain difficulties of the future. He sat there all the

morning. Noon came, but he did Sot think of food,

although he had eaten little that morning. He lit an-

other cigar and took up the paper again, and read an

40I








<pb n="402"/>
THE DEBTOR

account of the suicide of a bank defaulter by shooting

himself through the brain. He fell to thinking of sui-

cide in his own case, as a means of egress from his owE

difficulties, but he thought idly, rather as a means ol

amusement, and not with the slightest seriousness.

He had a well-balanced brain naturally, and maintained

the balance even in the midst of misfortune. However,

a balance, however perfect, indicates by its very name

something which may be disturbed. He thought over,

idly, various means of unlawful exit from the world,

and applied them to his own case. He decided against

the means employed by the desperate bank cashier; he

decided against the fiery draught of acid swallowed by

a love-distracted girl; he decided against the leap from

a ferry-boat taken by an unknown man, whose body

lay unidentified in the morgue; he decided against il-

luminating gas, which had released from the woes of

life a man and his three children; he thought rather fa-

vorably of charcoal; he thought also rather favorably of

morphine; he thought more favorably still of the open-

ing of a vein, employed by fastidious old Romans who

had enough of feastand gladiators and life generally

and wished for a chance to leave the entertainment.

All this was the merest idleness of suggestion, a species

of rather ghastly. amusement, it is true, but none the

less amusement, of an unemployed and melancholy

mind. But suddenly, something new and hitherto un-

experienced was over him, a mood which he had never

imagined, a possibility which he had never grasped.

His brain, tried to the extreme by genuine misery, tried

in addition by dangerous suggestion, lost its perfect

poise for the time. A mighty hunger and thirst - a

more than hunger and thirst--a ravening appetite, a

passion beyond all passions which he had ever known,

was upon him, had him -in its clutches. He knew for

the first time the most monstrous and irresistible pas-

402

THE DEBTOR

sion of the race, the passion for release from mortal ex-

istence, the passion for death. At that moment he felt,

and probably felt truly, that had he been in dire peril,

he would not have lifted a finger in self-preservation.

He turned his eyes inward upon himself with greed for

his own life, for his own blood, and back of that was

the ravening thirst for release from the world and the

flesh and the miseries which appertained to them, as

one suffocating might thirst for air. He realized sud-

denly himself, stifling and agonizing, behind a window

which he had no need to wait for an overruling Provi-

dence to open, which was not too heavy for his own

mortal strength, which he could open himself. He

realized that whatever lay outside was outtside; it was

air outside this air, misery outside this particular phase

which was driving him mad. His imagination dwelling

upon the different means of suicide, now became judicial.

He thought seriously upon the drawbacks to one,'the

advantages of another. Then since the man was es-

sentially unselfish and fond of his own flesh and blood,

he began to reflect upon the horror of a confessed sui-

cide to them. He began to study the feasibility of a

suicide forever undiscovered. He began to plan how the

thing might distress his family as little as possible.

His cigar went out as he sat and studied. The furnace

fire was low and the room grew cold. He never no-

ticed it. He studied and studied the best means of

suicide, the best means of concealing it, and all the time

the greed for it was increasing until his veins seemed

to run with a liquid fire of monstrous passion, the pas-

sion of a mortal man for his own immolation upon fate,

and all the time that sense of intolerable suffocation by

existence itself, by the air of the world, increased.

He had now arrived at a state 3 mind where every

new phase was produced by suggestion. He was, in

a sense, hypnotized. Everything served to swing him

this way or that, up or down. The sight of a little pei

fume-bottle on the table, a dainty glass thing trace

over with silver, set him thinking eagerly of anothe

little bottle, of glass with a silver stopper, his wife'

vinaigrette which she was fond of using when her heai

ached. From that, the contemplation of inhaling arc

matic salts, he went naturally enough to the inhalin,

of more potent things which assuage pain, and coulI

assuage, if taken in sufficient quantities, the pain of lif

itself. He remembered the exaltation which he ha,

experienced once when given chloroform for a sligh

operation. Directly the idea of repeating that blissfu

sensation seized upon him he was mad for it. To gi

out of life like that, to take that way of opening th

window into eternity, into another phase of existence

or into oblivion, what ecstasy! He remembered tha

when under the chloroform, a wonderful certainty, 

comprehension, seemingly, of the true import of lifi

and death and of the hereafter, had seized him. Hi

remembered a tremendous assurance which he had re

ceived under the influence of the drug, of the ultimat(

joy beyond this present existence, of the ultimate en(

in bliss of all misery, of the tending of death to the

fulness of life. He remembered-a rapture beyond words

an enthusiasm of gratitude for such an immortal deligh-

for the power which he had sometimes rebelled agains-

and reviled .for placing him in the scale of existence

He remembered how all his past troubles seemed as onl3

stepping-stones to supernal heights, how he could have

kissed them for thankfulness that he had been forcec

by an all-wise Providence over the agony of the asceni

to such rapture. Immediately his thoughts centrec

upon chloroform. He looked across at the divan witl

suggestion, became filled with the picture of his peace.

to all his miserable cares and worries, passing out of

reach of them on an ecstatic flight propelled by the

force of the winged drug. He began to consider the

possibility of obtaining chloroform. At once the in-

stinct of secrecy asserted itself. He decided that he

could not, under the circumstances, go into the drug-

store in Banbridge and ask for a quantity of the drug

sufficient for his purposes. He realized that to do so

would be to incur suspicion. He doubted if he could

maintain a perfectly unmoved countenance while asking

for it. He felt that his face would bear evidence to his

wild greed. He heard, as he sat there, the whistle, then

the rumble of a heavy freight-train a quarter of a mile

distant, and at once he thought of the feasibility of

going to New York for the chloroform. 'He looked at

his watch and reflected that he had lost the noon train.

He also reflected as to the possible suspicion which he

might awaken of going to join his family, and making

his final exodus from the town 'and his creditors. He

placed his watch in his pocket, and his eyes fell on the

electric-light fixture, with a red silk shade over the bulb,

and at once his mind conceived the idea of his going

somewhere on the trolley-cars. He thought of going

to New Sanderson; then dismissed that as not feasible.

He knew too many people in that place, and had too

many creditors. Then he thought of going to Port

Willis, which was also connected with Banbridge by a

trolley-line, and was about the same distance. Again

he looked at his watch. It was nearly two o'clock. He

wondered absently where the day had gone, that it was

so late. He had not the least idea as to the times and

seasons of the Port Willis trolley-cars, but he directly

arose to make ready. As he did so he heaR a distress-

ful mew, and the black kitten which Marie had essayed

to carry with her -that morning made a leap to the

window - sill. The little animal looked in, fixed his

golden, jewel-like eyes on the man, and again uttered

an appealing, accusatory wail. Then she rubbed her

head with a pretty, caressing motion against the win-

dow-glass. She had evidently escaped from the Hun-

garian and sped home. Carroll opened the window,

and the cat arched her back and purred, hesitating.

Carroll waited patiently. Finally she stepped across

the sill, and he closed the window. Then he called the

cat into the kitchen, but he could find no milk for her,

nothing except a tiny scrap of beefsteak. The cat fol-

lowed him around the kitchen, slinking with her furry

stomach sweeping the floor, and mewed loudly, with

alert eyes of watchful fear, exactly as if she were in a

strange place. The strangeness in the house intimi-

dated her. She missed the wonted element 'of the

human, and the very corners of her familiar kitchen

looked strange to her. She would not even eat her

meat, but ran under the table and wailed loudly, with

wild eyes of terror on Carroll. He went out, shutting

the door behind him, and her loud inquiring wail floated

after him.

Carroll brushed his overcoat and hat carefully, and

put them on. He went out of the house and took the

road to the trolley-line. It was still very cold, and the

rime of the morning lay yet on the shaded places. In

the road, in the full glare of the sun, were a few dark,

damp places. The sky was very clear, with a brisk

wind from the northwest. It was at Carroll's back

and urged him along. He walked quite rapidly. He

had a curious singleness of purpose, as unreasoning and

unreflective as an animal in search of food. He was

going to Port Willis for chloroform to satisfy a hunger

keener than any animal's, to satisfy the keenest hunger

of which man, body and soul together, is capable, a

hunger keener than that of love or revenge, the hunger

for the open beyond the suffocating fastnesses of life.

He met several people whom he knew, and bowed per-

functorily. One or two turned and looked after him.

Two ladies, starting on a round of calls, Mrs. Lee and

Mrs. Van Dorn, again looked forth from the window

of Samson Rawdy's best coach, and at the intent man

hurrying along the sidewalk.

"I wonder where's he going," Mrs. Lee said, in a

hushed tone. She was just approaching a house where

they meditated calling, and she was rubbing on her

violet-scented white gloves. Mrs. Lee looked worn and

considerably thinner than usual, and she was uncom-

fortably conscious of her last season's bonnet. "My

bonnet doesn't look very well to make calls," she had

remarked, when she entered the coach, hired, as usual,

at her companion's expense.

"It looks very well indeed," said Mrs. Van Dom; in

a covertly triumphant voice. She herself wore a most

gorgeous new bonnet with a clump of winter roses

crowning her gray pompadour. "It isn't the one you

wore last winter, is it ?" asked she.

"Yes," admitted Mrs. Lee.

"You don't mean it! I thought it was new," said

Mrs. Van Dorn, lying comfortably.

"No, it's my old bonnet. I thought maybe it would

do a while longer," said Mrs. Lee, meekly.

"I heard yesterday that a good many folks in Ban-

bridge had been losing money through Captain Carroll,"

said Mrs. Van Dor, with appositeness.

Mrs. Lee colored. "Have they.?" said she.

"I heard so."

"Who is that man coming?" said Mrs. Lee, quickly,

striving to turn the conversation. Then she directly

saw that the man was Carroll himself.

"Why, it's Captain Carroll himself!" said Mrs. Van

Dom, and then Mrs. Lee wondered, in her small, hushed

voice, where he was going.

Samson Rawdy, driving, looked sharply at him. He

even leaned far out from the seat after he had passed,

and watched to make sure he did not take the road to

the railroad station. Then he began, for the hundredth

time mentally, calculating the amount that was still

owing him. It was not much, only a matter of two dol-

lars and some cents, but his mind dwelt upon it.

"Seems to me he looked queer," Mrs. Lee remarked,

thoughtfully, after Carroll had passed.

"How do you mean?"

"I don't know. There was something about the

way he was walking made me think so. I suppose he

doesn't know what way to turn."

"Well, I don't pity him," said Mrs. Van Dor, with

subdued vindictiveness. "I don't see what a man is

thinking of to come into a place and conduct himself as

he has done. They say he is in debt everywhere, and

has cheated everybody who didn't know any better

than to be cheated."

Mrs. Van Dorn spoke with point. She had heard on

very good authority that Mrs. Lee's husband had lost

heavily through his misplaced confidence in Carroll. Mr.

Lee knew that she knew, but she stood up bravely for

the maligned man hurrying towards the Port Willis trol-

ley-car.

"Well, I don't know," said she. "You can't always

tell by what people say. It always seems to me that

Banbridge folks are pretty ready to talk, anyway. We

don't know how much temptation the poor man has

had, and maybe he never meant to cheat anybody."

"Never meant!" repeated Mrs. Van Dorn, sarcasti-

cally. "Why, that is the way he has been doing right

along everywhere he has lived. Why, I had it straight

from a lady I met who had visited in Hillfield, New

York, where they used to live before they came here.

Never meant!"

408

'Maybe he didn't," persisted Mrs. Lee. She was a

grateful soul, and, even if capable of small and petty

acts, was of fine grain enough to bear no rancor towards

the discoverer of them; but the other woman was built

on a different plan.

"I don't take any stock in him at all," she said, with

a species of delight. She looked out of the small, rear

window of the coach as she spoke. "He's going to

Port Willis," she said. "He's getting in the trolley-

car."

Samson Rawdy also turned his head and saw with

a strained side glance Carroll getting into the Port Willis

trolley-car. Then he said: "G'lang!" to his horses, and

they turned a corer with a fine sweep, while the ladies

began getting their cards ready.

"I wonder what he's going to Port Willis for," said

Mrs. Van Dorn, reflectively and malignantly. "I sup-

pose he's looking out for somebody to cheat over there."

"Well, I pity him, poor man!" said Mrs. Lee. "If

a man does cheat other folks, he can't do it without

cheating himself worst of all, and it always turns out

so in the end."

As is often the way with a simple tongue, hers spoke

more wisdom that it wot of. It was indeed quite true

that poor Arthur Carroll, seating himself in the Port

Willis trolley-car, had in the bitter end cheated himself

worse than he had any of his creditors. He was more

largely in his own debt than in thaof any other man;

he had, in reality, less of that of which he had cheated

than had any of his victims. Hardly one of them all

was in such sore straits as he, for in addition to his im-

mediate personal necessities there was always the in-

cubus of the debts. And he was starting forth upon this

trip with the purpose in his overstrained, distorted

brain of spending his last reserve, and incurring a debt

to himself which should never be paid to all eternity.

Carroll seated himself in the car, which was already

quite well filled; there was not much time to spare be-

fore its scheduled departure. He found a corner seat

empty, and settled himself into it with a bitter little

sense of self-gratulation for at least that minor allevia-

tion of the situation. The corer seat in a Port Willis

trolley-car had distinct advantages aside from the phys-

ical comfort, owing to the frequent crowding and the un-

certain nature of the component elements of the crowd.

Carroll settled back in his corer and surveyed his

fellow-passengers, waiting with a kind of stupid patience

for the starting of the car. There was a curious look of

indifference to remaining or going, on most of the faces,

the natural result of the universality of travel in Ameri-

ca, the being always on the road for all classes in order

to cover the enormous distances in this great country

between home and work or amusement. All excite-

ment over the mere act of transit has passed; there is

stolidity and acquiescence as to delays and speed, unless

there are great interests at stake. As a rule, the people

in the Port Willis trolley-car had not great interests at

stake; they were generally not highly organized, ner-

vously, and were to all appearances carried as woodenly

from one point to another as were the seats of the car.

That afternoon a German woman sat nearly opposite

Carroll. She was well - dressed in a handsome black

satin skirt, with an ornate, lace-trimmed waist showing

between the folds of her seal cape. There were smart

red velvet roses and a feather in her hat. She sat with

her feet far apart, planted squarely to prevent her

enormous slanting bulk from slipping on the high seat.

Her great florid face, a blank of animal cognizance of

existence, stared straight ahead, her triple chins were

pressed obstinately into the fur collar of her cape. She

was the wife of a prosperous saloon proprietor of Port

Willis, which was a city of saloons, She had herself been

nourished on beer, until her naturally strong will had

become so heavy that it clogged her own purposes,

Her absently set face had a bewildered scowl as if at

some dimly comprehended opposition. Carroll sur-

veyed her with a sort of irritated wonder. No mathe-

matical problem could present for him difficulties as

insuperable as this other human being, who, in a simi-

lar stress to his own, would think of beer instead of

chloroform, and of sleep instead of death-indeed, for

whom a similar stress could not exist, so cushioned was

both soul and body with stupidity and flesh against the

pricks and stabs of life.

Beside Carroll sat, sprawling his ungainly sideways

length over the seat, a lank countryman in top-boots

red with the earth of the country roads. His face,

lantern-jawed, of the Abraham Lincoln type, lacking

the shrewd intelligence of the trained brain, was pain-

fully apathetic. He had scarcely looked up when Car-

roll took his seat beside him. His lantern jaws worked

furtively and incessantly with a rotary motion over his

quid of tobacco, which he chewed with'the humnble and

rudimentary comfort of an animal over its cud. He

was half-starved on his poor country fare, and the to-

bacco furnished his stomach with imagination in lieu

of solid food. Now and then he rose and slouched to

the door, and returned. At the other end of the car,

opposite, were two Hungarian women, short, squat,

heavily oscillating as to hips, clad in full, short skirts,

aprons, and gay handkerchiefs over strange faces,

at once pitiful, stern, and intimidating. One of the

women was distinctly handsome, with noble features

closely framed by a snow-white kerchief. She had the

expression of the pure aAl unrelenting asceticism of a

nun, but four children nearly of an age were with her-

one a baby in her arms, one asleep with heavy head on

her shoulder, the other two, a boy and girl, sitting on

the seat with their well-shod little feet sticking straight

out, and their little Slav faces, softened by infancy,

looked unsmilingly out of the opposite window. The

baby in her lap was also strangely sullen and solemn,

with an intensely repellent little face in a soft, white

hood. The face of the baby looked like an epitome of

weary, even vicious, heredity. He looked older than

his mother. Now and then she bent, and her severe

face took on an expression of majestic tenderness. She

pressed her handsome face close to the little, elfish, even

evil face of the child, and kissed it. Then the baby

smiled a fatuous, toothless smile, and he also was trans-

formed; his little glory of infancy seemed to illuminate

the face marked with the labors and sins and degra-

dation of his progenitors. The other Hungarian woman,

who had with her one child, older than the baby, very

large and heavy, caught it up and kissed it with fervor,

and the child stared at her in return with a sort of

patient wonder. Then the two women exchanged smiles

of confidence. Carroll watched, remembering Amy

with their children. She had been very charming with

the children, and, after all, there was not such a dif-

ference as might appear at first. The thought flashed

into Carroll's mind that here was a little, universal well-

spring of human nature which was good to see, but the

deadly pessimism and despair of his own mood made

him straightway corrupt the spring with his own dark

conclusions.

"What is it all for?" he asked himself, bitterly.

"Look at the handsome alien creature there, with four

young around her, and the other with that unresponsive

little brat. Any one of those children, from the looks

of their faces, is capable, if left to its own unguided

proclivities, of murdering the very parent who is now

caressing him; any one of them is hardly capable of

doing anything in life for his own good or happiness, or

412








<pb n="413"/>
THE DEBTOR

the good and happiness of the world, if left to himself,

as, he will be. What does either of those women know

about training a child with those features, a child dis-

torted from birth ?" 

Beyond Carroll, on the same seatat, sattwo quite pretty

young girls with smart hatsi and protuberant pompa-

dours over pink-and-white faces, They had loosened

their coats, revealing coquettish neckwear,, They sat

with feet crossed, displaying embroideed petticoats, at

which now and then the Hungariau women glanced

with the hopeless admiration with which one might

view crown jewels. The two girls coyptly now and

then reached forward their pretty heads and regarded

Carroll with half-bold, half - innocent coquettishness,

but he did not notice it. One whispered to the other

how handsome he was, and did she know who.he was.

A rumble and jar became audible, and the New

Sanderson car came up at right angles on the track on

the other road. The two cars connected. Then pas-

sengers alighted from the New Sanderson car, and en-

tered the waiting one. There was a distinct stir of ex-

citement as they entered, for it was evidently a bridal

party. They were all Hungarians, and on their way to

Port Willis for the ceremony. There were the pros-

pective bride and groom and several friends of both sexes.

They settled themselves in the car, the girls huddled

close together, the young men by themselves. The

bride was quite evident from the bridal whiteness of

.her hat, a pitiful cheap affair bedecked with thin white

ribbon and a forlorn white plume; but although the

bridegroom was as unmistakable, it was difficult to tell

how. Carroll decided that it was because of the in-

tensified melancholy and abjectness and shame of his

expression. Not one of the young men, who numbered

as many as the girls, but had it. They were all ignoble,

contemptible, their faces above their paper collars and

413








<pb n="414"/>
THE DEBTOR

hideous ties stained with miserable imaginations. There

was not a self-respecting face among them; but the girls

were better. There was in their faces an innocent

gayety like children. Instead of the painful, restrained

grins of the young men, they giggled artlessly when their

eyes met. They were innocently conscious of their

flimsy and gaudy dresses of the cheapest lawn or muslin

on that cold day, with a multitude of frills of cheap lace

and bows of cheap ribbon, with bare hands adorned with

blue or red stoned rings protruding from their poor

jacket-sleeves. The bride, afraid of crushing her finery,

had nothing over her shoulders in her thin white muslin

except one of the gay Hungarian. kerchiefs. It was of

an exceedingly brilliant green color, a green greener

than the grass of spring. Above it her homely, down-

cast face showed beneath the flapping white hat, which

had a cluster of blue roses under the brim next the dark

streaks of her coarse hair. The face of the bride was

simple and rude in contour and line, the face of a peas-

ant from a long line of peasants, and it was complex

with the simple complexity of the simplest and most

primal emotions, with love and joy and wonder, the

half-fearful triumph of swift inertia, attained at last in

the full element of life. The others were different; they

were dimpling and laughing and jesting in their unin-

telligible guttural. Their faces knew nothing of the

seriousness of the bride's. One of them was exceeding-

ly pretty, with a beauty unusual in her race. Her high

cheek-bones were covered with the softest rosy flesh,

her wide mouth was outlined by curves. She wore her

cheap muslin with an air, gathering up her petticoat,

edged with the coarsest lace, daintily from the muddy

floor, revealing her large feet in heavy shoes and white

stockings. All the young men of the party except the

prospective groom, who sat entirely wrapped in his at-

mosphere of grinning, shamefaced consciousness, glanced

414








<pb n="415"/>
THE DEBTOR

furtively at her from time to time. She was quite aware

of their glances, but she never returned them. When a

young man looked at her, she said something to one of

the girls, and laughed prettily, striking another pose for

admiration. She never, however, glanced at Carroll

as did the two pretty girls beyond him on the same seat.

She seemed to have no consciousness of any one in the

car outside of those of her own race. Indeed, the whole

party, travelling in a strange land, speaking their strange

tongue, gave a curious impression of utter alienty. It

was almost as if they lived apart in their own crystalline

sphere of separation, as if they were as much diverse as

inhabitants of Mars, and yet they were bound on a

universal errand, which might have served to bring

them into touch with the rest if anything could. Car-

roll gathered an uncanny impression that he might be

himself invisible to these people, that, living in another

element, they actually could not see or fairly sense any-

thing outside. He looked from them to the two older

women of the same race with their children, and again

his pessimistic attitude, evolved from his own misery,

set his mind in a bitterly interrogative attitude. He

looked at the bride and the mistakenly happy mother

caressing the evil-looking child, and a sickening disgust

of the whole was over him.

The car started, and proceeded at a terrific speed

along the straight road. Carroll stared past the bulk

of the German woman at the flying landscape. Since

noon the sky had become clouded; it threatened snow

if the wind should go down. The earth, which had been

sodden with rain a few days before, the mud from which

showed dried on the countryman's boots, was now

frozen in a million wrinkles. The trees stood leafless,

extending their rattling branches, the old corn-fields

flickered with withered streamers; a man was mourn-

fully spreading dung over a slope of field. His old

415

horse, stood between the shafts with drooping head.

The man himself was old, and moved slowly and pain-

fully. A white beard of unusual length blew over his

right shoulder. Everything seemed aged and worn and

weary, and full of knowledge, to its undoing. To Car-

roll, in this mood, even the bridal-party, even the chil-

dren, seemed as old as age itself, puppets evolved from

the ashes of ages, working out a creation-old plan of

things.

The car was very close and hot-in fact, the atmos-

phere was intolerable-but he felt chilly. He pulled his

coat closer. Two young men, countrymen, who had

entered from the New Sanderson car, and sat next the

German woman, eyed him at the gesture, and their

eyes fell with a sort of dull dissent upon his handsome

coat. One said something to the other, and both laugh-

ed with boorish malice. Then one, after glancing at the

conductor, whose back was turned as he talked to one

of the pretty girls with pompadours, bent his head hasti-

ly to the floor. Then he scraped his foot, and looked

aloft with an innocent and unconcerned, expression.

One of the pretty girls had observed him, and said some-

thing to the conductor, pointing to a printed placard

over the man's head. The conductor looked at him,

but the man did not notice. He gave his fare, when it

was demanded, surlily. Then he bent his head again,

when the conductor had turned again, scraped his foot,

and gave a sharp glance at the same time at Carroll's

long coat, which was almost within range. The German

woman suddenly awoke to nervous life and pulled her

satin skirt aside, with a look at the offender, to which

he was impervious.

Then the car stopped in response to a signal, and a

tiny, evidently aged, woman with the activity of a child

sprang on board. She had a large bag which she bore

on one meagre little arm as if it had been a feather.

416








<pb n="417"/>
THE DEBTOR

Her wrinkled little face, rosily colored with the cold air,

peeped alertly from under quite a fine, youthful hat

trimmed with smart bows and a wing, but set crookedly

on the head. Her sparse gray hair was strained tightly

back from her thin temples and wound tightly at the

back. Although she was undoubtedly old, her face

could no more be called old than could that of a bird.

She kept it in constant motion, bringing bright eyes to

bear upon the different passengers. She did not travel

very far. She stopped the car, springing alertly to

her feet and pulling the bell-rope. Then she hopped

off as spryly as a sparrow, on her thin ankles, moving

with nervous haste. Then it was that Carroll noticed

the boy for the first time, although he was seated

directly opposite, and the child looked long and intently

at the man. When the strange, agile old woman ran

through the car, the boy looked across with a look of

innocent fun at the man, and for the first time the two

pairs of eyes met. It was not in Carroll, whatever his

stress of mind, to meet a smile like that without re-

sponse. He smiled back. Then the boy ducked his

head with fervor, and off came his little cap, like a gen-

tleman. 

He was a handsome little fellow, younger than Eddy

by a year or two, fair-haired and blue-eyed, with a most

innocent and infantile expression. He was rather poor-

ly dressed, but he looked well cared for, and he had the

confident and unhesitating regard of a child who is well-

beloved. He had a little package of school-books under

his arm.

Carroll, after returning the child's smile, turned away.

He did not look again, although he felt that the blue

eyes with a look of insistent admiration were stead-

fastly upon his face. The country through which the

car was now passing was of a strange, convulsive char-

acter, It was torn alike by nature and by man. Storms

and winds had battered at the clayey soil, spade and

shovel had upturned it. It was honey-combed and up-

heaved. There were roughly shelving hills overhung

with coarse dry grass like an old man's beard, there were

ragged chasms and gulfs, and all in raw reds and tone-

less browns and drabs, darkened constantly by the

smoke which descended upon them from the chimneys

of the great factories to the right. Over this raw red

and toneless drab surface crawled, on narrow tracks,

little wagons, drawn by plodding old horses, guided by

plodding men. Beyond, the salt river gleamed with a

keen brightness like steel. The sky above it was dull

and brooding. The wind was going down. The whole

landscape was desolate, and with a strange, ragged,

ignominious desolation. The earth looked despoiled,

insulted, dissected, as if her sacred inner parts were laid

bare by these poor pygmies, the tools of a few capitalists

grubbing at her vitals for the clay which meant dollars.

In the most desolate part of this desolate country,

the car was stopped, and two Syrians laden with heavy

grips got on. These tall, darkly gaunt men, their sinis-

ter picturesqueness thinly disguised by their Western

garb, these Orientals in the midst of the extremest phase

of the New World, passed Carroll with grace, and seated

themselves, with a weary air, and yet an air of ineffable

lengths of time at command, suggestive of anything but

weariness. There was actually, or so Carroll fancied,

a faint odor of attar of rose and sandal-wood evident in

the horribly close car. The men had in their grips

rosaries, and Eastern stuffs or Eastern trinkets of the

cheapest description.

To Arthur Carroll, regarding them, the fancy oc-

curred, as it had often occurred, of himself following a

similar pursuit. He had revolved in his mind all pos-

sible schemes of money-making, of winning an honest

living. All the more dignified methods, the methods

THE DEBTOR

apparently suited to himself, seemed out of his reach.

He pictured himself laden with a heavy grip, with two

of them, one painfully poised on the hip, the other drag-

ging at the hand, going about the country, concealing

his rage with abjectness and humility, striving to dis-

pose of his small and worthless wares for money enough

to keep the machinery going.

"I believe I would make a very good peddler," he

thought. Although his grace of address was involun-

tary, like any keenly intelligent and retrospective man,

he could not avoid being aware of it. He felt that he

could outstrip that saturnine Syrian in. his own field.

Looking away from them, his eyes met the little boy's,

also returning from a sober, innocent contemplation of

them, and the boy's eyes again smiled at him with an

odd, confidential expression. So clearly wise and un-

derstanding was their direct regard, that it almost seem-

ed as if the child guessed at the man's thoughts; but

that was, of course, impossible. Carroll smiled at him

again, and the little face blushed and dimpled like a

girl's with admiration and grateful delight. He was a

daintily built little boy, with nothing of Eddy's little

dash of manner, but he was charming. The car reached

Port Willis and proceeded along the principal street.

Carroll suddenly reflected that he must soon get off;

he would reach the end of the line. Again his errand

loomed up before him. The necessity for immediate

action removed the paralyzing effect which the very

horror of it had had upon him for a time. Curiously

enough, during the half-hour in the car he had held, as

it were, a little truce with this fell appetite which had

seized upon him. He had thought very little of it.

The strange inertia of passivity in motion of the other

passengers had seized upon him, but now was coming

a period of wakening. The passengers began to drop

offa! The bridal-party went out chattering and laugh-

ing, the prospective bride with ugly red spots of agita-

tion on her high cheek-bones, the pretty girl holding up

her laced petticoats with the air of a princess. The

stout German woman got off in front of her husband's

saloon. The Syrians stopped in front of a store. Car-

roll rode through to the end of the line, and there was

then nobody left except himself, the two pretty girls,

and the little boy. The girls swept off before him, with

a consciousness of their backs in his sight. Carroll got

off, and, to his utter amazement, the little boy, pressing

close to his heels, lifted a small voice. It was an exceed-

ingly small and polite little voice, as sweet as a girl's, a

thin treble.

"Be you Eddy Carroll's father ?" asked the little voice.

Carroll looked down from his height at the small creat-

ure beside him. The little, upturned face looked very

far down. The little cap was pushed back and the

fair hair clung to the innocent forehead damply like a

baby's.

"Yes, my little man," said he, affably. "Who are

you ?"

"I go to school with him," said the little boy.

"Oh!" said Carroll.

"Has he went?" further inquired the little boy, wist-

fully. He was a little scholar, but he had not learned

as yet the practical application of English. It was "has

gone" in the book and "has went" on the tongue.

"Yes; this morning," replied Carroll.

"I was in his classes," said the little voice.

"Why, you are younger than he is!" said Carroll.

"I guess I got my lessons better," admitted the little

voice, but with no conceit, rather with a measure of

apology.

Carroll laughed. "You must have," said he. The

boy had, undoubtedly, a rather intellectual head, a full

forehead, and eyes full of thought and question.

420








<pb n="421"/>
THE DEBTOR

"You go to school in Banbridge?" said Carroll, walk-

ing along the street by the boy's side.

"Yes. I live here. My papa is dead and my mother

dressmakes."

"Oh!" said Carroll. Suddenly, to his utter amaze-

ment, the small hand which was free from the books was

slid into his, and he was walking up the street with the

strange small boy clinging to his land. : Carroll was

conscious of a feeling of grotesque amussement, of an-

noyance, and at the same time of pleasure and of ex-

quisite flattery. There was, strangely e:toulgh, lin the

child, nothing which savored of the primg or the

forward. There was no more offence t be;taken than

if an exceedingly small, timidly ingratixiig,),and pretty

dog had followed one. There was the, ss   isubtle com-

pliment implied, that the dog and the child considered

him a man desirable to be followeda, a, a ioQbe trusted

by such helplessness and ignorance .:ld,,,oving admi-

ration.

Carroll asked no more questions, but walld up the

street with the boy clinging to his hand.. H  thought

of Eddy, butthe touch of this child wvss very different;

the hand was softer, not so nervous.: iarroll, walking

up the street, became forgetful of the child, who re-

mained silent, only glancing up at himnow and then,

timidly and delightedly and admiringly. It was, in

fact, to the boy, almost as if he were walking hand in

hand with a god. But to the man had returned in full

force the abnormal passion which had sent him thither.

He looked for a drug-store where he could buy chloro-

form. His mind was as set upon that one end as a

hunting-dog's upon his quarry. He could not seem to

grasp anything very intelligently but that one idea,

which crowded out every other for the time. The two

passed store after store, markets, beer-saloons, fruit-

stalls, and dry-goods. There were several blocks before

421








<pb n="422"/>
THE DEBTOR

the first drug-store was reached. Carroll saw the red,

green, and blue bottles in the windows, and turned tow-

ards the door.

"Mr. Willard keeps this store; he's a nice man,"

volunteered the boy, in his sweet treble.

Carroll looked down and smiled mechanically. "Is

he?" he said.

"Yes. My mamma makes Mis' Willard's dresses.

She's real good pay."

Carroll entered the store, the boy still keeping close

hold of his hand.

There was no one behind the counter, on which stood

an ornate soda-fountain with the usual appliances for

hot and cold beverages. A thought struck Carroll.

He put his hand in his pocket and looked down at the

boy.

"Do you like chocolate?" he asked.

The boy blushed and hung his head.

"Do you?" persisted Carroll.

"I didn't ask for any," the boy said, in an exceeding-

ly shamefaced voice.

Carroll laughed as a man came from the rear of the

store and paused inquiringly behind the counter. "Give

this little boy a cup of hot chocolate, and make it pretty

sweet," he said.

When the boy was seated, blissfully sipping his

chocolate, Carroll asked calmly for his chloroform. The

druggist himself gave it to him without any demur.

There was that about Carroll's whole appearance

which completely allayed suspicion. It seemed incon-

ceivable that a man of such appearance, benevolently

and genially treating a pretty little boy to a cup of

chocolate, should be essaying to purchase poison for

any nefarious purpose. The druggist put up the

chloroform in a bottle marked poison in red letters,

changed the bill which Carroll gave him in payment,

422








<pb n="423"/>
THE DEBTOR

and remarked that it was a cold day and looked like

snow. The boy was hurrying to finish his chocolate,

that he might follow again this obfect of his admiration,

but Carroll caught sight of the Banbridge car coming

up the street, after having made an unusually long wait

at the terminus of the line.

"Take your time, my boy. I have to go," he said,

and hurried out to the car, leaving the boy staring

wistfully after him with she chocolate sweet upon his

tongue.

Carroll, with his chloroform in his pocket, boarded

the car, and speeded again over the road to Banbridge.

The way home seemed to him like a dream. He was

not conscious of much about him; his mind now seemed

concentrated on that small bottle in his pocket. He

noticed nobody in the car, but sat in his corner, with

eyes fixed absently on the flying landscape. The con-

ductor had to speak twice before he realized that he

was asking for his fare. When the car reached the end

of the line in Banbridge, he sat still for a few seconds

before he collected himself enough to understand that

the end of his journey was reached, and it was time

for him to get off the car and walk home.

Walking along the familiar way, his apathy began to

fail and his nervous excitement returned. He began to

realize everything, this hideous end to his failure of a

life which was so rapidly approaching. He realized that

he was walking alone to his deserted home, cold and

cheerless, dark and silent. It was already dusk, the

days were short and the sky heavily clouded. The raw

wind from the northeast smote him hard in the face like

a diffused flail of wrath. He thought of his wife and

children and sister speeding along to their old home in

the cheerful Pullman-car. He reflected that about this

time they would be thinking of going to the dining-car

for their dinner. He reflected that after the chloroform

28               423

THE DEBTOR

had done its work, they would be well cared for in Ken-

tucky, much better off than they had ever been under

his doubtful protection; that Eddy might grow up to

be a better man than his father, that Charlotte would

marry down there, that they would all be comfortable,

and in the intense and abnormal self-centredness of the

mood which was upon him, that mood which leads a

man to escape from his own agony of life by the first

exit, that awful hunger for the beyond of his own soul,

he never gave a thought to the possible sufferings of his

family, to their possible grief at the loss of him. He

actually hugged himself with the contemplation of

their comfort and happiness, which would follow upon

his demise, as he hugged himself upon the prospective

ecstasy and oblivion in the bottle in his pocket.

He came in sight of his house, and a bright light shone

in the dining-room window. He looked at it in bewil-

derment. His first thought was an unreasoning one that

some of his creditors had in some unforeseen way taken

possession. He went wearily around to the side door.

There was a light also behind the drawn curtain of the

kitchen. He opened the door and smelled broiling

beefsteak and tea. Then Charlotte, warm and rosy,

laughing and almost weeping at the same time, ran

towards him with her arms held out.

"I have come back, papa," said she.








<pb n="425"/>
CHAPTER XXXIII

FOR the first time in his life Arthur Carroll had a

perfect sense of the staying power, of the imregnable

support, of love and the natural ties of humanity.

Charlotte's slender arms closed around his neck; she

stood, half-weeping, half-laughing, leaning against him,

but in reality he leaned against her, the soul of the man

against the soul of the girl, and he got fromlit a strength

which was stronger than life or death. He felt that it

bent not one whit before his terrible weight of misery

and perplexity. He was stayed.,               a 

"I came back, papa," Charlotte repeated. She was

herself a little terrified by what seemed to her a daring

action; then, too, she dimly perceived something be-

neath the surface which made her tremble. She felt

the despairing weight of the other soul against her own.

She stood still, clinging to her father, saying in her lit-

tle, quivering voice that she had come back, and he

was quite still, until at last he made a little sound like

a dry sob, and Charlotte straightened herself and took

his hand firmly in her little, soft one. The girl became

all in a second a woman, with the full-fledged instincts

of one. She knew just what to do for a man in a mo-

ment of weakness. She towered, by virtue of the ma-

ternal instinct within her, high above her father in'

spiritual strength.

"Papa, come into the house," said she, and her voice

seemed no longer Charlotte's, but echoed from the man's

far-off childhood. "Come into the house, papa," she

425








<pb n="426"/>
THE DEBTOR

said; "come." And Carroll followed her into the house,

like a child, his hands clasped firmly and commandingly

by the little, soft one of his daughter.

Charlotte led her father into the dining-room, which

was warm and light. There was a Franklin stove in

there, and a bright fire burned in it.

"The furnace fire had gone out, and I could not do

anything with that, so I made a fire in this stove,"

Charlotte explained. "I made it burn very easily."

She spoke with a childish pride. It was, in fact, the

first time she had ever made a fire. "The fire in the

kitchen-range was low, too," she said, but I put some

coal on and I poked it, and there is a beautiful bed of

coals to cook the beefsteak." Then Charlotte caught

herself up short. "Oh, the beefsteak will burn!" she

cried, anxiously. "Do sit down, papa, and wait a

minute. I must see to the beefsteak."

With that Charlotte ran into the kitchen, and Car-

roll dropped into the nearest chair. He felt dazed and

happy, with the happiness of a man waking to con-

sciousness from an awful incubus of nightmare, and

yet a deadly sense of guilt and shame was beginning to 

steal over him. That bottle of chloroform in his pocket

stung his soul like the worm, which gnaweth the con- 

science unceasingly, of the Scriptures. He thought 

vaguely of removing it, of concealing it somewhere.

He looked at the china-closet, the door of which stood

ajar; he looked at the sideboard with its glitter of cut

glass and silver; but reflected that Charlotte might

directly go to either and discover it, and make inquiries.

He kept it in his pocket.

He heard Charlotte running about in the kitchen.

He continued to smell the broiling beefsteak and tea,

and also toast. He became conscious of a healthy

hunger. He had eaten nothing since morning, and very

little then. Then he gathered his faculties together

426








<pb n="427"/>
THE DEBTOR

enough to wonder how this had come about; how

and why Charlotte had returned. But he sat still in

the chair beside the Franklin stove. He gazed steadily

into the red glow of the coals, and a strange dimness

came over his vision. A species of counter-hypnotism

seemed to overcome him. He had been in an abnormal

state, superinduced by unhealthy suggestions of the

imagination acting upon a mind ill at ease; now his

natural state gradually asserted itself. His mind swung

slowly back to its normal poise. When Charlotte en-

tered, bearing a platter of beefsteak, he turned to her

quite naturally.

"How did it happen, darling?" he asked.

Charlotte looked at him, and her face, which had

been anxious and puzzled, lightened. She laughed.

"I had my mind all made up, papa," she replied, in a

triumphant little voice.

"That you would come back?"

"Yes, papa. I knew there was no use in saying I

would not go. I knew if I did, Amy would directly

declare that she *ould not go either, and I should spoil

everything. So I decided that I would start with the

rest, and come back."

"How far did you go?"

"I went to Lancaster. I did not mean to go so far.

I meant to get off at New Sanderson, but I could not

manage it. Amy wanted to play pinochle, and I could not

get away. But when we got to Lancaster, we stopped

awhile, and Amy was having a nap, and Anna was read-

ing, and the train made a long stop, and Eddy and I

got out, and I told Eddy what I was going to do, and

gave him a little note. I had it all written before I

started. I said in the note that I was coming back,

that I did not want to go to Kentucky; that I was

coming back and would stay with you a little while,

and then we would both go to Kentucky and join

427

THE DEBTOR

the others. I said they were not to worry about

me."

"What did you tell Eddy?"

"I told Eddy that you could not be left alone with

nobody to cook for you, and he must get on the train

and not make any fuss, and tell the others, and be a

good boy, and he said he would. I saw him safely on

the train."

"How did you get here from Lancaster, child?"

"I took the trolley," Charlotte said. "There is a

trolley from Lancaster to New Sanderson, you know,

papa."

Charlotte did not explain that the trolley from Lan-

caster to New Sanderson was not running, and that she

had walked six miles before connecting with the trolley

to Banbridge. "I got the meat in New Sanderson,"

said she. "I got some other things, too. You will

see. We have a beautiful supper, papa."

Carroll looked at her, and she answered the question

he was ashamed to ask. "Aunt Catherine sent me a

little money," she said. "She sent me twenty-five

dollars in a post-office order. She wrote me a letter and

sent me the money for myself. She said the shops were

not very good down there-you know they are not,

papa -and I might like to buy some little things for

myself in New York before coming. I said nothing

about the money to Amy or the others, because I had

this plan. I even let Amy take that extra money and

buy me the hat. I was afraid I was mean, but I could

not tell her I had the money, because I wanted to carry

out this plan, and I did not see how I could get back

or do anything unless I kept it, for I had no money at

all before. I have written a letter to Aunt Catherine,

and she will get it as soon as they get there. I don't

think she will be angry; and if she is, I don't care."

Charlotte's voice had a ring of charming defiance. She

428








<pb n="429"/>
THE DEBTOR

looked gayly at her father. "Come, papa," said she,

"the beefsteak is hot. Sit right up, and I will bring

in the tea and toast. There are some cakes, too, and

a salad. I have got a beautiful supper, papa. I never

cooked any beefsteak before, but just look how nice

that is. Come, papa."

Carroll obediently drew his chair up to the table. It

was daintily set; there was even a little vase of flowers,

rusty red chrysanthemums, in the centre on the embroid-

ered centrepiece. Charlotte spoke of them when she

brought in the tea and toast. "I suppose I was ex-

travagant, papa," she said, "but I stopped at a florist's

in New Sanderson and bought these. They did not

cost much-only ten cents for all these."  She took her

seat opposite her father, and poured the tea. She put

in the lumps of sugar daintily with the silver tongs.

Her face was beaming; she was lovely; she was a dar-

ling. She looked over at her father as she extended

his cup of tea, and there was not a trace of self-love

in the little face; it was all love for and tender care of

him. "Oh, I am so glad to be home!" she said, with a

deep sigh.

Carroll looked across at her with a Fort of adoration

and dependence which were painful, coming from a

father towards a child. His face had lightened, but

he still looked worn and pale and old. He was become

more and more conscious of the chloroform in his pocket,

and the shame and guilt of it.

"Why did you come back, honey?" he asked.

"I didn't want to go," Charlotte said, simply. "I

wasn't happy going away and leaving you alone, papa.

I want to stay here with you, and if you have to leave

Banbridge I will go with you. I don't mind at all not

having much to get along with. I can get along with

very little."

"You would have been more comfortable with the

429








<pb n="430"/>
THE DEBTOR

others, dear," said Carroll. He did not begin to eat

his supper, but looked over it at the girl's face.

"You are not eating anything, papa," said Charlotte.

"Isn't the beefsteak cooked right?"

"It is cooked beautifully, honey; just right. All is.

I am glad to see you come back. You don't just know

what it means to me, dear, but I am afraid-"

Charlotte laughed gayly. "I am not," said she.

"Talk about comfort-isn't this comfort? Please do

eat the beefsteak, papa."

Carroll began obediently to eat his supper. When

he had fairly begun he realized that he was nearly

famished. In spite of his stress of mind, the needs of

the flesh reasserted themselves. He could not remem-

ber anything tasting so good since his boyhood. He

ate his beefsteak and potatoes and toast; then Char-

lotte brought forward with triumph a little dish of

salad, and finally a charlotte-russe.

"I got these at the baker's in New Sanderson," said

she. She was dimpling with delight. She looked very

young, and yet the man continued to have that sense

of dependence upon her. She exulted openly over her

supper, her cooking, and her return. "I don't know

but I was very deceitful, papa," she said, but with glee

rather than compunction. "Amy and Anna had no idea

that I did not mean to go with them to Aunt Catherine's,

and oh, papa, what do you think I did ? What do you ?"

"What, dear?"

"My trunk was packed with, with-some old sheets

and blankets and newspapers-and all my clothes are

hanging in my closet up-stairs." Charlotte laughed a

long ring of laughter. "I knew I was deceitful," she

said again, and laughed again.

Carroll did not laugh. He was thinking of the Hun-

garian girl in Charlotte's red dress, but Charlotte thought

he was sober on account of her deceit.

430








<pb n="431"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Do you think it was very wrong, papa?" she asked,

with sudden seriousness, eying him wistfully. "I will

write and tell Amy to-night all about it. I couldn't

think of any other way to do, papa."

"I met Marie as I was coming home from the station

this morning," Carroll said, irrelevantly.

Charlotte looked at him quickly, blushed, and raised

her teacup.

"I thought at first, though I knew it could not be,

that I saw you coming," said he; "something about her

dress-"

"Papa," said Charlotte, setting down her cup, and

she was half-crying-"papa, I had to. Marie was so

shabby, and she said that her lover had deserted her

because she was so poorly dressed; anrd though of course

he could not be a very good man, nor very loyal to

desert her for such a reason as that, yet those people

are different, perhaps, and don't look at things as we

do; and Marie has got another place; but-but she-

didn't have any money, you know, and she didn't

really have a dress fit to be seen, and that dress I gave

her I did not need at all--I really did not, papa. I

have plenty besides, and so I gave it to her, and my

little Eton jacket, and I told her she would certainly

have every cent we owed her, and she seemed very hap-

py. She is going to a party to-night and will wear that

dress. She thinks she will get her lover back. Those

Hungarian men must be queer lovers. Marie said he

would not marry her, anyway, until she had some

money for her dowry, but she thinks she may be able

to keep him until then with my red silk dress, and I

told her she should certainly have it all in time." Char-

lotte's voice, in making the last statement, was full of

pride and confidence without a trace of interrogation.

"She shall if I live, dear," said Carroll. All at once

there came over him, stimulated with food for heart

43I








<pb n="432"/>
THE DEBTOR

and body, such a rush of the natural instinct for life

as to completely possess him. It seemed to him that

as a short time before he had hungered for death, he

now hungered for life. Even the desire to live and pay

that miserable little Hungarian servant - maid was a

tremendous thing. The desire to live for the smallest

virtues, ambitions, and pleasures of life was compelling

forcp.

"I have something beautiful for breakfast to-morrow

morning, papa," said Charlotte, "and I know how to

make coffee." And he felt that it was worth while

living for to- morrow morning's breakfast alone. No

doubt this state of mind, as abnormal in its way as the

other had been, was largely due to physical causes, to

the unprosaic quantity of food in a stomach which had

been cheated of its needs for a number of days.' The

blood rushed through his veins with the added force of

reaction, supplying his brain. He was not happier-

that could scarcely be said-but he was swinging in the

opposite direction. Whereas he had wanted to die, be-

cause of his misery and failures, he now wanted to live,

to repair them, and the thought was dawning upon

him, to take revenge because of them. In this mood

the consideration of the bottle of chloroform in his

pocket became more and more humiliating and con-

demning. The sight of the girl's innocent, triumphant,

loving little face opposite overwhelmed him with a

stinging consciousness of it all. He felt at one minute

a terrible fear lest those clear young eyes of hers could

penetrate his miserable secret, lest she should say, sud-

denly: "Papa, what did you go to Port Willis for?

What have you in your pocket?"

Charlotte went to bed early, after she had cleared

away the table and washed the dishes, unwonted tasks

for her, but which she performed with a delight intensi-

fied by a feeling of daring.

432








<pb n="433"/>
THE DEBBTOR

"Papa, I have washed the dishes beautifully; I know

I have," she said, and she looked at him for praise, her

head on one side, her look half-whimsical, half-childishly

earnest. "I don't see why it is at all hard work to be

a maid," said she.

"There are other things to do, dear, I suppose,'

Carroll said.

"I think I could easily learn to do the other things,"

said she. "I don't quite know about the washing and

ironing, and possibly. the scrubbing and sweeping."

Charlotte surveyed, as she spoke, her hands. She looked

at the little, pink palms, made pinker andslightly wrin-

kled by the dish-water; she turned them and surveyed

the backs with the slightly scallopingg joints, and the

thin-nailed fingers. She shook, her, head,   "II don't

know," said she, again.

"I know," Carroll said, quickly; , "YQor father is

going to take care of you; Charlotte,;: It,l has ,ot yet

come to that pass that he is quite. helple.s,'

Charlotte did not seem to notice hilurtt, indignant

tone. She went on reflectively. "It dosiseem," said

she, "as if there were a great many ways of being crip-

pled besides not having all your arms apil; legs; as if

it were really being very much cripple if; you are in

a place where there is work to be done, and your hands

are not rightly made for doing it. Now :here I am, and

I can't do Marie's work as well as Marie did it, because

she was really born with hands for washing and ironing

and scrubbing and sweeping, and I wasn't. A person

is really crippled when she is born unfitted to do the

things that come her way to be done, isn't she, papa?"

"There is no question of your doing such things,

Charlotte," Carroll said again, and Charlotte looked at

him quickly.

"Why, papa!" said she, and went up to him and

kissed him. She rubbed her cheek caressingly against

433








<pb n="434"/>
THE DEBTOR

his, and his cheek felt wet. She realized that with a

sort of terror. "Why, papa, I did not mean any harm!"

she said.

"I will get a servant for you to-morrow, Charlotte,"

he said, brokenly. "It has not yet come to pass that

you have to do such work." He spoke brokenly. He

did not trust himself to look at the girl, who was now

looking at him intently and seriously.

"Papa, listen to me," said she. "Really, there is

no scrubbing nor sweeping nor washing nor ironing to

be done here for quite a time. Marie has left the house

in very good condition. There is enough money to pay

for the laundry for some time, and as for the cooking,

you can see that I shall love to do that. You know

Aunt Catherine used to let me cook, that I always

liked to."

Carroll made no reply.

"Papa, you are not well; you are all worn out,"

Charlotte said. "Let us go into the den, and you smoke

a cigar and I will read to you."

Carroll shook his head. "No, dear, not to-night,"

he said.

"We will have a game of cribbage."

"No, dear, not to-night. You are tired, and you

must go to bed. Take a book and go to bed and read.

You are tired."

"I am not very tired," said Charlotte, but therein

she did not speak the entire truth. Her spirit was leap-

ing with happy buoyancy, but she could scarcely stand

on her feet, she was so fatigued with her unaccustomed

labor and the excitement of it all. There was a ringing

in her ears, and her eyelids felt stiff; she was also a lit-

tle hoarse. "Will you go to bed, too, papa?" said she,

anxiously.

"I will go very soon, dear."

"Won't you want anything else before you go?"

434








<pb n="435"/>
THE DEBTOR

"No, darling."

Charlotte stood regarding him with the sweetest ex-

pression of protection and worshipful affection, and

withal the naivet6 of a child pleased with herself and

what she has done for the beloved one. "You did have

a good supper, didn't you, papa?" she asked.

"A beautiful supper, sweetheart."

"You never had a better?"

"Never so good, never half so good," said Carroll,

fervently, smiling down at her eager face.

"You are glad I came back, aren't you, papa?"

"Glad for my own sake, God knows, dear, but-"

"There are no buts at all," Charlotte cried, laughing.

"No buts at all. If you don't think I am happier and

better off here with you than I would be rattling down

to Kentucky on that old railroad, and I am always car-

sick on a long journey, you know, papa."

Charlotte lit a lamp and bade her father good-night.

She kissed him and looked at him anxiously and with

a little bewilderment. He had seated himself, and was

smoking with an abstracted air, his eyes fixed on

vacancy.

"Now, papa, you will go to bed very soon yourself,

won't you?" she urged. "You look sick, and I know

you are tired out."

"Very soon, honey," Carroll replied.

After Charlotte had gotten into bed, and lay there

with her lamp on a stand beside her and her book in

hand, she listened more than she read. When in the

course of half an hour she heard her father come up the

stairs and enter his own room, she gave a sigh of relief.

"Good-night, papa," she called out.

"Good-night, dear," he responded. Then Charlotte

fell asleep with her light burning and her book in her

hand, and she did not hear her father go softly over

the stairs a second time.

THE DEBTOR

As was said, his mind, in regaining its normal balance,

had swung too far to the opposite direction. His de-

sire to live, that possessed him, was as much too intense

as his previous desire to die. He had for the time

being another fixed idea, not as dangerous in a sense as

the other, at least not to himself, but still dangerous.

The miserable little bottle of chloroform became, in this

second abnoimal state of his mind, the key-note on

which his strenuous thoughts harped. It seemed to

him that that bottle with its red label of "Poison" was

as horrible a thing to have as a blood-stained knife of

murder. It was in a sense blood-stained. It bore the

stigma of the self-murderer. It bore evidence to his

hideous cowardice, his unspeakable crime of spirit. He

felt that he must do away with that bottle; but how?

After he was in his room, and the door locked, he took

the bottle from its neat wrapper of pink paper and

looked at it. It seemed like an absurdly easy thing to

dispose of; but it did not, when he reflected, seem easy

at all. It was not a thing to bur, or throw away.

He thought of opening the window and giving it a fling;

but what was to hinder some one finding it in the morn-

ing under the windows? The man actually sat down

and gazed awhile at the small phial of death with utter

helplessness and horror; and as he did so, the always

smouldering wrath of his soul towards that man in

Kentucky, that man who had wronged him, swelled to

its height. He had always hated him, but his hate had

never assumed such strength as this. He became con-

scious, as he had never been before, that that man was

responsible for it all, even to the crowning horror and

ignominy' of that bottle. He reflected that no man of

his name had ever, so far as he knew, stained it as he

had done by his life; that no man of his name had ever

so stained the record of his race by the contemplation

of such a dastardly death. He felt, gazing at that

436

THE DEBTOR

bottle, every whit as guilty as if he had drained the con-

tents, and he told himself that that man was responsible,

that that man had murdered him .in the worst and subt-

lest way in which murder can be done; he had caused

him to do away with his own honor. He felt himself

alive to his furthest fancy with hate and a desire for

revenge. 

"I will live, and I will have the better of him yet,"

he muttered to himself. 

Every nerve tingled; his fingers, clutched the bot-

tle like hot wires-that bottle which that other man

had caused him t6 buy, and which: he,: culd not get

rid of, this palpable witness to his crime and dis-

grace. 

Finally he got up and threw up the 'indow; then he

put it down again. It did not seem to him, in his un-

reasoning state, that he could probably empty the

chloroform out of the window without, the slightest

danger of detection, and then scrape 1he label from the

bottle. It did not seem possible to him that Charlotte

would not immediately perceive the ,futnes of the drug

which would cry to her from the ground. Her room

was next his own. He sat ddwn' again .aad :gazed at

the bottle with the absurd bewilderment of a drunken

man. Then he tried stowing it away ii :adrawer of the

dresser, behind a pile of shirts. He even, after doing

that, began to undress, but that did not satisfy him.

It seemed certain to him that Charlotte Would find it

in the morning, and say, "Why, papa, what is this bot-

tle marked 'Poison' in your drawer?"

At last he unlocked his door, opened it, and stole

softly down- stairs. He unfastened the kitchen door,

and went across the field and garden behind the house,

to the little pond beside the rustic arbor, the little senti-

mental Idlewild of the original dwellers in the house.

It was a dark, waving night. It still did not storm,

437








<pb n="438"/>
THE DEBTOOR

and was warmer. It would probably rain before morn-

ing. The wind smote his face damply. He had come

out in his shirt-sleeves. He moved slyly, like a thief; he

felt like one. like a thief and a murderer-a self-murderer,

and a murderer, in will, of the man who had caused him

to commit the crime. He felt burning with hate' as

he slunk across the field, of hate of the man who had

brought him to this, who had caused his financial and 

moral downfall. At that time, had the man been near,

his life would have been worth nothing. Carroll thought,

as he hurried on, holding fast to the bottle, how he could

overthrow him, uncork the bottle and hold it to his

face, that he might inhale the death he had meted out

to him. It seemed to him like the merest instinct of

self -defence. He stumbled now and then over the

tangle of dry vines in the garden, among the corn-stalks.

He went like a guilty thing, instead of moving with his

usual confident state, the state of a gentleman from a

long line of gentlemen. He had become alive to his

own shame, his own ignominy, and he had turned at

bay upon the one who had caused him, as he judged, to

fall.

When he reached the little pond, he paused and looked

about him for a second. It was a desolate spot at that

time of year and that hour. The little sheet of water

gleamed dully like an obscured eye of life. The trees

waved their slender arms over it. Something about

the summer-house creaked as a damp wind blew on his

face. He saw through the trees a faint gleam of light

from a house window farther down the road. He heard

a rustle in the undergrowth on his right, probably a

stray cat or a bird. He stood there holding the bottle

of chloroform and hating that man; then he raised his

arm and flung the thing into the pond. There was a

splash which sounded unnaturally loud, as if it could be

heard a long distance.

Then Carroll turned and went home across the field;

the evidence of his guilt was hidden away out of sight,

but the memory and consciousness of it was in his very

soul and had become a part of him, and his hate of the

man who had brought him to it stalked by his side like

a demon across the fields.

CHAPTER XXXIV

THE next morning Carroll looked ill, so ill that Char-

lotte regarded him with dismay as she sat opposite him

at the breakfast-table. She was full of delight over her

meal. She had gotten up early and made the fire and

cooked the breakfast; in fact, Carroll had been awakened

from the uneasy sleep into which he had fallen towards

morning by the fragrance of the coffee. He opened his

eyes, and it took him some time to adjust himself to

his environment, so much had happened since the

morning before. He awoke in the same room, in the

same bed, but spiritual stresses had made him unfamil-

iar with himself. It took him some time to recall every-

thing-the departure of his family, his journey to Port

Willis, Charlotte's return, the chloroform-but that

which required no time to return, which was like a vital

flame in him from the first second of his consciousness,

was his hatred of the man who had done him the wrong.

As he lay there reflecting he became aware that he had

always hated in just such measure as this, from the very

first moment in which he had become aware of the

wrong, only he had not himself fairly sensed the mighty

power of the hate. He had not known that it so per-

meated his very soul, so filled it with unnatural fire. At

last he arose and dressed and went down-stairs, and

greeted Charlotte, radiant and triumphant, and seated

himself opposite her at the table, when her face fell.

"You are certainly ill, papa," said she.

"No, dear," said Carroll. "I am not ill at all." This

440








<pb n="441"/>
THE DEBTOR

morning he tried to eat, to please her, for his appetite of

the night before had gone. He was haggard and pale,

and his eyes looked strained.

"You look very ill,": said Charlotte. "Let me carl

the doctor for you, papa, dear." 

Carroll laughed. " Nonsense," he said. "I am as well as

ever I was. You fHake a baby of your old father, honey."

"Have another chop, then," said Charlotte.

And Carroll passed his plate for the chop, and ate it,

although it fairly nauseated him. He looked at.the

child opposite as he ate, and she looked as beautiful as

an angel, and as good as one to him. He thought how

the little thing had come back to him, her unfortunate

father, who had made such a muddle of his life, who had

been able to do so little for her; how she had given 'up

the certainty of a happy and comfortable home for' un-

certainty, and possibly privation, and the purest grati-

tude and love that was so intense possessed him. :,Look-

ing at Charlotte, he almost forgot the hatred of the man

who had brought this upon him, and thenA the hxtfed

awoke to fiercer life because of the love. ,: .  . . 

Then, all unconsciously, Charlotte herself, seemingly

actuated by a species of mental telegraphy, spurred

him on. "Papa," said she, viewingl him irith:appro-

bation as he ate his second chop, " isA tffat.man iniActon

who treated you so dreadfully still li'img there?"

Carroll's face contracted. "Yes, deaat'i he said.

"If I had gone down there, and had seen that man,

I should have been afraid of the way 'I would have felt

when I.saw him," said Charlotte,. Herinnocent girl's

face took on an expression which was the echo of her

father's. "I suppose he is prosperous," she said.

"I think so, honey.".      '  - ' '

"I feel wicked when I think of him," said Charlotte,

still with the look which echoed her father's, "when I

think of all he has made you suffer, papa."

44








<pb n="442"/>
THE DEBTOR

Carroll made no reply; the two looked at each other

for a second. The girl's soft face became almost terrible.

"I think if I were a man, and met him, and-had a

pistol, I should kill him," she said, slowly.

Carroll made an effort which fairly convulsed him.

His face changed. He sprang up, went over to Char-

lotte, took hold of her head, bent it back, and kissed her.

"For God's sake, honey, don't talk in that way!" he

said. "All this is not for you to meddle with nor

trouble your little head with."

"Yes it is, if it troubles you, papa."

"I can manage my own troubles, and I don't want

any little girl like you trying to take hold of the heavy

end," Carroll said, and laughed quite naturally.

"Then you must not look so ill, papa."

"I am going to have another cup of coffee," Carroll

said, and showed diplomacy.

Charlotte delightedly poured out the coffee. "Isn't

it very good coffee?" she said. 

"Delicious coffee."

"I am going to get a beautiful dinner for you,"

Charlotte said. The second cup of coffee had reassured

her. She began to think her father did not look so ill,

after all. She was herself in a state of perfect content

and happiness. She felt a sense of triumph, of daring,

which exhilarated her. She adored her father, and how

cleverly she had managed this coming back. How im-

possible she had made it for any one to gainsay her!

After breakfast her father went out, telling her he

should be home by noon, and she busied herself about

the house. She was an absolute novice about such work,

but she found in it a charm of novelty, and she de-

veloped a handiness which filled her with renewed tri-

umph. She kept considering what would her father

have done if she had not returned.

"He would have had no supper when he came home

442








<pb n="443"/>
THE DEBTOR

last night," Charlotte said-" no supper, for he evidently

was not going to the inn, and the fire was out. How

dreadful it would have been for him!" She imagined

perfectly her father's sensations of delighted surprise

and relief when he espied her, to welcome him, when he

felt the warmth of the fire, when he smelled the supper.

The pure delight of a woman over the comfort which

she gives a child or a man whom she loves was over her.

She realized her father's comfort as she had never

realized any of her own. She fairly danced about her

work. She put the bedrooms in order, she washed the

breakfast dishes. Then she meditated going down-

town and buying a fish for dinner. Carroll was very

fond of baked fish. About ten o'clock she had finished

her work, and she put on her hat and coat and set forth.

She ordered the fish, and paid for it. She gave the man

a five-dollar note to change. He looked at it suspicious-

ly. When she had gone out, he and two other men

who were standing in the little market looked at one

another.

"Guess the world's comin' to an end," he said, laugh-

ing, "when they pay cash with five-dollar bills."

"Sure it was a good one?" said one of the other men.

"I thought all Carroll's family had went," said the

third man.

"Guess they didn't have enough money to take this

one, and you can't beat the Pennsylvania Railroad

nohow," said the fishman.

Charlotte went on to the butcher's, bought and paid

for some ham, then 'to Anderson's for eggs. The old

clerk came forward as she entered, and answered her

question about the eggs.

"Do you want them charged?" he asked.

"No, I will pay for them," replied Charlotte, and took

her little purse, and just then Anderson, having heard

her voice, looked incredulously out of his office, his

443








<pb n="444"/>
THE DEBTOR

morning paper in hand. Charlotte laid some money on

the counter, and stepped forward at once. She saw

wiSth a sort of wonder, and an agitation within herself

for which she could not account, that the man was dead-

ly white, that he fairly trembled.

"Good-morning, Mr. Anderson," she said.

Anderson was a man of self-control, but he gazed

down at her fairly speechless. He had been telling

himself that she had gone as certainly out of his life

as if she were dead, and here she was again.

"I thought," he stammered, finally.

Charlotte's face of innocent wonder and disturbance

flushed. "No, I did not go, after all," she said, like a

child. "That is, I started, but I went no farther than

Lancaster. They thought I was going-they all did-

but I could not leave papa alone, and so I came back."

She was incoherent. Her own confusion deepened.

She tried to look into the man's face, but her own eyes

fell; her lips quivered. She was almost crying, but

she did not know why. She turned to the counter, be-

hind which stood the man with the package of eggs

and the change.

"Send that package," Anderson said, brusquely.

"The wagon has gone."

"Send it as soon as it comes back. There will be

time enough."

"I can manage if I don't have the eggs until noon,"

said Charlotte. 

The clerk turned to put away the parcel in readiness

for the delivery-wagon, and again Anderson and the

girl looked at each other. Anderson had caught up his

hat with his newspaper as he came out of the office, and

Charlotte looked at it.

"Were you going out?" she asked, timidly, and yet

the question seemed to imply a suggestion. She glanced

tsWards the door.                            ',

wondering whether she should ask him to call, now her

mother and aunt had gone. She resolved that she would

ask her father. As for Anderson, he went back to the

store in a sort of dream. He suddenly began to won-

der if the impossible could be possible. At one mo-

THE DEBTOR

ment he ridiculed himself for the absurdity of such an

imagination, even, and then the imagination returned.

He reflected that he would have had no such doubt

if it had not been for his lack of success in his profession.

He charged himself with a lack of self-respect that he

should have doubts now.

"After all, I am a man," he told himself. "I am as

good as ever I was."

Then he considered, and rightly, that it was not his

own just estimate of himself which was to be taken into

consideration in a case of this sort, but that of the peo-

ple. He realized that a girl brought up as Charlotte

Carroll had been might, knowing, as she must finally

know, her own father to be little better than a common

swindler, not even dream of the possibility of marrying

a grocer. He had to pass his old office on his way home

to dinner that noon, and he looked at it with more regret

than he had ever done since leaving it. The school was

out and the children were streaming along the street.

The air was full of their chatter. Henry Edgecomb came

up behind him with a good-morning. He looked worn

and nervous. Anderson looked at him sharply after

his greeting.

"What is the matter?" he asked.

"Nothing, only I am tired out," Edgecomb replied,

wearily. "Sometimes I envy you."

"Don't," said Anderson.

"I do. This friction with new souls and tempera-

ments is wearing my old one thin. I would rather sell

butter and cheese."

"Rather do anything than desert the battle-field you

have chosen, because you are beaten," said Anderson,

with sudden bitterness.

"Nonsense! You are not beaten."

"Yes, I am."

"You have simply taken up new weapons."

446








<pb n="447"/>
THE DEBTOR

"Weights and balances," said Anderson, but his laugh

was bitter.; 

He left Edgecomb at the corner, and, going up his own

street, reflected again. HEe began to wonder if possibly

he would not have done better to have stuck to his

profession; if he could not have left Banbridge and

tried elsewhere-in the City. He wondered if he had

shown energy and manly ambiti6n, If he had not been

poor-spirited. When he reached home his mother eyed

him anxiously and asked if he were: iU.ii' i 

"No," he said, "but I met Hentriyahd he looks

wretchedly."                          i

"He hasn't enough to eat,'? Mt;. :Anderson said.

"Harriet does not give him enough' o eat. It is a

shame. If I were in his place I would 'get imarried."

"He says he is tired out teaching.''"He' talks about

the friction of so many natures'lon!hii.'4'-: i

"Of course there is a friction," siaid MtrS; . Anderson,

"but he could stand it if he had miore to1',at;. Let us

have a dinner next Sunday night; let usi have a roast

turkey and a pudding. We will h&ae 'trthni at noon.

Henry is very fond of turkey, and it is late;enough to

get good ones."                 ' i

"Shall we ask Harriet?" inquired Anderson, with a

lurking mischief.                    , ;

His mother looked at him with quick suspicion.

"You don't want her asked?" she said.

"Why should she be asked? She never is."

"I don't know but with an extra dinner-"

"She has her mission," Mrs. Anderson said, with

firmness. "You are eating nothing yourself, Randolph."

Presently she looked at her son with an inscrutable ex-

pression. "Are the Carrolls all gone?" she asked.

Anderson cut himself a .bit of beefsteak carefully be-

fore replying. ,"Some of them, I believe," said he.

"I heard Mrs. Carroll and her sister and daughter and

447








<pb n="448"/>
THE DEBTOR

the boy all went yesterday morning. Josie Eggleston

came in about the Rainy Day Club meeting, this morn-

ing, and she told me." There was something so inter-

rogative in his mother's tone that Anderson was obliged

to say something.

"They all went except the daughter, I believe," he

said.

"The girl who was here?"

"Yes."            -         ,

"Then she didn't go?"

"She went as far as Lancaster, but she came back?"

"Came back?"

"Yes. She didn't want. to leave her father alone,

and-under a cloud, as he seems to be, and she knew

if she declared she was not going there would be'opposi-

tion-that, in fact, her mother would not go."

"I don't think much of her for going, anyway," said

Mrs. Anderson. "Leaving her husband all alone. I

don't care what he had done, he was her husband, and

I dare say he cheated on her account, mostly. She

ought not to have gone."

"They wanted her to go; she is not very strong; and

the sister is really ill," said Anderson, " and so the daugh-

ter planned it. She went as far as Lancaster, then she

got off the train."

"Why, I should think her mother would be crazy ?"

"She sent word back, a letter by Eddy. He got off

the train with her; the train stopped there a few min-

utes."

"Then she came back?"

"Yes."

"And she is going to stay with her father?"

"Yes."

"Oh!" said Mrs. Anderson.

After dinner Anderson sat beside the sitting-room

window with his noon mail, as was his custom, for a

few minutes before returning to the store, and his mother

came up behind him. She stroked his hair, which was

thick. and brown, and only a little gray on the temples.

"She is a very pretty girl, and I think she is a dear

child to come back and not leave her father alone," she

said.

Anderson did noat ,ook -ut,l biV bhe leaned his head

caressingly towards his mother.

"I have been thinling,' said  ., "''Ii am a good

IT was the next day but one that Mrs. Anderson, ar-

rayed in ~her best, seated in state in the Rawdy coach,

was driven into the grounds of the Carroll house. Char-

l6tte answered her ring. The elder woman's quick eye-

saw, with: bth pity and disapproval, that the girl was

unsuitably arrayed for housework in a light cloth dress,

which was necessarily stained' and spotted.

"She had on no apron," she told her son that night.

"I don't suppose the poor child owns one, and of course

she could not help getting her dress spotted. Her little

hands were clean, though, and I think she tries hard.

The parlor was all in a whirl of dust. She had just

been sweeping, and flirting her broom as people always

do who don't know how to sweep. The poor child's

hair was white with dust, and I sat down in a heap of

it, with my best black silk dress, but of course I wouldn't

have seemed to notice it for anything. I brushed it

off when I got in the carriage. I said, 'You are doing

your work?' And she said, 'Yes, Mrs. Anderson.'

She laughed, but she looked sort of pitiful. The poor

little thing is tired. She isn't cut out for such work.

I said her hands and arms didn't look as if she could

sweep very easily, but she bristled right up and said she

was very strong, very much stronger than she looked,

and papa wanted to get a maid for her, but she preferred

doing without one. She wanted the exercise. The

way she said preferred! I didn't try to pity her any

more, for that. Randolph-"

THE DEBTOR

"What is it, mother?"

"How much has that child seen of you ?"

"Not so very much, mother. Why?"

"I think she thinks a great deal about you."

"Nonsense, mother!" Anderson said. It was after

tea that night, and the mother and son sat together in

the sitting-room. They had a fire. on the hearth, and

it looked very pleasant. Mrs. Anderson had a fine

white apron over her best black silk, and she sat one

side of the table, knitting. Anderson was smoking and

reading the evening paper on the other. He continued

to smoke and apparently to read after his mother made

that statement with regard to Charlotte;. She looked

at him and knew perfectly well that he  as not com-

prehending anything he read.     ; 

"She is a very sweet girl," she said, presently, in an

inscrutable voice. "I don't like her family, and I must

say I think her father, from what I hear, almost ought

to be in prison, but I don't think that child is to blame."

"Of course not," said Anderson. He turned his

paper with an air of pretended abstraction.

"She says she thinks her father will leave Banbridge

before long," said Mrs. Anderson, further.

Her son made no response. She sat- thinking how,

if Carroll did leave Banbridge and the rest of the family

were in Kentucky, why, the girl could be judged sepa-

rately; and if Randolph should fancy her--she was not

at all sure that he did-of Charlotte she had not a

doubt. She had never had a doubt of any woman's

attitude of readiness to grasp the sceptre, if it were

only held out by her son. And she herself was con-

scious of something which was almost infatuation for

the girl. Something about her appealed to her. She

had an almost fierce impulse of protection, of partisan-

ship.

Anderson himself had not the least realization of his

45I








<pb n="452"/>
THE DEBTOR

mother's actual sentiments in'the matter. It was 'the

consequence in inconsequence'of a woman, which a mian

can seldom grasp. From what he had known of his

mother's character heretofore, a girl coming from such

a family would have been the last one to appeal'to her

for a daughter-in-law.' She had been plainly hostile

to young women with much superior matrimonial as-

sets. He had often surmised that' she did not,'wish

him to marry at all. 'He did not understand the-pose

sibility there is in some women's 'natures of themselves

falling in love, both individually and vicariously, with

the woman who loves their sons, or who is supposed to

love their sons. 

"Captain Carroll .came into 'the yard just as I drove

out," said Mrs. Anderson. "He is a very fine-looking

man. It is a pity."' Then she added again, with an

obscure accent of congratulation, 'Well, if he goes-away

nobody need say anything more against 'him."'

Anderson reflected, without expressing it aloud;, that

it was doubtful if Carroll's exit was possible, and, if

possible, would be conducive to silence from his credi4

tors, but he apparently continued to read. -:

"He is a very handsome man," said his mother again,

"and he has the air of a gentleman. He bowed to me

like a prince. He is a very fine-looking man, isn't he ?'

Before Anderson could reply the door-bell rang.

"I wonder who it is," Mrs. Anderson said, in a hushed

voice.

"Somebody on business, probably," replied Ander-

son, rising. The maid had gone out. As he went into

the front hall his mother rustled softly into the dining-

room. She was always averse to being in the room

when men came on business. Sometimes commercial

travellers infringed upon. Anderson's home hours, and

she was always covertly indignant. She was constantly

in a state of armed humility with regard to the details

of business. She felt the incongruity of herself, the

elderly gentlewoman aitm.the soft, rich, black silk, with

the scarf of real dlace hastened w'ith: a brooch of real

pearls at the throat,..with the cap.of real lace, with the

tIots of lavender, rihbon, !on.her. uff of white curls,

remaining in the room while the discussion as to the

rates of tea and coffee -,Or sugar, or soap. went on. So

she slipped with her kntting-wok ial'toA.o dining-room,

but she dropped her; al Qfiwmhite-woltwhichi remained

beside the chair whic&ishe:sa ld oeautpiedrii- ,the sitting-

room. She was knitting; a- whit- I  ..shh .She sat be-

side the dining-table,. and- eoatinatet to, Wt;,- however,

pulling furtively on thea recreaat .ta ,awhile her son

ushered somebody; intor the, sitting - to1. asked: him

politely to be seated, and., hern. iclfd kt-rdoor., That

prevented her from knitting aanyrtore, as $he wool was

held taut. So she finally laid 4ter:,wrltOin :tbe table

and went. out into the- hall on her, way dp-6tairs,,.. The

door leading from the hall into .thle ittingtripom .was

closed, and she stopped -and eyed i euiouily: the ,hat

and coat on the old,- fashioned .ahoga.y tabhle in the

hall. She stood looking at them from s4-distance of

a few feet; then she wrapped her sill drapefies closely

around her and slid closer. She .passed .hr hand over

the fine texture of the. coat, whichwas, redolent of-cigar

smoke. She took up the hat. :-Thet she spied the top

card on the little china card-b1aket. on the table) and

took it up. It was Arthur Carroll's: She nodded !her

head, remained, standing a moment listening to the, in-

audible murmur of conversation from the next room,

then went up-stairs, to sit down inlher old winged arm-

chair, covered with a peacock-pattern chintz, and read

until the visitor should be gone.,,. She was fairly quiv-

ering with astonishment and curiosity. But she was

no. more astonished than her son had been when he

had, opened the front-door and seen Arthur Carroll

THE DEBTOR

standing there. He had almost doubted the evidence

of his eyes, especially when Carroll had accepted his

invitation to enter, and had removed his coat and hat

and followed him into the sitting-room.

"It is a cold night," Anderson said, feeling that he

must say something.

"Very, for the season," replied Carroll, "and I have

not yet, in spite of my long residence North, grown

sufficiently accustomed to the heated houses and un-

heated out-of-doors to keep my top-coat on inside, even

if I remain only a few minutes."

The sumptuous lining of the coat gleamed as he laid

it on the hall-table; there was something unconquerable,

sumptuous, genial, undaunted yet about the man. He

had the courtesy of a prince, this poor American who

had lived by the exercise of his sharper wits on his

neighbor's dull ones, if report said rightly. And yet

Anderson, as he sat opposite Carroll, and they were both

smoking in a comrade-like fashion, doubted. There was

something in the man's face which seemed to belie

the theory that he was a calculating knave. His face

was keen, but not cunning, and, moreover, there was a

strange, almost boyish, sanguineness about it which

brought Eddy forcibly to mind. It was the face of a

man who might dupe himself as well as others, and do

it with generous enthusiasm and self-trust. It was the

face of a man who might have bitter awakenings, as

well as his dupes, but who might take the same fatuous,

happy leaps to disaster again. And yet there was a

certain strength, even nobility, in the face, and it was

distinctly lovable, and in no weak sense. He looked

very like Eddy as he sat there, and, curiously enough,

he spoke almost at once of him.

"I believe you were a friend of my son, Mr. Ander-

son," he remarked, with his pleasant, compelling smile.

Anderson smiled in response. "I believe I had that

454








<pb n="455"/>
THE DEBTOR

honor," he replied. Then he said something about his

having gone, and how much his father must miss him.

"He is a fine little fellow," he. added, and was almost

surprised at the expression of; positive gratitude which

came into Carroll's eyes in response. He spoke, how-

ever, with a kind of proud deprecation.

"Oh, well, he is a boy yet, of cqurse," he said, "but

there is a man in him if fate doesn't put too many stum-

bling-blocks in his way."''  . .,

"There is such a thing," said Aaderson.

"Undoubtedly,"-said CarroUll  ",Moral.hurdles for the

strengthening of the spirit are all very well, but occa-

sionally there is a spirit ruined by them." ,

"I think you are right," said AInderoa;, ",still, when

the spirit does make the hurdles'-" , i , 

"Oh yes, it is a very superior sort, after that," said

Carroll, laughing; "but when : it 'doesnt:-! Well, I

hope the boy will have tasks proportioned to his strength,

and I hope he will have a tfry at themi all' anyhow."

"He -seems to me like a boy that would,'" Anderson

said. "What do you think of makg oigf him?"

"I hardly know. It depends. His mother has al-

ways talked a good deal about Eddy's .studying law,

but I don't know. Somehow the law hias always seemed

to me the road of success for the few: and a slippery

maze to nowhere for- the many."

A sudden thought seemed to strike Carroll; he looked

a little disturbed. "By-the-way," he said, "I forgot.

You yourself-"

Anderson smiled. "Yes, I studied law," said he.

"And gave it up?"

"Yes. I could not make a living with it."

Carroll regarded the other man with a curious, wist-

ful scrutiny. He looked more and more like Eddy.

His next question was as full of naivet6 as if the boy

himself had asked it, and yet the charming, almost

30                   455

THE DEBTOR

courtly state of the man never for one instant failed.

"And so," he said, "you tried selling butter and eggs

instead of legal wisdom?" The question might have

been insolent from its purport, but it was not.

Anderson laughed. "Yes," he replied. "People must

eat to live, but they can live without legal wisdom. I

found butter and eggs were more salable."

Carroll continued to regard him with that pathetic,

wondering curiosity. "And you have never regretted

the change?" he asked.

"I don't say that, but, regret or not, I had to make

it, and-I am not exactly sure that I do regret it."

"But this-this new occupation of yours cannot be

-precisely congenial." 

"That does not disturb me," Anderson said, a little

impatiently.

Carroll looked at him with understanding. "I see

you feel as I do about that," he said. " It is rather prov-

ing one's self of the comnion to hold back too strenu-

ously from it, and yet"-he hesitated a moment-" it

takes courage, though,'! he said. Suddenly his eyes

upon the other man became full of admiration. "My

daughter tells me, or, rather, my son told me-principally,

that you are interested in entomology ?" he said.

"Oh, I dabble a little in it," Anderson replied, smil-

ing. 

Carroll's eyes upon him continued to hold their wist-

ful questioning, admiring expression. Anderson be-

gan to wonder what he had come for. He was puzzled

by the whole affair. Carroll, too, seemed to present

himself to him under a new guise. He wondered if his

reverses had brought about the change.

"I do not wish," said Carroll, "to display curiosity

about affairs which do not concern me, and I trust you

will pardon me and give me information, or not, as

you choose; but may I ask how you happened, when

456








<pb n="457"/>

you became convinced that ypu were not to ,make a

success in law, why you chose your-present business ?"

"I have not the sightestr,.objectitn to answering,"

said Anderson, although r;he .began -to wonder if the

other had called simply ,fQr-;.the puRpose of gratifying

his curiosity about his  airs .'fi;,the, slightest. I

simply tried to think -f , poaieth$gow}hwhc  I should be

sure to sell, because people would be sur-to bbuy, and

J thought of-butter and pheese. ; At lF seems exceed-

ingly simple to me, the .principl. qEtainig enough

be willing to give their own; eamig.,  Ist is all a ques-

tion of supply for the demand. ?rtg you must study

act like Booth or sing like Patti, segalthat,; if,you can

dance like Carmencita, sell that... At alW-remains with

you, what you can do; sing o01 damne, or sway a multi-

tude, or sell butter and eggs; or posgibly,, rather, it re-

mains with the public and what it deq'dess you can do

-that is better for one's vanity."-.  -

"Decidedly," agreed Carroll, with an odd, reflective

expression.                ' , , - .     .

"If the public want your song ,or your novel or your

speech, they will buy it, or yourdance, and if they don't

they won't, and you cannot make them. You have to

sell what the public want to buy, for you yourself are

only a unit in a goodly number of .millions."

"And yet how extremely all-pervading that unit can

feel sometimes," Carroll said, with a laugh,

He was silent again, puffing at his cigar, and again

Anderson, leaning back opposite and also smoking,

wondered why he was there. Then Carroll removed

457








<pb n="458"/>
THE DEBTOR

his cigar and spoke. His voice was a little constrained,

but he looked Anderson full in the face.

''-Mr. Anderson," he said, "I want to know if you

will kindly tell me how much I owe you, for I am one

of the consumers of butter and eggs."

Anderson continued to smoke a second before answer-

ing. "I cannot possibly tell you here, Mr. Carroll,"

he replied then.

"Of course I know I should have written and asked

for the bill," Carroll said, "but I knew some had been

paid, and-you have been most kind, and-"

Anderson waited.

"In short," said Carroll, speaking quickly and

brusquely, "I am under a cloud here, and-your mother

called to see my daughter this afternoon, and I thought

that possibly you would pardon me if I put it all on a

little different basis."

Carroll stopped, and again Anderson waited. He

was becoming more and more puzzled.

Then Carroll spoke quite to the point. "I could

have sent for the bill which you have so generously not

sent, which you have so generously allowed my poor,

little daughter to think was settled," said he, "but if

you had sent it I simply could not have paid it. I

could have written you what I wished to say, but I

thought I could say it better. I wish to say to you

that I shall be obliged if you will let me know the ex-

tent of my indebtedness to you, and if you will accept

my note for six months."

"Very well," said Anderson, gravely.

" If you will have the bill made out and sent me to-mor-

row, I will send you my note by return mail," said Carroll.

"Very well, Mr. Carroll," replied Anderson.

Carroll arose to go. "You have a pleasant home

here, Mr. Anderson," he said, looking around the room

with its air of old-fashioned comfort, even state.

458








<pb n="459"/>
THE DEBTOR

"It has always seemed pleasant to me," said Ander-

son. An odd, kindly feeling for Carroll overcame him.

He extended his hand. "I am glad you called, Captain

Carroll," he said. He hesitated a moment. Then he

added: "You will necessarily be lonely with your family

away. If you would come in again-"

"I cannot leave my daughter alone much," Carroll

answered, "but otherwise I should be'glad to. Thank

you."  He looked at Anderson with evident hesitation.

There was something apparently whichi he;was about to

say, but doubted the wisdom.of saying it. ,

"Your daughter is still with you?" Anderson said.

"Yes."                              ,

Then Anderson hesitated a second.' Then he spoke.

"Would you allow me to call upon "your daughter,

Captain Carroll ?" he asked, bluntly.

Carroll's face paled as he looked at him. "On my

daughter ?"                         . 

"Yes. Captain Carroll, will you be seated again for 

a few minutes. I have something I would like to say

to you." 

Anderson was pale, but his voice was quite firm. He

had a strange sensation as of a man who had begun a

dreaded leap, and felt that in reality the 'worst was

over, that the landing could in no way equal the shock

of the start. Carroll followed him back into the sitting-

room and sat down.

Anderson began at once with no preface. "I should

like to marry your daughter, if she can love me well

enough," he said, simply.

"Does she know you at all, Mr. Anderson?" Carroll

said, in a dazed sort of fashion.

"She knows me a little. I have, of course, seen her

in my store."

"Yes."

"And once, as you may remember, she came here."

459








<pb n="460"/>
THE DEBTOR

'^Yes, when she had the fright from the tramp."

"''She cannot know me very well iI admit." (

" I don't see that you know her very well, either, for

that matter.": 

"I know her well enough," said Anderson. 'I have

no doubt as far as I am concerned. My only doubt is

for her, not only whether she can care sufficiently for

me, but whether, if she should care, it would be the

best thing for her. I am much older than she. I can

support her in comfort, but not in luxury, probably

never in luxury; and you know my position, that I have

been forced to abandon a profession which would give

my wife a better social standing. You know all that;

there is no need of my dwelling upon it."

Anderson said that with an indescribable pride, and

yet with a perfect acquiescence in the situation. He

looked at Carroll, who remained quite pale, looking at

him with an inscrutable expression of astonishment.

Finally he smiled a little.

"As they say in the comic column, this is so sudden,

Mr. Anderson," he said.

'I can well imagine so," Anderson replied, smiling

in his turn. "It is rather sudden to me. Nothing

was further from my intention than to say this to-

night."  .

Carroll looked at him soberly. "Mr. Anderson, it

all depends upon the child," he said.. "If Charlotte

likes you, that is all there is to be said about it. You

are a good man and you can take care of her. As far

as the other goes, I have no right to say anything.

Frankly, I should prefer that you had succeeded in

your profession than in your present business, on her

account."

"So should I," said Anderson, gloomily.

"But it is all for her to decide. Come and call, and

let matters take their course. But-I shall .say noth-

469








<pb n="461"/>
THE DEBTOR

ing to her about this.: A girl like Charlotte is a sensitive

thing. Call and see. As far 'as I am concerned-"

Carroll paused a second. Then he rose and held out

his hand. "I have no reason, whatever to object to

you as a husband for my daughter, and my son-in-law,"

he said.

"Thank you," said Anderson. 

Carroll had gone out of the door,, and Anderson was'

just about to close it after him, whn'he tured back.

"By-the-way, Mr. Anderson," he' said`: andndAnderon

understood that he was about to say what htd been on

his mind before and he had refrained from' beipssing.

"I want to inquire if you have any acquaintance with

the large grocery house of Kidder & ;Laddi in the

City?" he asked.             "     '    ' .:  .'.,

"A slight business acquaintance;" replied Anderson,

wonderingly.                 ;       . .- 

"I saw," said Carroll, in an odd, breathless' sortt:of

voice, an advertisement for a - floor-walker ins that

house. I wondered, in the event of my applying for

it, if you would be willing to give me a letter of intto-

duction to one of the firm, if you were sufficiently ac-

quainted."

"Certainly," said Anderson, but he was aware that

he almost gasped out the answer.

"I saw the advertisement," said Carroll again. `"I

have to make some change in my business, and"-he

essayed a laugh-"I have to think, as we have agreed

is the thing to do, of some salable wares in my pos-

session. It did occur to me that I might make a pass-

able floor-walker. I have even thought of a drum-

major, but there seems no vacancy in that line. If you

would."

"Certainly," said Anderson again. "Would you like

it; now?"

"If it is not too much trouble."

461








<pb n="462"/>
THE DEBTOR

* Anderson hastened to the old-fashioned secretary in

the sitting-room and wrote a line of introduction on a

card while Carroll waited.

"Thank you," Carroll said, taking it and placing it

carefully in his pocket -book. The two men shook

hands again; Carroll went with his stately stride down

the street. It was snowing a little. Anderson thought

idly how he had not offered him an umbrella, as he saw

the flakes driving past the electric light outside as he

pulled down the window-curtains, but he was as yet

too dazed to fully appreciate anything. He was dazed

both by his own procedure and by that of the other

man. It was as if two knights in a mock tourney had

met, both riding at full speed. He had his own mo-

mentum and that of the other in the shock of meeting.

His mother's door opened as he went up-stairs with

his night-lamp, and her head in a white lace-trimmed

cap, for she still clung to the night-gear of her early

youth, peered out at him.

"Who was it?" she asked, softly, as if the guest were

still within hearing.

"Captain Carroll."

"Oh!"

"He came on business."

"He stayed quite awhile. You had a little call with

him ?"

"Yes, mother."

She still looked at him, her face, of gentle, wistful

curiosity, dimly visible between the lace ruffles of her

nightcap, in the door.

"He spoke of your calling there this afternoon, and

he seemed much pleased," Anderson said.

"Did he?"

"Yes."

"Well, good-night, dear," said Mrs. Anderson, with

an odd, half-troubled but rather enjoyable sigh. Her

son kissed her, and she disappeared. She got back into

bed, and put her lamp out. The electric light outside

streamed into her room and brought back to her mind

moonlight reveries of her early maidenhood. She re-

membered how she used, before she ever had a lover, to

lie awake and dream of one. Then she fell to planning

how, in the event of Randolpihs marrying, the front

chamber could be refurnished, and the furniture in that

room put in the northwest chamber, which was sparsely

furnished and little used except for storage purposes.

Then the northwest room'could be the guest-chamber,

and Randolph's present rotm wodld answer very well

for his books, and would be a study when the bed was

taken down.                     * .

She had the front chamber eompletely refurnished

when she fell asleep, and besides had some exciting and

entirely victorious feminine tilts with *sundry women

friends who had ventured to intiniate that h'er son had

made an odd matrimonial choice. It' wtas quite a cold

night, and she wondered if that child had sufficient

clothing on her bed. She was in reality, iin her own way,

as much in love with the girl as her son.

CHAPTER XXXVI

CARROLL, in the ensuing weeks, living alone with

Charlotte, endured a species of mental and spiritual

torture which might have been compared with the rack

and wheel of the Inquisition. It seemed to Arthur

Carroll in those days as if torture was as truly one of

the elements incumbent upon man's existence as fire,

water, or air. He got an uncanny fancy that if it ceased

he would cease. He had all his life, except in violent

stresses, that happy, contented-with-the-sweet-of-the-

moment temperament popularly supposed to be a char-

acteristic of the butterfly over the rose. But deprive

the butterfly of the rose and he might easily become a

more tragic thing than any in existence. Now Car,

roll was deprived of his rose, he could get absolutely

none of the sweets out of existence from whence his

own individuality manufactured its honey. Even Char-

lotte's presence became an additional torment to him,

dearly as he loved her and as thoroughly as he realized 

what her coming back had done for him, from what it :

had saved him. She had given him the impetus which

placed him back in his normal condition, but, back 

there, he suffered even more, as a man will suffer less 

under a surgical operation than when the influence of

the anesthetics has ceased. There was absolutely no

ready money in the house during those weeks except

the sum which Charlotte's aunt had sent her, which was

fast diminishing, and a few scattering dollars, or rather,,

pennies, which Carroll picked up in ways which almost

He thought that possibly his fine presence .and urbane

manner might recommend him 'for a. plaie of that sort,

but it was already filled. He went, to several of the

great department stores and inquired'if there was a

vacancy. He felt that the superintendents; to whom

he applied regarded his good points as he might have

regarded the good points of a horse. .One of them told

him that if he would. give his address, he would be

given the preference whenever,,a vacancy occurred.

Carroll knew that he was mentally appraised as a prom-

ising person to direct ladies to ribbon and muslin counters.

He looked at another floor-walker strutting up and down

the aisle, and felt sure that he could do better, and all

this.amused contempt for himself deepened and bored

THE DEBTOR

its way into his very soul. He always asked himself;

with the demand of an unpitying judge, if he could not

have done better for himself if he had begun at once;

if he had not at the first failure drifted with no resistance,

with the pleasant, easy. devil-may-careness which was

in his nature along with the sterner stuff which was now

upheaving and asserting itself, and taken what he could,

how he could. He had not, after all, had an absolutely

unhappy home, although it had been founded on the

sands, and although that iron of hatred of the man who

had done him the wrong had been always in his soul.

The life he had led had been not one of active and volun-

tary preying upon his fellow-men; it had been only the

life of one who must have the sweets of existence for 

himself and those he loved, and he had gotten them,

even if the flowers and the fruit hung over the garden-

walls of others. Now it suddenly seemed to him that

he could no longer do it, as he had done, even if the

owners of the fruit and flowers should be still unawares.

Curiously enough, the old Pilgrim's Progress which he

had read as a child was very forcibly in his mind in these

days. He remembered the child that ate the fruit that

hung over the wall, and how the gripes, in consequence, 

seized him. Something very like the conviction of sin '

was over the man, or, rather, a complete consciousness i

of himself and his deeds, which is, maybe, after all, the

true meaning of the term. It was true that the self-

knowledge had seemed to come, perforce, because it was :

temporarily out of his power to transgress farther; in :

other words, because he was completely found out; but :i;

all the same, the knowledge was there. He saw hiim-

self just as he was, had been-a great man goaded on

always by the small, never-ceasing prick of hatred, with

the sense of injury always stinging his soul, living as

he chose, having all that he could procure, utterly care-

less whether at the expense and suffering of others or

466








<pb n="467"/>
THE DEBTOR

not. Now, for the first time, he began to adjust him-

self in the place of others, and the adjusting produced

torment from the realization of their miseries, and worse

torment from realizatioa of his own contemptibility.

It really seemed as if all positions which might have

been in some keeping with the man .and his antecedents

were absolutely out of his reach  Not a night but he

read the advertising columns until he was blind and

dizzy  Every morning he went 'to New York and

hunted. The first morning he had takin the train, he

had actually to assure some of Shis watehful creditors

that he was going to return. Then all day hewandered

about the streets, making one of long lines'of applicants

for the vacant positions. One m-ntiing'he .found him-

self in the line with William Allbright.: 'He recognized

unmistakably the meek, bent back'of the old clerk three

ahead of him in the line. A book-keeper had been ad-

vertised for in a large wholesale hoiuse, 'and , there were

perhaps forty applicants all awaiting :their turn. His

first impulse, when he caught sight of 'iis bid clerk, was

to leave the line himself; then the lnobility Which was

struggling for life within him asserted itself and made

him ashamed of his shame. He stood still with his

head a little higher, and moved on with the slowly mov-

ing line of men which crawled towards the desk like a

caterpillar. He saw Allbright turn away rejected with

a feeling of pity; the old man looked dejected. Carroll

reflected with a sensation of pride that at least he did

not owe him. He himself was rejected promptly after

he had owned to his age. The man four behind him

was chosen. He was a very young man, scarcely more

than a boy, unless his looks belied him. He was dis-

tinctly handsome, with the boy-doll style of beauty-

curly, dark hair, rosy cheeks, and a small, very care-

fully tended mustache. He wore a very long and fash-

ionable coat, and was evidently pleasantly conscious

Aeard a voice so near his ear that it whistled. , Thei

;voice was exceedingly bitter, even malignant. 

"That's the way it goes, these times; that's the way

it always goes," said the voice.  .             .,,

Carroll turned and gazed at the speaker, a man prob-

ably older than himself; if not, he looked older, since

his hair was quite white and his carriage not so good.

"The employers nowadays are a pack of fools, a pack

of fools!" said the man. His long, rather handsome

face, a face which should have been mild in its natural

state was twisted into a thousand sardonic wrinkles.

"A pack of fools!" he repeated. "Here they'll go and

hire a little whippersnapper like that every time, instead

of a man who has had experience and knows how to do

the work, just because he's young. Young! What's

that? You'd think what they wanted was a man to

keep their books straight. I can keep books if I do say

so, and that young snip can't. Lord! He was in Avin

& Mann's with me. Why, I tell you he can't add up

a column of figures three inches long straight, to save

his neck. The books will be in a pretty state. I'll 

give him just ten days before they'll have to get an

expert in to straighten out things. Hope they will; ;

serve 'em right. Here I am, can't get a job to save my :

life, because my hair has turned and I've got a few :

more years'over my head, and I can keep books better 

than I ever could in my life. Good Lord! You'4 .;

'" 'I-shouldn't be surprised if you were right, sir,"

replied Carroll, rather ,apathetically. He was going

through all this with,<at;the sligteist hope, but only for

the sake of feeling that ien h addone his utmost before

he took up with the alteratiye ;wtefio, so dismayed his

very soul. He himself looked. -old thait morning. He

had retained his youthful apppliaanc'e,mveh longer than

men usually do, but a he had vihiwed, hi' reflectibn in the

glass that morning She-!had said  i 'imnself'that he at

"But you look as if you tcomlld. do-f;,re . andibetter

work in an hour than that young, 'bob-sqarl t ; could in

a month," said the man at his side  . ,i '.

"Very likely," replied Carroll, inditffeenty. .  :;

"You don't seem to care much&abdut ;. it? the other

man said. The two' had gone out d: the lbuilding, ,and

were walking slowly down the street.

"If they want young men:,they do, I sappose," Car-

roll said.     :               , 

"Been trying long?"

"Quite a time."                  ; ,,

"Well, the employers are a set of GI;D. fools!" said

the other man. An oath sounded horribly incongru-

ous coming from his long; thin, benevolent mouth.

"I don't see what you are going to do about it if they

are," Carroll replied, still with that odd patience. It

seemed to him as if he was getting a sort of fellow-feeling

aknd intense personal knowledge of ,his fellow-beings,

which united him to them with ties stronger than those

of love. He felt as if he more than loved this rebellious

wretch beside him, as if he were one with him, only pos-

sesed of that patience which gave him a certain power

to aid him. "I suppose men have the right to employ

whom they choose," said Carroll. " If they prefer young

men who don't know how to do the work, to old men

who do, I suppose they have a right to engage them.

And they may have some show of reason for it. I don't

see what can be done, anyway."

" I'll tell you what has got to be done, sir, and how we

can help ourselves," returned the other, with a ranting

voice which made people turn and stare at him. "I'll

tell you. We've got to form a union. There are unions

for everything else. We have got to have a union of

older, men qualified to work, who are shouldered out of

it by boys. Once that is done, we are all right. To-day

in this country a man can't hire whom he pleases in

most things. The unions have put it out of his power.

The people have risen. We belong to a part of the people

who haven't risen. Now we must rise. Let us form a

union, I say. If they engage young men before us,

there are ways of making them smart for it, the em-

ployers as well as the employ6s. I tell you that has got

to be done."

Suddenly the men heard a laugh behind them. It

was a woman's laugh, shrill and not altogether pleasant-

not the laugh of a young woman, but the woman who

came up with and immediately began to speak looked

quite young. She was undeniably pretty. Her blond

pompadour drooped coquettishly over one eye, her

cheeks were pink, her face smooth, her figure was really

superb, and she was very well dressed, in a tailor-made

gown, smart furs, and a hat evidently of the English-

tailor make.

"Excuse me," she said, with perfect assurance, and

yet with nothing of offensive boldness, rather with an

air of camaraderie, "but I heard you talking, you two,

and I thought I would give you a few points. I don't

know whether you know it or not, but I have recently

secured the position of cashier there, in Adkins &

Somers's." She motioned with one nicely gloved hand

back towards the place they had just left. "I got it

in preference to about a dozen young girls, too," she

said, with triumph, '.'but I shouldn't have if-"  She

hesitated a minute. The color on her cheeks deepened

under the floating veil, and there was, in consequence,

a curious effect of two shades of rose on her cheeks.

"See here," she said, walking along with them, "I don't

know you two men from Adam, and I needn't take the

trouble, and if you don't like it you can lump it, but

I'm going to say something. I know I look young. I

ain't fishing for a compliment. I know it. I've got a

looking-glass in a good light, and I've got mny eyes in

my head, and, what's more, I'm spunky enough to own

it to myself if I don't look young; but I ain't young. I

ain't going to say how old I am, but I will say this

much, I ain't young. I've been married twice and I've

had three children. My first husband died, the second

went off and left me. I've got a daughter fourteen

years old I'm keeping in school. She ain't going into

a department store, if I work my fingers to the bone."

She said the last with a fierce air that made her for a

second really look younger. "Well," she went on.

"I'll tell you, too. I had a good place for a number

of years, but the man died in September, and the man

that took the business put his sister in my place. Then

I was out of a job. I hadn't saved a cent, and I didn't

know what I was going to do. Mildred-that's my

daughter-is big of her age and good-looking, and she

wanted to leave school and go to work, but I wouldn't

let her. Well, I studied up all the advertisements and

I tried, and I couldn't do a thing. Then I set my wits

to work. I ain't one to give up in a hurry; I never was.

As I said before, I didn't have much money, but I hire

our little flat of a woman, and she's a good sort, and

she's willing to wait, and a month ago I took every cent

I cotld raise and I went through a course of treatment

with a beauty-doctor. I had my hair (it was turned

somie) dyed, and I was massaged until I felt like a cur-

rant-bun, but I always had a good skin, and there was

sbmething to work on, and I took my figure in hand;

that wasn't very bad, anyway, but I got new corsets,

awful expensive ones, and had a tailor suit made. I

had to raise some money on a little jewelry I had, but

I made up my mind it was neck or nothing, and, sir,

a month ago I got that place in Adkins & Somers's at

a thousand a year. They are gooql men, too. You

needn't think there's anything wrong." She looked at

them with an expression as if she was ready to spring

at the slightest intimation of distrust on their part.

"It is only just that people think they want young help

and they are going to have it. I've got the place and

I'm in clover, and it's worth something looking so much

better, though it don't make much difference to me.

All I care about nowadays is my daughter."

The two men looked at the woman, Carroll with a

courteous sympathy, and the interest of an observer of

human nature. She was of a pronounced American

type, coarse, vulgar, strident-voiced, smart, with a

shrewdly working brain and of an unimpeachable heart.

She was generosity and honesty itself, as she looked at

the two men in a similar strait to the one from which

she had extricated herself.

The other man, who had a bitter, possibly a danger-

ous strain developed by his misfortunes, laughed sar-

donically. "How long do you think you can keep it

up?" said he. "Hm?"     Had he been less worn and

weary, and apparently even starved, his laugh and ques-

tion would have evoked a sharper response. As it Was,

the woman replied with the utmost good-riature.

- "Any old time," said she. "Lord! I ain't setting'

up for a kid. I ain't fool enough to put on short skirts

can keep it up, anyhow. Lord! I ain't so very ld,

anyhow. If I didn't look the way I do now, I couldn't

get a position, becatise 'they'd put me down for a back-

number; but I had something left for' tat beauty-doctor

to work on." Then she gazed critically at. the two men.

"It wouldn't take much to make you into a regular

dude," said she to Carroll. ";.Y6,U are.' dressed to beat

the band as it is. Say!"  She ga&v hil'a, 'confidential

wink.                       '     ..  '. ...

"Well?" said Carroll.             i   .      .

"You are dressed most too well   It's Al very well

to look stylish, to look .as if. you hat ;bebn, earaing

twenty-five hundred a year, but, ,LordL yoD.   look as if

you had been getting ten! .The bossed faibt be a little

himself to some of the firm's cash. .See?; I dt.'t mean

any offence. You look to me like a : rel gentlemanY."

"Thank you," replied CarrollU- ."..          "

"If I was you I'd put on a pair of pants not quite

so nicely creased, and I'd sell that ovetat-;;and get .a

good-style ready-made one.' Your !chancedl would be

a heap better-honest."          '     , ' 

"Thank you," said Carroll, again. He was conscious

of amusement and a curious sense of a mefltal tonic from

this, loud-voiced, eagerly helpful female. ,;.

"I'm right, you bet," said she. "ButJ otherwise it

wouldn't take much. You go and have .a little some-

thing put on your hair, and have your -ace massaged

a little, and if I was you I'd buy a red tie. You can get

a dandy red tie at Steele & Esterbrook's for a quarter.

That one you have on makes you look kinder pale.

Then a red tie is younger. Say, I'll tell you, if you would

only have your mustache trimmed, and wax the ends,

it would make no end of difference."

"What are you going to do when you are asked how

old you are? Lie ?" inquired the other man, in his bit-

ter, sardonic voice.

This time the woman regarded him with slight in-

dignation. "Say," said she, "you'll never get a place

if you don't act pleasanter. Places ain't to be got that

way, I can tell you. You've got to act as if you'd eat

nothin' but butter an' honey for a fortnight. If you

feel mad, you'd better keep it in your insides." Then

she answered his questions. "No, I ain't goin' to lie,

and I ain't goin' to tell anybody else to lie," said she.

"Lying ain't my style. But it ain't anybody's busi-

ness how old you are, anyhow. I don't know what right

a man that I go to get a place frdtn has got to ask how

old I be. All he has any right to know is whether I ain't

too old to do my work. I don't lie; no, siree. All I say

is, and kinder laugh, 'Well, call it twenty-five,' or you

might call it thirty, and with some, again, you might

call it thirty-two or three. That ain't lyin' if I know

what lyin' is." As the woman spoke her face assumed

precisely the mischievous, challenging smile with which

she had replied to similar questions. Carroll laughed,

and the other man also, although grudgingly.

"Well," he said, "there's different ways of looking

at a lie."

"It wouldn't be any manner of use for you to say you

wouldn't see twenty-eight again, no matter how much

you got fixed up " the woman retorted. "But I guess

you can get something, if it ain't quite so good. I have

a gentleman friend who is over fifty and who said he was

thirty-seven, and he got a dandy place last week. But

I tell you you'll have to hustle more'n this other gentle-

man. You're bald, ain't you?"

"I don't know what that has got to do with it,"

growled the man, and he tried to quicken his pace; but

she kept up with him.

"It's got a good deal to do with it," said she. "I

know a place on Sixth Avenue where you can get an

elegant front-piece that nobody could ever tell, for three

dollars and forty-nine cents. , Another gentleman friend

of mine-he's a sort of relation of mine; my sister was

his first Fife-got one there. Yes, sir, you'll have to

get one, and you'll have to get your face massaged and

your eyebrows blacked, and, Lord! you'll have to have

that beard shaved off and have a zmustache, if you get

anything at all. Lord! you look as if you'd come right

out of the Old Testament. I don't see why you're wast-

ing your time hanging around offices for, without you

see to that, first of all. I should think your wife would

tell you, but I suppose she's the same sort. Now as for

you," she added, turning again to Carroll, "if you just

get polished up a little bit-say, here's the card of my

beauty-doctor" (she produced a card from an ornate

wrist-bag)-"you'll look dandy."

Suddenly the woman, with a quick good-bye, turned

to cross Broadway, but her good-nature and sympathy

had something fine and inexhaustible, for even then

she turned back to look encouragingly upon the older,

soured, bitter, ungrateful man with Carroll, and she

said: "You go 'long with him, and I guess you'll get a

place, too. Good-bye."

With that she was gone, passing as straight as if she

owned an unassailable right of way through the press

of vehicles. Just as she gained the opposite sidewalk

a fire-engine thundered up.

"She had a close call from that," Carroll said. His

face had altered. He still looked amused.

"That woman couldn't get run over if she tried,"

sad the other man.

"There ain't nothing made in the country that can

run over her. It's women like her that's keeping men

out of the places that belong to them by right."

"I am afraid there was some truth in her theory and

iher-advice," Carroll said, laughing, and looking after

tlt second engine clanging through the scattering crowd.

>l.'c Well, I guess when I go to buying women's frizzes

:to ,wear to get a place, she'll know it," said the other

=san. "Good lord! if it's the outside of the head they

Want, why don't they get dummies and done with it?

I tell you what is needed is a new union."

Just at that moment they reached a restaurant from

which came an odor of soup. Carroll turned to his

companion. "I am going in here to get some lunch,"

he said. "I don't know what kind of a place it is, but

if you will go with me, I shall take pleasure in-"

But the man turned upon him fiercely. "I 'ain't got

quite so low yet that I have to eat at another man's

expense," he said. "You needn't think, because you

wear a better coat than I do, that-"  The man stopped

and nodded his head, speechless, and went on, and was

out of sight, but Carroll had seen tears in the angry eyes.

He went into the restaurant, took a seat at a table,

and ordered a bowl of tomato-soup. As he was sipping

it he heard a voice pronounce his name, and, glancing

up, saw two pretty girls and a young man at a near-by

table. He recognized the young man as the one who

had been lately in his employ. About the girls he was

not so sure, but he thought they were the same who

had come to Banbridge to plead for their payment.

They all bowed to him, and he returned the salutation.

They all had a severe and, at the same time, curious

expression. One of the girls whispered to the other,

and although the words were not audible, the sharp

hiss reached Carroll's ears. 

"Wonder what he's doing in this place," she said.

"The other girl, the elder, craned her neck and. ob-

served what Carroll was eating. "He hasn't got any-

thing but a bowl of tomato-soup," she replied.

' :"'pose he's goin' through the whole bill," said the

young man. The three were themselves lunching fru-

gally. One of the girls had also!.a bowl of tomato-soup,

the other a large piece .'of squashipie. The young inan

of himself, the worshipful idmiraticn ll;ithad-^.ad for

the man still influenced him. The poor young fellow,

whose very pertness and braggadcdiort'areasimple  and

childlike, really felt towards the.- oldvtan who hada

been his employer much as a faitkiful retaiageritowards

He had, after all, that nobility iof soul' which: altered

circumstances could not affect. HeeWas; just as defer-

ential as if Carroll had been seated; at :a tableiin; Del-

monico's, but the fact remained, that 'he was about to

ask him again for his money. He was horribly pressed.

He had obtained another position: inm ne!'of the depart-

ment stores, which paid him ver3r libte, and he was in

debt, while his clothes were in :sueh :a degree of shabbi-

ness:that they were fairly precarious. The very night

before he had sat up until midnight mending a rent in

his trousers, which he afterwards inked; and as for his

overcoat, he always removed' that with a sleight-of-

hicd': lest: its ragged lining becomne evident, and when

ladies were about he put it on in an agony lest his arms

catch in the rents. He had even meditated cutting out

the lining altogether, although he had a cold. He was

so in debt that he had stopped eating breakfast; and

the leaving off of breakfast for other than hygienic rea-

sons, and when it has not been preceded by a heavy

dinner the night before, is notconducive to comfort.

So he bent low over Carroll and asked him in a small

voice of the most delicate consideration, if he could let

him have a little on account.

Carroll had turned quite white when he approached

him, but his regard of him was unswerving. "It is im-

possible for me to-day, Mr. Day," he replied, "but I

assure you that you shall have every cent in the

end."

The tears actually sprang into the young fellow's

nervously winking eyes. "It would be a great accom-

modation," he said, in the same low tone.

"You shall have every cent as soon as I can possibly

manage it," Carroll repeated.

"I have a position, but it does not pay me very much

yet," said the young fe!ow, "and-and-I am owing

considerable, and-I need some things."

His involuntary shrug of his narrow shoulders in

his poor coat spoke as loudly as words.

Carroll was directly conscious in an odd, angry, con-

temptuous sort of fashion, and whether because of him-

self, or of that other man, or of an overruling Provi-

dence, he would have been puzzled to say, of his own

outer garment of the finest cloth and most irreproach-

able make. "As soon as I can manage it, every cent,"

he repeated, almost mechanically, and took another sip

of his soup. The young fellow's winking eyes, full of

tears, were putting him to an ignominious torture.

The two girls had stood close behind the young man,

waiting their turns. Now the younger stepped forward,

and she spoke quite audibly in her high-pitched voice.

"Good-morning, Mr. Carroll," said she, with a strained

pertnessof manner.

"Good - morning," Carroll returned, politely. He

half arose from the table.

The girl giggled nervously. Her pretty, even beau-

tiful face, under her crest of blond hair and the scoop

of a bright red hat, paled and flushed. "Oh, don't

stop your luncheon," said she; "Go right on. I just

wanted to ask if you could possibly-"

"I am very sorry," Carroll replied, "but to-day it is

impossible; but in the end you shall not lose one dollar."

The girl pouted. Her beauty: gave her some power

of selfassertion, although in reality she was of an ex-

ceedingly mild and gentle sort. 

"That is very well," Msaid she, "but how long do you

think' it will be before we get to the end, Mr. Carroll?"

"I hope not very long," Carroll said, with a miser-

able patience. 

"It had better not be very long," said she, and sud-

denly her high voice pitched to tragedy. "If-if-I

can't get another place that's decent for a girl to take," '

said she, " and if I don't get what's owing me before long,

I shall either have to take one of them places or get a

dose." She said the last word with an indescribably

hideous significance. Her blue eyes seemed to blaze

at Carroll.

Then the other girl pressed closer. "You needn't

talk that way," said she to the girl. "You know that

I-I"

"I ain't goin' to live on you," returned the other girl,

violently. People were beginning to look at the group.

"Now, you know, May," said the other girl, "my

room is plenty big enough for two, and I'm earning

plenty to give you a bite till you get a place yourself,

and you know you may get that place you went to see

about yesterday."

"No, I won't," said May. "It seems to me'it's

pretty hard lines that a poor girl can't get the money

site's worked as hard for as I have."

The other girl pushed herself in front of May and

spoke to Carroll, and there was something womanly and

beautiful in her face. "I have a real good place," she

said, in a low voice, and she enunciated like a lady. "A

real good place, and I'll look out for May till she gets

one, and I can wait until you are able to pay me."

"I will pay you all as soon. as possible. I give you

all my word I will pay you in the end," said Carroll.

He seemed to see the three go out in a sort of dream.

It did not really seem to him that it was he, Arthur

Carroll, who was sitting there in that smoking, greasy

atmosphere, before that table covered with a stained

cloth, over which the waiter had ostentatiously spread

a damp napkin, with that bowl of canned tomato-soup

before him, and that thick cup of coffee, with those three

unhappy young creditors, who had reviled and, worse

than reviled, pitied him, passing out, with the open

glances of amused curiosity fastened upon him on every

side.

"Guess that dude is down on his luck," he heard a

young man at his left say.

"Guess he put the money he'd ought to have paid

that young lady with into his overcoat," his companion,

a girl with a picture-hat, and a wide lace collar over her

coat, responded.

Carroll felt that he was overwhelmed, beaten, at bay

before utter ignominy. The thought flashed across him,

as he tried to swallow some more of the soup, that in

some respects, if he had been a murderer or a great

bank defaulter with detectives on his track, the situa-

tion would at least have been more endurable. The

horrible pettiness of it all, constituted the maddening

sting of it. While he was thinking this the girl they called

marched, holding her skirts tightly around her, with a

displosure of embroidered ruffles and the contour of

pretty hips, and there:was a shout of laughter in the

place. Carroll pushed away his bowl of soup and turned

to a grinning waiter near him.

"My check," he said.

"I ain't your waiter," replied the man, insolently.

"Bring me my check for this soup and coffee," re-

peated Carroll, and the man started. There was some-

thing in his look and tone that commanded respect even

in this absurdity. In reality, for the time, he was al-

most a madman. His fixed idea reasserted itself. At

that moment, if it had been possible that his enemy,

the man who had precipitated all this upon him, could

have entered the room, there would have been murder

done, and again for the moment his mind overlapped

on the wrong side of life, and the desire for death was

upon him. There was that in his face which hushed the

laughter.

"They had better not hound that man much farther,"

one man at the table on the right whispered to his com-

panion, who nodded, with sharp eyes on Carroll's face.

They were both newspaper-men.

When Carroll had paid his bill and passed out, one of

the men, young and clean-shaven, pressed close to his side.

"Pardon me, sir," he said, "but if you would allow

me to express my regrets and sympathy-"

"No regrets nor sympathy are required, thank you,

sir," replied Carroll.

"If I could be of any assistance," persisted the man,

who was short in his weekly column and not easily

daunted.

"No assistance is required, thank you, sir," replied

Carroll.

The man retreated, and rejoined his companion at

the table.

"Get anything out of him?" asked the other.

"No, but I can make something out of him, I guess."

"Poor devil!" said the other man.

"It might have paid to shadow him," said the first

man, thoughtfully. "I shouldn't wonder if he took a

bee-line for a drug-store. He looked desperate."

"Or perhaps the park. He looks like the sort that

might have a pistol around somewhere."

This man actually .after a second's reflection, left his

luncheon and hastened after Carroll, but he did not find

him. Carroll had recovered himself and had taken the

Elevated up-town to answer another advertisement.

That was one for a book-keeper, and there was also un-

successul. Coming out, he stood on the corner, looking

at'his list. He had written down nearly every want in

the advertising columns. Actually he had even thought

of 'tryig for a position as coachman. He certainly

could drive and could care for horses, and he considered

qui. Mia.rtially that'he might make a good appear-

ancaj, ive^ry o. a fashionable turn-out. He had left

nowv ih is list only two which he had not tried; one was

for a superintendent to care for a certain public build-

ing,, asmall museum. - He had really a somewhat better

chance there, apparently,'for he had at one time known

one of. the trustees quite well. For that very reason he

had ,put.it off until the -last, for he dreaded meeting an

old acquaintance, and; too, there was a chance, though

not a very good one, that the acquaintance might work

harm instead of advantage. Still, the trustee had been

in Europe for several years past, and the chances were

that he would know nothing derogatory to Carroll which

would interfere with his obtaining the position.

He reached the building, took the elevator to the

floor on which was situated the offices, and, curiously

enough, the first person he saw, on emerging from the

elevator, was the man whom he knew, waiting to ascend.

The man, whose name was Fowler, recognized him at

once, and greeted him, but with constraint. Carroll

immediately understood that in some unforeseen way

the news which travels in circles in this small world had

reached the other. He saw that he knew of his record

during the last years.

"I ,have not seen you for a number of years, Mr.

Carroll," said Fowler.

^'No," replied Carroll, trying to speak coolly, "but

that is easily accounted for; you have been abroad most

of the time, living in London, have you not?"

"Yes, for seven years," replied the other, "but now

I am home in my native land to end my days." Fowler

was quite an elderly man, and remarkably distinguished

in appearance, clean - featured and white - haired- in-

deed, he had cut quite a considerable figure in certain

circles on the other side. He was even taller than Car-

roll, and portly in spite of the sharpness of his features.

"You are glad to be back in America?" Carroll said;

he was almost forgetting, for the moment, the object

of his visit to the place. He had years ago been on

terms of social intimacy with this man.

"If I were not I would not say so," replied Fowler,

with a diplomatic smile. "I do not disparage my

country nor give another the preference in my speech,

until I deliberately take out naturalization papers else-

where."

Carroll smiled.

"By-the-way," said Fowler, whose handsome face

had hard lines which appeared from time to time from

beneath his polished surface-urbanity, "I have not seen

you for perhaps ten years, Mr. Carroll, but I heard from

you in an out-of-the-way place-that is, if anything is

out of the way in these days. It was in a little Arab

village in Egypt. I was going down the Nile with a

party, and something went wrong with the boat and we

had to stop for repairs; and there I found-quartered

in a most amazing studio which he had rigged up for

himself out of a native hut and hung with things which

looked to me like nightmares, and making studies of

the native Egyptians--and I must say he seemed to

be.doing some fine work at last-Evan Dodge."

ICarroll iinderstood then, perfectly, but he took it

calmly. "I always felt that Dodge had genuine

ability," he said.

"He has the ability to strike twelve, but not to

strike it often," said. Fowler .'(However, all his mod-

els in that place striking twelve made it easier for

him. His work was good, and'I thinki itiwill be heard

from. He had some good tea, and a tea-kettle, and he

made us a cup, and we talked' over the home news,

Dodge and I and two other gentlemen 'adsithAree ladies

of the party. You see, Dodge was 'compfratively fresh

from home. He had only been- quartered .there about

a month."                            , 

"Yes," said Carroll.              ri:,,r;

"He spoke of seeing you quite rbcnitrly.  Hi said

he had had a studio the summer: befrPe, in Hillfield,

where I believe you were living atth;ie Vtia" , 'Nothing

could have excelled the smoothness,'ad.even 'sweetness

of Fowler's tone and manner; nothing' cialdhave. ex-

heavy lids, and the lines of his fine mouth. ; '  . -

"Yes, he did have a studio therne,' asented Carroll.

"I believe that is quite a picturesque 'country about

there."                                  ; ! 

"Quite picturesque."                    . ..

"Well, Dodge did not make a mistake ,goinmg:so far

afield, though, for, after all, his specialty is the human

figure, and here it is only trees that. are not altered

in their contour by the fashions, Yes, he was doing

some really fine work.  There .wast one study of a

child-"

"He made one very good thing in Hillfield," said

Carroll, "a view from the top of a sort of half-mountain

there. I believe he sold it for a large price."

"Well, I am glad of that," said Fowler. "Dodge has

always been hampered in that way. Yes, he told me all

the news, and especially mentioned having lived in the

same village with you."

"Yes," said Carroll, with the dignity of a dauntless

spirit on the rack.

"I hope your wife and family are well," said Fowler,

further.

"Quite well, thank you."

"Let me see-you are living in New York now?"

"No, I am at present in Banbridge."

"Banbridge ?"

"In New Jersey."

"Let me see-your family consists of your wife and a

daughter and son?"

"Two daughters and a son. One daughter married,

last September, Major Arms."

"Arms? Oh, I know him. A fine man." Fowler

regarded Carroll with a slight show of respect. "But,"

he said, "I thought-Major Arms is nearly quite your

age, is he not?"

"He is much older than Ina, but she seemed very

fond of him."

"Well, she has a fine man for a husband," said Fow-

ler, still with the air of respect. "Your son is quite a

boy now?"

"He is only ten."

"Hardly more than a child."

"My wife and son and my sister are at present in

Kentucky with my wife's aunt, Miss Dunois; only my

younger daughter is with me in Banbridge."

"Catherine Dunois?"

"Yes."

"I used to know her very well. She was a beauty,

with the spirit of a duchess."

"The spirit still survives," said Carroll, smiling.

"She must be quite old."

"Nearly eighty."

The elevator going up stopped in response to a signal

from  Fowler. He extended, his hand. "Well, good-

,day," said Fowler.; "I am glad we chanced to meet."

"Well, it is a small world," replied Carroll, smiling.

"The chances for'mee:ting are much better than they

would be, say, in Mars."

"Much better, aand or. hearing, also. Good-day."

"G; odHay."         . . 

Catil: saw the elevator, with its open sides of filigree

iromn;; eeniding, and the expression pupon Fowler's calm,

handlom:e face, gazing backward at him, was unmis-

talka*bl. It was eveinmocking.

Carroll touched the :electric button of one of the

dolward elevators, and was soon carried rapidly down

to t*e street door. He pelt,, as he'gained the street,

th$.it'l[would rather starve to death than ask a favor

of it:er. He did not ask' for pity, or even sympathy,

inm :idownfall, but he did ask for recognition of it as

a *   -mon accident that might befall mankind, and a

comsequent passing by with at least the toleration of in-

difience from those not actively concerned in it; but in

tiwsman's face had been something like exultation, even

gloating, Carroll thought to himself, as he went down

the street, in the childish way that Eddy might have

done, with a sort of wonder, reflecting that he never in

his life, that he could remember, had done Fowler, even

indirectly, a bad- turn; He might easily have been

totally indifferent to his misfortunes, to his failings, but

why should they have pleased him?

Carroll walked rapidly along the street until he

reached Broadway again. It was a strange day; a sort

of snow-fog was abroad. The air was dense and white.

Now and then a mist of sleet fell, and the sidewalks were

horribly treacherous. The children enjoyed it, and there

were many boys and a few girls with tossing hair sliding

along with cries of merriment.

32                   487








<pb n="488"/>
THE DEBTOR

Carroll thought of Eddy as one little fellow, who did

TQot, ook unlike him, fairly slid into his arms.

. ,":Look out, my boy," Carroll said, good-humoredly,

keeping him from falling, and the little fellow raised his

cap with a charming blush and a "Beg your pardon,

sir." A miserable home-sickness for them came over

Carroll as he passed on. He longed for the sight of his

boy, or his wife and Anna. He had grown, in a manner,

accustomed to Ina being away. There is something

about marriage and the absence it causes that brings

one into the state of acquiescence concerning death.

But he longed for the others, and he thought of his poor

little Charlotte at home all day, and her loneliness. He

looked at his watch, and realized that he must hurry if

he caught the train which would take him to Banbridge

at six o'clock. He had one more place on his list, and

that was far up - town. He crossed to the Elevated

station and boarded the first up-town train. What he

was about to do was, in a way, so monstrous, taking

into consideration his antecedents, his bringing-up, and

all his forebears, that it had to his mind the grotesque-

ness of a gargoyle on his house of life. He was now

going to apply for the last position on his list, that of

a coachman for a gentleman, presumably of wealth, in

Harlem. The name was quite unknown to him. It

was German. He thought to himself in all probability

the owner was Jewish. This was absolutely his last

venture. He chose this as he would choose anything

in preference to the one which was always within reach.

As the train sped along he fell to thinking of himself in

this position for which he was about to apply. He

imagined himself in livery sitting with a pair of sleek

bays well in hand. He reflected that at least he could

do his work well. He wondered idly about the ques-

tions he would be asked. He considered suddenly that

he must have a reference for a place of this sort, and

488








<pb n="489"/>
THE DEBTOR

he 'tre a leaf out of his note-book, took out his stylo-

gaphic pen, and scribbled a reference, signing his. own

hame.: He reflected, as he did so, that it was odd that

fae, who had employed so many doubtful methods to

gain ifnancial ends, should feel an inward qualm at the

proceeding. Still, he was somewhat amused: at the

thought that Mr. A. Baumstein might write to him at

Banbridge, and he should in that case reply, repeating

his own list of qualifications for the place. He won-

dered if they would ask if he were married,, if they

would prefer him married, if he drank, if he wouldi be

forbidden to smoke "in the stables. He considered; all

the questions which he should be likely to ask himself,

in a similar case. He got a curious feeling as if he Tete

having an experience like Alice in Wonderland,: atif

he were in reality going in at the. back of his own :ex.-

periences, gaining the further side of his. :,oo ai,. He

began to be almost impatient tO6 reach.-hisi rtaiion and

see the outcome of it all. Strangely: enough ,he never

reflected 'on the good advicev Wvhieh. the young' womani

that morning hadTgiveii him .as .t the rndesirable, gen-

tility of his: general appearance, i He never considered

thas as a .drawbahck- Whea:bhe reachied;his station .he

avenue, and up a block to. the-next street; When he

found the dumber of which, h was in seatch he hesitated

a second.- He wondered at wha tdoomr he should apply.

It manifestly could not lbe therfront door. -'He therefore

went farther down. the street and gained the one running

parallel, by which means he could reach the rear entrance

of the house. It had no basement' etrance under the

front door. It was a new building, and quite pretentious,

the most- pretentious of a new and pretentious block.

He traversed the small back yard, bending his stately

head- under a grove of servants' clothes which were

swinging whitely from a net-work of lines, and knocked

489








<pb n="490"/>
THE DEBTOR

on the door. His knock was answered by a woman,

presumably a cook, and she looked like a Swede. Un-

accountably to him, she started back with a look of

alarm and nearly closed the door, and inquired in good

English, with a little accent, what he wanted. Carroll

raised his hat and explained.

"I saw an advertisement for a coachman," he said,

briefly, "and I have come to apply for the place if it is

not already filled."

To his utter amazement the door was closed violently

in his face, and he distinctly heard the bolt shot. He

was completely at a loss to account for such a proceed-

ing. He remained standing, staring at the blank front

of the door, and a light flashed across the room inside

and caused him to look at the windows. The light had

been carried into a room at the back, but he saw in the

pale dimness of the kitchen a group of women and one

boy, and they were all staring out at him. Then the

boy started on a run across the room, and he heard a door

slam. Carroll waited. He could not imagine what it

was all about, and a feeling of desperation was coming

over hiri. It seemed to him that he must find some-

thing to do, that he could not go home again. The

position of coachman began to seem desirable to him.

Charlotte need not know what he was doing; no one

need know. He had resolved to give another name,

and he would soon find another position. This would

be a makeshift. In this he could at least keep himself

to himself. He need associate with nothing except the

horses, and they were likely to be thorough-breds. It

would not, after all, be half so bad as some other things-

guiding superb horses through the streets and waiting

at doors for his employers. To his mind, a coachman-

that is, a City coachman-wears always more or less of

a mask of stiff attention to duty. He could hide be-

hind this mask. In reality, Carroll was almost at the

490








<pb n="491"/>
THE DEBTOR

end of his strength.4 His pride had suddenly become a

forgotten thing. 'He was wretchedly worn out, and, in

,fact, he was hungry, almost famished. He had eaten

very little lately, and !poor Charlotte, in truth, knew

little about cookery. ,He, in reality, became for the

time what in one sense he was impersonating. He be-

came a coachman in dire need of a job. Therefore he

waited. He reflected, while he waited,' that if they did

not hurry he would miss his train and Charlotte would

worry. In case he secured the position;she would cer-

tainly have to join the others in Kentucky; there would

be no other way, for he would be1obliged-to remain in

the City over night. 

All at once the door before him was sDung violently

open and a gentleman stood there. Cmroll felt at once

that he was Mr. A. Baumstein.    '   ' 

"What do you want, sir?" inquired'the 'gentleman,

and his tone was distinctly hostile, although he looked

like a well-bred man, and it seemed putzling that he

thus received an answer to his application.

"I saw your advertisement, sir-" Carroll began.'

"My advertisement for what, pray. " repeated Mr.

Baumstein.

"For a coachman," replied Carroll, "and I thought

if you had not already secured one-"

"Clear out, or I will call a policeman!" thundered

Mr. Baumstein, and again the door was slammed in his

face.

Carroll then understood. A gentleman who would

have been presentable at the Waldorf - Astoria, at a

gentleman's area door applying for a position as coach-

man, was highly suspicious. He understood readily how

he would have looked at the matter had the cases been

reversed. He made his way out of the little yard,

dodging the fluttering banners of servants' clothes, and

was conscious that his progress was anxiously watched

49I








<pb n="492"/>
THE DEBTOR

by peering eyes at the windows. He reflected thati.x-

douj^tdly that house would be doubly bolted and barred

thlat, night, and he would not be surprised if a special

policeman were summoned, in view of the great probabil-

ity that he was a gentleman burglar spying out the land

before he descended upon it in search of the spoons and

diamonds. Somehow the fancy tickled him to that ex-

tent that he felt almost as hysterical as a woman. He

laughed aloud, and two men whom he met just then

turned round and looked at him suspiciously.

"Dopey, I guess," one said, audibly, to the other.

It was now in Carroll's mind to gain the Elevated as

soon as possible, and hurry down-town to his ferry and

catch his train. He consulted his watch, and saw that

he, had just about time, if there were no delays. As he

replaced his watch he remembered that he had, besides

his railroad book, very little money, only a little silver.

The helplessness of a cripple came over him. He re-

called seeing a man who had lost both his legs shuffling

along on the sidewalk, with the stumps bound with

leather, carrying a little tray-of lead-pencils which no-

body seemed to buy. He felt like that cripple. A man

living to-day in the heart of civilization, where money

is in reality legs and wings and hands, is nothing more

than a torso without it, he thought. He felt mutilated,

unspeakably humiliated. It seemed more out of his

ability to get any honest employment than it had ever

done before. A number of laborers with their dinner-

satchels, and their pickaxes over their shoulders, passed

him. They looked at him, as they passed, with gloomy

hostility. It was as if they accused him of having some-

thing which of a right belonged to them. He Nell to

wondering how he would figure in their ranks. He was

no longer a very young man. However, his muscles

were still good and supple; it really seemed to him that

h1wnight dig or pick away at rocks, as he had seen men

492








<pb n="493"/>
THE DEBTOR

doing in that apparently aimless and hopeless and

never - ending fashion. He thought in such a case he

should have to join the union, and he really wondered

if they would admit him, if he pawned his clothes and

should buy some poorer ones. He decided, passing him-

self before himself in mental review, that he might be

treated by the leaders of a labor union very much as

he had just been treated by Mr. Baumstein at his area

door. He also decided that men like those who had juist

met him regard him with even worse suspicion and dis-

favor. He remembered stories he had read of gentle-

men, of students, voluntarily joining the ranks of labor

for the sake of information, but it seemed somehow iim

possible when it was attempted in earnest. Decidedly,

his appearance was against him. He had the misfort-

une to look too much like a man who did not naeed:to

dig to easily obtain, in labor's parlance, a job todig.

Yet, while he thought of it, such was the nman'y despera-

tion, his rage against his odds of life, that it seemed to

him that a purely physical attack on the earth, to which

he was fastened -by some indissoluble laws of nattire

which he could not grasp, would be a wvelcome relief.

He felt that with a' heavy pick in his hand he could

strike savagely at the concrete rock,ithe ribs of the earth,

and almost enjoy hiniself. !He felt that it would be like

an attack, although a futile and antlike one, at creation

itself. All this he thought idly, walking, even hurry-

ing, along the slippery pavement through the pale,

sleety mist. He walked as rapidly ad he could, some

of the time slipping, and recovering himself with a long

slide. He came to a block of new stone houses, divided

from another by a small space taken tup by a little, old-

fashioned, wooden structure that might have been with

propriety in Banbridge. He noticed this, and the

thought came to him that possibly it was the property

of some ancient and opinionated mortal who was either

493








<pb n="494"/>
THE DEBTOR

holding it for higher prices or for the sake of some at-

tachment or grudge. And just as he reached it he saw

coming from the opposite direction his old book-keeper,

William Allbright. Allbright, moving with a due re-

gard to the dangerous state of the pavement, had still

an alacrity of movement rather unusual to him. As

he came nearer it was plain to see that his soberly out-

lined face, long and clean - shaven, was elated by some-

thing. He started when he recognized Carroll, and

stopped. Carroll felt, meeting him, a sensation of self-

respect like a tonic. Here was at least one man to

whom he owed nothing, whom he had not injured. He

held out his hand.

"How do you do, Mr. Allbright?" he said.

"Quite well, thank you, Mr. Carroll," replied All-

bright, then his delight, which makes a child of most

men, could not be restrained. "I have just secured a

very good position in a wholesale tea -house - Allen,

Day & Co.," he said.

"That is good," said Carroll, echoing the other's en-

thusiasm. He really felt a leap of joy in his soul be-

cause of the other's good-fortune. He felt that in some

way he himself needed to be congratulated for his good-

fortune, that he had been instrumental in securing it.

His face lit up. "I am delighted, Mr. Allbright," he

repeated.

"Yes, it is a very good thing for me," said Allbright,

simply. "I was beginning to get a little discouraged.

I had saved a little, but I did not like to spend it all, and

I have my sister to take care of."

"I am very glad," Carroll said, still again.

Allbright then looked at him with a little attention,

pushing, as it were, his own self, intensified by joy,

aside. "You are not looking very well, Mr. Carroll,"

ie said, deferentially, and yet with a kindly concern.

"I am very well," said Carroll. Then he pulled out

494








<pb n="495"/>
THE DEBTOR

his watch again, and Allbright noticed quickly that it

was a dollar watch. He remembered his suspicion.

"I must hurry if I am to get my train," said Carroll.

"You live here, Mr. Allbright?"

"Yes. I have lived here for twenty years."

"Well, I am very glad to hear of your good-fortune.

Good-day, Mr. Allbright."

Carroll had not advanced three paces from Allbright

before his feet glissaded on the thin glare of the pave-

met the tried to recover himself, and ,came down heavily,

sia'g his head; then ho knew no more for some time.

CHAPTER XXXVII

CHARLOTTE had expected her father home at a little

after six o'clock that night. That was the train on

which he usually arrived lately. She had not the least

idea what he was doing in the City. She supposed he

was in the office as he.had been hitherto. She never

inquired. With all the girl's love for her father, she

had a decided respect. She was old - fashioned in her

ways of never interfering or even asking for information

concerning a man's business affairs.

Charlotte went down to the station to meet her father,

as she was fond of doing. She had her dinner all ready.

It was pretty bad, but she was innocently unaware of

it. In fact, she had much faith in it. She had a soup

which resembled greatly a flour paste, and that was in

its covered tureen on the range-shelf, keeping hot and

growing thicker. She had cooked a cheap cut of beef

from a recipe in the cook-book, and that was drying up

by the side of the soup. Poor Charlotte had no pro-

crastination, but rather the failing of "Haste makes

waste" of the old proverb. She had her cheap cut of

beef all cooked at three o'clock in the afternoon, and

also the potatoes, and the accompanying turnips. Salad

at that time of the year she could not encompass in any

form, but she had a singular and shrunken pudding on

the range-shelf beside the other things.  She set the

coffee-pot well back where it would only boil gently,

and the table was really beautifully laid. The child's

cheeks were feverishly flushed with the haste she had

496








<pb n="497"/>
THE DEBTOR

iafde and her pride in her achievements.     She had

Vidpt and dusted a good deal that day, also, and all the

bodks' and bric-a-brac were in charming arrangement.

She felt the honest delight of an artist as she looked

*biout her house, and she said to herself that she was

niot at all tired. She also said-that she was not at all

hingry, even if she had only eaten a cracker for lunch-

eon 'and little besides for breakfast. She realized a

faintness at her stomach, and told herself that shel must

be getting indigestion. Her little stock of money was

very nearly gone. She had even begun to have a very

few things charged again at Anderson's. Sometimes her

father brought home a little money, but she understood

well enough that their financial circumstances were

wellnigh desperate. However, she had an enormous

faith in her father that went far to buoy her up. While

she felt the most intense compassion for him that he

should be so hard pressed, it never occurred to her that

it could be due to any fault or lack of ability in him, and

she had, in reality, no doubt whatever of his final re-

covery of their sinking fortunes. She wrote her mother

that papa was going to the City every day, that they

were getting on very well, and while they had not yet

a maid, she thought it better to wait until they were

perfectly satisfied before engaging one. The letters she

had received at first from Mrs. Carroll had been' child-

ishly amazed and reproachful, although acquiescent.

Her aunt had written her more seriously and with great

affection. She told her to send for her at once if she

needed her, and she would come.

Charlotte, going down the street towards the station

that night, expected a letter by the five-o'clock train.

She reached the post-office, which was near the station,

aic a quarter before six, and she found, as she antici-

pt'ed, letters. There were several for her father,

'Wihch she thought, accusingly towards the writers, were

497








<pb n="498"/>
THE DEBTOR

bills. It was odd that Charlotte, while not really

morally perverted, and while she admitted the right of

people to be paid, did not admit the right of any one to

annoy her father by presenting his bill. She looked at

the letters, and, remembering the wretched expression

on her father's face on receiving some the night before,

it actually entered into her mind to tear these letters up

and never let him see them at all. But she put them

in her little bag, and opened her own letters and stood

in the office to read them. The train was not due for

fifteen minutes yet, and was very likely to be late.

She had letters from her mother, Ina, and aunt. They

all told of the life they were leading there, and expressed

hope that she and her father were well, and there was

a great deal of love. It was all the usual thing, for they

wrote every day. There were also letters from them

all for Carroll. The Carroll family, when absent from

one another, were all good correspondents, with the ex-

ception of Carroll. There was even a little letter from

Eddy, which had been missent, because he had spelled

Banbridge like two words-Ban Bridge.

Charlotte read her letters, smiling over them, stand-

ing aloof by the window. The post-office was fast

thinning out. There had been the customary crowd

there at the arrival of the mail-the pushing and shriek-

ing children and the heavily shuffling loungers-all peo-

ple who never by any possibility got any letters, but

who found a certain excitement in frequenting the

office at such times. Just as Charlotte finished her last

letter and replaced it in the envelope, Anderson came

in for his mail. He did not notice her, but went directly

to his box, which had a lock, opened it, and took out a

pile of letters. Charlotte stood looking at him. He

looked very good and very handsome to her. She

thought to herself how very much better-looking he was

than Ina's husband. There was something about the

498

THE DEBTOR

manly squareness of his shoulders, as he stood with his

,babzk towards her, examining his letters, which made

,her tremble a little, she could not have told why. Sud-

denly he looked up and saw her, and she felt that the

color flashed over her face, and was ashamed and angry.

'"Why should I do so?" she asked herself. She made

a curt, stiff little bow in response to Anderson's greeting,

and he passed her going out of the office with his letters.

Then she felt distressed.

"I need not have been rude because I was such a

little idiot as to blush when a man looked at me," she

told herself. " It was not his fault. He has always been

lovely to us." She reviewed in her mind just her ap-

pearance when she had given him that stiff little bow,

and she felt almost like crying with vexation. "Of

course he does not care how I bow to him," she thought,

and somehow that thought seemed to give her additional

distress, "but, all the same, I should have been at least

polite, for he is very much a gentleman. I think he is

much better bred, and he certainly knows much more

than Ina's husband, even if he does only keep a grocery

store; but then army officers are not supposed to know 

much except how to fight."

The heavy jar of a passing freight train made her

look at the post-office clock, and with her usual prompt-

ness, although it was fully seven minutes before the

train was due, even if it were on time, and she was only

about one minute's walk from the station, she reflected

that she must start at once if she were. to meet her

father. So she stowed away her letters in her little bag,

and fairly ran across the icy slope between the office

and the station. She saw, as she hurried along, a child

tumble down, and watched him jump up and run off

to make sure he was not hurt. When she reached the

station she did not go in the waiting-room, which seemed

close and stuffy, but remained out on the platform.

THE DEBTOR

The sun had set, but the western sky, which was visible

from that point, was a clear expanse of rose and violet.

Charlotte stood looking at it, and for a minute she was

able to find that standing-point outside her own little

life and affairs which exists for the soul. She did not

think any more of the money troubles, of her bowing

so stiffly to Mr. Anderson. She forgot not only her

petty worries, but her petty triumphs and pleasures.

She forgot even the exceeding becomingness of a new

way in which she had dressed her hair. She forgot her

coat, which she had herself trimmed with fur taken

from an old one of her mother's, and in which her heart

delighted. She forgot her supreme dinner warming on

the range-shelf at home. She forgot the joy she would

soon have in seeing her father alight from the train.

The little, young, untrained creature saw and knew

for the moment only the eternal that which was

and is and shall be, and which the sunset symbol-

ized. Her young face had a rapt expression looking

at it.

"Dandy sunset, ain't it?" said a voice at her ear.

She looked and saw Bessy Van Dorn, her large, bloom-

ing face, rosy with the cold, smiling at her from under

a mass of tossing black plumes on a picture-hat. The

girl was really superb in a long, fur-lined coat. She had

driven in a sleigh to the station, and she expected Frank

Eastman on the train, and was, with the most innocent

and ignorant boldness in the world, planning to drive

him home, although she was not engaged to him and

he was not expecting her. Her face, turning from the

wonderful after-glow of the sunset to Charlotte's, had

also something of the same rapt expression in spite of

her words.

"Yes, it is beautiful," replied Charlotte, but rather 

coldly. She was a friendly little soul, but she did not

nabturally care for girls of Bessy Van Dorn's particular

type. She was herself too fine and small before such a

mra)s of inflorescence.

':It's cold," said!'Bessy Van Dor, further, "but,

land, I like it! Have you been sleigh-riding?"

'."No, I haven't," repied Charlotte.

"Oh, I forgot," said Bessy.

Charlotte knew what she had forgot-that the horses

had gone for debt-and she reddened, but the other

girl's voice was honest.

"I'd like to take you sometime," said Bessy.

"Thank you," said Charlotte.  ..

"I'd offer to take you home to-night," said Bessy,

"but I've arranged to take somebody else."

"Thank you. I could not go, anyway," said-.Char-

lotte. "I am down to meet my father."

"Oh!" said Bessy. "Well, then you couldn't, "A

sleigh ain't quite wide enough for three, unless one of

'em is your best young man," she giggled. Chatotte

felt ashamed.

"My father is," she said, sternly. She fairly turned

her back on Bessy Van Dorn, but she did not notice

it, for the train was audible in the distance, axd Bessy

began calculating her distance from the car in which

Frank Eastman usually rode, that she might be sure

.not to miss him.

Charlotte stood on the platform, and also ran along by

the side of the train scanning anxiously the men who

alighted. To her great astonishment, her father was

not among them. She could scarcely believe it when

the train went slowly past the station and her father

had not got off.

Bessy Van Dom, driving Frank Eastman in her sleigh,

with the fringe of fur tails dangling over the back, looked

around at Charlotte slowly retreating from the station.

"Why, her father didn't come!" said she.

', "Whose father?" asked young Eastman. He looked

501








<pb n="502"/>
THE DEBTOR

adoringly and even lovingly at the girl, and yet in.:a

slightly scornful and shamed fashion. He hated to think

oftwhat some of the men he knew would say about her

meeting him at the station.

"Why, that poor little Charlotte.Carroll's!" said Bessy.

".Say," she added, after a second's hesitation.

"What?" asked young Eastman.

"I've a good .mind to ask her to ride. We're goin'

her way. You don't mind ?"

"Not a bit," said young Eastman, but he did think

uncomfortably of Ina's sister seeing him with Bessy

Van Dorn.

Bessie'promptly stopped. They had not yet made

the turn from the station to the main road, and Char-

lotte was just behind them.

"Say," she called out, "get in here. I'll take you

home-just as soon as not."

"Thank you," replied Charlotte. "I have an errand.

I am not going home just yet."

"All right," replied Bessy, touching her horse. "I'd

just as soon have taken you as not, if you'd been going

home."

"Thank you," Charlotte said, again.

"I declare, she looked as if sne was just ready to cry,"

said Bessy to Eastman, as they drove up the street.:

She was quite right; Charlotte was horribly fright-

ened by her father's non-arrival on the train. He.had

never come on a later train than that since the others.

had gone. The thought of returning alone to. her

solitary home was more than she could bear. -She re-

membered that there was another train a half-hour

later, and she resolved to remain down for that. She

thought that she would go to Mr. Anderson's store and

purchase some cereal for breakfast, that she might have

that charged. She was conscious, but she tried to stifle

the consciousness, of a hope that Mr. Anderson would be

<pb n="503"/>
THE DEBTOR

tlAe, and she might tell him that her father had not ar-

rivel on that train, and he would reassure her. But Mr.

Ainderson had naturally gone straight home from the post-

ooe to supper. Charlotte ordered her cereal, and also a

ew eggs. Then she went back to the station. It was

aearly twenty minutes before the train was due. She

walked up and down the platform, which extended east

and west. The new moon was just rising, a slender

crescent of light, and off one upper horn burned a great

star. It was a wonderful night, cold, with a calmness

and hush of all the winds of heaven which was like the

hush of peace itself. Charlotte noticed everything, the

calm night and the crescent moon, but she came be-

tween herself and her own knrowledge of it. Her mind

was fixed upon the train and the terrible possibility

that her father might not arrive on that. It seemed to

her that if he did not arrive on that it was simply be-

yond bearing. The possibility was too terrible to be

contemplated with reason, and yet she could not have

told just why she was in such a panic of fear. A thou-

sand things might happen to keep any business-man in

the City later than he had expected. He had often been

so kept while the others were home; but now she was

alone, and she felt that he would certainly come unless

something most serious had detained him. Charlotte

had naturally a somewhat pessimistic turn of mind, and

her imagination was active. She imagined many things;

she even imagined the actual cause of Carroll's deten-

tion, among others, that he had slipped on the ice and

injured himself. The falling of the boy on her way to

the six-o'clock train had directly swerved her fancy in

that direction. But she imagined everything. That

was only one of many casualties; The train was a lit-

tle late. She stood staring down the track at the un-

swerving signal-lights, watching for the head-light of the

locomotive, and it seemed to her quite certain that there

33                   503








<pb n="504"/>
THE DEBTOR

hadbeen an accident on that train. A thought strutk

her, and she went into the waiting-room and asked the

ticket-agent if the train was very late. The agent was

quite a young man, and he looked at her with a covert

masculine coquettishness as he replied, but she was

oblivious of that. All she thought of was that, if there

had been an accident on the line and the train was late

on that account, he would surely be apt to know. Her

heart was beating so fast that she trembled; but he said

ten minutes, and said nothing about an accident, and

she was reassured. She turned to go, after thanking

him, and he volunteered further information.

"'There is a freight ahead delaying the train," he

said.

"Oh, thank you," replied Charlotte. Then she went

out on the platform again and watched for the head-

light of the locomotive, staring down the track past

the. twinkle of the signal-lights. Suddenly it flashed

into sight far off, but she saw it. She waited. Soon

she heard the train. A gateman crossed the tracks

from the in-station, padlocking the gates carefully after

him. A baggage-master drew a trunk to the edge of

the platform. A few passengers came out of the wait-

ing-room.

.Charlotte waited, and the train came majestically

around the curve below the station. She moved along

as it came up, keeping her eyes on the cars. She seemed

to have eyes with facets like a cut diamond. It was

really as if she saw all the car doors at once. But she

moved with a strange stiffness, and could not feel her

hands nor feet; her heart beat so fast and thick that it

shook her like the pulse of an engine. She moved along,

and she saw every passenger who alighted. Then the

train steamed out of the station with slowly gathering

speed, and her father had not come on it.

Charlotte, when she actually realized the fact, the

504








<pb n="505"/>
THE DEBTOR

possibility of which had seemed incredible, gained a

little strength. It was like the endurance of disaster

which is sometimes more feasible than the contempla-

tion of it. She thought at once what to do. In the

event of her father having been delayed by some un-

foreseen business he would surely telegraph. She at

once crossed the fsltp'lefoni.Ff i'tllhDbn and went to

Andrew Drake's drug-store, where the telegraph-office

was. She asked if a ,telegram had-. omeJ-fo her, if one

had been sent to the house. Wlhe r;t.h$i  yi.n:clharge

with a vague sympathy. In a moment she recovaed

herself. He might have sent a telegram which hald At

ly had the same thought. "The minute the teJlegm

comes I'll get it up to you," he said, earnmtly;. " . eLx-

CHAPTER XXXVIII

THERE is, to a human being of Charlotte Carroll's

type, something unutterably terrifying about entering,

especially at Nightfall, an entirely empty house. The

worst of it is it does not seem to be empty. In reality,

the emptiness of it is the last thing which is compre-

hended. It is full to overflowing with terrors, with

spiritual entities which are much more palpable, when

one is in a certain mood, than actual physical presences.

Charlotte approaching the house, saw, first, glimmers of

light on the windows, which were merely reflections

ostensibly from the electric light in the street, not so

ostensibly from other lights.

"Oh, there is some one in there," Charlotte thought

to herself, and again that horrible, pulsing, vibrating

motion of her heart overcame her. "Who is there?"

she asked herself. She remembered that terrible tramp

whom she had seen asleep in the woods that day. He

might have been riding on some freight-train which had

stopped at Banbridge, and stolen across and entered

the vacant house. She stood still, staring at the cold

glimmers on the windows. Then gradually she became

convinced that they were merely reflections which she

saw. Aside from her imagination, Charlotte was not

entirely devoid of a certain bravery, or, rather, of a cer-

tain reason which came to her rescue. "What a little

goose I am!" she told herself. "Those are only re-

flections. They are the reflections of the light in the

street." As she studied it more closely she saw that

506








<pb n="507"/>
THE DEBTOR

the4ight, being intercepted by the branches of the trees

on the lawn, swaying in a light wind, produced some

of the strange effects at the windows which had seemed

like people moving back and forth in the rooms. Then

all at once she saw another glimmer, of light on the front

window of her father's room which she could not ac-

count for at all. She moved in front of a long, fan-

shaped ray cast by the electric light in the street, and,

looking at the window, the reflection was still there.

She could not account for that at all, unless it was pro-

duced by a light from a house window-which was

probably the case. At all events, it disquieted her.

Still, she overcame her disinclination to enter the house

because of that. She reasoned from    analogy. "All

the other lights are reflections," she told herself, "and

of course that must be." However, the main cause of

her terror remained: the unfounded, world-old con-

viction of presences behind closed doors, the almost

impossibility for a very imaginative person to conceive

of an entirely empty room or house-that is, empty of

sentient life. She had hidden the front-door key under

the mat before the front door; she had lived long enough

in the country to acquire that absurdly innocent habit.

She groped for it, thought for a second, with a gasp of

horror, that it was not there. Then she felt it with her

gloved hand, fitted it in the lock, opened the door, and

went in, and the inner darkness smote her like a hostile

crowd.

It was actually to the child as if she were passing

through a thick group of mysterious, inimical things

concealed by the darkness. It was as if she heard

whispers of conspiracy; it was even as if she smelled

ibors of strange garments and bodies. Every sense in

her was on the alert. She even tasted something bitter

' ilnher mouth. It was all absurd. She reiterated in

lher ears that it was all absurd, but she had now passed

507








<pb n="508"/>
THE DEBTOR

thaepOint wherein reason can support. She had :ome

thrugh an unusually active imagination into the un-

known quantities and sequences of life. She put out

her hands and groped her way through the darkness of

the hall, and the fear lest she should touch some one,

some terrible thing, was as bad as the reality could have

been. She knew best where to find matches in the

dining-room, so she went through the hall, with a sort

of mad rush in spite of her blindness, and she gained

the: dining-room  and felt along the shelf for a little

hammered-brass bowl where matches were usually kept.

In :it she felt only two. The mantel-shelf was the old-

fashioned marble monstrosity, the perpetuation of a

false taste in domestic architecture, but it was excellent

as to its facilities for scratching matches. She rubbed

one of the two matches under the shelf on the rough

surface, but it did not ignite.. It evidently was a half-

burned match. She took the other. It seemed to her

that if that failed her, if she had to grope about the

kitchen for more in this thick blackness-for even the

street-light did not reach this room- she should die.

She rubbed the last match against the marble, and it

blazed directly. She shielded it carefully with her hand

from  the door draught, and succeeded in lighting a

candle in one of a pair of brass candlesticks which stood

on the shelf. She then held the flaring light aloft and

looked fearfully around the room.. EEverything was as

usual, but, strangely enough, it did not reassure her.

The solitariness continued to hold terrible possibilities

for her as well as the darkness, and with the light also

returned what had been for a few minutes in abeyance

before her purely selfish fear, the anxiety over her father.

She moved about the house with the candle, going from

room to room. It seemed to her that she could not

remain one minute if she did not do so. Every time

ibefore entering a room she fe! sure that it was occupied.

and saw her miseir,   tfte n4-in r i dtying up in the

familiar homely articles of furniture assunmed strantge

appearances. She saw something on lhe range; for little

object which filled her with such unreasohIIig ho6ror

that it was almost sheer insanity. ' t as. s.simply: e-

cause she could not for the moment imagine what the

little object, which had nothing in. the' least frightf

about it, could be. Finally she rose and loolediOMid

it was only a little iron spoon which she =anst; have

dropped there. She removed it, but still the :horrr. was

over her. She lifted the cover from the; dish of meat,

and again the tears came.    .       :

"Poor papa! poor papa!" she said.

Then she carried the lamp into the , ining-room, and

went into the parlor. She had made herself quite satis-

fied, that there was in reality nothing menacing in the

house except her own fears. She: would sit beside one

f, the front windows in the parlor, in the dark, in order

that she might not be seen, and she would watch for

509








<pb n="510"/>
THE DEBTOR

her father, and she would also watch for any one who

might approach the house with any harmful intent.

Charlotte curled herself up in a large chair beside the

window which commanded the best view of the grounds

and the drive. With the light of the young moon there

was really no possibility that anything could approach

unseen by her, unless by way of the fields from the back.

But that she did not think of. Her mind became again

concentrated upon her father and the possibility of

either his return on the next train or a telegram ex-

plaining his absence. She knew that the next train

from New York was due in Banbridge at a few minutes

after eight. She had no time-table, but she remembered

Major Arms arriving once, and she was quite certain

that the train was due at eight-seventeen. It might, of

course, be late. She reflected, with a sense of solid com-

fort, that the trains were rather more apt to be late

than not. She need not give up hope of her father's

arriving on this train until even nine o'clock, for be-

sides the possibility of the lateness there was also that

of his walking rather than taking a carriage from the

station. In fact, he would probably walk, since he

was still in Samson Rawdy's debt. She might allow at

least twenty minutes for the walk from the station. She

might allow more even than that. She sat at the win-

dow, and waited, peering out. There was a singular

half-dusk rather than half-light from the new moon.

The moon itself was not visible from where she sat, for

the window faced north, but she could see over every-

thing the sweet influence of it. There was no snow on

the lawn, which was a dry crisp of frost-killed grass, as

flat as if swept by a broom, and here and there were the

faintest patches and mottles of silver from this moon,

aside from a broad gleam of the garish light from the

street-lamp. The bushes and trees showed lines of

silver. The moon was so young that the stars were

510








<pb n="511"/>
THE DEBTOR

quite brilliant. Takingi all the lights together-the

electric light in the street, the new moon, and the stars-

the lawn was quite visible, and even, because the leaves

were now all gone from the trees, the road for quite a

distance beyond. Charlotte had a considerable vista in

which to watch for her father. The time passed in-

credibly in this watching. She had ipon her such a

fear and even premonition that he might not come, that

the minutes passed with the horrible swiftness -that they

pass for a criminal awaiting execution. ThI first time-

she slipped out in the dining-room-with a last look at

the lawn and road, to be sure that he wouldnot . e there

in the mean time-to see what-time it was by the clock

on the shelf, she was amazed. It was already eight

o'clock. She had not dreamed it was more than half-

past seven. She crept back to her place by the parlor

window, with the feeling that much of her. time -of re-

prieve had passed, and that she was so much the nearer

the certainty of tribulation. Instead of impatience she

had rather the desire. to defer approaching disaster.

While she watched, she had less and less hope that her

father would come on that train, and yet:she kept her

heart alive by picturing her rapture when she should see

his tall, dark figure enter the lawn path, when she should

run and unlock and unbar the door and throw her arms

around his neck. She made up her mind that she

should not confess to him what a panic she had been in

because of his non-arrival. She planned-how she would

run and set the dinner, in which she.still believed, on

the table, and how hungry he would be for it. She was

quite sure that her poor father did not in these days

provide himself with sumptuous lunches in the city.

lBt all the time she reared these air-castles, she saw for

a.&ertainty the.dark sky of her trouble through them.

THE DEBTOR

in; reality exists. It existed in Charlotte watching for

-her father at the window, and yet so bound up was she

i:imthe probabilities and present sequences of things

that she still watched. Now and. then she made sure

that she saw her father turn from the road into the

-lawn, but the figure, to her horror, would remain stand-

ing still-in one place. It was simply a slender spruce

which had seemed to start out of a corner of the night

with a semblance of life. Now and then she actually

did see a figure coming up the road, approaching the

entrance to the lawn, and her heart leaped up with

joy. She watched for it to enter, but that was the

end. Whoever it was, it had passed the house and

gone farther up the road. Those were the cruellest

moments of any-the momentary revival of hope and

then the dashing it to the ground. By-and-by her eyes,

strained with such watching, began to actually deceive

her. She saw, as she thought, shadows, approach and

enter the house.  Several times she ran to the door

and opened it, and no one was there.

After she had gone out in the dining-room and seen

that it was eight-seventeen, the time when the train was

due in Banbridge, she watched for the train. She knew

that she could hear the rush of the train after it left

the station; she could even catch a glimpse of the rosy

fire of the locomotive through the trees, since the

track was elevated. She therefore watched for that,

but it was very late. That was unmistakably a great

solace for her. She actually had a prayerful mood of

thankfulness for the lateness of the train. It was that

much longer that she need not give up hope. There was

a few minutes that she felt quite easy. Suddenly she

remembered how foolish she had been to watch for her

father, anyway, before she heard the arrival of the

train. She realized that her head was overstrained,

bhs reason failing her. "How could papa come before

512








<pb n="513"/>
TH E DE B TO R

the train?" she asked herself. iBut after a few rmin-

utes her fears reasserted themselves. She watchl : ior

something inimical to appear crossing the lawn instead

of her father. And then she heard a train, and she.iflt

faint, but in a second she became aware that it was a

long freight. No passenger-train ever moved thus

with the veritable chu-chu of the children,. the heavy

panting of two engines. Then after that she.started

again, for she heard a train, but it was as if 'she had

been let fall by some wanton hand from a cmel height,

for that train was clearly a fast express which did not

stop at Banbridge. Then she heard a faint runmbe of

another freight on the Lehigh Valley. road. Then at

last came the train for which she had been looking,:the

train on which her father might come, the train on which

he surely would come unless some terrible thing 'had

happened. She heard distinctly, with her sharpened

ears, the stop of the train at the station, the letting off

of steam. She heard the engine-bell. She; heard it. re-

sume its advance with slowly gathering motin.'. She

saw a rosy flash of fire in the distance froni the engine.

Then she waited for carriage-wheels, or. for the sight of

her father coming up the road. It was quite soon-( that

she heard carriage-wheels on the frozen ground',; and she

ran to the door and opened it, but the earriage passed.

Samson Rawdy was taking home the next neighbor.

"    It will take papa considerably longer if heT walks;" 'she

told herself, and she locked the door and returned to

look at the clock, but after a while, when she did so, she

found it was twenty-seven minutes after eight. Still

that clock often gained. She ran out in the kitchen

and looked at the clock there, but that had stopped at

half-past seven. It was very seldom that anybody

remembered to wind up the kitchen-clock since Marie

went. Her own little watch was at the jeweller's in New

Sanderson for repairs. She had nothing to depend on

except the dining-room clock, which, to her great com-

fort, so often gained. She decided that she might wait

until ten minutes of nine by that clock before she gave

up hope, but the next time she went trembling out to

look at it it was only three minutes before nine. Then

it occurred to her that her father might easily have

had an errand at one of the stores before coming home.

The post-office would be closed; she had no hope for

that, but he might have had some business. She

thought that she might allow until half-past nine be-

fore she entirely gave up her father having come on

the eight-seventeen train. It was then that she began

running out on the lawn to the entrance of the drive

to watch for him. She put a Roman blanket, which

was kept on the divan in the den, over her head, and she

continually ran out across the lawn, and stood close to

a tree, staring down the road for some sign of her father.

Curiously enough, she was not nearly so terrified out-

of-doors as in the house. The strain of returning to

that vacant house was much worse for her than going

across the lawn in the lonely night. She watched and

watched, and at last when she returned to the house

and looked at the dining-room clock, it was half-past

nine, and she completely gave up all hope of her father

having come on that train.

A species of stupor, of terror and anxiety, seemed to

overcome her. She sat by the parlor window, still

staring out from mere force of habit. She knew that

the next and last train that night was not due until

one-thirty, presumably nearly two o'clock. She knew

that there was not the slightest chance of her father's

coming until then, but her mind now centred on the

telegram. It did seem as if there must be a telegram,

at least. All at once a figure appeared in the road and

swiftly turned into the drive. She thought at once that

the boy in the drug-store was bringing the telegram; still,

she resolved not to open the door until she was sure who

it was. She peered closely from the window, and it was

unmistakably the drug-store boy who emerged from the

tree shadows and came up on the stoop. She ran to the

door and unfastened it, not waiting for him to ring, She

held out her trembling little hand for the telegram, but

he kept his at his side. He looked at her, grinning half-

sympathetically, half-sheepishly. He was an overgrown

boy, perhaps three years younger than she, whom tapretty

girl overwhelmed with an enormous self-consciousness

and admiration. :-                       "

"Where is it?' asked Charlotte, impatiently.

"I 'ain't got nothin'," said the boy.

"Then why-"

"I was going home from the store, and I thought I'd

jest stop an' let you know there wa'n't no telegrams yet.

It wa'n't much out of my way."

Charlotte gasped.

"I thought it might be a relief to your mind to

know," said the boy. "I thought you might be

watchin'. I saw your father didn't come on that

other train. I was up at the station on an er-

rand."

"Thank you," sad Charlotte, feebly.

The boy lingered a second with bashful eyes on her

face, then he said again that he thought he would just

stop in and let her know. He was going down the

path, and she was just closing the door, when he called

back that she might have a telegram if her father sent

it by the postal-telegraph system.

"You won't get none from our place after now," he

said, "for Mr. Drake won't bring up none so late; but

if your father sends that way, you could get one, mebbe."

"Thank you," replied Charlotte, and the boy went

away.

When Charlotte re-entered the house and locked the

door, a loneliness which was like a positive chill struck

over her. It was much worse now since she had been

in communication with another human being.

"If he had only been a girl I would have gone down

on my knees to him to stay all night with me," she

thought.

She tried to think if there was anybody in Banbridge

whom she could ask to stay with her, but she could

think of none. She thought of Marie, but she did not

even know where she was. There was no woman whom

she could call upon. She resumed her seat beside the

window. She did not dream of going to bed. She had

now to watch for the possible postal telegram; it would

not be time for the last train for hours yet. She had the

telegraph-messenger and some possible marauder to

watch for. She kept her eyes glued to the expanse of

the lawn and small stretch of road visible between the

leafless trees. Now and then a carriage passed; very

seldom a walking shadow. She always started at the

sight of these, thinking the telegram might be about to

arrive. If the telegram should arrive she expected fully

that it would be of some terrible import. A thought

struck her, something that she might do. If her father

was injured, if she were to be sent for from the City,

she resolved that she would have everything in readi-

ness for instant departure. There was a train which

Banbridge flagged after the arrival of the last train from

New York. She lit a lamp, went up-stairs, and packed

SI6

a ,ittle, tr.velling-bag with necessaries, and made some

changes in her dress,-ad, felt a certain relief in so:doinig.

She had very little money, and a book with two or-tlriee

railroad tickets. She felt that she could start ah..a

moment's notice should the telegram arrive. All t.e

time she was packing she was listening for the door-bell'

It became quite firmly fixed in her mind what the tele-

gram would be: that her father was terribly injured

and had been carried to a hospital, that she 'should at

once go to the hospital. It sometimes occurred to her

that he might be even dead, but that idea did not-.so

take hold on her fancy as the other.  .  ., 

She left the lamp burning up-stairs, thinking sud-

denly that it would be well to have the house present

the appearance of being well inhabited.; She took .her

hat and coat and her little travelling-bag, and she went

back to the place by the parlor window and stared oit

at the lawn again. It was growing wery' late. Soon

it would be time for her to watch for theilast 'train. It

really seemed to: the girl an incredible supposition of

disaster that that train could pass by and her father

not appear, and that in the face of her morbid and

pessimistic conclusions. She was a mass of inconsist-

encies, of incoherencies.  She at once despaired and

hoped with a hope that was conviction. At last, when

she saw by the clock that it only wanted a few minutes

before the time when the last train was due, her spirits

arose as if winged. She even went out in'the kitchen

and examined the wretched dinner to make sure it was

still hot. She put more coal on the range. 'The house

was growing very cold, and she knew that the furnace

fire needed attention, but she absolutely dared not go

down cellar alone ,at that time. They had very little

coal, also, and had been in the habit of letting the

furnace fire die down at night. She put on her coat

when she returned from the kitchen, and sat again by'

THE DEBTOR

the window. She felt now an absolute certainty that

her father would arrive on this train. She felt that it

was monstrous to assume that her father would not

come home all night and leave her alone with no mes-

sage. She felt even quite radiantly happy sitting there.

She said to herself what a little goose she had been.

Even a noise made by some coal falling in the kitchen-

range failed to startle her. She now hoped that the

train would not be late, and it was, in fact, very nearly

on time. Then she watched for her father with not

the slightest doubt that he would come. It had come

to that pass that her credulity as to disaster had failed

her. It was simply out of her power to credit the pos-

sibility of his not coming on this train when he had

sent no telegram. She knew that there would be no

carriage at the station at that hour, unless he had

telegraphed for one from New York, and she questioned,

in the state of their finances, if he would do that. She

was therefore sure of seeing his figure appear, coming,

with the stately stride which she knew so well, into view

on the road below the lawn.

She allowed twenty-five minutes for his appearance

after she had seen the train pass. She knew nothing

could detain him in the village at that time of night,

and she was sure he would come within that time. She

looked at the dining-room clock and found that she

had, if she allowed that twenty-five minutes, just fifteen

minutes to wait. She sat shrugged up in her little fur-

trimmed coat, for the house was growing very cold, and

stared intently at the pale glimmer of the road. After

the twenty-five minutes had passed, she went out in

the dining-room and looked at the clock. The time was

more than passed; there was no doubt. Her father had

not come. The panic seized her.

She was now dashed from the heights of hope, and

the shock was double. She realized that her father had

5I8

THE DEBTOR

not come, would not come that night; that she would

probably have no telegram. She realized that she was

all alone in the house. Now again unreasoning fear

as well as the anxiety for her father: seized her. Again

the conviction of the awful poptlation of the empty

rooms was upon her. She sat dowa' again by the win-

dow, and she tried to make her;;reasoting powers re-

assert themselves.                . .; i

"If anything comes this way, :I -shall wee it in time,

and I can run out the back door al;i: across to the

neighbors," she told herself. " f Mytlingiombs in the

back way, I shall hear and have tAie to ru;i oat the

front door; and I know there is nothing in tbhe house."

But she could not reassure herself, ,sil-ce what terrified

her, and even temporarily unbalanced;Iaer, was Tear

itself.                         -       fi .; 

Fear multiplied, growing upon itself;.i.- ding out

new tentacles with every throb of her imIa ' , filling

the whole house. All her life she had'iL   i hat a

frightful thing it would be if ever she were ift lone by

herself in a house, all night; and now w-tr than that

had come to pass, for she was not aie;rthehouse was

peopled by fear and the creatures of fear  She heard

noises constantly that she could not acoeunt for, and

she also saw things which she could not :account for.

Again the small and trivial, acutely stinging horror of

some ordinary object in a new and awftl guise possessed

her. She was almost paralyzed at the sudden glimpse

of something on the divan across the room. It was a

long time before she could possibly totter to investigate,

and ascertain it was one of her own gloves. But it did

Aot strike her as at all funny. There was still some-

thing frightful to her about the glove. She went back

to the window, and soon she distinctly heard a noise

up-stairs, and then a shadow crossed the ceiling. A

new horror seized her- a horror of herself. She felt

34                  519








<pb n="520"/>
THE DEBTOR

that in another moment she might herself become .a

very part and substance of the fear that was oppress-

ing- her. She had an imagination of jumping up, of

running about and screaming, of breaking something.

Then with that clutch at life and reason which is life

itself, which all dying and despairing things have at the

last, she thought again that there must be somebody,

somebody in the whole place to whom she could turn,

somebody who would help her, who would pity her.

She had heretofore only thought of the possibility of

somebody who would come and stay with her; it now

occurred to her that she herself might be the one to go,

and that she might escape from this house of fear. It

was suddenly to her as to a prisoner who realizes that

all the time his prison doors have been unbarred.

"What am I staying here for in this awful house by

myself ?" she suddenly thought. When that idea came

to her, the idea of escape, the action of her mind became

involuntary. There was only one to whom she could

run for aid. She remembered so vividly that the

experience seemed to repeat itself, her terror of the

tramp in the woods, and how she had seen Anderson.

She sprang up. It became sure to her that she must

get away from that house, that she must not remain.

The imaginative girl, whom anxiety and want of food

had weakened, as well as fear, was fairly at the point

of madness, or that;hysteria which is the border-land

of it. She distinctly heard herself laugh as she ran

out of the room and out of the house. Her head

was bare, but she did not think of that. She had

on her coat which she had worn because of the coldness

of the house. She fled across the lawn to the street.

Once on the road, she was saner, she felt only the nat-

ural impulse of flight of any hunted thing. She fled

down the road past the quiet village houses, in which

the people slept in their beds. The electric lights were

out, the moon was low. It was quite dark. Nobody

except herself was abroad in the night. A great pity

for herself, a pity that she might have felt for a little

lonely child out by herself at night, when everybody

else was safe in their homes, came over her. She sobbed

as she ran; she even sobbed quite loudly. She did not

feel so afraid, as wild 'fS6 s  d'om dtb take her in and

comfort her. She ran down the main street and turned

CHAPTER XXXIX

ALMOST at once a light flashed from an upper window

in response to Charlotte's knock and ring. Anderson

himself had been in New York that night with Henry

Edgecomb to the theatre. A celebrated play was on,

in which a celebrated actress figured, and the two had

taken one of their rather infrequent excursions. Con-

sequently, Anderson had not been in the house more

than an hour, and during that hour had been writing

some letters which he wished to get off in the early mail.

His room was at the back of the house, a long room ex-

tending nearly the whole width, consequently his own

brightly shining light had not been visible to Charlotte

coming up the street.

As he was not undressed, he lost no time in opening

his door and entering with his lamp the front hall. As

he did so his mother's door opened, and her delicate,

alarmed old face, frilled with white cambric, appeared.

"Oh, who is it at this time of night, do you suppose,

Randolph?" she whispered.

"I don't know, mother dear; don't be frightened."

But she came quite out in her white night draperies,

which made her appear singularly massive. "Oh, do

you suppose there are burglars in the store?" she said.

"No. Don't worry, mother."

"Do you suppose it is fire?"

"No; there is no alarm."

"Randolph, you won't open the door until you have

asked who it is. Promise me."

-4-,; is probably Heniry come back for something.

It'iet may have locked him out, and he forgotten

:,: night-key." That was actually what had flashed

btNrugh Randolph's mind when he heard the knock and

rig.n

"Well, I shouldn't wonder if it was," said Mrs. An-

derson, in a relieved tone.

"Go back to bed, mother, or you will catch your

death of cold."

"But you will ask?"

"Yes, yes."

Anderson hurried down-stairs, and in consideration

of his mother's listening ears of alarm, he did call out,

"Who is there ?" at the same time unlocking the door.

It was manifest to his masculine intelligence, unham-

pered by nerves, that no one with evil intent would

thus strive to enter a house with a clang of knocker and

peal of bell. He, therefore, having set the lamp on the

hall-table, at once unlocked the door, and Charlotte

pulled herself to her feet and her little, pretty, woe-

begone face, in which was a new look for-him and her-

self, confronted him. Anderson did not say ,a word.

He somehow-he never remembered how-laid hold of

the little thing, and she was in the house, in the sitting-

room, and in his arms, clinging to him.

"Papa didn't come. Papa didn't come home," she

sobbed, but so softly that Mrs. Anderson, who was listen-

ing, did not hear.

Anderson laid his cheek down against the girl's soft,

wet one, as if it were the most natural thing in the

world, as if he had been used to so doing ever since he

could remember anything. There was no strangeness

for either of them in it. He patted her poor little head,

which felt cold from the frosty night air.

"There, there, dear," he said. i,; 

"He didn't come home," she repeated, piteously,

against his breast, and it was almost as if she were ac-

cusing him because of it.

"Poor little girl!"

"Not on the last train. Papa didn't come on the

last train, and-there was no telegram, and I-I was all

alone in the house, and-and-I came." She sobbed

convulsively.

Anderson kissed her cheek softly, he continued to

smooth the little, dark, damp head. "You did quite

right," he whispered-" quite right, dear. You are safe

now. Don't!"

"Papa!"

"Oh, some business detained him in the City."

"What has happened to papa ?" demanded Charlotte,

in a shrill voice, and it was again as if she were uncon-

sciously accusing Anderson. When a heart becomes

confident of love, it is filled with wonder at any evil

mischance permitted, and accuses love, even the love

of God. "What has happened to papa? Where is

he?" she demanded again. And it was then that Mrs.

Anderson, unseen by either of them, stood in the door-

way with an enormous purple-flowered wrapper surging

over her nightgown.

"Hush, dear!" whispered Anderson. "I am   sure

nothing has happened."

"Why are you sure?"

"If anything had happened I should have heard of

it. I came out on the last train myself. If there had

been an accident I should certainly have heard."

"Would you?"

"I surely should have. Don't, dear. Your father

has just been detained by business."

"'Then why didn't papa telegraph?"

"He did not get it in the office in season. The office

"Of course! There is nothing for you to worry about.

and go to sleep, and in the morning your father will

ity. She held out her arms' and. Charlotte .ed to them.

Mrs. Anderson looked over the girl's head at her son

with the oddest and most inexplicablp reproach. "You

bring it right up; be as quick as you can." Then all

in the same breath she was comforting Charlotte. " Your

father is all right, dear child. Don't you worry one mite-

not one mite. I remember once, when I was a girl, my

father didn't come home, and mother and I were almost

crazy, and he came in laughing the next morning. He

had lost his last train because there was a block on ac-

count of the ice. The river was frozen over. There is

nothing for you to worry about. Now come right up-

stairs and go to bed. There is a little room out of

mine, as warm as toast, and you won't be a bit afraid.

There you were all alone in that great house, you poor,

blessed child."

Charlotte sobbed, but now with a certain comfort.

"I should have been so afraid, I should have lost my

senses, all alone in a house at your age," said Mrs. Ander-

son, all the time gently impelling the girl along with

her. "Of course there is nothing to be afraid of, but

one imagines things; and you came here all alone at

this time of the night!"

"Yes," responded Charlotte, with a gasp of the in-

tensest self-pity, sure of an echo.

Randolph ran up-stairs before his mother and Char-

lotte and snatched the hot -water bottle out of his

mother's bed, and was out the opposite door, which

connected with the back stairs leading to the kitchen;

As he went out he heard his mother say: "All that

way alone this time of night, you poor, precious

child!" and Charlotte's little, piteous, yet comforted

sob in response, exactly as a hurt baby might re-

spond to commiserations. He felt his own knees trem-

ble as he went down-stairs, carrying the hot-water

bottle, which had always struck him as a rather absurd

article, to be regarded with the concessions which a

man should make to the little, foolish devices for the

comfort of a softer and slighter sex. He hunted up

526








<pb n="527"/>
THE DEBTOR

the milk in the ice-box, and warmed it with solicitude

in a china cup, which, luckily, did not break. The fire

was still very good, and the water in the tea-kettle quite

boiling. It was not long before he knocked at his

mother's door, bearing the water-bottle dangling on one

wrist, and carrying the cup of milk. His mother opened

the door just wide enough to receive the articles.

"Is the milk hot?" she asked.

Randolph meekly replied that it had almost boiled.

"The water-bottle is hot, too," said his mother, in a

satisfied tone. "She is undressed. I got one of my night-

gowns for her, and it is quite warm in the little room.

Now I am going to take this in to her, and make her

drink the milk, and I hope she will get to sleep."

"I hope she will," replied Randolph, in a sort of

dazed fashion, and there was a foolish radiance over

his face, and he did not meet his mother's eyes.

"I'm coming into your room a minute, after I see

to her," said his mother, and if the man had been a

child-the tone would have sounded ominous.

MAll right, mother," replied Anderson. He crossed

the hall to his room lined with books, with the narrow

couch. It hardly seemed like a bedroom, and indeed

he spent much of his time, when not at'the store, there.

He resumed his seat in the well-worn easy-chair beside

his hearth, upon which smouldered a fire, and waited.

He still felt dazed. He had that doubt of his own

identity which comes to us at times, and which is

primeval under stress of a great surprise. The old

nursery rhyme of the old woman who had her petticoats

clipped and was not sure of herself, has a truth in it

which dates from the beginning of things. Anderson,

sitting precisely as he had been sitting before in the

same chair by the same hearth-he had even taken up

the same book in which he had thought to read a chap-

ter after his letters were finished, before retiring-was

THE DEBTOR

as completely removed from his former state as if-he

had been translated into another planet. He looked

around the long room, which had a dark, rich coloring

from the backs of old books, and some dark red hang-

ings, and even that had a curious appearance of un-

substantiality to him. Or was it substantiality. Sud-

denly it seemed to him that heretofore he had seen it

all through a glass, and now with his natural eyes. He

had attained a height of nature whence the prospect is

untrammelled by imaginations and shows in the clear

light of reality. He thought of the girl whom his

mother was coddling, tucking into bed as if she were a

baby, and such a wave of tenderness and protection

came over him that he felt newly vivified by it.- It

was as if his very soul put forth arms and wings of lov'e

and defence.

"The dear little girl!" he thought to himself-" the

dear little girl!"

TIe thought that she was safe under his roof, away

from all fancied and real terror, filled him with such a

joy that he could scarcely contain it. He imagined her

nestling in that warm little bed out of his mother's

room, and the satisfaction that he might have felt had

she been his child instead of his sweetheart, filled him

with pure delight. He tried to imagine her terrors,

her young-girl terrors, alone in that house, her panic

running alone through the night streets, and he even

magnified it through inability to understand it. He

said to himself that she might have almost gone mad,

and again that sublime joy, that immense sense of the

protection and tenderness of love, filled his soul, which

seemed to put forth wings. Then the door opened and

his mother entered softly, slipping through in her vo-

luminous, purple -flowered draperies, -with glimpses of

white frills and large padding feet in purple-knitted

slippers. She still wore her frilled nightcap, and her

face .confrbnted .him from the white setting with a

"Terrible shock! I should think she had, poor

child!" said Mrs. Anderson, and she seemed to reproach

him.

"It was a long way for her to come alone," said An-

derson, as if he were trying to excuse himself.

"I should think it was. It's a good mile, and that

wasn't the worst of it. Worrying about her father,

and all alone in the house! I was always scared to

death alone in a house, and I know what it means."

She still seemed reproachful.

"She must have been frightened."

"I should rather think she would have been." Sud-

denly his mother's face regarding his took on a differ-

ent expression; it became shrewd and confidential.

"Do you suppose her father has taken this way of-?"

she said.

"No," answered Randolph, emphatically.

"You don't?"

"No, I do not. I don't know the man very well, and

I don't suppose his record is to be altogether justified,

but, if I know anything, he would no more go voluntarily

and leave that child alone all night to worry over him

than I would."

"Then you think something has happened to him?"

"I am afraid so."

"Do you think there has been an accident?'

"I don't know, mother."

His mother continued to look at him shrewdly. "Do

you suppose he has got into any trouble?" she asked,

bluntly.

"I don't know, mother.'

Then Mrs. Anderson's face suddenly resumed its old,

reproachful expression. "Well, I don't care if there

has," said she. She whispered, but her voice was in-

tense. "I don't care if there has. I don't care if he

is in state-prison. That child has got to caring about

you, and you ought to-"

Anderson turned and looked at his mother, and her

severe face softened and paled. He looked to her at

that moment more like his father than himself. He

was accusing her.

"Mother, do you think, if she cares, that I would ever

desert her, any more than father would have deserted

you?" he demanded.

It was her turn to excuse herself. "I know you are

honorable, Randolph," she said, "but I saw when I

came in, and I don't see how you have seen enough

of her to have it happen; but I know girls, and I can

see how she feels, and I didn't know but you might

think if her father-"

"What difference do you think her father makes to

me, mother?" asked Anderson.

CHAPTER XL

WHEN Carroll came to himself that night after his

fall, his first conscious motion was for his dollar watch.

He was in William Allbright's bed. There were only

two sleeping-apartments in the little tenement. William

was seated beside him, watching him with his faithful,

serious face; there was also a physician, keenly observ-

ant, still closer to the injured man's head; and the

sister, Allbright's sister, was visible in the next room,

seated in a chair which commanded a good view of the

bed. It was Allbright who had rescued Carroll from

the station-house; for when he did not rise, the usual

crowd, who directly attribute all failures to recover

one's self from a manifestly inappropriate recumbent

position, had collected, and several policemen were on

the scene.

"I know   this gentleman," Allbright said, in his

rather humble, still half-respectful, voice, which car-

ried conviction. "I know  this gentleman: I have

been a book-keeper in his office. He slipped on the ice.

I saw him fall. He is not drunk."

One of the policemen, who had been long in the

vicinity and knew Allbright, as from the heights of the

law one might know an unimportant and unoffending

citizen, responded.

"All right," he said, laconically. "Hospital?"

"Guess he's hurted pretty bad," remarked another

policeman, who was a handsome athlete.

"Hospital?" inquired the first, who was a man of few

words, of Allbright.

<pb n="532"/>
THE DEBTOR

"I guess we'd better have him taken to my house.

It's right here," replied Allbright. "Then we'll call in

Dr. Wilson and see how much is the matter with him.

Maybe he's only stunned. The hospital is apt to be a

long siege, and if there isn't any need of it-"

"His house is right here," said the first policeman to

the second, with a stage aside.

"All right," said the second.

A boy pulled Allbright by the sleeve. "Say, I'll go

for the doc," he cried, eagerly. He was enjoying the

situation keenly.

"Well," replied Allbright, "be quick about it. Tell

him there's a man badly hurt at my house."

The boy sped like a rocket, and three more with him.

They all yelled as they ran. They were street gamins

of the better class, and were both sympathetic and en-

tertained. They lived in a tenement-house near All-

bright, and knew him quite well by sight.

Meantime the two policemen carried Carroll the short

distance to William Allbright's house. He was quite un-

conscious, and it was an undertaking of considerable dif-

ficulty to carry him up the stairs, since the Allbrights

lived in the second story.

The clerk in the department store, and his mother,

who lived on the first floor, came to their door in un-

dress and offered their hospitality, but Mr. Allbright

declined their aid.

"No," he said. "I know him. It is Mr. Carroll.

He had better be taken up to my rooms."

When at last they laid the unconscious man on All-

bright's bed, which his sister, pale, and yet with a col-

lectedness under such surprising circumstances which

spoke well for her, had opened, the policeman who was

not an athlete, and was, in fact, too stout, wiped his fore-

head and said, "Gee."

The other remained looking at the injured man soberly.

"Guess he's hurted pretty bad," he remarked again.

"You bet," said the first. "Geel"

Allbright's sister came with the camphor-bottle,

which she kept in a sort of folk-lore fashion, as her

mother had used to- do in the country. Allbriglit

brought the whiskey, of which he kept a small supply.

in the house in,case of dire need, and stood over Carroll

with that and a teaspoon, with a vague ide&i of trying

to insinuate a few drops into his mouth. :'  ,'; ' 

The two policemen clamped heavily down-stkfs,, ?agree-

ing that they would remain until the doctor'came, and

see if it was to be the hospital after all.    -

"Guess he's hurted pretty bad," remarked the' hnd-

some policeman for the third time.

The doctor came quickly, almost on a rai'. ,e lived

within a block, and had not a large praciice.- He Veas

attended by a large throng of boys, for lthe 1hthe: had

served as a nucleus for many more. He turttm   6und

to them with an imperative gesture as he eAeted the

house door.'                               '   '

"Now you scatter," said he. He was ai iiriman:, but

he had at once an appeal of good-fellOslih?1and a cer-

tain force of character. Besides, theri  *rid the two

policemen hovering near. The boys withdrew and re-

mained watching in the dark shadoWs t ;ast':by an' op-

posite house. In case the injured 'mah'"Wi  carried to

the hospital, and the ambulance shtiold come, they

could not afford to miss that. They hiad ni t so many

pleasures in life. 

The doctor mounted the stairs; he had been there be-

fore, for Allbright's sister was more or less of an invalid,

and he at once abetted Allbright's purpose of the few

drops of stimulant on the teaspoon, which the patient

swallowed with a pathetic; gulping passiveness like a

baby's.

"He swallows all right," remarked Allbright's sister,

533 








<pb n="534"/>

in an agitated voice. She stood aloof, waving the

camphor-bottle; her eyes were dilated, and her face had

a pale, gaping look.

"You go out in the other room and stay there," said

the doctor to her, with the authority which a hysterical

woman defers to and adores. 

Allbright's sister was a very good woman, but she

had sometimes imagined, then directly driven the imag-

ination from her with a spiritual scourge like a monk

of old, what might have happened if the doctor were

not already married.

Carroll's forehead was dripping with camphor, and

there was danger should he open his eyes.. The doctor

wiped the pale forehead gently and spoke to him.

"Well, you had quite a hard fall, sir," he said, in a

loud, cheerful voice, and directly Carroll answered, like

a somnambulist:

"Yes,' quite a fall."

Then he seemed to lapse again into unconsciousness.

The doctor and Allbright remained working over him,

but it was within fifteen minutes before the time when

the last train for Banbridge was due to leave New

York that he made the first absolutely conscious mo-

tion.

"He is feeling for his watch," said Allbright, in an

agitated whisper. His wits were sharpened with re-

gard to Carroll's watch. Carroll's coat and vest had

been -removed, and were hanging over a chair. All-

bright at once got the dollar watch from its pocket

and carried it over to the sick man. "Here is your

watch, Mr. Carroll," he said, and his voice was full of

both respectful and tender inflections.

A sob was distinctly heard from Allbright's sister out

in the sitting-room. The woman from down-stairs, the

department clerk's mother, was now with her.

"He wants to see if his watch is safe, poor man,"

i*,~     ~     534

THE DEBTOR

sasd she, in a tearful voice, and Allbright's sister whim-

pered again.

"It's a wonder some of them kids didn't swipe it,"

said the down-stairs woman, and Allbright's sister was

conscious of a distinct thrill of disgust in the midst of

her excitement and, pity. She was of a superior sort

to the down-stairs woman, and she often told her broth-

er she could not get used to folks using such language.

Poor Carroll was looking dimly at his watch, and All-

bright at once divined that he could not distinguish the

time without his eye-glasses  He therefore leaned over

him-his own spectacles were on his nose-and told him

the time.

"It's almost seventeen minutes past twelve, Mr.

Carroll," he said.

Carroll made a movement to rise, then subsided with

i groan. "Where am I?" he inquired, feebly, with a

bewildered stare around the strange room. Directly

opposite him hung a large crayon portrait of Allbright's

father, a handsome man with a reverend beard like a

prophet, and his eyes became riveted upon that.

"You are in my house, Mr. Carroll," said Allbright,

ith a tender, caressing motion of his hand towards him,

ike a woman.

"You had a fall on the ice, Mr. Carroll," said the

physician, in a tone of soothing explanation, "but you

will soon be as good as new."'

"How far up-town ?' inquired Carroll, still gazing at

;he portrait, which had an odd hardness of outline, and

appeared almost as if carved out 6f wood.

"You are at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street,"

replied Allbright. "You are at my house, Mr. Carroll.

You fell right out here, and I had you carried in here."

Carroll tried again to rise, and made a despairing gasp.

'Oh, my God!" he said. "I have lost the last train

)ut. There isn't time to get down to the ferry, and

there is that poor child all alone there, and she won't

know-"

"You can send a telegram," suggested the doctor.

"Now, Mr. Carroll, don't get excited.'

"She will be all right," said Allbright.

"What is it?" asked the down-stairs woman, coming

to the door.

"His daughter is all alone in the house, I guess, and

he's worried about her," explained Allbright.

"There ain't nothin' goin' to eat her, if she is, is

there ?" inquired the down-stairs woman.

"I'll run with a telegramr," said Allbright, eagerly,

to the doctor.

But at that momentCarroll, lapsed into unconscious-

ness. The excitement had been too much for him. He

lay as if asleep.

"Where does he live?" asked the doctor, of All-

bright.

"I don't know exactly. Somewhere out on the Penn-

sylvania Railroad."

"You don't know?" repeated the doctor, with a faint

accent of surprise.

Allbright shook his head.

"You were book-keeper in his office?"

"Yes, but I 'haven't been there for some time. I

never asked any questions."

The doctor turned and looked at Carroll. Then he

went out of the room, with Allbright following, and gave

him some directions. He asked for a glass two-thirds

full of water and poured some dark drops into it.

"The minute he gets conscious again give him a

spoonful of this," he said, "and you had better sit be-

side him and watch him."   Then he turned to AlI-

bright's sister, who was trembling from head to foot

with a nervous chill. " You take a dose of that whiskey

your brother gave him," he said, jerking his shoulder

towards the inner room, "then go to bed, ari' dori't

"Oh, doctor, he isn't going to die here?"  '':

"Die here? No, nor nowhere else for one wlilfb.

"How long is he likely to be here on thei iharids'P

"He will be able to go home in the m6nitfig,' ili ki'"

"Oh, doctor, you aren't going to go away 'and;Iegave

could scarcely speak.                         - 

"You won't have to worry half so much over a straLge

Allbright's sister bridled with an odd?,'wihe caIJle

pride. She did not like to be a buent'tl brt'obiher,

nor make trouble, but there was a iceitin5sitistae;ti

let you make a good big bowl of that gruel of yours be-

fore you go to bed," he said; "then he can take it in

the course of the night if he is able; and beat him up

some eggs in the morning."

"I'll make the gruel if she ain't able," said the down-

stairs woman, in a tone vibrating between kindness

and scorn.

"Thank you. I am quite able to make it," said

Allbright's sister, and she was full of small triumph and

persistency. Yes, she would make the gruel, even if

she was so very delicate that she ought to go at once

to bed. It was quite evident that she thought that the

down-stairs woman could not make gruel good enough

for that man in there, anyway.

"Well, I guess I'll go," said the down-stairs woman,

"as long as I don't seem to be of any use. If there was

anything I could do, I'd stay." And she went.

"The idea of her coming up here and trying to find

out what was going on!" Allbright's sister said to her

brother as she was getting the meal ready for the gruel.

"I never saw such a curious woman."

"If we hadn't got so attached to the place we would

move," said Allbright, who was leaving his patient

momentarily, to change his shoes for slippers.

"I know it," said the sister, "but I can't help feeling

attached to the place, we have lived here so long; and

there is that beautiful cherry-tree out. in the yard, and

everything."

"That is so," said Allbright.

"I am glad Mr. Carroll didn't have to be carried to

a hospital."

"Isuppose he would have been if I had not happened

to be right on the spot," said Allbright, reflectively, to

his sister.

"You think he'll be all right in the morning, don't

you ?"

"Oh yes, the doctor said so!"

Outside, the watching boys in the shadow of the

church disappointedly vanished, cheated of their small

and grewsome excitement, when they saw the doctor

quietly walk towards his house and realized that there

was to be no ambulance and no hospital.

"Gee! I've had knocks harder 'n that, and never

said nothin' about it," said one boy as he scurried away

with the others towards his home in the high tenement-

CHAPTER XLI

IT was quite early the next morning when Charlotte

received the telegram that her father had had a fall on

the ice, was not badly injured, and would be home on

the noon train. Anderson had gone very early to the

telegraph-office. It was being ticked off in Andrew

Drake's drug - store when he inquired, and the boy

viewed him with intense curiosity when he took the

message, but did not dare ask any questions. Ander-

son hurried home with it to Charlotte, who was not yet

up. Mrs. Anderson had insisted upon her having her

breakfast in bed, and she had yielded readily. In fact,

she was both too confused and too ashamed to see

Anderson. She dreaded seeing him. She was as simple

as a child, and she reasoned simply.

"He held me in his arms and kissed me last night,

the way Major Arms would have done with Ina," she

told herself, "and of course I suppose I must be en-

gaged to him; but I don't know what he must think of

me for coming here the way I did. It was almost as if

I asked him first." She wondered if Mrs. Anderson had

seen. But Mrs. Anderson's manner to her was of such

complete and caressing motherliness that she could not

have much fear of her. In reality, the older woman,

who had an active imagination, was slightly jealous, in

view of future possibilities.

"I wonder if they will think they ought to sit by

themselves evenings," she reflected. She looked at the

girl's slight grace in the bed, and the little, dark head

540








<pb n="541"/>
TH'E DEBTOR

sunken in the pillow, and she wondered how in the

world the mother of a girl like that could stay one

minute in Kentucky and leave her. "She must be a

pretty womant" she thought to herself. Already she

hated the other mother-in-law, and she felt almost a

maternal right to the girl. She recalled what she had

seen the night before, and thrills of tender reminiscence

came over her. "Randolph will make just such a good

husband as his father," she thought to herself, and then

she rather resented his superior right over the girl, as

she might have done if it had not been a question of her

own son, and Charlotte had been her own daughter.

She loved her as she loved the daughter she had never

had. She stroked her hair softly as it curled over the

pillow.

" You have such pretty hair, dear," she said, with posi-

tive pride. The little, flushed face looked up at her.

Charlotte had just finished her breakfast. Anderson

had brought the telegram and gone, and the two were

alone. It was arranged that Charlotte was to get up

in an hour, and that Mrs. Anderson was to go homeb ithF'

her in one of Samson Rawdy's coaches.       '

"We will take my maid, and she can get the furiiace

fire started," she said, "and help about the dinner."

"'I had such a nice dinner all ready last night," Char-

lotte said, "and I am afraid it must be spoiledi now."

"Never mind. We will get another," said Mrs. An-

derson. 

Both Anderson and his mother hiad'succeeded in

quieting Charlotte's lingering fears concerning her father.

"He probably got stunned," Anderson said; "and he

cannot be very bad or he wouldr not be coming home

on the noon train."  He was talking to Charlotte from

his mother's room, with the; door ajar.

There was something conclusive in Anderson's voice

which reassured Charlotte.

<pb n="542"/>
THE DEBTOR

"My son -would not say so unless he thought so,"

said Mrs. Anderson. "He never says a thing he does

not mean." She spoke with a double meaning which

Charlotte wholly missed. It had not occurred to her

that Mr. Anderson would have taken her in his arms

last night and kissed her and comforted her, if he had

not been thoroughly in earnest and in love with her.

She supposed, of course, he wished to marry her. All

that troubled her was her own course in practically pro-

posing to him. Presently, after she and Mrs. Ander-

son were alone together, she tried to say something about

this to the other woman.

"I don't know as I ought to have come here last

night," she said, "but-"

"Where else would you have gone?" inquired Mrs.

Anderson.

Charlotte looked up at her piteously. "I hope Mr.

Anderson didn't think I-I--ought not to," she whis-

pered, and she felt her cheeks blazing with shame. She

did not know if Mrs. Anderson really knew, but she was

as much ashamed.

Mrs. Anderson stooped over her and laid her soft

old cheek against the soft young one. "My precious.

child!" she whispered. "I could not help seeing last

night, and this was just the place for you to come,'for

this is your home, or is going to be; isn't it, dear?"

Charlotte put up her soft little arms around the

other woman's neck, and began to cry softly. "Oh,"

she sobbed, "I don't want him to think that I-"

"Hush, dear! He will think nothing he ought not

to think," said Mrs. Anderson, who did not, in reality,

know in the least what the girl was troubled about,

but rather thought it possible that she might fear lest

her son was not in earnest in his attentions, on her

father's account. She did not imagine Charlotte's

faith and pride in her father. "My son cares a great

deal for you, dear child, or he would never have done

as he did last night,?' she said;. "and some day we are

all going to be very happy.?. 'u :'::

Charlotte continued to sob softly, but not altogether

unhappily. 

"My son will make a veryigoodit hsband," Mrs.

Anderson said, with a slight inflecton:.of pride. "He

will make a good husband, just as his fathei did."

"He is the best man I ever saw, except papa," cried

Charlotte then, with a great gulp obfi bliafl 6onfession,

and the two women wept in each- dtblr'9iArft.l ; "I

will try and make him a good wife,;/'?"Bala'This-

pered, softly.                   ', :i     , -:;

looked at Mrs. Anderson with a troubled facli-r' ;Bit

would not want to leave you."  '    .    ;

"I could not leave papa all alone." :"'p  -  ' i... :a'

"Well, we won't worry about that noW, dea'," Mrs.

Anderson replied, although her forehead was slightly

knitted. "Your mother and aunt will be back; some

way will be opened. We will not Vworrytabout that

now."                            : . 

Charlotte blushed painfully at the thought that she

had been hasty about making preparations for the

marriage, and had shocked Mrs.' Anderson.  "You

don't think papa is very badly hurt?" she said.

"Why, of course not, dear. Didn't you hear what

Randolph said? He probably was stunned. It is so

easy to get stunned from a fall on the ice. My hus-

band got a bad fall once, one icy Sunday as we were

coming home from the church. They had to carry him

into Mr. John Bemis's house, and he did not come to

for several hours. I thought he was killed. I never

was so frightened except once when Randolph had the

croup. But he got all over it. His head was a little

sore, but, that was all. I presume it was black and

blue under his hair. Randolph's father had beautiful

thick hair just like his. I dare say he was not hurt

so badly, because of that. Your father has thick hair,

hasn't he?"

"Yes."

"Well, I dare say he struck on his head, just as my

husband did, and was stunned. I dare say that was

just what happened. Of course he did not break any

bones, or he would not be coming home on the noon

train. I don't believe they would let him out from the

hospital so soon as that, even if he had only broken

his arm."

"Oh, do you think they carried him to a hospital?"

"They took him somewhere where he was taken care

of, or he would not be coming home on the noon train,"

said Mrs. Anderson. "It is almost time for you to get

up, and I want you to drink another cup of coffee.

You came here without any hat, didn't you, poor

child?"

"Yes."

"Well, I haven't got any hat, and you can't wear one

of my bonnets, but I have a pretty white head-tie that

you can wear; and nobody will see you in the closed car-

riage, anyway."

"I am making so much trouble," said Charlotte.

"You precious child!" said Mrs. Anderson; "when

I think of you all alone in that house!"

"It was dreadful," Charlotte said, with a shudder.

"I suppose there was nothing at all to be afraid of, but

I imagined all kinds of things."

"The things people imagine are more to be afraid of

than the things they see, sometimes," Mrs. Anderson

544

said, wisdly  " NW,' I: think perhaps you had: better

get up, dear, and you must drink another cup of coffee.

I think there will be just' about 'tine enough for you to

drink it and get dirssed befoi the e .cirriage comes.?

Mrs. Anderson took li pf'fid&i:.t assisting the girl to

dress that she had donAelt  dtessthg  r son when he was

a child. She even: noticed;, wit't the tenderest com-

miseration instead of ;condrination, -that the lace on

her undergarments was torii, atid thai 'ih'fte were but-

tons missing. 

"Poor dear child, she never had- any decent train-

Charlotte to take care of her clothes, as she 'might have

done if she had been her own girl baby. "I guess 'her

clothes won't look like this when I have had her awhile,"

she said to herself, eying furtively some torn lnce 6n

the girl's slender white shoulder.

When they were at last driving through the streets

of Banbridge, she felt unspeakably proud, ahd also a

little defiant.                                 -

"I suppose there are plenty of people who 'Will say

Randolph is a fool to marry a girl whose father has

done the way hers has," she told herself, "but I don't

care. There isn't a girl in Banbridge to compare with

her. I don't care; they can say what they want to."

She was so excited that she had put on her bonnet,

which had a little jet aigrette on top, awry. After a

while Charlotte timidly ventured to speak of it and

straighten it, and the tenderest thrill of delight came

over the older woman at the daughterly attention.

Sihei told Randolph that noon, after she had got

"but I thought it looked as if it might have been quite

nice when it was first cooked."

Already Mrs. Anderson was becoming deceptive for

the sake of the girl. She had carried a box of provisions

to the house, and they had stopped at the fish-market

and bought some oysters; and Mrs. Anderson had taught

Charlotte how to make a stew, and retreated before

it was quite time for Carroll to arrive. She felt in

her heart of hearts that she could not see him yet.

Even her love for the girl did not yet reconcile her to

Carroll. Charlotte was so glad that her little purse was

in her coat-pocket and that she had enough money to

pay for the oysters. She felt that she could not have

borne it had she been obliged to borrow money of Mrs.

Anderson. She felt that it would reflect upon her

father. Already she had an instinctive jealousy on

her father's account. She loved Mis. Anderson, but

she felt vaguely that not enough was said, even there

was not enough anxiety displayed, with regard to her

father. She reflected with the fiercest loyalty that

even although she did love Mr. Anderson, although she

had let him kiss her, although at the mere memory

thrills of delight overwhelmed her, she would not ever

admit even to herself that he was any better than her

father-her poor father who had been hurt and whom

everybody was blaming and accusing. Directly after

Mrs. Anderson and the maid had gone, she began mak-

ing the oyster-stew. It would not be quite so good as

if she had waited until her father had really arrived,

and Mrs. Anderson had told her so, but Charlotte could

not bear to wait. She wished him to have something

nice and hot the minute he came in. The water boiled

and she made the tea. Mrs. Anderson had said that

the tea might be better for him than coffee, and she also

made toast. Then she went again into the parlor to

the window, as she had done the night before; but it

was all so different now. She was so happy that she

was confused by'it:. She had not been brought up, as

one would say, religiously, although she had always

gone to church, but now she realized a strange uplifting

of her thoughts above the happiness itself, to a sense

of God. She was conscious of a thankfulness which at

once exalted and humbled her. She sat down beside

the window and looked out, and everything, every dry

spear of grass and every slender twig on the trees, was

streaming like rainbows in the frosty air;: :It 'came to

her what an unspeakable blessing it was that she had

been allowed to come into a world where there Were so

many rainbows and so much happiness, and how nothing

but more rainbows and happiness could come of these.

That there was nothing whatever to dread in the fu1ite.

And she thought now her father was coming home, aad

she thought of all her horrible imaginations o:f thieight

before as she might have thought of a legion of routed

fiends. And soon Samson Rawdy drove her father into

the grounds, and she ran to the door. Shelopened it

and went to the carriage with her arms extendedi but

he got out himself, laughing. 

"Did you think I wanted help, honey?" he said, but

though he laughed, he walked weakly and his face was

very pale.

He paid Samson Rawdy, who opened his mouth as if

to say something, then looked at Carroll's pale face and

changed his mind, getting rather stiffly up on his seat-

he was growing stout-and driving away.

"Oh, papa!" Charlotte said, slipping her arm through

his and nestling close up to him as they went into the

house.

Carroll bent down and kissed her. "Papa's poor lit-

tle girl!" he said. "It was mighty hard on her, wasn't

it?"

"Oh, papa, you are not hurt very badly?"

547








<pb n="548"/>
THE -DEBTOR

"Not hurt at all, sweetheart. I, to put it simply,

tumbled down on the ice and hit my head, and was so

stunned that I did not come to myself until it was too

late for the last train."

"Oh, papa, where were you? Did they carry you

to a hospital?"

"No, dear. I was very near a man who used to keep

my books before I gave up my office, and he had me

carried to his house, which was near by, and he and his

sister did everything for me, they and their doctor."

"They must be such good people!" said Charlotte.

"Such good people that I can never pay them," said

Carroll, in an odd voice. They had entered the house

and were going through the hall. "Not in other ways

than money," he added, quickly. "I owe him noth-

ing." It was the first time that Carroll had ever at-

tempted to justify himself to his child, but at that mo-

ment the sting of thinking that she might suspect that

he owed Allbright money was more than he could bear.

When they were in the dining-room, Carroll turned

and looked at Charlotte. "My poor little girl! What

did you think, and what did you do?" said he.

She threw her arms around his neck again and clung

to him. "Oh, papa, when you didn't come, when the

last train went by and you didn't come, I thought-"

"Poor little sweetheart!"

"I went down to the six-o'clock train, and then I wait-

ed for the next, and then I came home, and I watched,

and the telegraph - boy came to tell me there was no

telegram, and I had the dinner keeping warm on the

back of the range; it was beefsteak cooked that way in

the cook-book, and there was a pudding," said Char-

lotte, incoherently, and she began to weep against her

father's shoulder.

In reality, the girl's nerves were nearer the over-

strained point now than they had been before.-'iShe

was so glad to have her father home, she was so dazed

by her new happiness, and -there was something 'about

her father's. white face which frightened her in a subtle

fashion. There was a&changed meaning in it beside'tihe

sick look.

"Poor little girl!" Carroll said again. "Did you have

to stay here alone all night <'

"No, papa. I stayed just as long as I could, and

then I went out, and I ran-"

"Where, dear?" -

"I ran to-"

Carroll waited. Charlotte had turned her face as

far away from him as she could as she leaned against

him, but one ear was burning red.

"I ran to the-Andersons'. You know Mr. Anderson,

that tiine when I was so frightened by the tramp-  You

know I stayed there to tea, that- Mrs. Anderson was

very kind," said Charlotte, in a stammering and inco-

herent voice. 

"Oh," said Carroll. 

Suddenly Charlotte raised her head, atd-t she looked

at him  quite bravely, With an :innocent confidence'

"Papa," said she, "you needn't think I am ever going

to Ieave -you, not until Amy aind tle others come back,

because I never will. You never will think so?"'

"No, darling," said Carrilf  His face grew paler.

"But," continued Chariotte, "'when I went to the

Andersons' last night, I rang the bell, and I pounded

with the knocker,' too, I was so frightened, and Mr.

Anderson came right away. 'He had been to New

York'himself, to the thteatre, and he had not been home

long, and-"

Carroll waited. (. '  -

"I am never going to leave you, papa," said Char-

lotte, "and I love you .yust as much. I love you just

as much as I do-him, only, of course, it is different.

<pb n="550"/>
THE DEBTOR

You needn't think I don't. There is nobody like you.

But he-if you don't mind, papa, I think I will marry

Mr. Anderson sometime, the way Ina did Major Arms."

Carroll did not speak for a moment. He continued

looking at her with an expression made up of various

emotions-trouble, relief, shame.

"He is a very good man," said Charlotte, in a half-

defensive tone. "He is the best man I ever saw, ex-

cept you, papa."

Carroll bent down and kissed her. "You are very

sure you love him, are you, dear?" he said.

"Why, papa, of course I am! I never could see how

Ina could love Major Arms enough to marry him, but

I can see how anybody could be glad to marry Mr.

Anderson."

"Then I am very glad, sweetheart," Carroll said,

with a curious quietness, almost weariness.

"His mother is lovely, too," said Charlotte.

"That is nice, dear, for I suppose you will live with

them."

"When Amy and the others come back," said Char-

lotte. "I am not ever going to leave you, papa. You

know it, don't you?"

"Yes, sweetheart," said Carroll, still with the same

curious, weary quiet.

Charlotte looked at him anxiously. "Does your

head ache now, papa?" she asked.

"No, dear."

"But you don't feel well. You are very pale."

"I feel a little weak, that is all, dear."

"You will feel better when you have had dinner.

Mrs. Anderson came home with me, she and her maid,

and she gave me some lovely thin slices of ham, and

there is an oyster-stew, and some tea. Sit down, papa

dear, and we will have dinner right away."

Carroll made a superhuman effort to eat that dinner,

550








<pb n="551"/>
THE DEBTOR

but still the look whose strangeness rather than pale-

ness puzzled Charlotte never left his face. She kept

looking at him.

"You won't go to New York again to-morrow, will

you, papa ?" said she.

"No, dear. I don't think so."

"I wish you wouldn't go again this week, papa.

To-day is Thursday."

"Perhaps I won't, dear."

After dinner Carroll lay down on the divan in the

den and Charlotte covered him up, and after a while

he fell asleep; but even asleep, when 'she stole in to look

at him, there was the same strange expression on his

face. It was the face of a man whose mind is set irrev-

ocably to an end. A martyr going to the stake might

have had that same look, or even a criminal who was

going to his doom with a sense of its being his just

deserts, and with the bravery that befitted a man.

That evening Anderson came to call, and Carroll an-

swered the door-bell. He took him into the parlor,

and spoke at once of the subject uppermost in the

minds of both.

"Charlotte has told me," Carroll said, simply. He

extended his hand with a pathetic, deprecatory air.

"You know what you are doing when you ask for my

daughter's hand," he said. "You know she might have

a parentage which would reflect more credit upon her."

"I am quite satisfied," Anderson replied, in a low

voice. All at once, looking at the other man, it struck

him that he had never in his life pitied any one to such

an extent, and that he pitied him all the more because

Carroll seemed one to resent pity.

"This much I will say-I can say it confidently now,"

said Carroll, "I shall meet all my indebtedness. You

will have no reason to hesitate on that account," but he

paused a moment. "I am driven to resorting to any

36                55I








<pb n="552"/>
THE DEBTOR

honest method which I can find to enable me so to do;"

he continued. He made a slight emphasis upon the

word honest.

"I can understand that as fully, possibly, as any

man," Anderson replied, gravely.

Carroll looked at him. "Yes, so you can," he said-

"so you can. Well, this much I will say for myself,

Mr. Anderson. I am proud and glad to confide my

daughter to your keeping. I am satisfied, and more

than satisfied, with her choice."

"Thank you," replied Anderson. He felt a con-

straint, even embarrassment, as if he had been a very

young man. He was even conscious of blushing a

little.

"Sit down," said Carroll, placing a chair for him,

and offering him a cigar.

Then he went to call Charlotte. It was at that mo-

ment rather a hard experience for Charlotte that it was

not her mother instead of her father who called her to

go down and see her lover. She had thought, with a

passion of yearning, of her mother who had done the

same thing, and would understand, as she fluffed out

her pretty hair around her face in front of the glass in

her room. When her father called her she ran down,

but instead of going at once into the parlor, where she

knew her lover was waiting for her, she ran into the

den. She felt sure that her father had retreated there.

She found him there, as she had thought, and she flung

her arms around his neck.

"I am never going to leave you alone, you know,

papa," she whispered.

"Yes, dear."

"Papa, come in there with me."

Carroll laughed then. "Run along, honey," he said,

and gave her a kiss, and pushed her softly out of the

room.

delight of the fighter, of the wrestler with the angel.

What he had set himself to do for the sake of not only

making good to others what they had lost through him,

but what he had lost through himself, was unutterably

terrible to him. But while his face was agonized, he

yet threw back his head with the motion of the con-

queror. And he owned to himself that the conquest

was even greater because it was against such petty

odds, because both the fight and the triumph savored

of the ignoble, even of the ridiculous. It would be

much easier to be a hero whom the multitude would

applaud and worship than a hero whom the multitude

would welcome with laughter. When comedy becomes

tragedy, when the ignominious becomes victorious, he

who brings it about becomes majestic in spite of fate

itself. And yet withal the man sitting there listening

to the soft murmur from the other room felt that his

own life, so far as the happiness which, after all, makes

life worth living for mortal weakness, was over. He

thought of his wife and sister and children, who would

be all safely sheltered, and, he hoped, even happy in

time, although separated from him; and while his soul

rejoiced over that, he yet could not help thinking of

himself. Listening to the voices of the lovers in the

parlor, he thought how he and Amy used to make love,

and how it was all over, perhaps forever over. He

smiled a little as he remembered how his Charlotte

had asked him to go with her to meet her lover. Gentle

and affectionate to his family as he was, Carroll was

essentially masculine. He could not in the least under-

stand how the girl felt. He felt a little anxious lest

the child should not really love Anderson, because she

hesitated, since he could see no other reason for her

hesitation. However, when, about eleven o'clock, he

heard the stir of approaching departure, and went hur-

riedly into the hall in order to intercept Anderson be-

554








<pb n="555"/>
THE DEBTOR

fore he went, one glimpse of the girl's little face re-

assured him. She seemed to at once have grown older

and younger. She was reflective, and fairly beaming

with utmost anticipations. She looked at Anderson

as he had never seen her look at any one. He had

doubted a little about Ina; he, had no doubt whatever

about Charlotte. "She is in love with him, fast enough,"

he said to himself. He spoke to Anderson, and asked

to have a word with him before he went.+. ,

"Come back into the parlor a moment, if yov please,"

he said. "I have a word to say to you." :' ': .

Anderson followed him into the room. 'le atleady

had on his overcoat. Carroll stood close -to'tii' -and

spoke in a low voice. His face was ghastly whei'-he

had finished, but he looked proudly at the othr;iman.

"Now it is for you to say whether you will advatice

or retreat, for I think that, under the' cistciustances,

nobody could say that you did not do the last with

honor," he concluded.               . ';

Anderson, who had also turned pale, stared at him a

second, and his look was a question.

"There is absolutely nothing else that I can do," re-

plied Carroll, simply; "it is my only course."

Anderson held out his hand. "I shall be proud to

have your daughter for my wife," he said.

" Remember she is not to know," Carroll said.

"Do you think the ignorance preferable to the

anxiety?"

"I don't know. I cannot have her know. None of

them shall know. I have trusted you," Carroll said,

with a sort of agonized appeal. "I had, as a matter

of honor, to tell you, but no one else," he continued,

still in his voice which seemed strained to lowness.

"I had to trust you."

"You will never find your trust misplaced," replied

Anderson, gravely, "but it will be hard for her."

555








<pb n="556"/>
THE DEBTOR

"You can comfort her," Carroll said, with a painful

smile, in which was a slight jealousy, the feeling of a

man outside all his loves of life.

"When?" asked Anderson, in a whisper.

"Monday."

"She will, of course, come straight to my mother,

and it can all be settled as soon as possible afterwards.

There will be no occasion to wait."

"Amy may wish to come," said Carroll, "and Anna."

"Of course."

The two men shook hands and went out in the hall.

Carroll went back to the den, and left Charlotte, who

was shyly waiting to have the last words with her lover.

Pretty soon she came fluttering into the den.

"You do like him, don't you, papa?" she asked, put-

ting her arms around her father's neck.

"Yes, dear."

"But I am never going to leave you, papa, not for

him nor anybody, not until Amy and the others come

back."

"You will never forget papa, anyway, will you,

honey?" said Carroll, and his voice was piteous in spite

of himself.

"Forget you, papa? I guess not!" said Charlotte,

"and I never will leave you."

That was Thursday. The next afternoon Mrs. An-

derson came and called on Charlotte. -She was glad that

Carroll was not at home. She shrank very much from

meeting him. Carroll had not gone to New York, but

had taken the trolley to New Sanderson. He also went

into several of the Banbridge stores. The next Sunday

morning, in the barber's shop, several men exhibited

notes of hand with Carroll's signature.

"I don't suppose it is worth the paper it is written

on," said Rosenstein, with his melancholy accent, frown-

ing intellectually over the slip of paper.

happy. Her father seemed in very good spirits, but

she wondered why he looked so badly. It was actually

as if he had lost ten pounds since the night before.

He was horribly haggard, but he talked and laughed

in a manner rather unusual for him, as he ate his

breakfast. Charlotte watched jealously that he should

do that. When he took his second badly fried egg, she

beamed, and he concealed his physical and mental

nausea.

When they were eating breakfast, much to Char-

lotte's amazement, the village express drove into the

yard.

"Why, there is the express, papa!" she said.

"Yes, honey," replied Carroll, calmly. "I have a

trunk I want to send to New York."

"Oh, papa, you are not going away?"

"Sending a trunk does not necessarily imply you

are going yourself, honey. I have a trunk to send in

connection with some business."

"Oh!" said Charlotte, quite satisfied.

Carroll rose from the table and showed the express-

man the way to his room, and the trunk was brought

down and carried away, and Charlotte asked no more

questions and thought no more about it. Carroll walked

to the station. When it was time for him to start, he

went eo Charlotte, who was clearing away the breakfast

dishes, and held her in his arms and kissed her.

"Good-bye, papa's blessing," he said, and in spite of

himself his voice broke. The man had reached the

limit of his strength.

But Charlotte, who was neither curious nor suspicious,

and was, besides, dazzled by her new happiness, only

laughed. "Why, papa, I should think you were going

away to stay a year!" said she.

Carroll laughed too, but his laugh was piteous. He 

kissed her again. "Well, good-bye, honey," he said.

Just as he was going out of the door he stopped, and

said, as if it were a minor matter which he had nearly

forgotten, "Oh, by-the-way, sweetheart, I want you,

at exactly half-past nine, to go into the den and look

in the third volume of the Dutch Republic, and see what

you will find."

Charlotte giggled. "A present!" said she. "I know

it is a present, but what a funny place to put it in, papa,

the third volume of the Dutch Republic."

"At exactly half-past nine," said Carroll. He kissed

her again and went away.

Charlotte stood watching him. go out of the yard.

It came into her head that he must have had some very

good luck, and had taken this funny way of making

her a present of some money. Of course'it could only

be money which was to be hidden in such a place as a

book. Poor Charlotte's imaginations were tainted by

the lack of money,

She could hardly imagine a pleasant surprise uncon-

nected with money. She hurried about her household

tasks, and at exactly half-past nine, for she.was obedi-

ent as a child, she went into the den and got from the

case the third volume of the Dutch Republic. In it she

found an envelope. She thought that it contained

money, but when she opened it and found a letter, sud-

denly her heart failed her. She sat down dizzily on the

divan and read the letter. It as very short. It only

told her that her father loved her and loved them all;

that he was writing the others just what he was writing

her; that he loved her, but he was'forced to go away

and leave hew, and not even let her know where he was

nor what he was doing-ont for a long time, at least;

but that she was not to worry, and she was to go at

once to Mrs. Anderson, who would take care of her

until she was married. Then he bade God bless her,

and said he was her loving father. Charlotte sat with

the letter in her lap, and the room looked dim to her.

She heard the door-bell ring, but she did not seem to

realize what it was, not even when it rang the second

and the third time. But the front door had been left

unlocked when Carroll went, and Anderson came in

presently, and his mother was with him. Mrs. Ander-

son knew nothing except that Carroll had gone, and

nobody was to know where, or why, but that there was

nothing dishonorable about it, and Charlotte was to

come to them. She was quite pale herself when she

saw Charlotte sitting on the divan with the letter in

her lap.

"I have a letter from papa," Charlotte said, piteously,

in a trembling voice. Then Anderson had her in his

arms and was soothing and comforting her, and telling

her he knew all about it. It was all right, and she was

not to worry.

Mrs. Anderson stood watching them. "Where are

your coat and hat, child?" said she, presently. She, in

reality, felt that she was the proper person to have

comforted the girl, under such circumstances, and not

a man who knew nothing about girls, nor how they

would feel when deserted, in a measure, by a father.

When-they were in the carriage, she sat on the seat with

Charlotte and kept her arm around her, and looked

across almost defiantly at her son.

"It is a terrible strain on the poor little thing, and if

we are not careful she will be down with a fever," she

told Randolph, privately, when they were home.

He laughed. "Take care of her all you want to,

mother," he said.

After dinner he went up to the Carroll place. He

had his instructions from Carroll what to do. Some

of the creditors were partly satisfied with the things

belonging to the Carrolls; some were taken to the- An-

derson house for Charlotte. As for Charlotte herself,

she wias, in reality, not so far from the feter which

Mrs?.Anderson had, predicted. She adored her father.

yery day she watched for a letter. At last Anderson

told-her as much as he could and not break his wdid to

her father    ..

"Your father is perfectly safe, dear," he said, "and

he is earning a great deal of money."

"What is he doing?" asked Charlotte, and her.man-

ner showed for the first time suspicion of her father.

"Something perfectly honest, dear," Anderson re-

plied, simply, "but he does not want you to know and

he does not want the others to know. You just be

contented and brave and make the best of it all.."

That was not long before they were married. It had

seemed best to them all that they should not delay long.

Mrs. Carroll did not come to the wedding, because Ina

was ill. Anna knew as well as Anderson what her

brother was doing. She had somehow comforted. her

sister-in-law without telling her anything, but she did

not think it best to visit Banbridge. She had at times

a feeling as if she herself were doing what her brother

was,,and the shame and pride together stung her in the

saim :way, She wrote by every mail to Carroll, and

posted,it in another town, and nobody knew. In one

of the letters she told: him with an unconcealed glee

that his old em<wty; the. man who had brought about

all this, had la; Lal cki of :paralysis.

" He will -never.;spjak again," shei wrote. "He has

become dead while.be, is alive. After all, the Lord is

dark, but the winter sky was full of stars, which seemed

very near as he took his way up the street towards the

Anderson house. He walked slowly when he approach-

ed the house, and frequently cast a look behind him,

as if he were afraid of being seen. When he reached the

house he saw the curtains in the sitting-room were not

drawn, and a warm glow of home seemed to shine forth

into the wintry night. Carroll cautiously went up the

steps, very softly. He went far enough to see the in-

terior of the room, and saw Charlotte and her husband

sitting there. Mrs. Anderson was there also. Shewas

reading the Bible, as befitted a Sunday night. Now

and then she looked at Charlotte with a look of the ut-

most love and pride. Anderson, who was reading the

paper, looked up, and the watching man saw him, and

his eyes and Charlotte's met. The man watching knew

that no anxiety about him seriously troubled her then,

that she was entirely happy, and a feeling of sublime

content and delight that it should be so, and he quite

outside of it all, came over him.

He went softly down the steps and along the street

to the station, where he could get a train back to the

City in a few moments. To his own amazement, he

was quite happy, he was even more than happy. A

species of exaltation possessed him. Even the thought

of himself, Arthur Carroll, posing nightly as a buffoon

before the City crowds, did not daunt him. He realized

a kind of joyful acquiescence with even that. He felt

a happy patience when he considered the time that

might elapse before he could see his family again. He

passed the butcher's shop, and reflected with delight

that he should be able to meet the note which was due

next day. He remembered happily that he had been

able to send Charlotte a little sum of money for her

trousseau, and that perhaps a part of it had bought the

pretty, rose-colored dress which she was wearing that

night. Still, all this did not altogether account for the

wonderful happiness which seemed to fill him as with

light. He hurried along the street frozen in ridges like

a sea, and he remembered what Anna had written about

the man who had wronged him, and all at once he un-

derstood what filled him with this exaltation of joy, and

he understood that underneath all the petty dishonors

of his life had been a worse dishonor which took hold of

his very soul and precipitated all the rest, and that he

was now rid of it. He had no sense of triumph over his

enemy, no joy that the Lord had at last wreaked ven-

geance upon the man who had injured him; but he

was filled with an exceeding pity, and a sense of for-

giveness which he had never in his life felt before. He

had never forgiven before; now he forgave. He re-

membered, going along the streets, the words of The

Lord's Prayer, "Forgive my debts as I forgive my

debtors," and his very heart leaped with the knowl-

edge that forgiveness was due him because of is for-

giveness of another, and that the debt of honor to God

and his own soul was paid.

THE TEST OF LOVECHAPTER IA GIRL'S TRAGEDY
<p>ONCE more Hamilton Gower read the little pink note that had come with the manuscript which his beloved, Seraph Elfinstar, had given him to read:</p>
<p>"Before you begin to read my narrative you must know this in explanation: Mr. Elfinstar is not my father, but my grandfather, and I am Margaret Campbell."</p>
<p>He sat stupefied with amazement and sorrow.</p>
<p>One idea possessed and overwhelmed him--that Seraph Elfinstar, the good and beautiful girl whom he loved and worshiped for her angelic attributes of person and character, could be one and the same individual with Margaret Campbell, the convict murderess, whom he had learned to loathe and abhor for the cruelty of her nature and the atrocity of her crime.</p>
<p>He could not understand this. He could not believe it. The terrible revelation crushed, but did not convince him.</p><p>He sat there paralyzed by the stunning blow, utterly incapable of reasoning upon it.</p>
<p>Seraph Elfinstar and Margaret Campbell one and the same woman! It was incredible! it was impossible! even though she herself had said it!</p>
<p>He felt a sudden sense of suffocation. Rising and staggering like a drunken man, he tottered to one of the windows and raised it, drew a deep inhalation of the fresh air, and then sank down on a chair beside it and rested his elbow on the sill.</p>
<p>Margaret Campbell and Seraph Elfinstar one!</p>
<pb n="4 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>Oh! this was a nightmare from which he would presently be relieved! He had talked too much and thought too much of this detestable Margaret Campbell, and her sinister influence on the life of Seraph Elfinstar, until at length he had blended them in his dreams! He would pinch himself severely and wake up.</p>
<p>He did so, but without effecting any change in his surroundings.</p>
<p>Here was still the hotel room, with its whitewashed walls, its straw matting on the floor, its white-curtained windows, and its white-draped bed. There was the little pink note that had stung him like an asp lying on the floor, and here was the roll of manuscript in his hand!</p>
<p>No, he had not been dreaming! He was wide awake, and face to face with a hideous, a ghastly, reality. Seraph Elfinstar was Margaret Campbell, and a convict for life!  Seraph herself had written it! Seraph, whose word was truth!</p>
<p>Since she was Margaret Campbell, of course, she was lost to him forever and ever! There could be no thought of marriage with her, a convict for life in the penal settlements of Tasmania!</p>
<p>But was she guilty?</p><p>Impossible!</p>
<p>Seraph Elfinstar must be as innocent as an angel, even though Margaret Campbell had been convicted under overwhelming evidence, and the two names represented but one woman.</p>
<p>Yes, Seraph Elfinstar was innocent! He felt absolutely certain of that!  He could not have been intimately associated with her for six weeks without recognizing the purity, tenderness and sincerity of nature which would have rendered such guilt as had been ascribed to Margaret Campbell utterly impossible to her.</p>
<p>How, then, had such a net of cirumstantial evidence involved her in its meshes?</p>
<p>Would her narrative explain that?</p>
<p>He was scarcely capable of examining the manuscript as yet. The terrible excitement of the last half hour had almost exhausted his strength. He felt as weak as a child.</p>
<p>He was very abstemious in the use of wine; yet now he felt the need of some stimulus.
</p><pb n="5 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>He stretched out his hand and rang the bell, whose pull was within his reach, summoned a waiter and ordered a glass of wine; and when he had drunk it he settled himself in his large armchair, unrolled the manuscript, and read:</p>
<p>"THE STORY OF MARGARET CAMPBELL</p>
<p>"Dear friend, who have been so good to me, I feel that I must be true with you.</p>
<p>"Now, standing in the shadow of death, I must tell you the whole story.</p>
<p>"I preface my narrative by confessing that but for my own fault I should never have been placed in the awful position in which I stand to-day--doomed to die for a crime that I never was capable of committing.</p>
<p>"Dearest of dear friends! you knew so little of me, of my circumstances, before my dire extremity brought you to my help, that I must recount something of my early life in order to explain what is to follow.</p>
<p>"I am the only child of Duncan Campbell, second son of Duncan Campbell, of Rose Hill, and of Seraph Elfinstar, only daughter of Theobald Elfinstar, of Thorncliff, Yorkshire.</p>
<p>"I have no memory of my parents, having lost them both in the first two years of my existence.</p>
<p>"My infancy and childhood were passed happily under the guardianship of my father's elder brother, Mr. Stuart Campbell, of Rose Hill.</p>
<p>"My uncle was without children, and I, in right of my father, was the recognized heir presumptive of the estate.</p>
<p>"I was the adopted daughter of the house, petted and spoiled by both uncle and aunt.</p>
<p>"I loved my uncle, who was my uncle by blood; but I actually adored my aunt, though she was my aunt only by marriage.</p>
<p>"She loved me with more than a mother's tenderness, and I worshiped her with more than a daughter's devotion.</p>
<p>"The bond of affection between us was a perfect bond.</p>
<p>"She was a most accomplished woman, and when, in the seventh year of my age, the question of providing a governess for me arose in the house, and I--spoiled child that I was--rebelled at the idea, with a storm of sobs, and tears,
<pb n="6 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

and protestations that I would never let a stranger take possession of me, and separate me for ever so many hours a day from my dear auntie, she, in her self-sacrificing love, came to my rescue by declaring that she herself was perfectly competent and perfectly willing to take full charge of my education, and would henceforth do so.</p>
<p>"Yes, the lady of the manor, in her love for the little alien child who was not of her blood, readily assumed the duties and responsibilities which are usually considered very onerous and oppressive even by those who are trained to undertake them as a profession.</p>
<p>"My uncle, with an incredulous smile, remarked that he hoped that my aunt would not find cause to regret her undertaking.</p>
<p>"If she ever had such cause she never expressed the least regret.</p>
<p>"She was the most patient of teachers, and I was to her, what I might not have been to any other human being, the most docile of pupils.</p>
<p>"We were both much happier for this new and close companionship established between us; she found in it occupation and amusement, I employment and pleasure.</p>
<p>"In this way several happy years passed, when at length my aunt's health began to droop. She was now about forty-five years of age, my uncle being ten years her senior, and I a well-grown girl of twelve.</p>
<p>"My dear aunt had no especial disease, nor do I think she need have died, had not heart-break been added to other causes of decline.</p>
<p>"Yes, heart-break! You shall know all about it now.</p>
<p>"About this time, when my dear aunt was failing in health and beauty, there came to visit us a very distant cousin of my uncle--an impecunious widow, aged about thirty-two or thirty-three--in person beautiful and attractive as an angel; in character selfish and subtle as a demon.</p>
<p>"Using and abusing her privileges of relationship, she gradually appropriated and absorbed all my uncle's time and attention.</p>
<p>This was not all accomplished in a day, or a week, but in the course of weeks running into months.</p>
<p>"She talked, read, or played cards with him in the house;
<pb n="7 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

she walked, rode, or drove with him in the park; while my aunt, confined to her own room by indisposition, was utterly neglected, and left to pine in solitude, or with no other company than myself, or her maid, Stockton.</p>
<p>"While these follies were going on under my eyes I did not at first recognize them as improprieties. I was too young. I knew too little of the world. I thought that it was my uncle's duty, and a very hard duty, under the circumstances, to entertain the lady guests, and I was sorry for him and vexed with her, especially when my aunt, looking at me with anxious, pathetic eyes, would ask:</p>
<p>"'Meg, darling, where is your uncle?'</p>
<p>"And I would be compelled to answer that he was with Mrs. Mattox.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I would grow impatient at seeing how my aunt was neglected, and how despondent she was becoming, and then I would exclaim:</p>
<p>"'I wish that Mattox woman would go home, if she has any home to go to! I should think she might see that she is a nuisance, especially to poor uncle, who wants to spend some time in the day with his wife!'</p>
<p>"But my aunt would only answer by the saddest smile, that always ended in a sigh.</p>
<p>"One day I was suddenly enlightened. I happened to be alone in my aunt's boudoir, arranging some of the first wild violets of the spring in little vases on her table, when Stockton entered with a silk quilt to lay on the sofa in readiness for her mistress, who intended to lie down there that day for a change. As she was arranging the silk quilt and cushions she suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>"'I hope my master will find time to-day to come and sit a while with my mistress.'</p>
<p>"'Why, he cannot, Stockton. He is going by rail to Tynemouth to show Mrs. Mattox the ruins of the old abbey she is so anxious to see,' I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"'Humph!' muttered the maid, with a decided expression of scorn and detestation.</p>
<p>"Encouraged by this tacit sympathy, I cried out sharply:</p>
<p>"'I wish to the Lord in heaven that woman would go about her business--that I do!'</p>
<p>"'She is about her business, Miss Margaret! Never you doubt that!'</p>
<pb n="8 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"'What do you mean by that, now, Stockton?' I demanded, feeling annoyed and made vaguely anxious by something very peculiar in the woman's tone and manner.</p>
<p>"'She knows her business pretty well, Miss Margaret, and she has set herself about it in earnest. I am sure my poor mistress sees that as well as I do, although she says nothing.'</p>
<p>"'Stockton, why can't you speak out?  What is her business, then?'</p>
<p>"'To become the second wife of your uncle, and the mistress of Rose Hill!" curtly replied Stockton.</p>
<p>"At these words I fell into a perfect whirlwind of fury. I uttered many wild, mad threats, which were afterward produced against me on my trial.</p>
<p>"Yes, I did say the words reported of me. I did say:</p>
<p>"'That she shall never be! I will kill her first--the snake! I will kill her with my own hands before she shall succeed to my aunt's place in the house, even if she has supplanted her in the heart of her husband! I will kill the crawling, venomous reptile first! I will kill her with my own hands!' I repeated many times, and in my blind fury and passion I meant what I said.</p>
<p>"Two housemaids, who were passing the door on their way to the upper chambers, paused and stood aghast at my state of rage.</p>
<p>"'For the love of the Lord be quiet, dear Miss Margaret, or we shall have the house about our ears!  Look at the maids, how they stare! Go about your work, you minxes! What are you loitering here for?'</p>
<p>"The two young women passed on, pale with dismay.</p>
<p>"I raged on, unheeding Stockton's prayers and remonstrances, until at last she said:</p>
<p>"'Now, there is your aunt's bell, and I should not wonder if she had heard you and is frightened out of her senses.'</p>
<p>"That stopped me at once. I would not have hurt, or in the least degree startled, my aunt on any account.</p>
<p> "I had never liked Mrs. Mattox; but from that hour I hated her with a bitter hatred, and I pitied my aunt with an intensity that nearly broke my heart. I would look at her sweet, pale face and hollow eyes and gray hair, and have to run out of the room to hide my tears. I would then encounter the round, rosy cheeks and beaming, black
<pb n="9 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

eyes and golden hair of Mrs. Mattox with a burning rage that nearly consumed me. Oh! I thought, if I could only strike her dead with the glance of my eyes! Or if I could breathe a pestilence over her and wither her freshness and beauty with leprosy or smallpox, how gladly I would have done it!</p>
<p>"The whole household saw the intensity of my hatred and shuddered at it, and were compelled to testify to it when they were forced to appear as witnesses against me on my trial.</p>
<p>"But, now, was there no excuse for me?</p>
<p>"This woman Mattox had deliberately won my foolish old uncle's affections from his invalid wife! She daily flaunted her fresh and blooming beauty and elegant and bewitching toilets, in contrast to the pale, gray, failing lady whose heart was breaking even faster than her health!</p>
<p>"She was killing my sweet and gentle aunt! How could I help hating her unto death?</p>
<p>"Once I ventured to ask my aunt:</p>
<p>"'Why does not Mrs. Mattox go home? She has been here for four months now, and her children must want to see her, if she does not care to see them.'</p>
<p>"'Her children are at boarding school, dear, and can only see their mother at stated intervals,' replied my aunt.</p>
<p>"'But, why, then, does not she go home?' I persisted.</p><p>"'I do not think she has any settled home. I think, while her daughters are at boarding school, she visits around among her friends.'</p>
<p>"'Then why in the world doesn't she go to some other friend now? It must have been somebody else's turn at least three months ago! She must be defrauding some admiring friends out of their proper share of her pleasant society!'</p>
<p>"'I suppose she finds her quarters here more agreeable than elsewhere,' said my aunt, with a patient smile.</p>
<p>"'I wish I could make them very disagreeable to her! I wish--'</p>
<p>"'Hush, darling,' said the gentle lady.</p>
<p>"'Auntie, dear, why do you not write her a note, and say that it is not convenient to entertain her any longer? Oh, auntie! do write that note, and I will take it to her myself--with pleasure.'</p>
<pb n="10 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>
<p>"'No, dear, I cannot do that. It would do no good. It would rather do harm, for it would displease your uncle,' she patiently replied.</p>
<p>"'Displease my uncle? Who cares if it would? You have the right to send away the woman who takes up so much of his time that ought to be passed with you!'</p>
<p>"'Hush, hush, my love, and listen to me,' she said, impressively. 'I am going away from this earth, dear Margaret; I am going away very soon; and I want to go--I want to go to that love which never disappoints, or wounds,  or fails; but I want to go in peace, dearest, in perfect peace with all the world.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, auntie; oh, auntie, what do you mean? Do you mean to let that woman kill you, and never say a word?' I broke forth, in burning indignation.</p>
<p>"'Hush, my darling; hush! I mean only this--that the few remaining days of my life on earth may be passed in peace, so that in leaving it I may depart in peace. What, my Margaret, shall I mar with discord this sacred time, when earth is fading on my vision and heaven is brightening? No, dear child; no.'</p>
<p>"I looked at her and made up my mind, if she would not write that note to send Mrs. Mattox away, I would speak to that woman myself.</p>
<p>"I was terribly excited. I did not dare to trust myself in the creature's presence until I could command myself; for I required perfect calmness in order to speak to her as I intended to do. But how or when I should attain such calmness I could not know.</p>
<p>"I went to Stockton, who was busy in my aunt's dressing room, to consult her.</p><p>"'Stockton,' I said, 'I am so very nervous. My heart is throbbing up toward my throat, as if it would choke me; my brain is beating as if it would burst; my limbs are trembling so that I can scarcely stand; and you can perceive for yourself that I cannot speak steadily.'</p>
<p>"'I can see you are in an awful way, Miss Margaret; and now what has put you into it?' she inquired.</p>
<p>"'That woman, of course!'</p>
<p>"'Now, Miss Margaret, you must not think of her, or you will be growing crazy! Just to see that state you are in!'</p>
<pb n="11 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"'Stockton, I know it!  And I do not wish to betray myself. I am going downstairs now. Give me something to quiet me! You know what to give. I have seen you give it to auntie when she has been very nervous. What is it? Give me some!'</p>
<p>"'It is laudanum I gave my mistress, by the doctor's directions, my dear Miss Margaret. I would not like to fool with it without orders.'</p>
<p>"'How much do you give auntie, then?'</p>
<p>"'Eh twenty-five drops; but she is used to it; twenty-five drops might lay you out. No, Miss Margaret, I can't even give you so much as one drop without the doctor's orders. It might kill you, and I don't want to be hung for poisoning, not at my time of life!'</p>
<p>"I turned away from Stockton and went straight to the little cabinet in which the medicine bottles were kept, and I deliberately dropped ten drops of laudanum in a teaspoon and swallowed it.</p>
<p>"I had never taken laudanum in my life before, and the effect was prompt and potent. My turbulent blood suddenly fell as calm as the stormy sea at the divine command.</p>
<p>"I went downstairs as firmly as if I had been fifty years old instead of twelve; and I went into the library, where Mrs. Mattox sat reading poetry aloud and making eyes at my uncle, who listened, and leered, and sighed over the traitress, in a way to have put me in a rage, if it had not been for the laudanum.</p>
<p>"'Uncle,' I said, 'I have something to say to Mrs. Mattox, if you will please excuse me, and leave us alone for a few minutes.'</p>
<p>"'Indeed! A message from your aunt, perhaps,' he said, rising, while Mrs. Mattox closed her book, keeping her thumb in her place.</p>
<p>"I did not reply to my uncle's theory, and he, taking it for granted that he had guessed the truth, left the library.</p><p>"We were alone together-the snake woman and myself.</p>
<p>"'Have you a message from your aunt to me, my love?' she sweetly inquired, bringing her black eyes to bear caressingly on me.</p>
<p>"'No, madam, I have no message from my aunt to you.
<pb n="12 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

It is scarcely likely that my aunt would send a message to you,' I replied, with a calm dignity not at all natural, but due entirely to the laudanum.</p>
<p>"'But you have something to say to me, my dear? she murmured in the most mellifluous of tones.</p>
<p>"'Yes, madam, I have this to say: You have been here nearly five months; you have so completely engrossed the attention of my uncle that he has had no time, days nor evenings, to give to his invalid wife. Everybody notices this and blames you. The attendant physician, the servants in the house, all talk about it. Some one ought to tell you what is said. I do it. You should go away, and leave the husband to his wife.'</p>
<p>"She did not lose her temper at those plain words, as any one might have supposed she would have done. Oh, not in the least. Her wonderful powers of dissimulation served her as well as the opiate did me. So that what might otherwise have been an unseemly war of words became a quiet discussion.</p>
<p>"'But, my little love,' she said sweetly, 'I cannot go away and leave the family at such a distressing time. I would willingly have gone three months ago, or any time since that. I came only to spend the Christmas holidays. I had promised January to the Countess of Rockland; February to the Countess of Grassmere; March to the Marchioness of Widelands; April to the Duchess of Wincaster; and to all these ladies I have had to send excuses because my duties kept me here at Rose Hill, and I have had to forego all their pleasant country parties for the sake of staying here in this afflicted family, and doing my little best to supply the place of its lonely invalid mistress. I am sorry people are so absurd as to talk; but that should not prevent me from doing my duty.'</p>
<p>"That I did not fall upon her, tooth and nail, for her hypocrisy was due only to the calming influence of the laudanum.</p>
<p>"'So you will not go?' I said.</p>
<p>"'No, sweet one, I must not.'</p>
<p>"'You will stay here as a guest until you are sure of remaining here as the mistress of the house?</p>
<p>"'Is that what the wicked people say of me, my dear?</p>
<p>"'It is just what observers think of you, madam.'</p>
<pb n="13 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"'How unjust they are! How little they know me!'</p>
<p>"This woman knew that she was not deceiving me. She did not even wish to do so. I saw through her. She wished at the same time to avoid a scene which would have compromised her, and to defy and taunt me under the cover of her sweet words and looks.</p>
<p>"I, a child of a dozen years, was powerless in the hands of such a woman.</p>
<p>"'You will not go, then! You will not go! Very well! I shall pray day and night to the Lord to deliver us from you, as from the greatest evil that afflicts us!'</p>
<p>"I spoke passionately, notwithstanding the opiate, and I left the room.</p><p>"I never told my aunt of this conversation, nor did Mrs. Mattox complain of me to my uncle. She would not have done that. Her tactics were to avoid all disturbance; to keep all in apparent harmony.</p>
<p>"My dear aunt faded gradually, and about three weeks after my interview with Mrs. Mattox she passed quietly away.</p>
<p>"Then I think my uncle was seized with a sudden remorse, for he shut himself up in his room and refused to see any visitor, leaving all necessary arrangements in the hands of his solicitors and steward.</p>
<p>"On the day of my aunt's death, Mrs. Mattox came to me, and said:</p>
<p>"'I must leave you, sweet love! I grieve to do so; but you must be aware that it would not be proper for me to remain in the house of a widower where there is no lady at the head of the establishment.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, go, go,' I answered passionately. 'Go! you have finished your work here! You have won the heart of the husband and broken the heart of the wife!  You have killed her! Go, and may the Lord judge you!'</p>
<p>"'You are excited, dear love! You will be more just to me when you are calmer,' she said, as she stooped to kiss me; but I started and turned away, and she left the room, and, a few hours later, the house.'</p>
<pb n="14 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

CHAPTBER II AN OLD MAN'S FATE
<p>"AFTER the funeral of my aunt, my uncle continued disconsolate for many days.</p>
<p>"All his fondness for myself was revived, and he kept me much with him, and made me talk about my aunt. He never dreamed that she had known of his devotion to her rival, and that she had secretly broken her heart over it, for no word or look of hers had ever betrayed her feelings on that subject; nor did I ever drop a hint to my uncle that could have enlightened him.</p>
<p>"I had too much veneration for the delicacy and dignity of my dear aunt's character to show the death wound that she had covered.</p>
<p>"Nor was the name of Mattox ever mentioned between us. Remorse, no doubt, kept my uncle silent, and pride and hatred restrained me.</p>
<p>"I hoped and believed that we should never see or hear any more of that woman. Ah! I knew so little of human nature!</p> <p>"In a few more weeks my uncle grew restless, and took a journey, telling me that he was going away on business. He was absent a week, and returned in much better spirits.</p>
<p>"A month later he made another journey, and stayed away another week, and came home accompanied by an upholsterer and decorator, who was engaged to fit up and refurnish the whole house.</p>
<p>"Still, I had no suspicion of what was soon to follow.</p>
<p>"If my aunt's maid had been with us she might have enlightened me; but Stockton had left to take another service.</p>
<p>"The whole interior of the house seemed to be turned topsy-turvy, and the utmost confusion prevailed for several weeks; but, at the end of that period, the work was complete, and the house was elegantly decorated and refurnished.</p>
<p>"Then my uncle went on a third journey, without explaining his business to any of us.</p>
<pb n="15 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"When he had been gone four weeks he wrote from Paris to our housekeeper, telling her to have everything in readiness to receive her new mistress, as Mrs. Campbell and himself would arrive at Rose Hill at six o'clock on the ensuing Saturday evening.</p>
<p>"This news was a terrible shock to me! My ravings on that occasion proved the malignant hatred I bore toward the second Mrs. Campbell.</p>
<p>"When the newly married couple arrived at the stated time, I refused to meet them.</p>
<p>"While madam was in her dressing room, my uncle came in search of me, and would have embraced me had I not broke suddenly out upon him.</p>
<p>"'You shall never kiss me again as long as you live! You have brought that woman home here to take the place of the lady whom you and she killed between you! Yes! You killed my dear aunt between you, and you know you did, and I hate you both!  I hope the Lord will punish you both!'</p>
<p>"My uncle said if I could not behave myself he would have to send me to school, and so he left me.</p>
<p>"Well, it turned out that I really could not behave myself, and so I was sent to school. I was very glad to go, so as to be rid of the sight of the woman who had as surely killed my aunt as if she had stabbed her through the heart.</p>
<p>"I entered the school early in January, and remained until the end of the term early in June. Then my uncle came in person to bring me home for the midsummer holidays; but I utterly refused to come, and spoke of the new woman in such terms as to leave him no option but to return to Rose Hill without me.</p>
<p>"I remained at the school another half year, which ended with the Christmas holidays. Again my uncle came for me, for he loved me as his child, and was always good to me. He pressed me to return home with him. He told me that I had a little baby cousin, a little boy, who, to be sure, was born the heir of Bose Hill, so that I was no longer the heiress, but that I should be so richly provided for by his will that I should never be the worse for the loss of the estate.</p>
<p>"I replied that I neither wanted the estate nor the
<pb n="16 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

money; that all I wanted was never to set foot within limits of Rose Hill again, and never to set eyes on the murderess of my aunt, or on her son.</p>
<p>"Strong and bitter words these, yet they scarcely expressed the strength and bitterness of my feelings.</p>
<p>"My uncle replied, with some dignity, that he should certainly never ask me to come to Rose Hill again, or even allow me to do so, and thus he left me.</p>
<p>"But we did not either of us keep our words. Circumstances controlled us. I stayed another year at school, then I got a letter from my uncle, written in a faint and feeble hand, and asking me to return with the end of that school term and spend with him at Rose Hill the last Christmas he would ever see on earth, for that he was on his death-bed!</p>
<p>"On reading this letter, every line of which revealed the dying hand, my long-cherished resentment melted away like snow under the sun, and I wrote back, begging him to forgive my undutiful conduct to him; expressing the greatest sorrow for his illness; assuring him of my devoted love and gratitude for all his patient goodness to me, and promising to return to him at once, and never leave him as long as he would permit me to stay with him.</p>
<p>"I sent off this letter, and as soon as the school broke up for the Christmas holidays I hurried off to Rose Hill.</p>
<p>"I found my poor uncle much nearer death than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>"I found also in the family three members that I had not left there--the infant heir, now aged about thirteen months, and Lavinia and Malvina Mattox, the two daughters of Mrs. Campbell's first marriage.</p>
<p>"I found, also, an entirely new set of servants, from the butler and the housekeeper down to the youngest maid. All these had been engaged by the new mistress, and were devoted to her.</p>
<p>"The young heir was the idol of the whole household. The two stepdaughters of my uncle were the recognized young ladies of the family, but with a difference: Lavinia, the eldest girl, aged seventeen, was a youthful image of her mother--a black-eyed, golden-haired blonde--and she was always elegantly dressed, and affectionately caressed.</p>
<p>"Malvina, the younger girl, aged about fifteen, was very
<pb n="17 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

plain, having a pale, sallow face, dull, flaxen hair, dim, blue eyes, and a fragile figure, with one shoulder a little higher than the other. She had, also, a very feeble mind, and a very uncertain temper. She was dressed shabbily, and snubbed constantly. For all these reasons I became at once much interested in the poor girl.</p>
<p>"The new Mrs. Campbell was very devoted in her attentions to her dying husband. She was, also, very sweet in her manner. It was her cue to be so, and, therefore, I did not appreciate her superficial amiability.</p>
<p>"I was my uncle's constant companion. It was his wish that I should remain in his room and sit by his bed as much as possible.</p>
<p>"He assured me that he had never ceased to love me as a daughter, and that I was well provided for by his will, and he hoped, he said, that I would try to get on with my new aunt, who was really very amiable, and desired to make me happy.</p>
<p>"I could not contradict or oppose my dying uncle. I promised all he wished, and I even treated Mrs. Campbell decently in his presence for his sake.</p>
<p>"My poor uncle lingered a few weeks longer, and then died, with my hand clasped in his own.</p>
<p>"After my uncle's funeral his will was read. He had made ample provision for me, but had constituted his widow the guardian of my person and the trustee of my property.</p>
<p>"Those were bitter pills!</p>
<p>"And, ah! from that day how much changed for the worse my life became!</p>
<p>"Mrs. Campbell threw off her mask forever!</p>
<p>"She no longer affected any kindness of feeling or conduct toward me. I, who had been brought up in the house as the heiress presumptive of the estate, and treated with the tenderest affection by the master and mistress, and with the highest respect by all the servants of the establishment, was now made to feel as if I were a poor dependent on the bounty of a widow, and a barely tolerated intruder in the home of my ancestors. I was treated with contempt by the new mistress, and with insolence by the new servants, who were her creatures.</p>
<p>"My own beautiful suite of apartments, consisting of
<pb n="18 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

boudoir, bedchamber and dressing room, was taken from me and given to Miss Lavinia Mattox, and I was put in a small apartment in the attic, with the poor, sickly, half-witted Malvina for a roommate, and even for a bedfellow. And I was ordered to watch over her and take care of her, for it was not safe either to herself or to others that she should be left unguarded.</p>
<p>"I told you that at first view this girl had excited my compassion, but when I came to know her more thoroughly she inspired me with fear and dislike. She was not quite an idiot, but she was sly, cruel and vindictive, as idiots often are. She was cowardly, also, and secretive to a degree I have never seen equaled.</p>
<p>"She saw that I, equally with herself, was a butt for the ill usage of the household, and she divined that, equally with herself, I resented the bitter injustice.</p>
<p>"She confided to me, in secret, her hatred of the whole family, and of her mother most of all.</p>
<p>"This shocked me so much that I felt compelled to tell her how wicked it was in her to hate her own mother.</p>
<p>"Then she laughed in my face, and told me that she gave hate for hate, that her mother was ashamed of her, and would like to have her dead and out of the way, and she knew it!</p>
<p>"Yet it was only to me this unfortunate girl confided her real feelings. She had inherited her mother's powers of dissimulation, and she openly fawned upon the relatives whom she secretly hated.</p>
<p>"This creature had, among her other infirmities, the troublesome and dangerous habit of sleep-walking.</p>
<p>"Now, though I feared and disliked her, yet I pitied her, and I was often anxious lest she should come to harm during her fits of somnambulism; and whenever I awoke in the night and missed her from my side I always rose, lighted a candle, and went in search of her, usually finding her loitering aimlessly about the upper corridors of the house, when I would gently awake her and lead her back to her bed.</p>
<p>"We two were almost inseparable companions; and we were so, not of choice, but of necessity. For such was the will of Mrs. Campbell. We slept together in the little attic
<pb n="19 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

room, and we ate together at the second table. We were not allowed to sit down with the family at the first.</p>
<p>"But the catastrophe was approaching.</p>
<p>"It happened one long, dreary, drizzling season in mid-winter that Mrs. Campbell and Miss Mattox both lost their spirits and their tempers; nothing could please them, and they tormented each other.</p>
<p>"It was during this season that one day, in a climax of insolence, Mrs. Campbell, who had been out walking in the wet park, sent for me to her room, and ordered me to take off her muddy boots.</p>
<p>'Of course, I flatly refused to do so, telling her that it was the duty of her maid to perform that service.</p>
<p>"A disgraceful scene ensued, such as I cannot even recount here, but will merely say that she finished by declaring that she would use her power, as my guardian, to punish and degrade me; and that the very next day she would give me a mistress, by binding me out to a tailoress, to learn the trade, even if she had to pay a high premium with me.</p>
<p>"I flung myself out of her presence in a fury of passion, and used the wild, mad words that have since been brought up against me on my trial.</p>
<p>"My violent excitement continued so long that one of the maids carried word to the housekeeper, who came to me and brought a sedative draught, and coaxed me to go to bed.</p>
<p>"I did so, and the last that I remember of that maddening day is that I fell asleep in the arms of Malvina Mattox, who had undressed herself and lain down beside me to try to console me.</p>
<p>"Poor creature! I was the only one in the house whom she did not hate, and whom, perhaps, she even loved a little.</p>
<p>"The reaction from the extreme excitement and the influence of the sedative combined to cause me to sleep long and deeply.</p>
<p>"I was aroused in the morning by the tremendous confusion that rolled through the house from cellar to attic. I was still folded in the arms of Malvina, as if neither of us had moved during the night.</p>
<p>"It was one of the housemaids who had burst into the
<pb n="20 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

room, with her eyes staring and her dress in disorder, and with the news that the infant heir was missing from his crib in the nursery, and could not be found anywhere, and that the mistress was beside herself with grief and terror. And did we know anything about it, she inquired, or had we seen anything of the dear little master?</p>
<p>"We were both too much startled by the rude awakening to understand the full force of what was said; but I answered that we had seen nothing of the child since the preceding day; while Malvina, with the most stolid indifference, yawned, turned over, and closed her eyes as if to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>"I arose at once; for, notwithstanding my hatred of the mother, I had a really tender love for the poor baby, who was an affectionate and winsome little laddie.</p>
<p>"You, my dear friend, as well as the public, know all the hideous details of the domestic tragedy that followed. I need not repeat them here.</p>
<p>"I think I was suspected from the very first, though this suspicion never got into the papers.</p>
<p>"It was not, however, until the remains of the poor, dear baby were discovered at the bottom the dry well that I was openly accused.</p>
<p>"And to my intense amazement, the first witness against me at the coroner's inquest was my half-witted roommate, Malvina Mattox, in whose arms I had slept the whole night of the murder.</p>
<p>"Amid tears and sobs that seemed to prove her reluctance to tell the story, which was dragged from her by questions, she testified that about three o'clock on the night, or rather on the morning of the murder, I arose from our bed, drew the key from our chamber door, and taking it with me, left the room and went downstairs; that I was absent about an hour, and returned to the chamber a few minutes after the clock in the tower struck four.</p>
<p>"This testimony, false and incomprehensible as it was to me, was the first link in that fearful chain of circumstantial evidence which was forged for my destruction.</p>
<p>"You have seen how link after link was found and fitted until the whole fatal sequence was complete!</p>
<p>"The coroner's jury brought in a verdict in accordance with the evidence, and I was committed to prison on the
<pb n="21 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

charge of having murdered my infant cousin, there to await the action of the grand jury.</p>
<p>"That first night in my lonely cell I lay too stunned for thought or feeling. I seemed to have not a friend in the world, for no one came near me but the prison officials.</p>
<p>"But the next day, when the turnkey unlocked my door, and the bright morning sun streamed into my cell, you entered with that light, a fitting halo for the benignant face that shone upon me there.</p>
<p>"You sat down on the cot beside me, and took my hand, and told me that you were Theobald Elfinstar, of Thorncliff, my grandfather and my mother's father, and that you had come to help me, and, if possible, to save me.</p>
<p>"I had never seen your face before! I had never heard your name before! I had never even known of your existence before! Nor of the bitter feud--most bitter on the part of the Campbells--which had kept my father's and my mother's people apart, and had hidden from me the knowledge of the Elfinstars.</p>
<p>"But I loved you from that moment with a. love that filled my whole soul.</p>
<p>"You came to me like an angel from heaven. You told me that in face and form, in voice and manner, I was the counterpart of what my mother--your own, only child--had been at the time when young Duncan Campbell fell in love with her, against the will of his whole family.</p>
<p>"You believed my unsupported declaration of innocence--you said it was impossible that I could ever have imagined, much less perpetrated, such a crime.</p>
<p>"You said that you felt perfectly sure of my innocence, and would move earth and heaven, if possible, to prove it.</p>
<p>"And, oh! my dearest dear, you kept your word!</p>
<p>"You have spent a fortune on my defense, and, though you could not secure my acquittal in the face of the tremendous falsehood of that circumstantial evidence which has convicted me, yet you have paved the way to a commutation of my sentence, and you say that if I am spared from death and sent for life to the penal colonies, you will spend another fortune to go out there and make me a home!</p>
<p>"Was ever human love like yours?</p>
<p>"I know not what the end may be; but, if it should be
<pb n="22 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

death, it is due to you, dearest dear, that I should leave this record of the truth behind me.</p>
<p>"And whatever my fate may be, in living or dying, oh, most beloved, my heart is bound to you by the strongest bonds of love and gratitude and veneration. I have done, and I sign the name that never was sullied by a sinful charge--the name that you say you will give me when we shall have passed through this <hi rend="italic">via crucis</hi> and reached some home of peace--my angel mother's--your angel daughter's name,              SERAPH ELFINSTAR."</p>
<p>"She is innocent!" exclaimed Hamilton Gower, when he had finished this manuscript. "My martyred love is innocent! But she is none the less lost to the world, and to me, unless I can prove her to be so! I will henceforth devote my whole life and fortune, if necessary, to the one sacred object of the vindication of her name and fame!"
CHAPTER III"AS A SPIRIT"
<p>"YES! here and now do I pledge my life and fortune and 'sacred honor' to this most sacred cause!" earnestly repeated Hamilton Gower, as he once more lifted the manuscript of Seraph Elfinstar from the sofa table on which he had laid it.</p>
<p>There were a few supplementary pages added to the end. They were dated on the morning of that day, and were as follows:</p>
<p>"You will see by the foregoing narrative, my friend, that it was written in those dark days that immediately followed the conviction of the writer.</p>
<p>"It is scarcely necessary to add now that my dear grandfather, by almost superhuman efforts, succeeded in procuring a commutation of the death penalty to that of transportation for life to these penal colonies.</p>
<p>"He did all that man could do to ameliorate my condition in the prison where I was confined while waiting for
<pb n="23 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

the departure of the convict transport ship in which Iwas to sail.</p>
<p>"He sent confidential agents in advance to select a site and begin the building of a home here.</p>
<p>"He let his own patrimonial home and bought and shipped furniture, books, pictures, statuary and all that was required to fit up and embellish a comfortable and refined home.</p>
<p>"He saw me every day, and kept up my spirits by telling me the progress that he had made in his preparations for emigration, and picturing the quiet, peaceful haven we should reach after these storms, and the harmonious life we two should lead in that far-off island of the southern sea--which, though some parts of it had been given over to demons and their drivers, was yet, in the beauty and sublimity of its scenery and the salubrity and delightfulness of its climate, a paradise fit for the dwelling place of angels and good spirits.</p>
<p>"And, meanwhile, so diligently did he work, that by the time the prison ship was ready to sail his own arrangements were all completed.</p>
<p>"He saw me off. He commended me to the care of the ship's captain, and he did all the 'regulations' would permit him to do to soften for me the hardships of that voyage in the convict ship. He urged me to keep up my courage, to pray when my heart failed, and to believe that he would be at Hobart Town ready to receive me, to take me at once out of the penal station, in the only way he could, as his 'assigned servant,' nominally, but really as his dear and cherished daughter. And so he blessed me and bade me good-by an hour before the ship sailed.</p>
<p>"I do not wish to speak of that sad voyage. The convict transport ships are notorious for being the worst in the service, and that in which I sailed was old, slow and unseaworthy. Some unfortunate Irish patriots, whose only crime had been love of national liberty, and whose death sentence had, like mine, been commuted to transportation to the penal colonies for life, went over in the same ship.</p>
<p>"I have heard that they were penned with the worst of the convicts, and suffered unimaginable tortures; but I never saw one of them; for, by the intercession of my
<pb n="24 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

uncle, the influence of the chaplain, the fact that I was the only female prisoner on board, and, I think, through the pity of the officers and their wives for my childish and harmless personality, I was treated with great kindness. I was taken out of the convict quarters of the ship and appointed to assist the stewardess in waiting on the officers' wives.</p>
<p>"When we reached Hobart Town, my dear grandfather stood upon the dock.</p>
<p>"I see him now as I saw him then--his tall, spare figure clothed in black, with a white necktie, his venerable head bare, his long, white hair waving in the wind, his broad-brimmed black hat held in his hand.</p>
<p>"I was allowed to land before the band of convicts did. The chaplain and one other detailed officer were my custodians.</p>
<p>"When we stepped on the wharf my grandfather me and took me in his arms and warmly embraced me.</p>
<p>"He had a carriage waiting. We four--my grandfather, the chaplain, the sergeant and myself--entered it, and were driven immediately to the residency, and ushered into the presence of the superintendent of convicts.</p>
<p>"There the necessary forms were gone through and the documents signed, and Margaret Campbell, life prisoner of the crown, was transferred to the guardianship of Theobald Elfinstar, Esq., as his 'assigned servant.'</p>
<p>"The chaplain and the sergeant then left us, and my grandfather put me in the carriage and directed the coachman to drive to the Royal Victoria.</p>
<p>"While we were on our way he opened a bundle, in which there was a large, handsome cloak, which he wrapped about me to hide my prison garb. Next he took from a box a hat and veil, which he gave me to put on my head.</p>
<p>"Then he told me that he had sailed from London two weeks after I did, and yet he had reached Hobart Town a month before I arrived, and had been busily engaged in overseeing the completion of our house, which was now habitable, if not finished.</p>
<p>"When the hack drew up before the Royal Victoria, my grandfather got out, paid the hackman first of all to get rid of him at once, and then hurried me, closely veiled as
<pb n="25 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

I was, into a private suite of apartments and rang and ordered breakfast.</p>
<p>"When we were alone he said to me:</p>
<p>"'Go into the adjoining room, my dear, where you will find clothing suitable for a young gentlewoman. Dress yourself in it. Then make up your present garb into a parcel. We will throw it away when we get out of town, as we will throw away the name of Margaret Campbell forever! You are no longer a Campbell, my dear! You are an Elfinstar in name as you certainly are in face. And you are not my grandchild, but you are my daughter, my dear Seraph, restored to me again. Go make your toilet, Seraph Elfinstar. You are now all my own; for I have plucked you out of the fire.'</p>
<p>"Was ever love like this? I asked myself again. I threw myself into his arms and burst into a flood of tears, and wept and kissed and embraced him until he gently led me to the door of my chamber and put me through it with a repetition of his words:</p>
<p>"'Go and make your toilet, Seraph Elfinstar.'</p>
<p>"I went in and closed the door behind me, and found myself in a clean, spacious, comfortable apartment, that seemed to me--after my prison and ship experiences of the last seven months--to combine every imaginable luxury--the greatest of which was the bathroom.</p>
<p>"I took a bath, and dressed myself in the black silk suit that had been provided for me, and added the little white linen collar and cuffs, and the blue silk necktie that came with it. Nothing had been forgotten, not even the white linen pocket handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>"I took one and passed into the parlor, where the table was already set and my grandfather was waiting for me.</p>
<p>"'Now, be at perfect peace, my love,' he said as we sat down to the table. 'No one in this house knows anything about you. The past is past. In a few minutes I expect my faithful servant, Jonas Stackpole, here with our private carriage, which he is to bring to meet his master and his master's daughter, who is just arrived from the old country.'</p>
<p>"I assured my grandfather that I was at perfect peace. Every state is relative to other states. After my terrible peril and suffering, and the intermediate sea voyage, sad
<pb n="26 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

enough, but ameliorated by kindness and by hope, I felt I had now reached a fair haven of rest. I was in a state of calm delight.</p>
<p>"My grandfather recognized this, and smiled with benignant pleasure.</p>
<p>"After breakfast he led me, closely veiled, out to the carriage, which was waiting for us before the door.</p>
<p>"The tallest, gauntest and reddest man I ever saw was seated on the box. He got down, touched his hat and opened the door for us.</p>
<p>"My grandfather put me in, followed me, and we were soon bowling along the New Town Road on our way to the Hermitage.</p>
<p>"How well I remember that delicious ride! After my long, long confinement, and longer sea voyage, that ride was life and joy to me; deep, calm joy, for I was not yet capable of jubilant exultation.</p>
<p>"But on that glorious morning the sun, which shone, flooding the azure heavens and the green earth, the waving forests, the undulating hills, the distant, towering mountains, whose opal-hued tips blended with the golden and ruby-tinted clouds along the horizon--the exhilarating fresh air, and even the rapid motion of our carriage, all combined to give me delight.</p>
<p>"After a few hours of this delicious drive we entered upon a very rough, new road leading into the wilderness of jagged rocks and thorny trees that surrounded the base of Mount Wellington, like the enchanted, impenetrable thicket of the fairy tale.</p>
"'I had this road opened, but it is not yet completed,' said my grandfather, as the carriage was stopped for a moment, while Jonas Stackpole got down from his boxand went to the horses' heads to lead them.</p>
<p>"In this manner we went on for a mile or two, winding up the mountain, until we came to a place beyond which we could go no farther in the carriage.</p>
<p>"Here several rude-looking men in yellow jackets were at work on the extension of the road, and they stopped work, leaning on their picks and shovels to gaze at us.</p>
<p>"Here, also, was a rough building of boards, for temporary use as stable, carriage and tool shed.</p>
<p>"We left the carriage and mounted saddled horses, that
<pb n="27 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

were waiting for us, and so we ascended by a bridle path that wound up the mountain, until we reached the plateau where stands the Hermitage, with which you are now so familiar.</p>
<p>"It was not then complete. The grounds were still half wilderness, and only the rooms on one side of the hall had been finished.</p>
<p>"But when the horses stopped at the main entrance the servants were all there waiting for us.</p>
<p>"My grandfather helped me to dismount, and led me up the stairs, saying to the domestics:</p>
<p>"'This young lady is my daughter, and your mistress.'</p>
<p>"The women courtesied and the men touched their hats as we passed by them and entered the house.</p>
<p>"My grandfather called a rosy-faced young girl to us, and said:</p>
<p>"'This is Jones, your lady's maid, my dear. Now, Jones, show your mistress to her own apartments. My dear, I ordered dinner at six.'</p>
<p>"I followed my new maid upstairs, and to an elegant suite of apartments that had been especially fitted up for me, and that outshone every place I had ever seen before in splendor and luxury.</p>
<p>"Such was my reception at the Mountain Hermitage.</p>
<p>"No one in the house knew any better than that I was Miss Elfinstar, the daughter of their master.</p>
<p>"They had never been in any manner interested in Margaret Campbell, and most likely they had never heard of her or of her imputed crime; or, if they did, they had passed it over and forgotten it in the multitude of more recent, if not more sensational, newspaper items.</p>
<p>"My life at the Mountain Hermitage has been calmly happy.</p>
<p>"My grandfather goes down to the residency once a month to make reports of his 'assigned servant,' Margaret.Campbell, life prisoner of the crown, and his reports are always so satisfactory as to the conduct of the girl that there are faint, distant hopes that he may obtain for her a conditional pardon, but never the slightest possibility that she will be allowed to return to her native country.</p>
<p>"Now you know why I may not ever marry.
<pb n="28 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"Go home to England, and take with you my life-long gratitude and affection.</p>
<p>"I do not ask you to forget me, but to remember me as one who has passed away from this earth. Think of me only as a spirit, and of the Mountain Hermitage as a home of the spirit world which you have seen in a dream. Goodby. God bless you!"</p>
<p>"Think of her 'only as a spirit, and the Mountain Hermitage as a home of the spirit world seen in a dream!'" said Hamilton Gower to himself, as he folded the manuscript. "I shall do nothing of the sort! I have flesh and blood myself, and so has she, and we have half a century of material life on this planet yet to endure! No; it is a quixotic adventure to undertake, but I will do it! I will vindicate her fame, and restore her to the world!"</p>
<p>He fell into deeper thought.</p>
<p>"Let me see what I have to do: It is now March-the first day of March, really. In six months it will be the first of September--my birthday--when I shall be of age. Why--I have not got more than time to rally my witnesses and return to England to claim my inheritance!</p>
<p>"Ha! ha! ha! What an unpleasant shock my appearance will be to the worthy Mr. Lewis Manton, who stepped into my shoes, assumed my rank, and married my sweetheart! And what a sensation in the quiet village of Hawkeville! Ah!</p>
<p>"But I must look after my witnesses. To be sure, it would never do for me to go to Hawkewood and claim my rights unsupported by witnesses! The excellent Mr. Manton is quite capable of disputing my identity.</p>
<p>"Let me see. Delaplaine and Gow must accompany me to Hawkewood, or meet me there. They both promised to meet me at the Hall on the first of the next September. But that promise was given eighteen months ago, and may have been forgotten--at least by Delaplaine--for it is not likely to be so by Gow, from whom I parted only a few months ago.</p>
<p>"However, I must write to both. Gow, I know, is still at Dead Maiden's Brook. But where is Delaplaine-the dandy!--where is he? Ah! In the hair-dressing line of
<pb n="29 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

business in the Rue du Rivoli, Paris; but I have lost my memorandum and forgotten the number.</p>
<p>"But a letter will find the fellow, no doubt. I must write to him at once. The <hi rend="italic">Norfolk</hi> is expected to touch here on her return voyage from Melbourne to London, to-day or to-morrow. I wish I were ready to return by the <hi rend="italic">Norfolk</hi>; but I am not. I must see Seraph Elfinstar again, and have a final understanding with her. And I must notify Ham Gow. He must return with me by the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> a month hence."</p>
<p>As Mr. Hamilton Gower formed this resolution he went to his valise, unstrapped it, and took from it his writing case, which he laid upon the table, opened and arranged.</p>
<p>Then he sat down and wrote two letters. The first was directed as follows:</p>
<p>M. HENRI DELAPLAINE, Barbie&egrave;r et Coiffeur, Rue du Rivoli, Paris, France.</p>
<p>The second one was addressed to:</p>
<p>MR. DUPLICATE HAWKE, Gold Diggings, Dead Maiden Brook, Via Melbourne, Victoria.</p>
<p>Having sealed these letters, he put them in his pocket, took his hat, and went out to post them.</p>
<p>This was Hamilton Gower's first walk through Hobart Town.</p>
<p>When he had first arrived in the city that morning he had been too deeply absorbed by the mystery of Seraph Elfinstar, and his curiosity and anxiety to read her manuscript and solve the enigma of her life in the wilderness, to feel the slightest interest in his surroundings.</p>
<p>Now, however, he stepped out upon the clean and well-kept street, flanked by its neat and tasteful dwellings, with the bright, blue waters of the Derwent flashing in the morning sunlight on his right, and the vivid, green-wooded hills, and the distant cloud-capped opal mountains on his left, his mind was penetrated and exhilarated by the beauty
<pb n="30 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

and brilliancy of nature surrounding this quaint little city of the Antipodes.</p>
<p>He did not know the way to the post office, but he meant to ask the first man he should meet.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Gower. How do you do?"</p>
<p>This salutation came from Dr. Briggs, who suddenly joined him.</p>
<p>"Ah! good-morning, doctor. I am glad to meet you," returned the young man cordially.</p>
<p>"Fine morning. Glorious weather, this!"</p>
<p>"It is, indeed."</p>
<p>"When did you reach town?"</p>
<p>"Only this morning."</p>
<p>"I hope you left our friends at the Hermitage well?"</p>
<p>"Quite so."</p>
<p>"By George! a strange household, that!" remarked the doctor, as the two gentlemen walked on together.</p>
<p>Hamilton Gower said nothing.</p>
<p>"A very strange household," continued Briggs. "The idea of a man of his age coming out to this colony and spending a mine of money to build a palace on a mountain! Why, sir, the cost of building that house on Mount Wellington was at least ten times what it would have been to have built it on the banks of the Derwent, or on those of Sullivan's Cove, where the villas of our wealthiest colonists are located! Why, sir, the engineering of that mountain road leading up to the house cost a fortune, cheap as convict labor is!"</p>
<p>"I have no doubt of it," said Mr. Hamilton Gower, by way of saying something.</p>
<p>"Do you know what people say about it?" inquired the surgeon, looking up suddenly.</p>
<p>"No," replied Mr. Gower uneasily, for he feared that some suspicion or even knowledge of the identity of Margaret Campbell, the convict servant, and of Seraph Elfinstar, the daughter of the master of the Mountain Hermitage, had got abroad.</p>
<p>"They say that no man but a man whose eccentricities had reached the verge of insanity would have selected such a site for a home!" explained the doctor.</p>
<p>"Yet it is a beautiful home," replied Mr. Gower, with
<pb n="31 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

a sense of relief in discovering that no knowledge or suspicion of the truth had crept out.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, a beautiful home in the wilderness; but no society, or possibility of society," growled the doctor.</p>
<p>"I do not think he wants society," ventured Mr. Gower.</p>
<p>"Maybe he does not; but the young lady, sir, his daughter. Do you not suppose that it is natural she should want society?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, she may marry some day, and then she will get it."</p>
<p>"Marry? By Jove! I should like to know whom she could be likely to marry up there, unless, indeed--oh!" suddenly exclaimed the doctor, stopping short and staring at the young man by his side.</p>
<p>"Or, at least," said the latter with an embarrassed smile, "the old gentleman, who is turned three score and ten, may die very soon--must die before very long, and then his daughter will be at liberty to leave the Hermitage. She will not grudge a few years of her early youth to him."</p>
<p>"A few years, quotha ? Why, if the man has only turned seventy, he may live ten, twenty, or even thirty years longer, until the young girl shall grow into an old woman. Which way are you going?" suddenly inquired the doctor, as they came to a crossing.</p>
<p>"To mail letters; but, really, I do not know but that I am going away from the post office! I meant to inquire, but your conversation interested me so much that I forgot to do so," replied the young man.</p>
<p>"Well, I am going there myself. It is around this corner."</p>
<p>The two gentlemen turned and walked to the post office together, mailed their letters and came out.</p>
<p>"Which way now?" inquired the doctor.</p>
<p>"Well, I hardly know where to go, or what to do with myself to-day," replied the young man frankly</p>
<p>"Quite so, and so much the better. Come home with me to a bachelor's early dinner, and afterward I will take you around and show you the town--the government offices, military barracks, convicts' barracks, county jail, female house of correction, prisoners' hospital--such is the enlivening program! Oh, I assure you, life at Hobart
<pb n="32 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

Town is a criminal drama and a penal panorama! You'll come?"</p>
<p>"Thank you! Willingly," replied the young man.</p>
<p>They turned into Macquarrie Street, the surgeon leading the way.</p>
<p>"Hello!" he exclaimed, "whom have we got here?"</p>
CHAPTER IV AN EMBARRASSING ENCOUNTER
<p>A SLENDER young girl, dressed in black, was flying to meet them--a delicate, thin young girl, with a fair, thin face, large, light blue eyes, and pale, yellow hair. Her colorless countenance was radiant with surprise and delight as she flew on toward them, and--regardless of the presence of a third person--threw herself, sobbing for joy, into the arms of the astonished and horrified Mr. Hamilton Gower, and clung tightly around his neck.</p>
<p>"My good girl! my good girl!" remonstrated the young man, while the surgeon of convicts stood and laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Ham! Oh, my darling Ham! Do I you at last!" cried the young woman, hugging for dear life.</p>
<p>"But, my good girl! Really, now, you know! Indeed now! Really, now!" cried Mr. Hamilton Gower, blushing furiously and trying gently to release himself from this overpowering and embarrassing embrace.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ham! Precious, precious love! I have come so far to see you! I have sailed so many thousands upon thousands of miles across the ocean, and was seasick, and got the quinsy among the icebergs, and was scared almost to death when Neptune came on board crossing the equator, you know--though he was nobody but the bo's'n, after all! And when I got here and couldn't find you--oh, Ham! But it is all over now, Ham, my darling! And I am so happy! so happy!" she exclaimed, with another bear's hug of her slender arms, to which excitement had lent unnatural strength.</p>
<p>"But, young woman! you are--you are--this is--this
<pb n="33 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

is--" cried Mr. Hamilton Gower, crimson with confusion, as he tried to unwind the clinging arms from about his neck, while the doctor stood and laughed silently.</p>
<p>But Lona Pond was deaf and blind to everything except the presence of her supposed betrothed, and she went on with her hysterical exclamations:</p>
<p>"Oh, Ham, dear, I was so disappointed when I first got here! I came with Mrs. Belle Isle, as lady's maid, you know! Mrs. Belle Isle, who was Miss Isoline Irvine, my own young mistress, and she married Lieut. Belle Isle and came out here with him, and brought me to wait on her; but I never would have come, dear Ham, if it had not been for your sake," she added, with a tighter rivet of her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>"Young woman, this is really and truly--" he began; but she went on without hearing him:</p>
<p>"Oh, I was so disappointed and heart-broken when I got here and couldn't find you, and when my mistress told me you must be three or four hundred miles away from me! Oh, Ham! I didn't know that, you see, or maybe I might not have had the courage to come out here ! Lord love you, dear Ham! I always had thought that Sydney and Melbourne and Hobberton, and all these outlandish Bottomy Bay places were close together, just like Hawkeville and Demondike and Bowling Green, and so on, at home in England."</p>
<p>"But see here!--I say! You are--"</p>
<p>But she only squeezed him tighter, and continued:</p>
<p>"Oh, Ham! you'd have pitied me if you'd seen how done for I was when I couldn't find you! Oh, I like to have died! My mistress could tell you! And once, Ham, I saw a convict in the chain gang working on the new road that I took for you--and that almost did for me too! Not that I believed that you had been guilty of any crime, dearest Ham! but, then, I knew that innocent people sometimes get convicted by the courts. And he was the very image of you, dear Ham!" she concluded, with another squeeze.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton Gower found that he could not release himself from those slender, clinging arms without hurting them, and so he ceased to struggle and resigned himself
<pb n="34 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

to the situation, while the surgeon stood laughing silently, and the girl continued her monologue:</p>
<p>"He was an awful man whom I mistook for you! Oh, I beg your pardon for mistaking him for you, dear Ham! But he was the very image of you! I---Why don't you speak to me, Ham? You haven't--you don't seem to be glad to see me!" said Lona Pond, suddenly coming to her lover's irresponsive mood, as she withdrew her arms and looked at him.</p>
<p>He stood before her cold and calm, for he had now recovered his self-possession, notwithstanding the surgeon's irritating, silent laugh.</p>
<p>"No, indeed, you don't seem a bit glad to see me!" said Lona Pond, in mournful resentment.</p>
<p>"Who are you, young woman?" quietly asked Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>"Who am I? Is that the way you speak to me, Ham Gow? Who am I, do you ask? You know very well who I am! I am Leonora Pond! your promised wife! and this is your engagement ring I wear upon my finger! Who am I, indeed! Oh! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh,dear!" she exclaimed, beginning to groan and wring her hands.</p>
<p>"Here is some huge mistake, and I think I understand it," murmured Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>"I should think you might understand it! But the mistake was all mine in thinking you would be faithful, and loving you, loving you in your absence as if you were already my-- Ah, me! Ah, me!" groaned the girl, wringing her hands.</p>
<p>"You are Leonora Pond, you say? Now, then, whom do you take me for?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Whom do I take you for? That is a pretty question to ask me, Ham Gow. I don't take you for the King of France, nor yet for the Emperor of Russia. I take you for Ham Gow, of Hawkeville, as have been engaged to be married to me for three years and more. But Ido suppose you have made your fortune in the gold mines and you are looking higher now! looking to marry a lady!" she added in bitter scorn.</p>
<p>"You take me for Ham Gow--"</p>
<p>"I know you are Ham Gow! What do you mean?" resentfully demanded the girl.</p>
<pb n="35 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

"You are utterly mistaken! My name is Hamilton Gower!"</p>
<p>The girl gazed at the speaker, and burst into a weak, contemptuous laugh, saying:</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed! Ham Gow wasn't a good enough name for the grand gentleman that made his fortune in the gold mines, so you must tack two or three more syllables on to it! Mr. Ham-ilton Gower. But," she said, with a sudden effort at self-assertion, "you needn't be afraid, Mr.Hamilton Gow-er! I do not mean to force myself on you! I'd die sooner than force myself on any man, even if he was my lawful, wedded husband! much less only my engaged one! I would have thrust both my hands into the fire before I would have put them around-before I would have touched you with them, if I had known that you had changed to me! Yes, I would! I would, and you know I would!" she passionately exclaimed, as she suddenly turned and walked away.</p>
<p>"But you are mistaken, my good girl! You are indeed! I am not Ham Gow, but I know who is, and I dare say he is as true as steel to everything he ever promised you! Come back and listen to reason!" said the young man, stepping quickly after her.</p>
<p>She turned fiercely upon him, drew the betrothal ring from her finger and threw it down on the ground, exclaiming:</p>
<p>"You want that back again, I suppose! Take it!" and walked swiftly away.</p>
<p>He stopped and picked up the ring and put it in his vest pocket to keep it from being lost, and then he would have followed her; but the street was no longer private--a groupof officers coming out of the barracks walked slowly down it.</p>
<p>The young man retreated and rejoined the surgeon, who was still noislessly laughing.</p>
<p>"What amuses you so much, I should like to know?" inquired the former gravely.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower!" exclaimed the surgeon, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Do you really think that I knew anything about that young woman?" resentfully demanded the young man.</p>
<pb n="36 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"She thought so " replied. the surgeon, with his silent laugh.</p>
<p>"She was mistaken," said the first speaker.</p>
<p>"Oh, now, come, come! Come, come, my young friend; I am a graybeard and--a physician!"</p>
<p>"What in the deuce has that got to do with it?"</p>
<p>"I know that young men will be young men! I don't expect them to be saints and angels! Mrs. Belle Isle's little maid really is a pretty creature! Only it is a pity--only it is a pity that she should have taken any nonsense you may have talked to her in such dead earnest as to have followed you out here--by Jove!" laughed the surgeon.</p>
<p>"I never saw that girl in the whole course of my life until to-day! I never talked 'nonsense,' as you callit, to any girl at any time! and I never will!" exclaimed Mr. Hamilton Gower, flushing with honest resentment.</p>
<p>"Eh!" cried the surgeon, struck at last by his earnestness, and stopping and staring at him.</p>
<p>"I am serious," said the young man.</p>
<p>"I see you are, and I believe you, of course! but how in the mischief came that young person to make such an absurd mistake?" inquired the doctor.</p>
<p>"She mistook me for another man to whom I bear a wonderful resemblance. I know the man she mistook me for! I have known him from my boyhood. And we came from the same neighborhood, Hawkewood, in Cornwall, England! I could have explained to that young woman--if she would have stopped to hear me-that her lover was probably faithful and that he would be here to answer for himself in about a month from this; but you saw that she would not listen to reason!"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! No! she was too much confirmed in her belief that you were her recreant lover! Very awkward for you! I don't think anything would convince her of the truth but the visible presence of Ham Gow at your side and before her face!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not! Well, the poor girl can have that evidence in a few weeks, if she does not choose to receive any other testimony sooner," said Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>"Here we are at my quarters! Come in," said the doc-
<pb n="37 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

tor, leading the way into a small house adjoining the prisoners' barracks.</p>
<p>About the same hour Mrs. Belle Isle was sitting alone in her parlor, when the door opened and her maid entered and dropped down at her feet in great agitation.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, Lona?" inquired the lady.</p>
<p>"Oh, madam, it is all over! all over!" cried the girl, bursting into tears and weeping wildly.</p>
<p>"What is all over? What do you mean, Lona?"</p>
<p>"Oh, madam, it is all over between me and Ham Gow! He has made his fortune in the gold mines, and he has turned against me! I know just how it is! He is rich and he wants to marry rich! and so he is false to me!" wildly wept the girl.</p>
<p>"I do not believe it, Lona. What makes you think so?" inquired the lady.</p>
<p>"Oh, madam, I would never have believed it of him either, if I had not heard it out of his own lips!"</p>
<p>"Have you seen him, then?" demanded Mrs. Belle Isle, in surprise.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, madam! He is in the colony! He is in the town!"</p>
<p>"Where did you see him?"</p>
<p>"On Macquarrie Road, as I was coming home with the Berlin wool yarn you sent me to buy for you. He was walking with another gentleman. I think it was the surgeon of convicts, and I spoke to him. Oh! I was so overjoyed, so crazy with delight when I saw him, that I'm afraid--I'm afraid I behaved very improper! But he denied that he was Ham Gow, and he pretended that he did not know me! Oh! Oh! Oh, dear me! Oh, dear me!" cried Lona, bursting again into a passion of tears.</p>
<p>"Try to be calm, my poor girl; and try to think now whether you are quite, quite sure that this man was Ham Gow," said her mistress kindly.</p>
<p>"Oh, madam! Oh, madam! as if it was possible for me to be mistaken in my own Ham Gow!" exclaimed the girl. Then dropping her voice, she moaned: "My own Ham Gow! Ah, me! Ah, me! My own Ham Gow no longer! Never again! Never again!"</p>
<p>"You were mistaken once, you remember, Lona, when
<pb n="38 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

you mistook a convict in the chain gang on the public road for your betrothed," said the lady.</p>
<p>'"Oh, my dear ma'am; but that was such a different thing!" said Lona Pond illogically. "That man was a convict, and couldn't have been Ham Gow at all; and this man looks respectable, and certainly is Ham Gow."</p>
<p>"But you thought at the time that Hice was Ham Gow."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am; but Hice wasn't, you know, because it was proved that he wasn't. But this man is. I know he is," replied Lona, with stupid persistency.</p>
<p>"My poor girl, you are probably as much mistaken in this instance as you were in that. You are unsound on the subject of your lover. You have mistaken some other man for Gow. Really, Lona, you must not go about the town laying claim to every man who happens to bear some resemblance to Gow! Consider, child, that Gow would never have denied his own identity, or his knowledge of you. I could never believe that of him."</p>
<p>"Nor could I ever have believed it of him if my own ears had not heard his own lips speak it!" sobbed the girl.</p>
<p>"Mr. Belle Isle shall find out if Gow is in town, if that will satisfy you," said the young matron, who seemed really at a loss how to comfort the "foolish virgin" at her feet.</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am, he is in town, fast enough; there is no doubt about that! But I won't distress you any more with my going on, ma'am. You are very good to me, anyway--much better than I deserve," said Lona at length, rising and wiping her eyes as she left the room.</p>
<p>Later in the day, as Mrs. Belle Isle sat alone in her parlor, an orderly entered with two cards on a waiter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belle Isle took them, and read in succession:</p>
<p>"George Briggs, M.D."</p>
<p>"Mr. Hamilton Gower."/p>
<p>"Show these gentlemen in," said the lady.</p>
<p>The orderly saluted and threw open the door, and Dr. Briggs and Mr. Hamilton Gower entered the room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belle Isle arose to receive them.</p>
<p>"Good-morning, madam! I have taken the liberty of an intimate friend to bring you a visitor--a forlorn young man just arrived, a stranger in the town--Mr. Hamiton Gower--of--Cornwall, England--Mrs. Belle Isle," said the surgeon, presenting his companion in an offhand manner.</p>
<pb n="39 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Gower. Doctor, you have had a pleasant day for your usual walk," said the lady, as the two callers seated themselves, and she resumed her place on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Yes; and a rather amusing adventure--of which more presently. You have been out to-day?"</p>
<p>"No, I have been lazy and remained indoors, and there-fore 'I have lost a day,' as some sage or hero said, long ago, when he had missed doing a good deed," said Mrs. Belle Isle with a smile.</p>
<p>"I have been doing good deeds, then, and have not lost a day! I think I have made two in one! After getting through with my patients, I fell in with Mr. Gower, here, wandering about like the Wandering Jew, and I took him under my protection and have been showing him around our town--into the cheerful and exhilarating jails, hospitals, convict barracks and so on."</p>
<p>"Ah!--and what do you think of it all, Mr. Gower ?" inquired the lady, turning to her younger visitor.</p>
<p>"I think of it, madam," said the young man with a thoughtful smile--"under your ticket-of-leave system--very much as some people think of purgatory, with this difference, that its convicts are quite as likely to sink down into utter perdition as to rise into the comparative heaven of honesty and respectability."</p>
<p>"That is but too true," assented the surgeon. Then addressing his hostess, he said, quite suddenly: "Speaking of convicts, ma'am, you remember that desperate fellow Hice, in whom Mr. Belle Isle showed so much interest at one time?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! It was because--because my maid, poor girl, saw him in the chain gang on the new road, and imagined that she recognized in him an old acquaintance of hers," replied the lady, speaking with some hesitation.</p>
<p>"He afterward bolted, you know."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know; and he threw the whole community of women here in such a state of terror by his outbreak that not one of us would dare to take a walk or ride beyond the limits of the town."</p>
<p>"Ah! he was not half as black as he was painted! He is gone, poor fellow, to render his account to the only just
<pb n="40 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

Judge! Did you hear the particulars of his capture and his death?"</p> 
<p>"No; I only heard that he had been taken and, dangerously wounded, and lately that he had died at the Mountain Hermitage."</p>
<p>"Our young friend here was his captor," said the surgeon, turning with a smile to Mr. Gower.</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed!" exclaimed the lady, glancing at the young man with a new interest.</p>
<p>"Yes! it is rather a queer story altogether. Shall I tell you about it ?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if you please; I should like to hear it."</p>
<p>"That boy, there, is the hero of the adventure, you know--by the way, he is rather in that line of business, I think. He had a notable one this morning; but more about that presently. Now I am going to tell you a moving tale about his rescue of a beautiful young lady from the hands of a brutal ruffian in the wilderness, at the foot of Mount Wellington!"</p>
<p>"Doctor, I beg you to spare me," laughed the young man.</p>
<p>"I am going to do so, my dear fellow! I am going to spare you and to laud you," persisted the surgeon.</p>
<p>And he told the whole story of Hamilton Gower's adventure in the wilderness, including the rescue of Seraph Elfinstar, the capture of John Hice, and all that followed, ending with the recovery of the wounded convict and his assignment, through the intercession of the chaplain, to the private service of the master of the Hermitage, and his subsequent sudden death from congestion of the brain.</p>
<p>"Poor soul! I am glad he had a few weeks of peace at the last, and a quiet death in a Christian house," said Mrs. Belle Isle with a sigh.</p>
<p>"And such was the end of the man your maid raised such a coil about because she took him to be an old neighbor from her native village! But tell me, madam, is this girl rather"--the doctor touched his forehead significantly--"on the subject of this old neighbor of hers?"</p>
<p>"I fear so," admitted the lady.</p>
<p>"Rather given to imagine this, that and the other man to be the old neighbor in question?"</p>
<p>"I think so; but why do you ask?"</p>
<pb n="41 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"Because this morning she met us on Macquarrie Street and suddenly threw herself into the arms of this young man, to his amazement and my entertainment," laughed the doctor.</p>
<p>"How shocking! She told me of it. She took him to be Ham Gow. She still believes him to be so," replied Mrs. Belle Isle.</p>
<p>"Oh, she told you! Well, she made quite a scene. Fortunately, at that time there was not a soul on the street but ourselves--at least there was no one in sight or hearing. Gower could not convince the girl that he was not her own recreant lover, and she overwhelmed him, first with caresses and afterward with reproaches. Finally she left him in bitter anger."</p>
<p>"I know. I am very sorry, Mr. Gower, that you should have been so annoyed," said the lady, turning with a vivid blush toward the young man.</p>
<p>"Oh! I beg you will not disturb yourself, dear madam. The incident was rather comic than otherwise, and as soon as I discovered the precise nature of her misapprehension I could have explained it to her and satisfied her; but she would not stay to listen."</p>
<p>"Flung Ham Gow's engagement ring at the feet of Mr. Gower and fled away in a fury!" added the doctor.</p>
<p>"We could not but feel some compassion for the young woman in the midst of all our amusement, and also some responsibility for my resemblance to her lover, and some obligation to give her satisfaction."</p>
<p>"That's why I dragged him here. He said he should be intruding, but I made him come," put in the doctor.</p>
<p>"And I am very glad to have made your acquaintance, Mr. Gower," added his hostess kindly.</p>
<p>"Thank you, madam. On my own part I am very grateful to the circumstance that gives the privilege and pleasure of knowing you," responded the guest with a bow.</p>
<p>"And what my amiable young friend wishes further to say is this--that he knows this Ham Gow, who is his personal double; that this is not the first, nor the second, nor the third time that they have been mistaken for each other, though let me add, on my own account, one is a gentleman and the other is--not," explained the doctor.</p>
<pb n="42 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

"This Gow, however, was the favorite playmate of my childhood, and the companion of my boyhood. He is the betrothed husband, as I know from his own telling of this girl. He is in Victoria at present, but I expect him here within the month, for we are to return to England in company by the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi>, and I think, from what I know of him, that when he finds his betrothed here he will wish to marry and take her with him. This is just what I wanted to explain to the girl if she had given me an opportunity," concluded Mr. Gower.</p>
<p>"And it would be kind of you, ma'am, to let this poor fool know how the case stands. It would save her from breaking her heart, or cracking her brain, and it might save Mr. Gower from being assaulted or embraced in the public streets," laughed the surgeon.</p>
<p>"I will tell her," said Mrs. Belle Isle.</p>
<p>Then the two gentlemen said good-by and went their way.</p>
CHAPTER V AT THE GOLD DIGGINGS 
<p>DEAD MAIDEN'S BROOK had changed very much since the first great "rush" to its newly discovered gold fields.</p>
<p>Then it was but an extensive, disorderly encampment along the banks of the gully in the deep ravine through which it ran.</p>
<p>Now the scene presented every appearance of a prosperous settlement--a new, strange town such as may only be found in the Australian gold fields--a town of only one street, if street it could be called, where a loosely strung chain of dwelling houses, shops and taverns ran along for miles, on the east and west side of the gully, facing each other across it, and having the mountains at their backs.</p>
<p>These houses presented the most novel and curious aspect, being constructed of the most unusual and various material--some of cedar logs set upright like palisades, some of bark nailed on a framework of wood, and some of canvas-lined green baize or red cloth.</p>
<pb n="43 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>They were nearly all roofed with bark, or canvas, and lighted by one or more glazed windows.</p>
<p>Behind many of these houses were gardens where cabbages and potatoes and other common table vegetables were raised, and tended by the women and children.</p>
<p>Here and there was also a cow to be seen under a shed; but that was a luxury.</p>
<p>And the shafts, windlasses, pans and cradles of the diggers were to be seen everywhere--between the houses, along the banks of the gully, behind the houses, under the mountains, before the houses of the gully, and scattered up and down through the great ravine as far as the eye could reach in any direction.</p>
<p>The two principal hotels were--the "Queen's," on the north end of the east bank, and the "Prince of Wales," at the south end of the west bank. These were good-sized, well constructed frame buildings.</p>
<p>Besides these there were several other smaller and less reputable public houses, and more than a dozen "all sorts" stores, where everything, or a little of everything, was sold, from an ounce of tea to a pound of Epsom salts, and from a straw hat to a canvas tent.</p>
<p>There was also a post office, and a weekly mail from Melbourne.</p>
<p>Our friends, the numerous Joneses, had greatly prospered, some of them still engaged in working out the inexhaustible treasures of their first lucky leads, some engaged in the almost equally lucrative trade of the town, and one, the head of that fortunate tribe, enjoying himself in literally "taking his ease in his inn" as landlord of the Queen's, with a good staff of assistants in his own sons and daughters to take all the hard work off his hands.</p>
<p>Mr. Duplicate Hawke had also prospered in the beginning of his gold digging.</p>
<p>To sum up his fortune briefly, the first nine months had brought him very nearly ten thousand pounds.</p>
<p>But after that his luck declined. His "lead" yielded less and less, until at length it was worked entirely out.</p>
<p>He sunk other shafts, but found little or no gold. He was still persevering, however, under discouragement and a growing homesickness.</p>
<pb n="44 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>He had a little room on the second floor under the roof of his friend, Mr. Jones, the landlord of the Queen's.</p>
<p>There he slept and took breakfast and supper; but he spent his day beside his shaft, where his partner had a hut, and where they took "turn and turn about" working at the windlass, or digging at the bottom; but as yet they had raised nothing from this shaft but "dirt."</p>
<p>One afternoon he returned to his lodgings much earlier, and in a much more despondent mood than usual.</p>
<p>After supper he sat smoking a pipe with the landlord, on a bench in front of the house.</p>
<p>Before them yawned the great, deep gully that formed the bed of the low brook.</p>
<p>Across the gully was the row of cedar post, bark or canvas houses.</p>
<p>At this hour the street was quiet but for an occasional miner sauntering home to his supper.</p>
<p>The young man sighed.</p>
<p>"Give it up, lad!" said the landlord of the Queen's--"give it up! Luck has turned! And when luck has once turned, be it for good or for bad, it seldom or never turns back again! Give it up! Invest your money in some safe business. Take the place of barkeeper here. My boy has a mind to set up for himself, on the 'all sorts' line, and is only waiting for me to get a good substitute before he starts off."</p>
<p>"Want to go home," murmured Mr. Duplicate Hawke, almost unconsciously.</p>
<p>"Oh, you do! What for? You could not invest your capital to one hundredth part of the advantage at home as you can here. Don't you know that?"</p>
<p>"Yes--want to go home," muttered the young man demurely.</p>
<p>"Left a sweetheart there, maybe?"</p>
<p>"Yes--want to go home."</p>
<p>"Well, why in the deuce don't you go, my boy? You are able to afford it now. You must be worth about ten thousand pounds! Go home and marry your sweetheart and bring her out here with you, if you want to become a millionaire, or stay there with her if you decide to content yourself with a modest competency. Do anything rather than stay here and mope, mope, mope, until you
<pb n="45 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

are likely to be going mad instead of going home!" exclaimed Mr. Jones of the Queen's.</p>
<p>"How willingly, how gladly, would I have gone long before this, if it had been possible; but I cannot go," the young man mournfully replied.</p>
<p>"Can't go? I should like to know why; you are rich enough, as I said before."</p>
<p>"But for all that I cannot go back to England," sighed Mr. Duplicate Hawke.</p>
<p>"Whe-e-e-ew! Is that it?" said Jones, with a long whistle and a troubled look.</p>
<p>"No! that is not it!" energetically responded the young man. "It is not what you think! I never committed a crime in all my life! I--I might almost say I never did a wrong act in my life!"</p>
<p>"You can say a great deal more than most sinners, or saints either, for that matter, if you can say that; and really you look as if it might be true," replied the landlord.</p>
<p>"Look here, Mr. Jones, I don't consider myself worthy to be called a Christian! No, I don't, when I read my Bible and see what the life and example of the Divine Founder of Christianity was! But I'll tell you this: when parson was reading over the Commandments at morning service in your parlor last Sunday morning, I couldn't help feeling that I had kept them all 'from my youth up'--except the one about keeping holy the Sabbath day; but I have been loose in that respect--not going to church as I ought to have done. But as to my positive wrongdoing--no, Mr. Jones! no! your first opinion of me was the true one; I am not unworthy of your confidence."</p>
<p>"I know it, lad! I know it! I did but waver one second when you said that you could not go back to England! But why, now, if you will satisfy a good friend--why can you not go back to England?" affectionately inquired the landlord.</p>
<p>"I would tell you, if the secret was only my own, but it is not; however, my exile is not a lifelong one; but I cannot show myself in England, or even in any civilized part of these colonies, before the first of next September," said the young man.</p>
<p>"Ah! I begin to see! You are kept out of the way of
<pb n="46 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

being a witness in some case in which some one doesn't want you to testify."</p>
<p>"No, that is not the case. That would be wrong, and I told you that I had done no wrong."</p>
<p>"Well, then, I give it up."</p>
<p>"And you believe in me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I believe in you, chap! But see here! If it will be safe for you to appear in England on the first of September, you have not more than just time to get there if you start now!"</p>
<p>"I know that, but I cannot go until I hear from a friend of mine who is out here in the colonies. By George! You are so confiding that I feel just as if I ought to give you an inkling of how the case stands!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Duplicate Hawke.</p>
<p>"That is just as you please, lad " heartily responded Mr. Jones, though it was easy to see that he was full of curiosity.</p>
<p>"I will, then! It can do no harm, now and here. I will just give you an idea. Well, you see, there was a young nobleman who was left an orphan in his childhood to the care of a crabbed, narrow-minded, tyrannical old tutor, who made his life a burden that grew heavier and heavier year after year, until the youth got to be about nineteen years of age, and had but two years more of that bondage to bear; but he felt that he could not endure it any longer. So he planned to gather up all his money and jewels, and cut and run for the uttermost parts of the earth, and stay two years, and then return home only when he should be of age and could defy his tutor. That young nobleman is now in these colonies, and he will be of age on the first of next September."</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh, ho! I see! I perceive! I understand!" exclaimed the landlord of the Queen's, beaming radiantly. "You are the young nobleman in question, my lord! I beg your pardon for not recognizing your lordship's dignity at once, as I should have done intuitively if I had not been one of the stupidest of menl!"</p>
<p>Mr. Duplicate Hawke burst into a peal of laughter, and when it had subsided said:</p>
<p>"Mistaken again! Did I not tell you that I had never in my life done a wrong act?"</p>
<pb n="47 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>
<p>"Yes, my lord; your lordship did."</p>
<p>"And was it not very wrong in the young nobleman to run away from his tutor?"</p>
<p>"Ah--hum--ha--I do not know, my lord. Your lordship is the best judge," replied the landlord of the Queen's, in a noncommittal manner.</p>
<p>"Well, then, I judge that it was very wrong in a young nobleman to run away from his tutor; and as I insist that I never did any wrong, consequently I was not the young nobleman who ran away from his tutor."</p>
<p>"I beg your lordship's pardon," said Jones of the Queen's, in some little confusion.</p>
<p>"Nor am I a lordship, either. Come to your wits, my friend, and understand that I am no more nor better than the honest fortune-hunter you have hitherto known me to be."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said the landlord, a little, but a very little, resentfully. "And that being so, what has the young nobleman's tantrums--which I must say are very unbecoming of any young man, not to say a young nobleman--to do with your exile to foreign countries until the first of next September?"</p>
<p>"Only this--that having been in his lordship's confidence, and having been the last person known to be with him before his disappearance, and having a net of circumstantial evidence thrown around me, I was accused of this young nobleman's murder, and if I had not fled for my life I should, doubtless, long ago have been hung for it."</p>
<p>"Whe-e-e-w! Couldn't you have told people that he had run away?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I could have told them that, easy enough, but they would not have believed me, and I could not have proved the fact, and so I should have been hung, all the same. So I thought it best to follow the example of my lord, and cut and run. We are both in the colonies now."</p>
<p>"Seen him since you have been out here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. Do you remember the man we picked up at the other side of the mountain the day before we reached these diggings?"</p>
<p>"And you introduced as your brother?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and I guess I didn't tell a story that time. I
<pb n="48 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

guess he was my brother, by a gypsy marriage; at least I have been told so," laughed Mr. Duplicate Hawke.</p>
<p>"I remember him. And he was the absconding young scamp, was he?"</p>
<p>"He was the absconding young scamp. I say-it was very wrong in a young nobleman to run away from his tutor, was it not?"</p>
<p>"Oh, very wrong! Quite unpardonable! And to get an honest lad like you into such a mess, too! Now, what are you going to do about it?"</p>
<p>"Wait here until I get a letter from him fixing the day of our embarkation for England; for by our latest arrangement we are to return home together--he to claim his inheritance, on his majority; I--who have been in his secrets from the first--to prove his identity in case the man who, since his supposed death, has held his title and estates, should attempt to dispute it. And when I show them the young nobleman alive and well I hope they will stop calling me a murderer, and wanting to hang me."</p>
<p>"But, now, suppose this young lord should not write to you? Suppose something should have happened to him--that he should have perished in the bush, or have been killed by the blacks? What would you do in that case?" inquired Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>"I should have to stay here for the rest of my natural life, I suppose."</p>
<p>"And give up your sweetheart?"</p>
<p>"And give up my sweetheart."</p>
<p>"That would be blamed hard."</p>
<p>"Yes, it would be hard; but I hope it will not happen to me. It is true, I have not heard from my lord for the last two months; but then he was going to Van Dieman's Land, which would account for my getting no letters."</p>
<p>"There'll be a mail in to-night. Perhaps you may get a letter."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I may; but there is no special reason why I should," said the young man in a despondent tone.</p>
<p>But he did get a letter that very evening.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the mail wagon came running into the town, and past the Queen's, on its way to the post office.</p>
<pb n="49 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>In another moment the whole street, and that means the whole town, was alive.</p>
<p>Men, women and children whirled out of the houses on both sides of the gully, and surged up in the rear of the wagon on its way to the post office.</p>
<p>Many of the impatient people did not wait for the opening of the mails, but eagerly questioned the driver.</p>
<p>"Has there been a ship in from the ould country, Mick, boy?" was the question put with but little variation from more than a dozen different persons.</p>
<p>"Ay, sure! The <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> is in, with mails from England and likewise from Hobbyton! My bag be nigh bursting wi' 'em!" was the satisfactory answer that put new life and lightness into the hearts and feet of the anxious crowd.</p>
<p>Mr. Duplicate Hawke and Jones of the Queen were by no means the hindmost in the rush. They pushed their way to the front, though once or twice they were very nearly being forced over the bank and down into the gully.</p>
<p>Being. the most impetuous of the crowd, they were the first to push themselves into the post office, and the first, when the mail was opened, to get their letters.</p>
<p>The landlord of the Queen's hurried home, happy in the possession of a joint letter from his own and his wife's mother, and a bundle of London and Penzance newspapers.</p>
<p>Mr. Duplicate Hawke hastened after him, equally well pleased with the solitary epistle postmarked Hobart Town, and directed in the familiar hand of Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>On reaching the inn he hurried to his little room on the second floor, lighted his tallow candle, placed it in the neck of an empty bottle on his little table, and sat down to read his letter, which was this:</p>
<p>"ROYAL VICTORIA HOTEL, HOBART TOWN,</p>
<p>"March 1, 18-.</p>
<p>"DEAR Gow: If I have not written to you for some time past it has been because I had rambled out of the reach of mail routes.</p>
<p>"I arrived in this city only this morning.</p>
<p>"I write this letter for the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi>, which arrived here yesterday morning from London, and will sail for Melbourne with the first tide to-morrow morning.</p>
<pb n="50 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"I suppose she will remain at Melbourne for a few weeks.</p>
<p>"She will touch here again on her homeward-bound voyage.</p>
<p>"Now, Ham, it is high time that you and I were on our way to England. If you can possibly make your arrangements to do so, I beg that you will leave Melbourne by the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi>, and I will join you on board from this port, and we will return home together.</p>
<p>"If you should be at any pecuniary loss, dear friend, you know that I will make it up to you, as in common justice I should be bound to do; for your company on the voyage home, and your support when I shall present myself as one risen from the dead to claim an inheritance, will be all important and most valuable to me.</p>
<p>"You need not feel the slightest uneasiness in the prospect of presenting yourself here under your real name. You will not be arrested for the murder of the late Earl of Hawkewood. Not--mind you--because it has been discovered that he never was murdered at all, for no such discovery has yet been made; but because an unfortunate convict, one John Hice, being dangerously wounded, and believing himself to be near death, made a full confession of his crimes, acknowledging, among the rest, the murder of the Earl of Hawkewood, which homicide, he said, lay heavier on his soul than all his other sins, though he never meant to kill the earl, but only to strike him a stunning blow in self-defense.</p>
<p>"(I so entirely believed that statement to be true that I afterward asked and obtained the privilege of a private interview with the convict, in which I explained to him that he had never had the opportunity of killing the young earl, either intentionally or otherwise, and that he had only stunned another man with a harder head, when he had intended to stun the earl. My explanation, when I had convinced him of its truth, made the poor wretch positively happy. He is gone now, but not from the effect of his wounds, thank Heaven! However, this is aside from the purport of my letter.)</p>
<p>"The confession of Hice, duly taken. down in writing from his lips, signed, witnessed and attested, is on record, and fully exonerates you from the charge of murder. You
<pb n="51 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

can come to Hobart Town a free man, under your own name.</p>
<p>"Whether I shall assume mine before I reach England I have not yet decided. But I will, for once, indulge myself in the luxury of signing it here as</p>
<p>"Your true friend,           HAWKEWOOD.</p>
<p>"P. S.--I have written to Delaplaine at Paris, to remind him to keep tryst on the first of next September, at Hawke Hall.                      H."</p>
<p>"Well, well, well, well," slowly ruminated Mr. Duplicate Hawke, or Ham Gow, as we may as well call him, now that the ban is taken off from his name. "What a letter! Here is food enough for thought to keep me awake all night. My unknown assailant discovered in a Tasmanian convict! Blest if I did not always believe it to have been that fellow Lewis Manton who tried to murder the earl to succeed to his estates!--I am blest if I didn't!--and now it has turned out to be an ordinary sneak thief that dealt me that stunning blow! Well, his confession is on record, and I am cleared. Ah, I am glad to know that!</p>
<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed with a laugh, as a new aspect of the case struck his sense of humor. "It was I myself who was assassinated and half murdered, and as if that were not 'enough for the monkey,' it was I myself who was charged and all but hanged for that same assassination and supposed murder! Now I wonder if the like of that ever happened to mortal man before!</p>
<p>"Life's a conundrum, and I give it up!</p>
<p>"Well! We will keep the tryst at Hawke Hall on the first of September, and have some fun there! But how about the good Mr. Delaplaine? My lord says that he has written to him to join us at Hawke Hall. Good gracious! Has my lord forgotten that Mr. Delaplaine was accused with me of being an accomplice in his murder, and that therefore the worthy Mr. Delaplaine never could have carried out his purpose of buying that little business? My lord has forgotten that the excellent Mr. Delaplaine must be in hiding somewhere, and unless the valet, or himself, should remember the tryst to keep it at all risks, my lord must, do without his support. Well--I think we can do without it. And now to make glad the heart of my kind
<pb n="52 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

host, who will rejoice with me at this speedy prospect of happiness," said Ham Gow, as he blew out his candle and went downstairs in search of the landlord.</p>
<p>All the quietness that had prevailed throughout the hotel during the day was at an end now. The taproom and the parlor were as full as they could be with the miners, who were drinking, smoking, playing cards, singing songs, reading the newspapers that had come by the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi>, or exchanging private intelligence that had reached them in letters by the same ship.</p>
<p>The landlord was not among them; but the landlord's son, young George Jones, who was tending bar, called out to the newcomer, saying:</p>
<p>"If you wish to see father, Mr. Hawke, he is sitting with mother in her little back parlor, and he will like to see you, I know."</p>
<p>"Thank you, George, we'll find him," replied Ham Gow, as, glad to escape from the noisy scene, he passed through the crowded taproom and public parlor to the little apartment in the rear, to which the landlord retreated when he wished to enjoy a quiet hour with his family.</p>
<p>He found Mr. and Mrs. Jones seated at a small, round table in the middle of the room, with its top covered with letters, pamphlets and newspapers.</p>
<p>The faces of the man and the woman were beaming with happiness.</p>
<p>They both looked up at the same moment, and welcomed him with smiles.</p>
<p>"It is easy to see that you have received good news--so easy that I congratulate you before knowing what it is," said the young man, with a responsive smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, lad; thank you kindly; the very best of news! Draw a chair up to the table here with us, and listen to it. You'd hardly believe it, but the two old lasses are really coming out to us!" exclaimed Mr. Jones, with tears of joy in his honest blue eyes.</p>
<p>"The two old lasses?" repeated Ham Gow in some perplexity, as he made himself comfortable by sitting down and leaning his arms upon the table.</p>
<p>"Oh, ay! Her mother and mine! Our fathers have gone to their rest. Our mothers are widows; but they have always been fast friends, living near each other in
<pb n="53 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

Market Street, Penzance. It was our mothers' close friendship that brought Jane and me together in one of the happiest marriages--though I say it--that ever was made! And now the two old folks are coming out to us to complete our happiness--as why should they not, when they have neither kith nor kin in the old country to keep them there?"</p>
<p>"It must be a great undertaking for them, however," said Ham Gow bluntly.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of an undertaking for them! Lord love you, lad! they are two hale old girls, a trifle rising sixty, and have been at sea the best half of their lives--having both been stewardesses on the coasting steamers until they had saved money enough to set up shop--my mother kept a thread and needle shop, and hers a pastrycook's."</p>
<p>"I am glad that they are coming out to you, then."</p>
<p>"Thank you, lad. So are we. They are coming by the <hi rend="italic">Golden Path</hi>, that will be due here in about a month from this. So, you see, they are on the ocean, and three-quarters through their voyage, even now."</p>
<p>"As near as you can calculate, keeping in mind the great uncertainty of the time made by these sailing ships," put in Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>"Ay, Jenny, and that is true, too. But I declare that you and I must go to Melbourne by the first of the month, and stay there until the ship does come, if we have to stay for months. It would never do for the old lasses to arrive and we not be on hand to meet 'em."</p>
<p>"But the house--the business? Hadn't one of us better stay here to look after things, and the other go to meet the old folks?" suggested Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>"No, Jenny, lass, no! Let our boys and girls run the house for a while, or let it run itself, or let it stand still--I don't care! But your good mother shall not miss seeing you when she first sets foot in this strange land; and I'll be doggoned if my dear old mammy shall miss seeing my face among the foremost on the wharf; so that is settled."</p>
<p>"When will we go?" inquired Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>"A fortnight from this will be time enough for us to start," said Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>And then turning to his guest, he said:</p>
<p>"Now we have been talking so much about our own
<pb n="54 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

affairs that I have forgotten to think about yours, Mr. Hawke. You were anxiously looking for news from Hobby Town. I hope you got it, and that it is good."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I got it, and it is good," answered Ham Gow with a cordial smile.</p>
<p>"And you go back to the old country soon?"</p>
<p>"Yes, as soon as possible. I shall leave this place by the mailwagon that starts at daylight to-morrow morning for Melbourne, and I shall take passage in the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> for London. She will stop at Hobart Town, as usual, and there my friend will join me, and we will go to England together."</p>
<p>"That will be very fine for you and your mate. But it is quite a sudden blow to us. I'm blest, if it wasn't for the thought of having the two old gals over so soon, I'd feel quite knocked over at the loss of you, lad!" said Mr. Jones.</p>
<p>"I do thank you for feeling so much interest in such a vagabond as I am! But I do not think you will lose me altogether. "I think I shall come back here--that is-is--is"</p>
<p>If the 'girl you left behind you' consents to emigrate, eh?" put in the landlord of the Queen's, with a wink.</p>
<p>"Just so," frankly admitted Ham Gow. "If she will come out with me I shall return, and I don't see why she shouldn't do so, for she has really no one belonging to her in the old country except a crabbed stepmother whom she will be glad to get away from. And now, my friends, I must leave you for the present. I have got a great deal to do to-night. I must go back to my claim and make some arrangement with my partner, Traverse, and get my pile and pack my valise."</p>
<p>"I should think you would have a great deal to do to get ready on so short a notice," said Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>"And so I will bid you good-night," added Ham Gow rising.</p>
<p>"We will see you again to-morrow morning," said Mr. Jones kindly, rising and holding out his hand, which Ham Gow took and pressed.</p>
<p>"And you shall have a good, hot, comforting breakfast before you start, be it ever so early," said Mrs. Jones.as
<pb n="55 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

she pushed her plump fingers into the hand of the young man, who clasped them warmly.</p>
<p>"And now get along with you, lad, for the night is passing, and seeing as you have so much to do, it would not be kind in us to keep you," said Mr. Jones, with practical good sense.</p>
<p>Ham Gow laughed and left the room, and quickly made tracks for the claim over which his partner, George Traverse, kept the night watch.</p>
<p>This claim was situated at the base of the mountains, about a mile north of the Queen's Hotel, and there was no other claim very near it.</p>
<p>There was no moon, and the sky was clouded over so that when Ham Gow had left the lighted houses behind him his way was very dark; but the low, distant light in the hut, like a glowworm on the ground, was a beacon to guide his steps.</p>
<p>He found George Traverse seated in the door of the hut, smoking a pipe, and not at all startled by the sudden announcement that his senior partner was going to leave by the mail wagon for Melbourne the next morning; such impulsive departures were too common in the mines.</p>
<p>The arrangements for the dissolution of partnership were of the simplest kind. Ham Gow was to take his clothing and his "pile," and leave George Traverse in possession of the hut, the claim and the tools.</p>
<p>He spent the night with Traverse, who walked back with him to the Queen's the next morning to see him off by the mail wagon.</p>
<p>The landlady of the Queen's kept her promise and had ready the good, hot, comforting breakfast, in which George Traverse joined Ham Gow.</p>
<p>At daybreak the mail wagon was ready to start, and Gow, after taking an affectionate leave of his partner, of the Joneses and of all friends and neighbors who were astir at that early hour, mounted to his seat, and waving a final adieu to all, started for Melbourne.</p>
<p>He reached that city in the highest health and spirits, had time enough there to purchase a comfortable outfit for his long sea voyage, and a week later he sailed in the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> for Hobart Town and London.</p>
<pb n="56 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

CHAPTER VI THE LOVERS
<p>"HAM GOW will answer that letter in person, if I know the fellow " said Mr. Hamilton Gower, as he went home to his hotel that night, after having spent the day in sight-seeing and the evening at the barracks. "In fact, he will have to answer it in person and come with the first mail, that leaves the diggings if he wants to be in time to secure his passage in the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi>. He will be here in two or three weeks, and I must be ready to join him. To-morrow I will go and have an understanding with the Elfinstars,"' he concluded, as he composed himself to sleep.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, in accordance with his resolution, he arose, ordered his horse, took his breakfast in a hurry, threw himself into his saddle and started for the Mountain Hermitage.</p>
<p>It was but seven o'clock when he cantered briskly out upon the New Road, where the chain gang of convicts, in their yellow jackets and ferocious or despondent aspect, were already at work under their drivers and guards.</p>
<p>He rode rapidly past these with sinking spirits, until he got out of sight and hearing of them and into the solitude and freshness of the green and dewy country, where he breathed more freely.</p>
<p>It was but nine o'clock when he reached the base of the mountain and began to wind up it by that wonderful road engineered by Mr. Elfinstar's enterprise and the convict labor.</p>
<p>It was ten o'clock when he reached the plateau on which the beautiful house and grounds of the Mountain Hermitage were situated.</p>
<p>He rode around by the foot of the lowest terrace and up a graded road leading to the stables, where he found old Jonas Stackpole sitting down in his armchair outside the door, smoking a short pipe.</p>
<p>"You didn't expect to see me back so soon, Stackpole, eh?" gayly inquired the young man.</p>
<p>"No, sir; but I am all the happier in having the un-
<pb n="57 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

expected honor," replied the old coachman, taking the pipe from his mouth and rising respectfully.</p>
<p>"I will leave my horse here and walk up to the house," said Mr. Hamilton Gower, as he dismounted and threw the reins to one of the grooms.</p>
<p>"All right, sir! He shall be well looked after," said old Stackpole, touching his forehead.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton Gower walked on toward the house.</p>
<p>As he drew near the upper terrace he saw Seraph Elfinstar at a distance. She was coming from the rear of the cultivated grounds, evidently from the rocky and thorny wilderness infected by noxious weeds and infested with venomous reptiles, that lay at the foot of the precipice, and that she haunted in her hours of morbid despondency and called her Gehenna.</p>
<p>She seemed, as she drew nearer, to be in one of her most despairing moods. Her radiant light hair was all gathered up in a dark net under a dark straw hat. She wore a dark-brown dress and shawl. Her face was very pale, and her eyes were fixed upon the ground as she slowly and languidly approached.</p>
<p>She did not see her lover until they met face to face, and he spoke to her.</p>
<p>"Seraph!"</p>
<p>She started as violently as if she had received a shock.</p>
<p>"You are back, then?" she said in a fainting voice as she looked up at him and leaned against a tree for support.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am here! here to renew my pledge to love only you of all women in the world! to marry only you, if you will be my wife, or--never to marry at all!" he answered, with earnest love and faith expressed in every tone of his eager voice and in every look of his eloquent face.</p>
<p>"And--Margaret Campbell ?" she faltered.</p>
<p>"Was a child-martyr as good and pure as were the St. Agnes and St. Rosalie worshiped of Christians!" warmly replied the young man.</p>
<p>"Ah! no, no, she was not! She did not commit any crime, or break any human law; but she was jealous and vindictive in temper. If she had not been so, don't you see, this fearful chain of circumstantial evidence could never have been woven around her for her destruction," said Seraph mournfully.</p>
<pb n="58 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

"'Jealous and vindictive,' do you call her? A helpless and harmless child, goaded into cries of pain and anger by wrongs that might have maddened older and more self-governed people!" earnestly responded the young man.</p>
<p>"You defend Margaret Campbell now as eloquently as you denounced her--once," said Seraph with a slight smile.</p>
<p>"I know her now. I did not know her then; and I would beg her pardon, at her feet, for the rash misjudgment by which I so greatly wronged her," said the lover reverently.</p>
<p>"Oh, you need not. It was so natural, so inevitable. It was a misjudgment also which you shared with the wisest judges and the sharpest jurors; with the press, and with the public," murmured Seraph.</p>
<p>"By all my hopes of heaven I will make them all change their minds!" eagerly exclaimed the youth.</p>
<p>"Ah! I do not know how you will manage to work that miracle!"</p>
<p>"The truth must prevail, if it has but one earnest advocate! And it shall prevail, for I am such a one! I shall return to England by the next ship. I shall devote all my time, fortune and energies to the vindication of your name!"</p>
<p>"Would you indeed do all that for me?--for me-lost, forlorn, despairing as I am--" Her voice broke down in emotion.</p>
<p>"Yes, all that, and more! for your misfortunes are mine and your unhappiness is mine; in serving you I serve myself. All that man or angel can do for you, I will do!"</p>
<p>"Ah! where can you ever begin? Your enterprise will be--a phantom hunt!"</p>
<p>"No, no! I believe I have a clue!"</p>
<p>"A clue!"</p>
<p>"Yes! I was too anxious in reading the narrative not to be on the lookout for clues, and I believe I have found one."</p>
<p>"You--suspect--some--one?" she inquired in a low, hesitating, almost breathless voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, I suspect some one."</p>
<p>"Whom--whom ?"</p>
<pb n="59 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

"That deformed, half-witted malignant who was your roommate and your accuser."</p>
<p>"Great Heaven!" breathed Seraph, gazing at the speaker in amazement.</p>
<p>"Seraph, is it possible that you never suspected this girl?"</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"And yet you knew that she was half-witted, malicious and a sleepwalker!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>" And you knew that only she, besides yourself, had command of that key of your room, which was also the pass-key to the nursery, and which was on the inside of your locked door on the night or early morning of the child murder!"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"And you never suspected her!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no! I never even thought of her in that terrible light. I should never have deemed it possible that she could have perpetrated such an atrocious crime. I do not believe it now!"</p>
<p>"Who did, then?" significantly inquired the young man. "You did not; that is certain to my mind. And there was but one other who could possibly have done it-that half-witted deformity who was your only companion in the room, and who was your first accuser. I shall follow up this clue. I shall set detectives privately to look up her antecedents and watch her present conduct."</p>
<p>"Oh, do not, do not have another guiltless one accused and punished," pleaded Seraph.</p>
<p>"She shall not be falsely accused or unjustly punished. Even if I should be successful in vindicating you and fastening the guilt where I believe it belongs--on her-still she will not be punished. She is half-witted, and, therefore, legally irresponsible. She would, if convicted, only be sent to the Hanwell Asylum for Criminal Lunatics, where she would be much better off than in her mother's house--judging from your narrative, Seraph; a fate much better than she deserves. By Jove! it will seem like a reward instead of a punishment for her guilt!"</p>
<p>"She is most unfortunate in her bodily deformity and mental derangement," said Seraph.</p>
<pb n="60 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"Why are you so tender in your feelings toward her? She was your first accuser."</p>
<p>"I thought she believed the story that she told me, and wept because she was compelled to tell it."</p>
<p>"She probably wept because she was not altogether an unmitigated devil, and felt the terrible wrong which, in order to shield herself, she was doing to one who had always been kind to her. Seraph, I believe that I have got the right clue, and I shall follow it up. If the girl is innocent, my investigation will not hurt her; if she is guilty, it would vindicate you without really injuring her. Will you let me lead you to the house? You look really faint."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I think we had better go in," assented the young lady, as she took the proffered arm of her lover.</p>
<p>When they reached the entrance they found Mr. Elfinstar sitting in his armchair on the piazza engaged in reading.</p>
<p>"So you are back, young sir!" he said, rising to meet his guest.</p>
<p>"Did you not expect to see me back?" inquired the latter with a smile, as he placed his companion in a seat and took another himself.</p>
<p>"Well, frankly, I did; for I know well the persistence youth in such matters."</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton Gower then spoke earnestly of Margaret Campbell's unjust conviction and cruel fate, and unfolded his own theory of the murder and plans of detecting the guilty and vindicating the innocent.</p>
<p>Mr. Elfinstar was penetrated by the fidelity and devotion of the young advocate and impressed with the plausibility of his opinion. He said but little, however, until Mr. Hamilton Gower, having finished his explanation and declined an invitation to dinner, arose to depart. Then the old gentleman warmly grasped his hand, saying:</p>
<p>"You are an enthusiast in this cause, my dear young friend, but--enthusiasts often succeed."</p>
<pb n="61 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

CHAPTER VII A LOVER' FAITH
<p>MRS. BELLE ISLE was very glad of the power put into her hands to relieve the mental distress of her foolish maid, but not until after breakfast on the morning succeeding the visit of the surgeon and the traveler did she get an opportunity of speaking privately to the girl.</p>
<p>When the lieutenant had gone on some business to the commissariat and the lady sat alone in her parlor, she summoned her maid to her presence.</p>
<p>Lona Pond came in, pale, red-eyed and dejected.</p>
<p>"Sit down; for you look as if you were about to sink through the floor. How silly you are, child, to distress yourself for nothing," said Mrs. Belle Isle kindly.</p>
<p>"For nothing! Oh, ma'am, do you call it nothing, after I have followed him so many thousand miles out to this dreadful country, to have my young man as I was engaged to be married to turn his back on me?" said the girl, bursting into tears at her own words and sinking down on a hassock at her mistress' feet.</p>
<p>"But he has done nothing of the sort, you stupid child!"</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am! but his own words and looks and my own eyes and ears to prove it, ma'am," persisted the girl.</p>
<p>"Look here, Lona! You were equally credulous to the testimony of your own eyes and ears when you mistook the convict, John Hice, for your betrothed, Ham Glow!"</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am, but that was very different."</p>
<p>"Very different, indeed, Lona! for whereas you mistook a chain gang prisoner for Gow on that occasion, you now mistake a gentleman of wealth and position for him!"</p>
<p>"And this time I am right, ma'am! He may be 'a gentleman of wealth and position' now, for aught I know to the contrary. He looks it, and I'll not gainsay that he is! 'Wealth' is sometimes soon won in the gold mines, ma'am, and 'position' always comes with it in these colonies! Yes, and the two together often turn men's heads, and hearts, too, for that matter, as they have turned the giddy head of my wild Ham and set his heart against his
<pb n="62 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

own true girl that crossed the big seas for his sake!" sobbed the girl.</p>
<p>"Oh! what a tiresome idiot you are, Lona!--I cannot help saying it! Now, listen to me and don't speak a word until I get through. The gentleman whom you met and embraced yesterday--"</p>
<p>"Don't throw that up against me, please, ma'am! I'll never do it again!" sniffed Lona.</p>
<p>"I hope and trust and pray that you will not; but I can't feel sure about it," smiled her mistress.</p>
<p>"I'll never, never, never kiss Ham Gow again as long as I live in this world! No, not if it was to save his neck from being stretched or his soul from being burned!"</p>
<p>"Hush! hush! you must not say such shocking words!"</p>
<p>"Not when I have been scorned and cast off by my young man who was engaged to be married to me, and for whose sake I crossed the seas! Beg pardon, ma'am, for speaking so strong in your presence; but I said it and I meant it!"</p>
<p>"Lona, your lover has never scorned you or cast you off--at least, to your knowledge, and you have no right to say that he has! Now, then, listen to me! Did I not tell you not to utter a word until I had finished?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, and I will be silent."</p>
<p>"Very well, then; now keep your promise and attend. The gentleman you seized upon in the street was Mr. Hamilton Gower," began Mrs. Belle Isle.</p>
<p>Lona Pond muttered something under her breath to the effect that she knew that he had added two or three syllables to his honest name since he had made his fortune; but Mrs. Belle Isle took no notice of her interruption, and went on to say:</p>
<p>"He is from Cornwall, and knew this Gow intimately from boyhood."</p>
<p>"I should rather think he did," mumbled Lona.</p>
<p>"It is not the first time, he says, by many that he has been mistaken for Gow and Gow for him."</p>
<p>"Tell that to the horse marines," muttered Lona under her breath.</p>
<p>"What are you saying, child?"</p>
<p>"Nothing much, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Mr. Gower, so far from resenting the mistake you made
<pb n="63 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

in regard to him, actually feels a kindly interest in you raffairs--"</p>
<p>"I thank him for nothing, and wish he would let me and my affairs alone."</p>
<p>"Eh?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Mr. Gower wishes to relieve your mind from doubts and misgivings. He has a very good heart."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, 'a very good heart!'"</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"Not anything particular, ma'am."</p>
<p>"He says that Ham Gow, his own old acquaintance, came out to these colonies about the same time that he himself did--"</p>
<p>"Ah I guess he told the truth there, anyway."</p>
<p>"Lona!"</p>
<p>"I was only thinking something to myself, ma'am."</p>
<p>"They did not come out in the same ship, however."</p>
<p>"Didn't they?"</p>
<p>"But they met quite incidentally on the road of the great rush to some new gold fields that were discovered just before their arrival, and they spent a few weeks together."</p>
<p>"No doubt they have spent a good deal of time together--have Ham Gow and Mr. Ham-ilton Gow-er!"</p>
<p>"Lona, if you continue to interrupt me by such remarks I cannot go on."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Mr. Gower left Gow at Dead Maiden's Brook--for that is the name of the new diggings. Mr. Gower has been traveling since that time, and has constantly corresponded with Gow, who has remained at the diggings, where he has made quite a large fortune already."</p>
<p>Lona gazed at her mistress in silence, seeming no longer to have the slightest inclination to contradict her.</p>
<p>"By a long-understood arrangement Mr. Gower and Ham Gow will return to England together. Mr. Gower has written to Gow to notify him of the time set for sailing. Gow is expected to arrive here by the <hi rend="italic">Labrado</hi>, which will touch here on her voyage to London, when Mr. Gower will take his passage back to England with Gow."</p>
<pb n="64 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"Dear me," said Lona Pond, putting her hand up to her head in a helpless sort of way.</p>
<p>"You will then have an opportunity of seeing the two men together, and knowing 'which is which,' concluded the lady with a smile.</p>
<p>Lona Pond did not answer her, but slowly shook her head, muttering to herself:</p>
<p>"Dear me! dear me! I wonder if I am growing silly?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Belle Isle could not reassure her by saying that she was not going in that way.</p>
<p>"And is it really and truly the case, ma'am, that I have mistaken a gentleman for Ham Gow, after going and mistaking a convict for him, too?" sighed the girl.</p>
<p>"I thought I had convinced you that you had. But when you see the real Ham Gow you will believe the evidence of your own senses."</p>
<p>"No, ma'am, no! I never shall! I never can believe my own eyes and ears and sense again as far as Ham Gow is concerned--never! I am gone daft on that subject, I know!" persisted Lona.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belle Isle thought it very likely that the girl spoke the truth of herself, and said no more.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton Gower became rather a frequent visitor at Lieut. Belle Isle's quarters, where he was always cordially welcomed; but he never encountered again the girl who had so vehemently embraced him, for Lona Pond, convinced at length that she had made a mistake, was so thoroughly ashamed of having kissed the wrong man that she kept carefully out of his sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Gower and Lieut. Belle Isle became great friends; but the former often caught the eyes of the latter fixed on him with a strange and wistful expression.</p>
<p>One evening when he was passing an hour in Mr. Belle Isle's parlor the young lieutenant, being present, suddenly said to him:</p>
<p>"By Jove! it is very strange!"</p>
<p>"What is strange, my dear fellow?" inquired Mr. Gower.</p>
<p>"The likeness."</p>
<p>"Oh! my close resemblance to the estimable Mr. Gow!" laughed the guest.</p>
<p>"No, not at all. I never saw Mr. Gow, to my knowledge, much as I have heard of that gentleman. No; I mean your
<pb n="65 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

likeness to the late unfortunate young Earl of Hawkewood. I knew the very first time I ever saw you that I had seen your face, or one exactly like it, before--somewhere or other."</p>
<p>"Very likely you have," laughed the visitor; "for I have been there or elsewhere--occasionally."</p>
<p>"At first," gravely continued the young lieutenant, "I could not locate the likeness--so to speak--but now I can do so--with the late Earl of Hawkewood."</p>
<p>"Ah ! you knew the young earl, then ?" said Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>"No, not at all, except by sight. Few people knew him in any other way, I fancy. He was kept very secluded from all society by a dreadful old dragon of a doctor of divinity, who was both his guardian and his tutor. No one ever saw him except at church. It was at Hawkeville's old church that I first saw his lugubrious lordship."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"And I always thought his dark, sad face foreshadowed a tragic end. I did not dream of a death by assassination, however. I thought of--suicide. He looked like it."</p>
<p>"Humph!"</p>
<p>"You are from Cornwall, I understand?"</p>
<p>"From Cornwall, yes."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps you may have known the late young Earl of Hawkewood?" suggested the lieutenant.</p>
<p>"I think I knew him--slightly," replied Mr. Gower with some hesitation.</p>
<p>"'You think,' my dear fellow? Are you not sure whether you knew him or not?" laughed Belle Isle.</p>
<p>"No, indeed, I am not sure; for though I was in his company a great deal, I cannot say that I knew him well, or that I ever addressed a word to him directly in my life; or that he ever spoke to me," gravely replied Mr. Gower.</p>
<p>"Oh! Ah! I see! You met him in mixed companies--in churches or lyceums, or something of that sort--for he never went into society at all."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But did you not notice, as I did, the profound melancholy of the young man?"</p>
<p>"A melancholy bordering on despair. Yes, indeed, I did notice it, more than any one else, I think; and I was
<pb n="66 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

more impressed than others with the doubt whether it would not end fatally," gravely responded Mr. Gower.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, it would seem that 'every face is a history or a prophecy.' His face was a prophecy of his tragic end."</p>
<p>The entrance of a servant with a tray of chocolate and cream cakes changed the current of the conversation.</p>
<p>After these refreshments had been discussed, Mr. Gower arose and bade good-night to his new friends.</p>
<p>Hamilton Gower was also a very frequent guest at the Mountain Hermitage; usually on the occasions of his visits leaving the Royal Victoria as early as six o'clock in the morning and reaching the Hermitage at nine, and there spending the whole day, and sometimes the night as well.</p>
<p>There he was received by the venerable master as an honored guest and as a beloved son, and welcomed by the young lady of the house with the calm delight she had come to feel and show in his presence.</p>
<p>He had inspired both the father and the daughter with his own strong faith in "a happy issue out of all their troubles."</p>
<p>So much of his time was passed at the Hermitage that whenever he spent a day and night with the Elfinstars, and left them after an early breakfast, it was always with the promise to return the next morning, so that they knew when to expect him, and on this expectancy Seraph Elfinstar vegetated until she saw him again; for she seemed now really to live only in his presence.</p>
<p>One morning, after having spent a day and a night at the Hermitage, having taken leave of his beloved, with the promise to come again early the next day, he went out and saw another saddled horse waiting beside his own.</p>
<p>"I will ride with you a little way," said his host as he mounted the second horse.</p>
<p>They cantered along slowly down the graded carriage way leading from the house and sweeping half around the foot of the lowest terrace.</p>
<p>When they had turned out of the grounds into the winding bride path that led down the mountain side, the old gentleman spoke:</p>
<p>"I have been wanting to talk to you for a long time
<pb n="67 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

to talk privately, I mean--but I could not ask you for a <hi rend="italic">te&ecirc;te-a&agrave;-te&ecirc;te</hi> without giving some explanation to Seraph, and I did not wish even to hint to her the subject which I must discuss with you."</p>
<p>"What subject?" uneasily inquired the young man.</p>
<p>"This. You see, I have not interfered with your conditional engagement to my daughter, and have even warmly welcomed your frequent visits and long stays, because all these have made her happy, as well as given me pleasure; and she has had so much woe, so little joy in this world, that I cannot bear--I have not the heart or the moral courage to deprive her of any enjoyment that comes in her way, or to inflict upon her the pain that its deprivation would cause," slowly answered Mr. Elfinstar.</p>
<p>"But why should you deprive her of this natural pleasure?" anxiously questioned Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>"Because of the uncertainty of the future. You are, as you have secretly confided to me, the Earl of Hawkewood; your family one of the oldest and most honored in England; your connections among the highest nobility in the kingdom. And--" The old gentleman paused, and sighed rofoundly.</p>
<p>"Well! Well! sir, what of all this?" impatiently inquired the young man.</p>
<p>"I must put the subject in its plainest, and, therefore, its most painful aspect. You wish to marry Seraph Elfinstar, my adopted daughter, who appears to you as she really is, a beautiful, amiable and cultured young girl--but--whom you now know to be one and the same with Margaret Campbell--"</p>
<p>"I beg you will cease!" exclaimed the young man, wincing.</p>
<p>"No, I must go on! Margaret Campbell, a convict, a life prisoner of the crown! Now, suppose that your most sanguine expectations are fulfilled, and that you succeed in vindicating the name and fame of this much-injured girl, and that you restore her to freedom and to her native land; I ask you, can you, a man of your rank and position, an earl, the grandson of a duke--can you marry Margaret Campbell, in the face of all her hideous antecedents? What would your relatives, say? What would your world say? The' Countess of Hawkewood an ex--"</p>
<pb n="68 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"Silence, sir; in the name of Heaven!" cried the young man, stung by the words.</p>
<p>"I am answered," gravely murmured old Elfinstar, nodding his gray head several times in affirmation; "I am answered; and I think, my lord, and I say it without the slightest surprise or resentment, that it is best you should not come again to the Hermitage. You see that you cannot marry my daughter--how much soever you may love and esteem her--you cannot marry her, in view of her horrible past.</p>
<p>"You mistake me! You misjudge me! You wrong me bitterlyl What have I ever said or done to lead you to suppose that I could be recreant to my plighted faith? Yes, I do love Seraph Elfinstar--for by that name only have I known her, and by that name only will I call her. I do love her, I do honor her, and I will marry her, if she will do me the honor to become my wife."</p>
<p>"But your rank?" mildly suggested the old gentleman.</p>
<p>"As to my rank, I am not at all indifferent to it, I assure you, Mr. Elfinstar! I should rather be the Earl of Hawkewood than to be a costermonger, or even a county clerk; but I am not the slave of my 'rank'! I will not bow down and worship my 'rank' as an idol! I will not sacrifice on the altar of my 'rank' all my heart's holiest affection! No! sooner than do that I will continue dead to the world, which for nearly two years has supposed me to be really so. I will leave my title and estate in the possession of my heir presumptive, who now usurps them, and I will live a true life here with the woman who is to be my mate forever. But it will not be necessary for me to sacrifice my rank, and my love shall share it with me! Come, Mr. Elfinstar, dear friend, we shall all be home in England within one year from this time--a happy household in Hawke Hall."</p>
<p>"But your relatives?" meekly queried the old gentleman.</p>
<p>Hamilton Gower broke into a soft and silvery laugh.</p>
<p>"'Relatives'!" he echoed. "Bless you, I have none whatever! I have not even acquaintances! And if ever I lamented the want of family and social ties, I now rejoice in it! There is positively no one to interfere with me! My only living kinsman is the man who now usurps my title, and he is so very distant a cousin that no one
<pb n="69 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

on earth but Sir Bernard Burke, who runs 'The Peerage,' could trace the connection. And the only humiliation he will feel must attend his being turned out of Hawke Hall. So you see my 'relatives' are as little likely as my 'rank' to be an impediment to our happiness."</p>
<p>" Finally--your world?"</p>
<p>"I haven't any, my good sir! I have lived so secluded from society that I have no world, outside of this colony. So much for my world. Have you anything else to urge?"</p>
<p>"In objection? No! but I have this to suggest. It is that, in case you succeed in vindicating the name and fame of Margaret Campbell, and thus restoring her to liberty--if you should still be determined to marry her, you marry her privately by her name of Margaret Campbell, and then, when we all get back to England, you receive her from my hand as my daughter, and marry her publicly as Seraph Elfinstar, and let this public marriage be attended with all the ceremonies</p>
<p>"'That wait on princes' nuptials.'</p>
<p>Will you do this?"</p>
<p>"I will do anything in my power to please you and Seraph."</p>
<p>"I wish this plan adopted to save you and yours from unmerited reproach. My granddaughter was but a child when she was caught and crushed in this terrible machinery of circumstantial evidence--a pale, thin, little girl of fourteen. She is now a tall and handsome woman of nineteen. You will marry her privately, under her first name, in order to make your union legal beyond all possibility of doubt. You will marry her publicly, under her second name that I have given her by adoption, and do this to throw a veil over misfortunes which the world must never know; and no one will ever recognize in Seraph Elfinstar, or the Countess of Hawkewood, the crushed and martyred hild who was sent out to these colonies four years ago. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>"And now I will bid you good-by, and turn back home with a somewhat lighter heart than I brought," said Mr.Elfinstar.</p>
<pb n="70 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>"And with more faith in me, I hope, sir," smiled the young man.</p>
<p>"It is faith that has lightened my heart. Heaven bless you, my boy," said the old gentleman, as he turned his horse's head and rode slowly up the mountain path.</p>
<p>Hamilton Gower, smiling to himself, cantered briskly on toward Hobart Town.</p>
CHAPTER VIII ANOTHER MAD MEETING
<p>THE month of March drew to a close, and the arrival of the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> was daily expected.</p>
<p>This prospect did not prevent Mr. Hamilton Gower from going as usual to spend a day and night at the Mountain Hermitage. He was not afraid of being left behind by the ship, in the event of her arrival during his absence. He knew that she was expected to remain for a few days in port.</p>
<p>And so it happened that, on the morning of the thirty-first of March, Mr. Hamilton Gower rode out to the Mountain Hermitage to spend a day and night with the Elfinstars.</p>
<p>And that same afternoon the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> sailed up the Derwent, and dropped anchor.</p>
<p>The news spread like wildfire through the town, causing considerable excitement--the arrival of a ship was such an important event at Hobart Town, even though it was a ship from Melbourne on her voyage to England, instead of a ship from "home," bringing news of friends and relatives.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> had brought such news on her voyage out, and now she would carry back answers to letters that had come by her mails some five weeks previous.</p>
<p>These answers, which had been begun soon after the reception of the letters and continued in the form of installments, had been waiting in many households to be dosed up and sent "home" by the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> when she should stop at Hobart Town on her way back to London.</p>
<pb n="71 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

<p>Now she was in port, and the letters must be finished in time for her next departure.</p>
<p>It happened that Mrs. Belle Isle was among the busiest letter writers. She had written long epistles to the Rev. Dr. Irvine, to Lady Victoria Belle Isle, and to Miss Olive Ball, and she wished to add to each a postcript; but having used up her stock of thin, foreign note paper, she sent her maid, Lona Pond, out into the town to procure a new supply.</p>
<p>Lona walked down Barracks Lane into Macquarrie Street, and thence into Queen Street, where she intended to make her purchase.</p>
<p>She walked with her eyes cast down upon the ground, for she could not bear to look at or speak to any one since her misadventure with Mr. Hamilton Gower.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard her name called in a voice that ought to have been familiar.</p>
<p>"Lona! Lona Pond! Is it possible! You here?"</p>
<p>She started in terror, and raised her eyes, to see standing before her, barring her way, a fine, stalwart-looking man, with good features, dark, sunburned complexion, dark eyes, dark hair and a full, heavy, dark beard.</p>
<p>He wore a sailor's suit, and held in his hand a tarpaulin hat.</p>
<p>She uttered a faint cry, and covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>"Lona! Lona Pond! Is this really you? I can scarcely believe my eyes! How came you out here? Speak to me!" exclaimed the newcomer.</p>
<p>But she only held her hands before her eyes and trembled.</p>
<p>"Are you Lona Pond? Speak to me! I cannot have made a mistake! Speak to me! Are you Lona Pond?" pleaded the stranger.</p>
<p>"Ay, I'm Lona Pond fast enough; miserable, demented girl that I am!" muttered the young woman from behind her trembling hands.</p>
<p>"You are Lona Pond! Of course, I knew it! I was sure of it! Dear, dearest Lona! It is such a surprise, such a delight, to meet you so unexpectedly! When did you come out here, and with whom?"</p>
<p>"I came out about a year ago, as lady's maid to an offi-
<pb n="72 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

cer's wife--Mrs Lieut. Belle Isle; but I wish you would let me pass, and not bar my way!" said the girl in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>"But, Lona! Why, Lona! Why do you speak to me in that manner? Don't you know me? Can it be possible that you don't know me?" demanded the young man in a voice of surprise.</p>
<p>"No, I don't know you at all! Let me go by, if you please," said the girl, trying to push past him.</p>
<p>He stopped her gently.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is because you don't want to know me," he said in a tone of pain and displeasure.</p>
<p>"No, I don't want to know you, and, what is more, I won't know you--so there, now! I have been fooled just once too often, and I will never be fooled again! Stand out of the way and let me pass!" she exclaimed in a shaking voice as she tried to push by him.</p>
<p>"One moment longer," he answered, breathing hard, as he continued to bar her path; "just one moment longer, and one question more. You don't want to know me, you say! Perhaps you have another sweetheart? Perhaps you have a husband?"</p>
<p>"No!" vehemently exclaimed the girl, "I have no husband and no sweetheart, and don't want any but my own ,dear Ham Gow! My own dear Ham Gow as I crossed the high seas to come to, but as I shall never find in this world! No, never! I have found only his doubles and his fetches, as have deceived and fooled me until I'm almost demented; but I'll never be fooled again! Let me go on, sir! I am out on an errand, and my mistress is waiting for me," she persisted, trying to pass by him.</p>
<p>But he blocked her way with the most affectionate words.</p>
<p>"Dearest, dearest Lona, you have found your faithful lover at last! I am your own, true Ham Gow !"</p>
<p>"I don't believe it! You can't fool me! Let me go by!"</p>
<p>"But I am, indeed, Ham Gow!"</p>
<p>"You are nothing of the sort!"</p>
<p>"I am Ham Gow--"</p>
<p>"You are a fetch!"</p>
<p>"Look at me, then! Look me straight in the face and assure yourself that I am he."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! I looked at the others! at the convict in the
<pb n="73 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

chain gang, and at the gentleman on Macquarrie Street, and by looking at them I was fooled. They were neither of them Ham Gow! They were his fetches!"</p>
<p>"But I am no 'fetch'! I am he!"</p>
<p>"You may be the Emperor of China, for aught I know! but if you don't stand out of my way and let me pass I will give you in charge! Here! Constable! Constable!" she cried, hailing an officer that was passing on the opposite side of the way.</p>
<p>"You are certainly crazy!" exclaimed the stranger as he stepped aside and let her pass.</p>
<p>Lona Pond hurried along Queen Street until she had put a hundred yards or so between herself and the stranger, and then she suddenly paused and put her hands up to her head in a bewildered manner, muttering:</p>
<p>"He was wonderfully like Ham Gow! wonderfully! But I know he wasn't Ham Gow! He was only another fetch, the third fetch! and the proverb says, 'Beware of the third time!' And I promised my mistress--solemnly promised her--never, never, never to take another man for Ham Gow! And I never will! And now I must hurry and get what she sent me for!"</p> 
<p>She quickened her steps and walked rapidly on for a few paces, and then paused again and put her hands up to her temples with an expression of perplexity.</p>
<p>"Now, what was it my mistress sent me for? That man has knocked it clean out of my head! Let me see! What was it? Berlin wool? No! Cologne? No! Oh I cannot remember to save my life! I shall have to go back and ask her! Such a loss of time! And she in such a hurry, too!"</p>
<p>Lona Pond turned and retraced her steps to the barracks in a hurry, and presented herself before her mistress in heat and agitation.</p>
<p>"You have walked too fast, Lona! You should not have done so," said Mrs. Belle Isle. Then: "Have you got the paper?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was paper! So it was! Dear ma'am, please forgive me; but--I had forgotten what you sent me for; and--I had to turn back!" replied the panting girl.</p>
<p>"Forgot my errand, Lona! That was very strange! But sit down and recover your breath! You are not fit
<pb n="74 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

to stand. How came you to forget?" gently inquired the lady.</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am," breathed the palpitating creature, as she sank down on a footstool at her mistress' feet, "it was all along of a great shock I got on Queen Street."</p>
<p>"What sort of a shock, Lona? I hope--"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, ma'am, it was another Ham Gow!"</p>
<p>"Lona!"</p>
<p>"I mean another fetch of his, ma'am!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my poor girl! are you quite losing your senses? "sighed the lady.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, dear ma'am, I am getting them back again, sure! for I would not allow this fetch to be Ham Gow, although he was the image of him--as perfect an image of him as the other fetches were, and even although he himself owned up to being Ham Gow, which the other two fetches didn't; but, on the contrary, denied that they were so."</p>
<p>"Lona!" suddenly exclaimed the lady. "You say that this third man declared himself to be Gow?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, he did, the deceiver! And he was the first to speak to me, calling me his dearest Lona, and asking me if I didn't know him, and a lot of other questions! But I wasn't to be fooled by him! I wouldn't allow him to be Ham Gow for one single minute!" said the girl, emphatically shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I think you have made another mistake, Lona," said the lady.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, please, ma'am, I haven't! No mistake this time! I remembered my solemn promise to you, ma'am, never to take another man for Ham Gow as long as I should live in this world! And I didn't, ma'am! For when this third fetch kept on trying to fool me, I just called a constable to him and come away!"</p>
<p>"What! You had the man arrested?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, ma'am, not that; for when I called the constable he got out of my way and let me pass. And then I hurried down Queen Street to do your errand, and then found out that I had forgotten what it was! Now, dear ma'am, wasn't it enough to make me forget?" pleaded Lona Pond.</p>
<p>"Yes, and I excuse your forgetfulness," laughed the,
<pb n="75 THE TEST OF LOVE"/>

lady. "But, Lona, I have reason for believing that this last man was really your lover!"</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am !" cried Lona, catching her breath.</p>
<p>"Do you not remember that I told you Gow was expected to arrive by the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi>, due here about the first of April?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am, I know, but--"</p>
<p>"Well, the <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> has arrived."</p>
<p>"The <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> arrived, ma'am!" exclaimed the girl, staring.</p>
<p>"Yes, this afternoon, as I should have told you if I had thought of it. The <hi rend="italic">Labrador</hi> has arrived, and Gow with her, no doubt! So it must have been he whom you met and flouted in Queen Street just now."</p>
<p>"The Lord have mercy upon me! Now I have it!" exclaimed Lona Pond, with a look of utter despair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belle Isle laughed, and said:</p>
<p>"Don't distress yourself, Lona. Mr. Hamilton Gower promised to bring Gow here to see you as soon as the ship should reach port, and he will certainly keep his word; and when you meet your lover you can explain to him how you happened to deny him, and it will be all right."</p>
<p>"Oh, ma'am; but to think that after taking two fetches for him I should take him for a fetch!"</p>
<p>"Never mind, Lona! You are sure of seeing your betrothed now, and that should be a great consolation! Go, take off your bonnet. I shall not send you out again today. I can call at the stationer's myself, when I go out for a drive," said the lady, gently dismissing her agitated maid.</p>

And stoopingover the well I saw a white figure with a white bundle-the figure of a young girl clothed in a white gown andhaving long, fair hair hanging down her back. A super-stitious thrill passed through me-the hour, the scene, theform, were all so ghostly. She stooped over the well anddropped something into it!  I heard the low, soft thudas it struck the bottom! Then the girl turned and cametoward me. She was within three feet of me before shesaw me.

She avoided them  with horror, andkept away as much as possible even from the streets thatled to them.In the evening she went to a concert with her father andher lover, and enjoyed the music, the lights and the gaycrowd with the keen delight of one long deprived of suchpleasures.

If it had not been so, the twomen would have turned their steps up along the banks ofDemondike."We must start for town to-night, Ham," said Mr. Gow-er, as they sauntered along, "for you know it is absolutelynecessary that we should be in London to-morrow morning,ready to receive the first possible news from our detective.""Yes, of course, I see that," assented Ham Gow."Besides, it is not safe for our plans for us to stay herea day longer.

Why, its saving in profanity alonewas inestimable !Then, again, these specimens were very light and port-able.

And therewere large trees, under which stood benches, where the rus-tic customers often sat while regaling themselves withpipes and beer.Behind the house were stables with red roofs, and therewere brown hayricks, and a few apple trees in an old-fashioned garden; all of which made a pleasant rural pic-ture fully appreciated by the Londoner.As the stagecoach drew up before the door the landladyherself came out to welcome any chance guests.But besides Mr. Hutchings there were only three otherpassengers, countrymen, who got out and went into the tap-room to call for mugs of beer, and who, after drinking,went off to their homes.Hutchings walked into the parlor of the inn, and asked ifhe could have a room and tea.The landlady, a brisk little body, with black eyes, blackringlets, a black alpaca gown and a cap trimmed with redribbons, answered that he could be promptly served withall that he should be pleased to call for, and anything else.Could he have his tea in that parlor ? he wanted to know.Certainly; there were no other stopping guests, and hecould have his tea in that parlor.And would the landlady pour it out for him?The landlady would pour it out for him with pleasure;but first she would send the chambermaid to show him hisbedroom.Exit the landlady and enter the chambermaid-a stout,high-comple'ioned country girl, in a blue dress and whitebib apron, and a white cap with blue ribbons.She stood and courtesied silently, and then turned andopened a back door and looked around at the guest.The latter understanding by this pantomime that he wasexpected to follow, arose and followed his conductressthrough a labyrinth of narrow passages and up a corkscrewL

Plain, neat and clean was allthat could be said of it. Having shown the guest into this room, the silent girlretreated.There was at least plenty of pure water and fresh towels.

The lad, Zach, helps in thestable up at the great house, and he have just come in tohis supper; but he can wait. He is my grandson, sir, anda great trial, too. And he lives with me, in course.

Well, well! I thought when kerry-sene' and lucifers was inwented, we had got to the werry endf inwentions! But-needle threaders! Well, well! Theymust cost a sight of money!" she said, longingly contem-plating the little instrument that she held between herfinger and her thumb."No, indeed! They cost only a penny apiece !" exclaimedthe agent."Only a penny apiece! Bless and save the man! does hethink a penny is not a sight o' money for the likes o' me?"sharply inquired the dame, who had lost half her reverencefor the visitor on discovering that, after all, he was only atraveling agent for the sale of a patented article."If you think the price too high, madam-   " com-menced the agent, in a conciliatory tone; but she inter-rupted him:"I'm not saying the price is too high for other folks!

"That is a pity; but perhaps that misfortune may beiremedied! Perhaps I may be able to find a knife, as well,as a knife sharpener, to reward a smart young chap whoiworks to help his grandmother."

When he hadquaffed it and left the house, the landlady stooped towardthe detective, dropped her voice to a confidential, low key,and inquired:"Did you have the good luck to show any of your waresto the ladies, sir, if one might ask?""Oh, yesl Old Mrs. Keene was so kind as to go withme to the house this morning, and get me an interview withthe ladies. They were pleased with my patent needle thread-ers, and bought a dozen."The landlady stared in astonishment for a moment, andthen exclaimed:"Well! though I asked you the question, I didn't expectyou to answer it in that way !

And insanity and epilepsy and what not in  ithe family !" exclaimed Mrs. Keene."'Insanity !'-'epilepsy !'-I don't understand you !" said Hutchings."Did you see-the youngest girl, sir? the afflicted one?'?inquired the landlady, lowering her voice to an almost in-audible key."The one that has fits? Yes, I saw her," answered thidetective, in as careless a tone as he could assume."They say she never was quite right in her head, and e d'.A,since that terrible tragedy she has been altogether wrong,'quite crazy.""Yet, if I remember rightly, she was the principal wit. ness against Margaret Campbell?"':"That she was, sir! and, therefore, one might think shecouldn't be quite as crazy then as she was cracked up to'be, else the judges wouldn't have listened to her.

I may say that I feel sure that I have.I have seen and studied the girl. She is still with her' mother, the widow of Duncan Campbell, of Rose Hill, who  'is still living in the manor house on sufferance. The girl Malvina appears to me as one who is crazed by remorse, or'some other deeply concealed trouble. I think it is remorse.I also think that she might be surprised or frightened into a confession of her crime. She suffers fearfully. So does her mother, who evidently now knows as much about the matter as the girl herself. Another view of the case is thatif Malvina could be withdrawn from the influence of hermother, she would-without being surprised or frightened       |into the measure-confess her crime, from sheer inability to bear the burden of the secret. But I do not think sheWwould ever have to suffer the extreme penalty of the law.She is evidently too much of an imbecile for that." "What, then, would be her fate ?" inquired Ham Gow, in a grave and compassionate voice."Seclusion 'during her majesty's pleasure' in the Asylum  iifor Criminal Lunatics, at Hanwell," replied the detective."The conviction of this guilty woman is absolutely neces-sary to the vindication of the innocent young girl who isnow bearing the penalty of this woman's crime! The charge of murder should be brought against Malvina Mattox atonce! With the testimony of Gow, here, supported by theevidence that you may be able to gather, she can be broughtto trial I And every hour's delay in bringing the guilty to justice is a heinous wrong to the innocent I Let us lose notime in this matter, but go to Yorkshire by the next train,"said Mr. Hamilton Gower, in a stem, relentless, determinedmanner."I beg your pardon, sir," interposed Detective Hutchings."But such haste would ruin our cause. Or it might do so.If we should succeed in bringing this woman to trial on  ,the evidence that we have got, it is very doubtful whetherwe could convict her on it. Mr. Gow is ready to swear thathe saw Malvina Mattox at the well on the night and atthe hour of the murder. Very well! But, on the otherhand, the old groom who was awakened by a noise that same

If we should want anything, I will ring,"said Mr. Gower.The waiter withdrew, and Ham Gow arose and locked thedoor after him."There!

Hutchings made haste and ate and drank fast, however;and when he had satisfied his hunger he drew a little away from the table, settled himself comfortably in his chairand began his report. He told his attentive listeners of the ostensible businessathat he traveled upon, as agent for the patent needle thread-.er and knife sharpener, and how easily it introduced him  !into all houses.                                       itHe related his gossiping interview with the landlady of  'the "Campbell Arms," at Rosedale, and of her account of ithe murder at Rose Hill and the sensation and excitementthat had drawn such crowds to her inn and put so muchmoney in her till.He told them that the impression of the neighborhood  ifseemed to have been then, and certainly was now, that there  .''had been no mistake at all made in the person of the con-victed criminal and that Margaret Campbell had been justly condemned.He told them, further, of the strange reports in the neigh-  Hborhood as to the strict seclusion in which the widow andher family had lived since the tragedy, and of the rumored illness and insanity of the younger daughter, who had been  ;'the principal witness against Margaret Campbell.He told them of his evening visit to the old lodge keeperof Rose Hill, and of his passing the greater part of the  ':night in her little parlor, where he heard, subsequently, the  ;!same account of the secluded family at the manor house 'that he had already heard from the landlady of the Camp-  ;bell Arms.He purposely omitted all mention of the ghost story, or  ',of his own strange adventure at midnight near the haunted "well, leaving that episode for the last; and he went on to itell of his morning visit to "the three weird women" in the  '!seclusion of their own private sitting room.,"The 'needle threader' was the talisman that procured imy admittance 'behind the scenes,'" he remarked, in pass- ^ing, "though I have reason to believe that even that talis- .man would have failed had it not bete presented by a

No doubt she feels it to beso, and shc. too, suffers acutely; her face shows her suffer-ing; but her conduct is not unnatural-for the criminal isher own daughter and the innocent girl is nothing to her,and she has not the Roman courage to give her own child upto justice to vindicate an alien. I am afraid few women,or even men, would have," said the detective."I burn at the stake until justice can be done!" vehe-mently exclaimed Mr. Gower."We must surprise or frighten this woman into self-betrayal or confession. I tried a little experiment on herwhen I was about to withdraw from the room, after havinghad the interview I have just related.

I went up to her as I was leaving,  Iand laid a packet of my needle threaders on her hands andspoke close to her ears to insure her attention. I only said:"'I wish you would be so good as to look at these ar- ticles,' or words to that effect."But she sprang up as if suddenly stung and began to ,wring her hands, and to cry out incoherently:" 'It is not so ! It is not so ' over and over again, as fast as she could speak, and then: 'Why didn't I die? Whydidn't I die ?' until she fell into convulsions."I stooped to raise her from the floor where she hadfallen; but the mother, who had darted to her assistance,dismissed me with sharp words, and I left them-to drawmy own conclusions, as you will now draw yours," said thedetective.Mr. Hamilton Gower reflected for a moment, and thensaid:"But did not that wretched girl's incoherent words--what were they ?--'It is not so! It is not so !'-savor moreof denial, of passionate, obstinate denial, than of confes-sion ?""No; for no one had ever accused her. No, indeed-not  '^as I understand them, from her manner. It was the sud-den utterance of brooding remorse. 'It is not so!' meant, to  'my apprehension, that Margaret Campbell never committed  ithe crime for which she is suffering the penalty."'"Good heavens I Yes! that must have been the meaningof the outburst !" said Mr. Gower."And yet the words would certainly bear two meanings-zither a denial of her own guilt, or of Margaret Camp- 'bell's," put in Ham Gow."You would not think so if you had heard and seen her. 'And now I come to the strangest, the most incomprehen-sible of my adventures at Rose Hill," said the detective,solemnly; and then he paused and looked gravely from oneto the other of his hearers."Go on. We are all attention. Let us hear your adven-ture, if it has any bearing on the case in question," saidMr. Gower."It has a very important bearing on the case," repliedthe detective; "but, mind, I intend to give you the facts in.,

I may, indeed,advance a theory, but I certainly will not insist upon it."By this time Hutchings had thoroughly aroused the curi-osity of his two hearers.And now he began by telling them of the strange rumorthat had met him on the very day of his arrival at Rosedale-a rumor that had gained credence throughout the neigh-borhood-that Margaret Campbell, the convict murderess,had died out in the penal settlements of Van Dieman'sLand, and that her lost spirit haunted the scene of hercrime, and might be seen every night at midnight standingover the old dry well, or walking around it, with the shapeof the murdered child in her arms."A mere vulgar ghost story, such as would be likely tobe invented by the lower classes in a neighborhood wheresuch a tragedy had been enacted," said Mr. HamiltonGower, contemptuously.The detective looked at the speaker with a quizzical ex-pression for a moment, and then said:"Ah that is your opinion, is it? So was it mine whenI first heard the story from the landlady of the CampbellArms. But I had soon good reason to change my mind,and to confess that there must be a material foundation forthe general fright.""A material one, perhaps, but scarcely a spiritual one.But, however, tell us your modified opinion," said Mr.Gower, with an incredulous smile."My opinion was, that the supposed ghost-the hauntingspirit of the old dry well-which had frightened away everymidnight prowler more effectually than the fiercest watch-dog could have done, was no other than the material personof Malvina Mattox, who, pursued day and night by remorse,epileptic, somnambulic, was driven each night to walk insleep around the scene of her terrible crime.""That may have been likely, you know," put in HamGow.Mr. Gower said nothing, but became more attentive."This story, I must remind you, came to my ears beforeI had actually seen the girl, but not before I had heardsufficiently of her disturbed mental condition to be enabledto suspect her of sleepwalking. With this suspicion on my

"Well, well," eagerly demanded Mr. Gower."I got the confidence of the old portress at the lodge,where I passed the early portion of the night, and guidedby her grandson, I went a mile or so through the old woodedpark to the rear of the manor house, where the stables, ken- nels, paddock and so forth, were situated.""Yes; go on," said Ham Gow."The scene of my adventure lies as plainly before mymind's eyes to-night as it lay before my bodily eyes lastnight. My path through a dense thicket had brought meup to an old stone wall and under the branches of a deadtree. It was midnight, and the full moon was shiningbroadly down from the zenith. It was almost as bright asday. I climbed the dead tree and looked over the wall."The detective paused for a moment to drink a draught of  ilale, and then continued:"And this is what I saw under the broad, bright moon-^light: On my right, the large, dark group of stone build- ings, comprising stables, coach houses, grooms' quartersand kennels, surrounded by the stable yard. Just beforeme an open paddock, with an old well in the midst, andhayricks and barns beyond. On my left an obscure, dense' fir wood, from far behind which the chimneys of the manorhouse arose."The narrator paused to take another drink, and con-        ltinued:"Now, my dear sirs, you need not think, though it was midnight, that I dreamed what I am about to tell you; forremember, that I was up in the fork of an old dead tree,and I was even uncommonly wide awake, both from a senseof the danger of my position, should I forget myself for an instant, and also from a vivid anticipation of an immediate encounter with a sleepwalker.""We understand the situation," said Mr. Gower."Well, then, as I sat, with my eyes roving over the wholescene-the stable yards and buildings, the paddock. withthe old dry well, and the dark fir wood-suddenly out of.1

She continuedto advance, and I saw that she carried in her arms theform of a fair and beautiful child, and that it was the halowhich emanated from the radiant child that illuminate. the woman's form as by a borrowed light."I remained spellbound, to gaze upon the vision until itapproached the old dry well and bent over its brink."Then, in the sudden feeling that the woman was aboutto drop the child into that perdition, I broke from the spellthat bound me, swung myself over the wall by the limb ofthe tree in which I sat, and dropped into the paddock below."It took me a moment to recover from the shock of thefall, and then I arose and ran toward the woman, who wasclasping the form of the child to her bosom and gazingdown into the well."As I approached she raised her head and turned aroundand met my gaze with a pair of strangely blue, blazing eyesthat seemed less human eyes than inward fire flamingthrough their sockets."Thinking only to save the child, awaken the sleepwalkerand surprise the criminal into self-betrayal, I threw myarms around her and clasped-  ""What, what?" demanded Ham Gow, while Mr. Goweronly listened in silent wonder."Empty air!

And I tell you also that there wasa circumstance that singularly favored this theory.""Ah! and that--  ""It was this strange coincidence, that when I saw Mal-vina Mattox, the same day, I found in her an exact counter-part of the woman seen in the midnight vision-exceptingonly the presence of the radiant child and the supernallight.""Well, but is not that the most likely of all theories inregard to the apparition ?""It would be, but for some objection!

Ham Gow had opened his pack and sred the contentsall over the table before her.It was the miscellaneous assortment of the ordinarypeddler's pack.Ham Gow sold her a black silk dress, a pair of black kidgloves, and a lace collar and cuffs; all of which she bulliedhim into selling at half price, because she insisted that hehad never paid dutyon them.And then the barmaid, and chambermaid, and cook, andscullion were called in and permitted to make purchases onthe same easy terms-the landlady still whispering confi-dentially to each:"He's a smuggler, so you must make him let you havethe things cheap; and you needn't mind dealing with him.Women never had anything to do with making the lawsagin' free trade, and they ain't bound to respect them."So Ham Gow had to see linen handkerchiefs, cotton laceand gilt jewelry go at about half what he had paid forthem; but he did not care-the loss was not his, and profitwas not the object of his present employer."Do you think of going out with your pack this after-noon ?" inquired the landlady, as Ham Gow, having soldthem all they wanted, was busily engaged doing up hismerchandise."Yes; I do," he replied."Then, I'd advise you to strike out into the country.

When she shall be brought in thevisitors' room to see him, let him ask her if she remembersthe occasion of their first meeting at midnight by the olddry well, some five years since-and-the result, mark me,will be her self-betrayal!""Ah-h! I see," muttered Hamilton Gower."For, you see, by all. that we can judge from what wehave heard, she has been tortured by remorse for the lastfive years, and has, doubtless, betrayed herself to her mother,and must certainly have done so to others, had she notbeen closely watched by that lady. Even my visit, for somereason that I do not understand, disturbed her to such adegree as to throw her into convulsions, and later to causeher flight from her home and her taking sanctuary in theconvent. Judge, therefore, what the effect will be whenshe shall find herself face to face once more with the onlymortal witness of her crime !""I see! I see! Let us lose no more time in talking!Let us go at once to the Convent of the Holy Sepulcher Now, then-what train should we take? And what is thenearest station?" hastily inquired Mr. Gower."There is no train leading anywhere near the convent,and this is the nearest station, and it is nine miles off ! SoI learned by inquiry at Rose Hill. The Convent of the HolySepulcher is one of the most secluded of the religious housesin the realm. We shall have to take a private conveyance,"said Hutchings."All right!

"Weshall not be able to gain admittance to the convent to-night,it is true; but we can go on and stop at the nearest publichouse, and be ready for as early a visit as the rules willallow in the morning. So time will be saved, and time isprecious."

He had seen four score yearsand five, and on this day he was weary, for it was Saturday,and nearly all the sisterhood had come to him in turn tomake their confessions and obtain absolution, preparatory toreceiving the Sunday morning's sacrament.No very grievous sins had as yet been confided to his earby the harmless nuns; only such peccadillos as the wan-derings of their thoughts during prayer, irritability of tem.per during pain, little passing angers or cnvyings, or, atmost, intrusive doubts of the divine mercy toward such sin-ners as themselves.Such and such like were the heinous sins and misde-meanors to which the good old man had been compelled tolisten all day long, and for which he had prescribed the ter-rible penances of a little self-denial and a few short prayers.And now that the day was nearly done, he was weary of itall, as he sat upon his hard bench in the close, dark nook,and he was thinking of withdrawing, when a sound fellupon his ear that at once fixed his attention.It was a most distressing moan, as of some dumb animalin pain, and it came from the other side of the little panel,through which his penitents, unseen, had breathed theirconfessions.The moanings were repeated, until at last the kind-hearted old man could wait no longer for a voluntary com-munication, but felt compelled to break his prescribedsilence, and ask:"What is the matter? What can I do for you? Speakfreely.""Oh, father! father!" wailed the voice of a woman frombehind the screen."You are in sorrow, my daughter. Confide your troubleto me, without fear, and I will comfort you, if I can,"gently whispered the old man.

For a mohe could not speak."Ah, you shrink from me already! What will youwhen you hear what I must tell?" moaned the woman."I do not shrink from you, my daughter. Who amthat I should dare to shrink from any ? I wait to hear wyou wish to say," gently replied the old man."I must relieve myself-of the secret-that oppresand suffocates-my soul 1" said the voice behind the serspeaking with difficulty and in gasps."I listen, my child," murmured the old man."I have borne the burden-so long-so long that it-nearly maddened-or killed me  I wish it had done -or the other !""Nay, nay, my daughter! Say not so! But why the burden of your sin, when you could lay it down at,.foot of the cross?" gently inquired the priest. "Oh. I was not permitted to confess! I was watcguarded, day and night!

For I confess, or die, or go raving mad !""Speak out, my child, in the name of Heaven !" saidpriest."I am-that wretched creature called-Malvina tox !" spoke the penitent, in gasps.

I had no malice against the child! I liked him! But listen! One day, in the same summer that he was born,I had him in my lap playing with him; I suddenly put himin my mother's arms and ran out of the room. Afterwardthey all asked me why I acted so strangely. I did not tellthem. I could not tell them; but I will tell you, father !""I am listening.""It was because I was suddenly seized with an unaccount-able, irresistible impulse to throw him out of the open win-dow!

I began to walk in my sleep, and to hauntthe nursery door at night-an infirmity of which I was to-tally unconscious until my roommate, Margaret Campbell,discovered it and told me of it. She also took to watchingme, following me, waking me up, and leading me back tomy bed."Here the old priest sighed deeply, for he was thinkinghow foully the guilty girl before him had repaid this friendfor all this kindness."And now I come to the fatal night. I had been pur-sued and tortured by that terrible impulse all day long. Atone time my mother brought the baby into the parlor whereI was sitting alone, and told me to take care of him whilethe nurse went to the village on an errand; but instead ofobeying my mother I screamed with terror, and ran out ofthe room and out of the house. I was scolded and beatenby my mother for what I did, yet I dared not tell her whyI had fled from the child, and so I became more nervousand ill than before.""You should have told her. She might have consulted aphysician. All this trouble might have been saved," saidthe priest." Ah, yes ! but what is the use of saying this now ? What'sdone is done!" moaned the penitent. "True," acquiesced the old man.The unhappy girl continued:"At night I went to bed and fell into the deepest sleep Iever experienced. I fell into that deep sleep while I heldMargart Campbell in my arms; for, as I said, she was mvroommate and my bedfellow, and my mother scolded heras well as me, and we had a common cause of complaint thatunited us in sympathy. So, with Margaret Campbell inmy arms, T fell into a deep, dreadful sleep, and dreamed-a fatal dream !""'A fatal dream!'" echoed the priest."Yes. Father, I am going to tell you the strangest ex-perience that ever happened to any human being-I amgoing to tax your credulity, perhaps, to the utmost," saidthe girl."Speak on, poor soul ll

I followedher, horrified, but unable to stop her, or to call out, or todo anything else but follow. I followed her then to theverge of the dry well, when suddenly she and the child sankinto the ground before my eyes, and in their place arose strange, wild-looking man with a shock of black hair andbeard."We gazed in a panic at each other for an instant, anthen I turned and fled to the house. When I regained oroom I found Margaret Campbell sleeping quietly in bed "I was so puzzled by all that had happened, or haseemed to happen, that I slept no more that night."The next morning-      Oh, father, do not ask me recall the agony of the days that followed-the disappeaance of the child; the anguish of the search; the horror othe discovery when his body was found in the well; the inIquest; the trial and conviction of Margaret Campbell !"One other thing was strange.

Andnow he felt overwhelmed by grief, horror and the magnitudeof the responsibility thus thrown upon him. He seemedunable to utter a word, though his penitent evidently pausedto give him the opportunity and waited to hear him."Oh, father! speak to me! Speak to me! Counsel me!Tell me what I ought to do, while I am sane enough tounderstand you!" cried the girl, in a voice of anguish, asshe knelt there, wringing her hands."Poor, miserable child!

Had he cometo denounce Malvina Mattox as the murderess of the littleStuart Campbell, her infant brother?"While he was asking himself this question, the gray-haired servant waited respectfully, and then inquired:"Did you wish to see my master, sir?""Yes ! yes I" exclaimed the priest, rousing himself. "Iwished to see the squire. Is he at home?""Yes, sir; please walk in. I will take your card."The priest drew a blank card from his pocket, wrote uponit, with a pencil:"Benedict Riordon, S.

She spoke with difficulty, while her whole  iaspect revealed to the most careless observer that not herhours only, but her minutes, were numbered.The magistrate's clerk took down her deposition in writ-ing, and when it was finished he presented the paper forsignature.Three times the pen dropped from her relaxing fingers before she completed it, and then she sank back in her chair, , laboring for breath.The doctor took her wrist in his hand, felt her pulse, andthen dropped it with a sigh.

What a strange, tragic phase of maniawas hers! She should have been placed in a lunatic asylum,under medical treatment, years before she had any oppor-tunity of doing harm. Doctor, you can, of course, give acertificate of death from natural causes to forestall the in-convenience of an inquest ?""Certainly," replied the physician."And I, if you will permit me, must go immediately toRose Hill to break the news to the family there; though,ah me! I can easily understand how this event will bemore of a relief than a grief to the widowed mother and thesister," sighed the priest."I will attend to the removal of the remains, if you willinstruct me as to where they shall be carried-to RoseHill, or to the Convent of St. Sepulcher," said the doctor."I thank you. To the Convent of St. Sepulcher. I willbring the mother thither; and, gentlemen, it is not nownecessary, I hope, that the afflicted lady should ever knowanything about the painful scene that has transpired inthis room," suggested the priest."No, it is not; though she may unhappily hear of it byaccident," said old Mr. Storkridge."That is scarcely possible. She goes nowhere, she re-ceives no visits; and even should any servant of hers hearof this day's work, he or she would not dare to mention itto the mistress," said the priest."Well, gentlemen, if I or my establishment can affordyou any assistance in this sad affair, command us.

Upon second thoughts, I will join the doctor in takingthe remains back to the convent and go from thence to Bose Hill to notify the family," replied the priest. "Will you not want another carriage? The break, or thewagonette, or any other in the coach house is quite at yourservice," persisted the squire."I thank you, no; we can take the body back in the samecarriage in which we came. But, squire, it is not only inthe departed soul that I feel deeply interested, but in theinnocent, living, suffering young girl serving out the termof her natural life in the penal settlements of Van Dieman'sLand! It is of her that I am thinking now! With the besthaste that we can make it must be six or eight months beforejustice can reach and relieve her.""I shall lose no time, Mr. Riordon. I shall act promptly, you may be sure. These documents shall go up to London to the Home Office, this day, by a special messenger, whoshall urge them upon the attention of the secretary for im-mediate action. There is not a doubt but that the order for the discharge of Margaret Campbell will go out with thenext mail to Hobart Town," warmly responded the oldcsquire."This contents me. I knew the girl, and through my re- lations to her as her spiritual director, I knew that she was i iinnocent, though I did not know who was guilty."               2"Kelsy I" said the squire, turning somewhat abruptly to)'the constable who still held the warrant, "oblige me by de'stroying that paper !

"The poor child has fainted dead away lShe never ought to have been taken out to drive in her weakstate."And words to the same effect were uttered by the portressat the house, as the doctor bore the body into the mainbuilding.Not until they reached "The Room of the Dead" at theback of the infirmary, and had laid the body on one of theslabs, did the priest, leaving the doctor on guard, go to in-form the mother superior of the convent about the death,and even then he told that lady of nothing but the death,and having dispatched her in haste to "The Room of theDead," he re-entered the carriage and drove to Rose Hill, tonotify the family there of what had just occurred.On arriving he sent up his card to the lady of the house,and was at once admitted to her presence in the upper sit-ting room, which was her usual morning retreat."You bring ill news, father," she said, on observing thedeep gravity of the priests aspect.He bowed solemnly and in silence, as he seated himselfon the chair that she drew forward for his accommodation."My unfortunate child 1 How is it with her?" anxiouslydemanded the lady."Tt is well with her," gravely replied the priest"You mean-you mean?" breathlessly inquired the lady..-'t,L',

It was with a deep sigh of satisfaction that she inquired:"When did it happen?""Not an hour ago-suddenly, too suddenly to have younotified in time.""I knew it would come suddenly when it did come.

THE TEST OF LOVE                    251Mrs Campbell felt that her wretched daughter was atlast safe from the imminent danger of a public trial, andpossibly a public execution, and she was very glad that thisshould be so.She suspected nothing of the dying deposition made bythe girl, nor did anyone enlighten her on the subject, whichwould have overwhelmed her with pain and shame.To the questions of Mrs. Campbell the nuns replied thatMiss Malvina had arisen and dressed herself in the morn-ing, and, with much excitement and obstinacy, had insistedon taking a drive; that the physician thought there wouldbe less danger in gratifying her wishes than in opposingthem. Accordingly, she was allowed to take the drive,attended by the physician, who kindly volunteered his serv-ices. But the girl had expired in the carriage.This was the impression the nuns had received, andthough it was not in all respects exactly true, yet it washonestly believed and uttered as truth.Mrs. and Miss Campbell remained three days at the con-vent.At the end of the third day the obsequies of MalvinaMattox were performed in the chapel, and her body waslaid in the cemetery.And on the morning of the fourth day Mrs. Campbellmade a munificent present to the convent, and then returnedwith her daughter to Rose Hill, where they fell into themonotonous routine of their secluded lives.In the meantime other events of importance to the desti-nies of our friends were rapidly transpiring elsewhere.After Ham Gow had laid the formal charge of murderagainst Malvina before Squire Storkridge, and had seen thewarrant made out for her apprehension-that warrantwhich was destined never to be served-he returned to thelittle wayside inn where he had left Mr. Hamilton Gowerand the detective waiting for him.He found them in the private parlor-the only one thelittle inn could boast."Well?" demanded Mr. Gower, eagerly."All right.

I shall attend that examination. You, also,Hutchings, must go with us to give your evidence in regard to the scene you witnessed in the boudoir of Mrs. Campbellon the morning of your visit to Rose Hill," said Mr. Gower.."Of course, I will go," replied the detective."I hope it will not go very hard with the poor, crazy'creature I This hunting a poor, half-witted girl to disgrace and death is not at all to my taste, even in the cause of^-justice," sighed Ham Gow."But it is to rescue another, a most innocent and mosgi!grievously wronged young lady, from a degradation worsthan death that you must do this," said Mr. Gower."And it will not go hard with her; never fear.

He marked this letter private, and addressed itto the town house of the secretary, and then waited thecourse of events.The following morning he received a note from the pri-vate secretary of the minister, saying that "his lordship"would receive Mr. Gower at the "office" that same day attwelve o'clock noon.Hamilton Gower rejoiced, for he now considered his causeas good as gained.And he was right..&

The great minister,was in point of fact a gentle and unassuming old man, who'might have been the beloved pastor of some simple country ,congregation; and yet he was one of England's most emi- 'inent as well as most Christian statesmen; while his high, full, broad forehead, thoughtful eyes, and calmly com- iipressed lips, quietly folded hands and easy attitude showed all an intellect as serene in its integrity as it was benevo-lent in its aims and potent in its strength.His manner at once put the young visitor at ease.With a low, respectful bow Hamilton Gower laid theletter and documents before his lordship."Sit down, young sir, while I look into these papers,"said the minister, taking up the packets.Hamilton Gower took a seat at a short distance an)}glanced from time to time at the face of the secretary, whowas now reading the letter of Squire Storkridge. The young man now fully appreciated the act of the greatsminister in giving his personal attention to a matter that;mighthave been referred to some of his numerous assisti.ants."This is the most cruel case of the kind that ever camer,under my notice," said the home secretary, as he finishedTreading the documents.The young gentleman bowed in respectful assent, and the?}elder one continued:"Measures'shall be at once taken to redress this grea'wrong, so far as it can be redressed; but what can com-'pensate to that unhappy girl for the injuries she has sf-lered-the distress of her trial and conviction, the miseryof five years of penal servitude?

And the minister bowed his head upon his chest with a deep sigh that revealed the painful sympathy of his soul."I wish to say to you, my lord, since your lordship so kindly takes some interest in this case, that the young girl,since her arrival in Tasmania, has had no suffering to en-counter, beyond that of exile-exile softened by the pres-ence and companionship of an aged relative, who precededher out to the colony, made a home for her there, and re-ceived her on her arrival in the only way in which he coulddo so, as his assigned servant, nominally, as his adopteddaughter really.""I am glad to hear it. I know such arrangements aresometimes made in the penal colonies. I am glad this hasbeen done in the case of this unfortunate girl.

I had supposed the shipwould sail on the first," said the young gentleman, respect-fully."The time of sailing has been changed," quietly re-sponded his lordship.The first feeling of Hamilton Gower on hearing this newswas one of disappointment-a delay of even ten days seemedvery grievous to him; but his next feeling, following almostinstantly upon the first, was one of delight at the thoughtthat this very delay would enable him to be the bearer ofthe order for Margaret Campbell's release, if only the min-ister would permit him to become so. He felt that he wasbeginning to trespass a little too long on the golden minutesof the home secretary; yet he could not help saying:"Again I beg your lordship's pardon and forbearance, but-I am going out to Australia by the steamer of the tenth,and I should be very happy to be intrusted with the orderfor Margaret Campbell's discharge."The minister reflected for a moment, and then said:mr   ~   "At present I see no objection to the plan.

The air be-came alive with the buzz of voices. It is true that rumorsof this deathbed declaration of the countess had prevailedand gained ground for weeks past; for the sick nurse hadprobably not been so reticent as prudence might have dic-tated to her to be; so the people were in a measure preparedfor the revelation; yet still to hear the rumor confirmed byevidence given under oath produced the most profound sen-sation.'The presiding magistrate gave an order that silenceshould be enforced or the hall should be cleared.This order had the effect of striking the spectators dumbfor the time being; and then Mr. Poinsett began to worrythe witness on the stand."You have a most wonderful memory, Mrs. Possett, tobe able to repeat, word for word, that dying declaration ofthe late countess-that dying declaration which was nevertaken down in writing I How is it that you can repeat thislesson so well ?" he sarcastically demanded."Your honors, I have repeated the last words of theCountess of Hawkewood, to the best of my knowledge, andthat is all I can do.

Even the deriders of his 'science' nevercalled him an impostor."I went with my tutor to see this wonderful personage.Curiosity impelled me to have my future forecast."He told me, or he foretold me, of every event of im-portance that has since happened to me-of the early deathof my father, who, indeed, died before my return to Eng-land; of my sudden and unexpected inheritance of wealth,landed estates and titles; of my marriage with a lady ofgreat beauty and high rank; and finally, of a series of ter-rible misfortunes that would happen to me in the secondyear of my marriage; of the loss of my wife and child bysudden death, and of a heavier calamity still-of my owni      apprehension and trial for the deepest crime known to thelaw-the heinous crime of murder."He either could not, or would not, tell me how thatcriminal trial was destined to terminate; whether I shouldbe acquitted or convicted of murder; or even whether Ishould deserve the one or the other fate. He answered to-   all my questions in his professional jargon:" 'The celestial sphere is veiled, the seer can see no more.'And so he took his fee and dismissed me; but I looked onthe dark side."You may wonder when I tell you that even then, before*^     one of those predictions had been fulfilled to justify my;_    forebodings, my mind was darkened and depressed, when inobedience to the powers of a magician, these'Forthcoming events cast their shadows before.'"But, then, I was superstitious by nature and by-train-ing, I was about to say. At least, the constant assdciationof a traveling tutor given to the study of the 'occult sci-ences' fostered a morbidly speculative disposition withinme."

You will soon hear."My father was in the prime of life, being scarcely ftwo years of age. He was of a very robust constituand had the finest health, never having had a day's in his life. He had no dangerous habits, was not ahunter, was not a heavy feeder or a hard drinker. Inhe had every prospect of living to be ninety or a hunyears of age. I could hardly believe in that portion ofastrologer's prophecy."Yet the first news that met me on my return to Ewas that my father had been killed in a railroad conwhen on his journey to meet me on my landing at Soampton !"I will not speak of the sorrow that overwhelmed mthat time. It has nothing to do with this case. But I mspeak of the horror that darkened my soul and obscuredreason, as I brooded morbidly over this unexpected flment of the astrologer's prediction."("Ah! ha ! he's going to set up the plea of insanity I !won't do, my lord!

Anyother mental trouble I might have confided to my minister;any other bodily ailment to my physician. But this trouble,preying on both mind and body, I was compelled to keep tomyself. I could not tell it to anyone."I sought forgetfulness in society, in travel, in wine, butfound it never. It was about fifteen months after this pre-diction had been made, and about twelve months after thefirst part of it had been fulfilled in the death of my father,that I was invited to attend the birthday festival of mycousin, the late Earl of Hawkewood, and I accepted the in-vitation and went to Hawke Hall on that fatal occasion."Now all that I have told you leads up to the explanationof my conduct at that time."I was really glad to make friends with my cousin aftera family feud of three generations. And I should haveenjoyed the festival had I not been overshadowed by theastrologer's prophecy of evil."The ball was kept up, as you-know, to a very late hourof the night, or rather to an early hour of the morning. I-according to a custom I was but too readily falling into-drank too much wine, and perhaps too much of strongerliquors."Thus it happened that when I left my room I lost my-self in the labyrinth of halls and corridors on the secondfloor, and as there seemed to be no servants at hand, it wassome time before I got back into the bachelors' corridor,where my room was situated."Then, by the most natural mistake, I went to mycousin's door instead of to my own, and was trying to open itcautiously for fear of disturbing my fellow lodgers, when Iwas startled by the sudden opening of the opposite doorai c the appearance of Dr. Laude.'"He saw the situation at once, told me I had mistakenthe door, and directed me to my own."I went to my room and went to bed, but some hourslater became so ill that I had to rise to seek relief.

You, Dr. Ball, were on the spot, as well as Dr.Laude and others.

I felt so comfortable that myone cigar grew to two or three. I was still smoking whenthe sound of some one walking in the corridor outside, andopening and shutting doors, reached my ears.1"Knowing that all the household had long retired, I be-lieved that a thief had in some way got into the house, andI wished to surprise him. So I took a revolver from its case,and instead of coming down the passage, I entered by a sidedoor into the bath room connected with the late earl's suiteof apartments, and passed through them all to its bedroomand then opened the door of that bedroom and stepped outinto the corridor ready to cover the intruder with my pistol."But I suddenly came upon my wife, who, on seeing me,stared until her face grew white with horror, and then, witha piercing scream, she fell into a swoon."I dropped the pistol, and stooped to raise her from thefloor. I heard steps rapidly approaching, and soon thehousekeeper was by my side, and with many anxious in-quiries that I was unable to answer, she followed me as Icarried the countess to her bedroom and laid her on the bed."You have heard from other witnesses that after thatnight my wife could not endure the sight of me for weeks."

He told of the tri-umphal acquittal of the prisoners and his own immediateentrance into his possessions."I had no time to write and advise you of these matters,dear sir, for I found by the change in the day of sailingthat I should be able to go personally on the same ship,which, had she sailed sooner, would have taken only my let-ters with the official order for Margaret Campbell's release.And so, by coming in person, although I have had a some-what rough and tedious voyage out, I have met you sixmonths sooner than I should otherwise have done.

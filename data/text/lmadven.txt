SOON after Wdjeaner Dr. Fenton drove over from

at the beginning of the winter. Mr. Hume does
not even know of her illness."
"It is one of those cases which develop very
quickly-inherited doubtless," said the doctor under
his breath. "Yes, poor girl, you ought to write to
Mr. Hume, Miss Mildmay; there is not a moment
to lose if he would see her alive."
" I will do so," said Kate.
"And now there is one thing more. I am callead

will do all that is necessary. I will ask him to-call
in a day or two; but really nothing.Van be done.
It is simply that she ought to have some one to see

look after you. And we won't call in another doctor
-not yet, because doctors are so often wrong."
" We ought to write to my uncle," said Kate
Bouverie, " and to Ralph Henley. I should like to see
Ralph once again. I should like to tell him myself
that I am dying; I should like to kiss him. Oh, Kate,
he was so handsome long ago; and he must be beauti-
ful now, for every one says he is like a young god.
And he loves me so much; he has never loved any
$I1 but me. Oh, Kate, Kate, I must see him again."
"We will write, of course, dear; we will write
to-night."
"How good you are to me, Kate! and yet I
didn't know you two months ago."
"I love you very much," said Kate Mildmay.
"But now I must leave you for a little. Fanchon
shall come in and sit with you, and I will take the
trap and drive to Mentone.  I shall be back as
quickly as possible, and will bring your medicine 
and my mother also. Cheer up, Kate; perhaps we
can save you after all. There is nothing like good -'
nursing. IDoctors are not half as important to a
sick person as a good nurse, and my mother is about
the best nurse in the wide world." 
Half-an-hour later Kate Mildmay was driving to
Mentone. She went first to the chemist's, desired the
prescription to b: made up, said she would call for
the medicine in  a-an-hour, and then turned her
horses head in the direction of a cheap pension where
her mother lived. It was a very cheap pension indeed,

somewhat fair type of face was standing kicking his
heels impatiently in the outer room of a lawyer's
office. He had frank blue eyes, and a pleasant ex-

all over him, from his bronzed cheek to his firm,
well-knit hands and athletic figure.
A clerk came up and spoke.
"Mr. Hume will see you now, Mr. Henley, will  i

Henley stepped across the room, a door was 
flung open, and he entered a large inner apartment.
A man with ironrey hair rose as he approached,

Henley glanced at him when he said this. It was
quite impossible that Kate could know this creature.
He hurried his steps.
"Yes," continued the stranger briskly, "I am
well acquainted with Mrs. Mildmay. The loss of her 
daughter was a terrible blow to her. She is an active,
enterprising, clever woman; I never met a cleverer. I
believe Ihavethe honour of addressing Mr.Henley. You
must have noticed what I mean, have you not, sir ?"
"I can't say I have," answered Henley.  He
earnestly desired to get rid of this most obstrusive
man, but had never in his life been intentionally rude
to any one. "Forgive me," he added; "I am in a
hurry, and must be going forward."
The man laughed in a coarse manner.
" I can accommodate my steps to yours,'" he said.
"Perhaps you are thinking that we will never meet
again. Would you like me to make a bet on the
subject ?"
"I do not bet with strangers," replied Henley.
"All the same, I wish to make a statement. We'
shall meet again-and yet again."
Henley had long legs, and he now strode quickly
forward. .
" I should like to tell you my name, sir," said the
stranger, whose squat legs had some difficulty in
keeping pace with Henley's long strides. "Surely it
is not necessary for you to walk quite so fast; I am
a little blown, and it is really important that I should
say something. By-and-by you will be able to recall
the circumstances of this apparently incidental meet-

The blood mounted to Henley's cheeks.

"I decline to discuss my future wife with you,"
retorted Henley.
'The valley they were walking up now narrowed,
and the way was lonely. Henley was a slighter man
than Merriman.  Merriman looked quickly around
him. With a quick stride he came forward, and now
stood in Henley's path.
" I am a desperate man; and I want ten pounds,"
he said. " It is worth your while to be civil to me;
I can make things hot for you if you are not. Will

"Certainly not."

"No, they do not part here," said the stranger.
He rushed upon Henley, caught him by the collar,
and, by a deft and sudden movement, hurled him to
IJihe ground. 
"There," he said, placing his knee on the chest
of his captive; "I am up now, and you are down.
It is a pleasant reversion of our ordinary positions,
and I am in no hurry to put an end to it. Give me
your purse; I won't leave you until you do."
"You are a beggarly ruffian; and if you can take
my purse you may, but I don't intend to give it you,"
said Henley.
The man looked steadily at him. He read the
determination in his eyes, rose abruptly, and stood a
little way off.

DOES it look all right, Mary ?" said Ethel Hume.
"Does what look all right ? " was the reply.
Why the room-her room; does it look as it
ought to look ? I have been taking such immense
pains with it."
"You fuss too much about things, Ethel. Why
should the mere fact of Kitty Bouverie coming here
upset everything ? You talk of no one but Kitty, and
now you make such a fuss about her room." 
" I wish you would look round it. I have brought
you here on purpose, and you have not said a single
word." 
"It looks charming."  Mary glanced round the
spacious apartment as she spoke. It was quite a
modern room, and newly decorated. There was a 
high dado round the walls; the dado was painted 
white. Above was a rich flock-paper of china-blue.
The room had several windows, right down to the
ground, which opened with French doors. Most rof.
the windows stood open now, and the bright spring 
sunshine and the delightful spring breeze came in and
filled the pretty room.
"'What is the idea of this ?" said Mary suddenly..
She walked over to the mantelpiece and looked at
a crayon drawing of a little girl which Ethel had
placed there. "Where did you unearth that thing ?"
she asked. 
so              .

"I knew such a picture existed, and I made a
tour up to the attics this morning and discovered it,"
replied Ethel. " Isn't it good ? Wasn't she a dear
little creature when that was done ?"
"So she was. What a pretty dimple she had in
her left cheek, and what rosy cheeks they were, and
pretty eyes; but that is a long time ago. I suppose
she will be immensely altered."
" Father says she is. He said in some ways he
would scarcely know her; but Ralph is infatuated,
and that's the main thing."
" I trust she won't be disagreeable. However, it
will be fun going to town with her and helping her
to get her trousseau; won't it, Ethel ?"
" I suppose so," replied Ethel. " You do seriously
think the room all right, Mary ?"
"Seriously, my dear, good Ethel, it is a room fit
for a princess. Now do let us come downstairs and
attend to other matters. The Jervises are going to
drive over to tea, and the Macdonalds want us to get
up a tennis tournament to-morrow. There are a great
many other people and things in the world beside
Kate Bouverie; try to remember that, Ethel."
"I cannot just at present. I feel wonderfully
excited. I am very glad she is coming back; I used
to be so fond of the little Kitty of long ago."
"I hear the sound of wheels," said Mary. " Let
us go out on the drive and be ready to welcome them."
The two girls went and stood on the steps of the
!. old house. The Grange was a house with many
modern additions; but the centre part was a couple
; of centuries old. There were modern wings, how-
itver, both to left and right, in which were numerous 
i_1ght bed-rooms and pleasant sitting-rooms; and the :.

grounds were spacious and exquisitely kept. The
entire place was an ideal English home. With the
westerly sun shining now in long slanting bars across
the grass and the trees bowing slightly to the breeze
the place looked its best.
A carriage drove rapidly up the avenue and stopped
at the front entrance. The two girls ran down the
steps and held out eager hands of welcome. A girl
stepped out and kissed Ethel on her cheek.
"You are Ethel ?" she said.
"Yes, of course, I am Ethel. Dear me, Kate,
how altered you are! I always called you Kitty in
my heart; but somehow you look more like Kate
now."
"I feel more like Kate; do call me Kate in the
future. Oh, what fun it is to see you again! How
is Aunt Susannah ? Is she well ?"
" Mother is never well, Kitty; you ought to re-
member that," said Mary in a grave tone. "She
suffers from her back, and is lying down; but she
will be very glad to see you and welcome you. Come
this way, please."
Mary had a grave, reproving kind of tone, and
Kate cast a laughing glance at Ethel, who slipped her
arm round her waist.
"Although you look different, you are in reality
just the same," she cried. "It was only at first I
thought you changed. You have still got that delight-
ful dimple in your cheek and that wayward sort of
caressing manner. Oh, I am delighted to welcome you
back again. I have loved you all these years, and you
have been such a good girl to correspond with me."
"I wonder what I said," thought Kate to herself.

" You are well educated, dear, are you not ? You
realise the great responsibilities which await you ?"
"I am afraid I don't," said Kate, laughing.
Mary looked shocked, but Ethel smiled.
"Don't you remember, mother," she said, "our
dear little Kitty of old, how she always would shirk
anything disagreeable. She does not want to talk
about her great responsibilities the first minute she
comes home. Do you, Kitty ?"
"That is just it," answered Kate.  "I realise
them, but at the present moment I am too happy to
think about them."
"And yet, my love, you come back to us without
your dear, dear father."
" Oh, of course, I sorrowed for father very much;
but I am happy to be back again in England. And
then remember, Aunt Susannah, I am engaged to
Ralph, and I love him-oh, so deeply."
"He is a splendid fellow, dear; and I am glad
you are happy. It would be selfish of us old people
if our young friends grieved for us too long. It is
the way of the world, my dear-the way of the
world. Mary, you may drop that Venetian blind
again; the light hurts my eyes. Ah, yes, Kate, I am
a sad invalid-but glad to see you, very glad. Now
go to your room and get ready for dinner."
"Ralph says he will be down to-night, and I
wonder if my boxes have come ?" said Kate, eagerly
turning to her two cousins.
The three left the room together. Mrs. Hume
lay on the sofa and thought.
"Pretty-but not exactly what I expected," she
thought. "There used to be a look about the face
of the child Kate-a sort of spiritual look which the

The lawyer bent down and kissed his wife.
"You look quite faded, Susannah, in this dark
room. Cannot you manage to let in a little more

The light hurts my eyes."
I wish you would not imagine that," he said im-
patiently. "The room is terribly dark. Won't you join
us at dinner to-night? Ralph will be down immediately
afterwards, and there is a great deal to talk over."
"I will try to, Robert."
Mr. Hume bustled away, and Mrs. Hume lay
still.  Tears rose slowly to her eyes; they rolled
down her thin cheeks. She stretched out her hand,
touched an electric bell, and a maid appeared.
"Thompson," said the lady, " take my keys and
open that drawer to the left in my secretary."
The girl did so.
"You will see a packet tied with a faded blue
ribbon. Give it to me."
"This is it, is it not, ma'am ?"
"Yes. You can leave me now, Thompson, for
half-an-hour, but come back then, as I wish to dress
for dinner to-night, and you can help to move me
into the dining-room. Bring with you my Venetian
point collar and my gold bracelets. But I will not
change this dress; I am too tired."
"Very well, ma'am."
"And, in the meantime, go to the young ladies
and see if you can help in any way. Miss Bouverie
will be tired after her journey, and will probably like
you to unpack her boxes."

"We are dying to hear you sing," she said.
"To hear me sing ?" answered Kate.    She 
coloured and then turned pale. She went over to*
the window and looked out.
"To hear me sing ? " she repeated.
"Yes, Kate ; Uncle Christopher was always writ-

always telling us what your masters said. Oh, it
will be splendid to hear you. And, you know, Kate,
you look like a musician."
" I am devoted to music," said Kate. She seated
herself quietly on the nearest chair.
"Your voice is a great deep contralto, is it not ?"
"Yes, a deep contralto." 
"And your master praised it ?"
"He said I had a good voice," replied Kate, in a
modest tone. " But I have not sung for some time,"
she added.
t What a dreadful pity ! Voices go off so when
they are not kept up by daily practice," said Mary, in
a practical tone. "Ralph is mad about music. You
used to sing like a bird when you were a little thing,
Kitty. It will be delightful to hear you and Ralph
singing duets together. You will both sing for us
this evening, won't you ?"
" I am sorry, but I cannot."
"Oh, Kitty; not even one little song ? And we
have been so looking forward to it. You are not
tired, and you have not got a cold."
" There is something wrong with my throat," said

dinner ?"
"My jewel-case is at the bottom of one of my

bright smile.
"Oh, father, what do you think ?" said Mary,
bending forward at that moment. "Kitty says that
her voice is quite out of order; she cannot sing a
note at present. There is something wrong with her
throat. She must go immediately to a specialist."

'I HAVE to tread on thorns," thought.the new Kate

Whether it was safely over

a long step into that future which so
uazdkd, perplexed, excited, and alarmed her.  Her
heart had beat too fast for comfort more than once
: during the evening. She had made two unpleasant
F discoveries-the real Kate had been possessed of a
glorious voice; the false Kate had no singing voice
':whatsoever. Then there was the Maharaja's myste-
'iious diamond; the present Kate had never heard of
diamond.
Beyond these two disagreeable matters everything
gone smoothly. Every one in the house had
en her for granted. She was what she repre-
ed herself to be-Kate Bouverie, the child who
been loved in that house long ago. She was the
r   -ess-and the betrothed of Ralph Henley. Al-
yRaph loved her, Kate was quite certain, for
Wif. Whether he could stand the test of knowing
t she had really done remained to be proved; but
!he loved her she had little doubt. Her heart
:agr.eably and her hopes were high.  All the
try as she would, she could not sleep.

depth of the country. Every one had gone to bed.
Kate lay still for the greater part of an hour, then
she got up; she had something to do. She knew
well that many, many days, months-perhaps years
-must pass before she could feel absolutely safe.
During all that time it behoved her to be carefpl
never to relax her vigilance, never for a single instant
to let herself go. Dangers might present themselves
at any moment; always and always there must be
rocks ahead-that awful past, which, notwithstanding
Kate Bouverie's diary, she knew so little about, must
ever and ever stand up to confront her. At any
moment, with all her care, she might give herself
away. Not until she had been the happy wife of
Ralph Henley for years would her fears slumber.
Well, be the dangers what they might, Kate was de-
termined that she would not fail; she would stick to
her r6le, she would be Kate Bouverie until she be-
came Kate Henley. She would be the heiress of
all the wealth, the enjoyer of all the pleasure. The
nameless Kate in her grave at Mentone should bear
her old personality. And she would be true to the
difficult post she had elected to occupy. 
She rose and put on her dressing-gown. She lit
some candles, and, opening her largest trunk, took
from it a jewel-case. She had managed to evade the
earnest requests of the Hume family that she should
exhibit the Maharaja's diamond that evening; but she
knew that, sooner or later, they must see it. In all
probability Uncle Robert would the very next day
demand a sight of her jewels, and the diamond, which
was supposed to be worth three thousand pounds,
would certainly be expected to be forthcoming.
Now Kate in her humble past had nothing what-

AN ADVENTURESS                63
to do with jewels. There was not a girl in the
who knew less about their true value. She
ot an idea where the real Kate had hidden

<pb n="64"/>
64           AN ADVENTURESS
Kate felt her heart beating fast. She knew that
her cheeks were turning pale. A wild terror seized
her. Suppose it had been stolen!   What in the
world had become of it ?
Suddenly it flashed through her mind that in jewel-
cases of the old-fashioned make there were generally
secret drawers. She uttered a pleased exclamation.
Of course, the great diamond was concealed in the
secret drawer. Now to search for it. It would look
very bad if she did not know the way of getting at her
own secret drawer in her own jewel-case ; but search
and fidget, and press and shake the little case as she
would, nowhere could she find the drawer. Finally
she had to get into bed without having the least idea
where the diamond was.
The next morning, while sitting before her glass
as her maid brushed her hair, it suddenly flashed
through her mind that perhaps Marryat could tell
her the secret of the drawer. She turned suddenly
to the girl.
"I am anxious to have some jewels reset before
my marriage," she said. " Do you see that jewel-case
on the dressing-table-it is very old-fashioned, and
not at all to my mind. I mean to have my jewels
put into a proper safe in my room when I am married,
but the provoking thing is that the spring to the
secret drawer is broken.  I have a very valuable
diamond in the drawer, and I cannot unfasten it."
"Supposeyou let me try, miss," said the girl. "I have
often had the care of jewel-cases for my mistresses,
and I know many of the tricks of the secret drawers."
" I wish you would," said Kate. "But the spring
is certainly broken. I do not think you will be able
to get the drawer open."



<pb n="65"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                 65
Kate put the jewel-case into the girl's hand.
Karryat opened the case, looked with envy at some
of the gems which were, she saw at a glance, of very
fine quality, but, try as she would, she could not find
the trick of the drawer.
"You are quite sure there is a secret drawer, miss ?"
"Of course I am.  I have a beautiful diamond
in it. Dear, dear, how very tiresome!"
"You must take the case to a jeweller, miss. He
will soon open the drawer for you."
"Perhaps it is the best thing to do," replied Kate.
"I have to go to town this morning on various
matters, and I will take you with me, Marryat. I will
order acarriage and go immediately after breakfast."
"Do the young ladies of the house accompany
you, miss ?"
" Not to-day, for I shall be particularly busy. By
the way, ?larryat, do not say anything about my
jewel-case when you go downstairs. I cannot have
a maid about me who tattles. You are very discreet
in that respect, are you not ?"
"Certainly, miss. I have always had the char-
acter of being discreet."
At breakfast Kate announced her intention of
going to town.
"I mean to drive," she said. "I can order a
carriage at the nearest livery stables, can I not,
Uncle Robert ?"
"Certainly, my dear. We will send a messenger
to Bates; he can supply you with a very decent
landau."
-' I should love to accompany you," said Ethel,
tei-paie face dimpling with pleasure.
"So you shall, Ethel, another day. But I have

a great deal to do to-day, and may just as well be
alone.  I shall take Marryat, of course.  By the
way, I must go to the throat specialist."
"Oh yes; don't forget that, Kitty," said her
uncle, looking up from his paper at the moment.
"Be sure you see Sir John Orme. He is the best
throat man far and away in London. But you had
better make an appointment with him. I will make
it for you, if you like."
"Oh no; I will call on the chance," said Kate,
reddening a little.  "What did you say Sir John
Orme's address was ?"
"40 Queen Anne Street, near Harley Street."
"Well, I shall be very busy, and would be glad
if you would send round for the carriage at once,"
continued Kate. " You won't be disappointed, Ethel ?
You shall come with me another day."
"I must try to bear up-but I am disappointed,"
replied Ethel.
Kate gave her a smile, stretching out her hand
under the table to squeeze Ethel's.
Ethel was considerably fascinated by Kate.-, But
Kate now observed that Mary lolked at her with a
watchful and perplexed glance.
In about an hour the carriage arrived, and Kate
and Marryat set off.  Kate held the jewel-case on
her lap.
As soon as they got to town she dismissed the
maid.
" Here is a long list of commissions I want you
to do for me," she said. "Here is money to pay
for them. I shall be at Charing Cross at four this
afternoon.  Meet me then.    Be sure you are
punctual. Meet me at the main entrance."        o



<pb n="67"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                 67
"You will be in the carriage, miss ?"
"Certainly. Now, see you attend to these com-
missions; and in especial go to Madame Coblentz
and arrange for an appointment. I want to choose
my Court dress. I am to be presented at the first
drawing-room after my marriage."
"Certainly, miss."
The maid got out and went her way, and Kate
gave directions to the coachman.
"Drive to Rider and Mansell in Bond Street,"
_ she said. The man turned the horses' heads in that
direction, and in a very few minutes they drew up
outside the great jeweller's shop. A man came out
to assist Kate to alight and to carry the jewel-case
into the shop. Before going, Kate told her coach-
man that he was to meet her at Charing Cross at four
o'clock that afternoon. She then dismissed him. As
she entered the shop she gave a little skip of joy.
"Free and unobserved for three or four hours,"
she muttered under her breath. "How nice ! I begin
to feel my silken chains somewhat heavy."
A smilirig and subservient shopman bent across
the counter to await her pleasure. Kate opened the
jewel-case and told him that she had lost the knack
of the secret drawer.
;  Either the spring is broken, or I have forgotten
the knack," she said. "I have not been wearing my
jewels for some time. I have some valuable jewels
;: in the drawer. I wish you would open it for me."
The man lifted the case and examined it care-
·fually.                  r
"The secret drawer is here," he said. "I believe
i:can open it in a moment or two. Do you object to
Hmy taking the case into my workshop ? "

"Certainly not. Find the drawer, get it open, and
bring the case back to me," was Kate's careless answer.
The man retired with the case into an inner room.
He brought it back in a few moments with the drawer
open.
"See," he said, " this was the trick. The spring
was not broken at all; it was hidden behind  "
"To be sure. How stupid I am!" said Kate,
laughing.  "I often used to press that knot in my
mother's time. Now, will you see me do it ? I press
just here, is it not so ? How stupid I was to have 
forgotten!"
The man did not say that he thought it very
strange of Kate to have forgotten. On the contrary,
he began to examine some of the jewels.
" You have a very valuable diamond in this drawer, 
if you will allow me to say so, miss."  As he spoke he
took out an unset stone.
"When this diamond is cut it will be of magnifi-
cent brilliance," he said. "It is, I can see at a glance,
of the first water."             -
Kate's eyes sparkled. Of course, here was the
Maharaja's diamond.  Her spiris rose higher each
moment.
"That stone ought to be valuable," she said. "It
was given to my late father in India. It was a present
from the Maharaja of Ruapore."
The man looked at it with immense respect.
"It is a magnificent stone," he said. " We should
be very pleased to cut and set it for you."
"I must speak to my uncle before I give it up to
you," replied Kate. "I will let you know in a day or
two, In the meantime, please have these pearls reset :;
and also this diamond necklet."

she made arrangements with him to have lessons on
the pianoforte two or three times a week, and also to
have the use of a private piano in order to practise
whenever she wished to.
"So far, so good," she said to herself. "My
voice is gone, and gone for ever; but the old Kate 
was a wonderful pianist. I know a little about music,
but I have much to learn. I have made up my mind
that I also will be a wonderful pianist in a short time.
Now the next step is to find time to practise-to prac-
tise continually four or five hours a day, and if neces-
sary, far on into the night. This cannot be managed '
at the Grange. I shall take a small flat in town, and
live there with Marryat. If Uncle Robert disapproves
I cannot help it.  Yes, I shall take a flat and come
up to-morrow. I wonder where I had best go."
After a little thought Kate decided to drive to
Chelsea, see a house-agent, and get orders to view
several flats.  She was nothing if she was not
quick and determined. Before two o'clock that
afternoon she had settled on a flat which exactly
suited her. It was a furnished oneqnd looked upon 
the river.  She decided to take It off-hand, and
told the people that she would arrive the following
day. She then spent the rest of the afternoon in the
British Museum, searching through old files of news-
papers in order to get particulars with regard to
the great occasion when Mr. Bouverie obtained that
wonderful uncut diamond from   the Maharaja of
Ruapore.

CHAPTER IX
[THAT evening Kate gave a lively account of her
adventures.  She made the Hume party laugh
heartily. She herself was in the highest spirits.
tI     "I hope, Kate," said Mr. Hume, "that you went
[  to see the aurist, Sir John Orme; we are all so
anxious about the recovery of your voice. JBut
; perhaps Sir John could not see you without an
appointment? "
' Yes, I went to his house and saw him," answered
. "He examined my throat, and says I must
attempt to use it for some months. He has
da strengthening gargle and a tonic."
e Did he say nothing about voice exercise?"
edMrs. Hume. "Voice exercises are so splendid
the throat.  For instance, a few notes of the
le every day."
"He said that at present I must not sing at all,"
)lied Kate. "The vocal chords are strained, and
I whole throat is in a relaxed condition."
"-!Most provoking!" cried Mr. Hume. "I did
*xok forward to hearing you sing. Nothing rests
~!more in the evening than really good singing,
unfortunately, neither Ethel nor Mary have
s to speak of. Then Ralph, too, is nearly music

As he spoke he looked with some concealed
anxiety at his niece. Was it possible that Kate,
splendidly well as she looked, was really consump-
tive ? There was such a dreadful taint in the family.
She certainly did not look like it, but that failure of
her voice at such an early age, might point to mis-
chief in the lower part of the larynx. He half thought
of seeing Sir John Orme himself on the subject, but
resolved if he did so to say nothing to Kate.
Towards the end of dinner, Miss Bouverie bent
slightly forward, laid her hand on her uncle's arm,
and spoke-
-" I do hope you won't all be awfully offended;"
she said. " I love you all, and it is delightful to be
amongst my own dear relations again---"
"Well, out with it, Kitty," said her uncle.
Kate swallowed something in her throat. She
was reluctant to tell about the flat, but it was abso-
lutely necessary that she should do so.
"I have always observed," said Mary, in an im-
patient voice, "that when people wish to say a truly
unpleasant thing they preface it somewhat in the way
you have just done, Kate. If you fke your relations,
why should you do anything to offend them ?"
"I hope I shall not offend you; but the fact
is I have not been accustomed to living with a lot
of people   "i
;" My dear-when you were with your father in
his great palace at Ruapore! My dear child, you
must have forgotten."
"No, I have certainly not forgotten," replied
Kate impatiently-her eyes were gleaming now, and
there was a brilliant colour in her cheeks-" but can
you not understand that a number of Indian servants



<pb n="73"/>

and a great deal of entertaining are not like being with
your own people ? And, then, the palace of Ruapore
was so big, that when I liked to be in my rooms I
was quite alone. I am passionately fond of music,
and I cannot practise as I wish in this house."
"Oh yes, that you can, Kate," exclaimed her
aunt. " You shall have the little turret room at the
top of the spiral stairs all to yourself. We can have
a piano sent in to-morrow."
Kate shook her head.
:-: ~ " It is just like you, Aunt Susannah. But I don't
/think it will do. Sir John Orme has not forbidden
/  me to use my fingers, and these fingers must rattle
over the keys for many hours a day.  Well, here
This the dreadful secret. I want to live alone. Yes, I
do, I do-I shall come and see you all constantly-
but I must live alone. And I have taken the dearest,
sweetest little furnished flat in Chelsea-the most
bjyou place in the world-and I am going there to-
morrow. Now, Uncle Robert, you are not really
angry with me?"
As she spoke she rose from her seat, ran up to
Mr. Hume, and threw her arms round his neck.
"You are not angry," she repeated; and now
2 she kissed him on his forehead.
|?  - There could scarcely anywhere be found softer
dips than Kate's. And Kate's eyes were of the most
iant in the world. In spite of himself, Mr. Hume
,,influenced by her beauty. It suddenly occurred to
tthat the idea was not so bad after all. He could
yvisit Kate in her flat. It would be necessary for
to see so much of her-and at all hours, too-for
were the settlements to be got up, and there
:e administration of all her large property. So



<pb n="74"/>
74             AN ADVENTURESS
although he shook his head and told her that she was
a very extravagant, discontented puss, 'he did not
object to her living alone as much as she feared.
"For my part I think it is rather a good idea,"
said Ethel-" more particularly as I hope you mean
me to live with you. You surely cannot live in your
flat alone ?"
"You shall come and see me sometimes," re-
plied Kate; "but I mean to live alone. Yes, I am
quite determined; it is one of my idiosyncracies.
And now, shall I run upstairs for my jewel-case ?
You asked last night to see the Maharaja's diamond. 
I have unpacked the case to-day and can show it
to you."
"Ah !" said Mr. Hume, "that's a good girl. We
certainly shall be interested to see that stone. Come,
Susan, dear; we can easily wheel your sofa into the
drawing-room. You also would like to see the price-
less stone which poor Christopher wrote to us about."
Mrs. Hume was wheeled into the drawing-room,
and Kate ran upstairs for her jewel-case. She knew
all about its contents now.  She could tell her
quondam relations all about the pearls she was having
re-strung and the diamond necWet which was being
reset, and for which she had ordered a diamond clasp.
Then as to the Maharaja's diamond, had she not
read all about that splendid uncut stone in the Times
at the British Museum?   She felt that she could
scarcely give herself away now with regard to the
Maharaja's diamond.
In her absence, Mr. Hume had placed a small
card-table opposite one of the windows, had drawn
down the blinds, placed a lamp in such a position
that the table should be in the most brilliant light,



<pb n="75"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                75 
and now motioned Kate to seat herself at her aunt's
right hand. The jewel-case was placed in the centre
of the table and solemnly opened.
The girls exclaimed when they saw the different
jewels, and began fingering the rings and looking
with eyes of longing at some soft lustrous pearl
ear-rings.
" Oh, what it is to be rich !" said Mary, with a
sigh. She glanced at Kate as she spoke, and for the
first time in honest Mary's life a feeling of envy
possessed her. But for Kate's existence, would not
she and Ethel be the heiresses?  For them would
be the jewels, and the money, and the beautiful
country home. For one of them, too, there might
even be Ralph Henley. They both considered Ralph
a prince amongst men, and felt that a very little
persuasion would have been needed to give him
their hearts. How different their lot in life would
have been but for Kate! Here Mary shook herself.
What horrid thoughts she was indulging in. For
there was Kate-Kate in the flesh, strong, wilful, and
handsome. Kate, who had not the slightest idea of
dying in order to convenience them, and whom they
both really loved. Oh yes; of course they loved her
devotedly, although somehow she kept disappoint-
ing them all day long. Neither girl could under-
stand why Kate disappointed them, but they-felt it all
the same; and now Mary dropped the pearls, and
Ethel put the rings back into the case.
"But I have not yet seen the diamond," said
' Mr. Hume.
; Kate gave a little pout.
;i~-::l  Of course you haven't seen it," she answered;
?fiis in the secret drawer."



<pb n="76"/>
76           AN ADVENTURESS
"Ah !" he cried. "You know the trick of the 
secret drawer, of course, my love ?"
"Well, is it likely I should not, Uncle Robert ?"
Here Kate pressed a spring, the drawer flew open,
and from the depths of the soft, faintly-scented Oriental
wool she produced the great diamond. Earlier in
the day several other diamonds of great value had
reposed by its side. But now it was alone. The
other diamonds were lying upstairs, wrapped in some
ordinary cotton-wool, in a little ordinary English box
that Mrs. Mildmay had given to her daughter some
years ago. The little box, containing the diamonds
worth hundreds of pounds, lay unprotected in the lid
of Kate's trunk. Never mind! Before many days
had passed she would convert them all into money.
"Here is the great diamond," she said, laying it
solemnly in the palm of her hand. Spots of excite-
ment had stolen into each of her cheeks and her eyes
looked strangely bright.
"Oh," she said, glancing round at her uncle,
aunt, and cousins, "shall I ever forget the great day
when my dear father received this priceless gem ?
Of course, I was with him, and the Maharaja noticed
me personally. Do you know what he did ? Oh, it
was disappointing. He tried to clasp a valuable gold
belt all studded with jewels round my waist. He had
taken it away from his favourite wife. He meant to
give it to me if I could clasp it. But I couldn't, my
waist was too big. Oh, I never was so cross about
anything. I almost cried."
Mrs. Hume now nearly cried herself with laughter.
"Your dear father wrote such a funny letter
about all that," she said. " He called you a covetous,
wicked little Kitty. It certainly was a pity you didn't



<pb n="77"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                77
get the belt, Kate. Didn't the Maharaja give you
something else in its place ?"
"He gave me nothing. That's just like them.
They offer you a thing one moment, and if you
can accept it well and good. But the belt was his
favourite wife's. And oh; how relieved she looked
when she saw me trying in vain to clasp it round my
waist. Wasn't she pleased when it wouldn't meet!
Oh, how I longed to say, 'Give me something else
instead.' But, of course, I couldn't."
"Let us look at the diamond now," said Mrs.
Hume. "What a pity it is not cut! it looks quite a
dull, ordinary sort of stone. Who would suppose it
was of such immense value."
"It is worth between two and three thousand
pounds," said Mr. Hume. " That is what your father
said when he wrote to us about it, Kate. We must
have it set, and you shall wear it on your wedding-
day.  Ah! and here comes Henley.     How do
you do, Ralph?    You would like to see the
Maharaja's diamond ?"
Henley took a chair near Kate's side.  She
dropped the unset diamond into his palm.
"Look," she said. "Look well.  That priceless
stone is yours and mine."
- ." 'Yours and mine ?" he answered, glancing into
face.
"Yes, yours and mine."

"It is a diamond, Ralph, and a very valuable
one," said Mr. Hume. "Tell him, Kate, how it got
into your possession."
Kate rose, laid her hand on her lover's arm, and
motioned to him to follow her to the other end of
the room. They were standing by the open window
when Mr. Hume came up and spoke.
"I shall have that diamond set for your wedding, 
Kate. You must wear it on your marriage-day."
"No," said Ralph; "I like her best without
diamonds. I only want you, Kate, not your precious
stones."
Kate dropped the diamond into her uncle's palm,
smiled up at Ralph, and they both strolled into the
garden.
The moonlight shone all over her face. Ralph
thought her the most beautiful woman in the world.
"I wish you would make that nice speech again,"
she said in a low voice.
"What speech, dearest ?"
"That you want me-not my diamonds."
"But, of course, Kitty, what else couldyou expect?" 
"I don't know," she answeed, flushing. "But
it's nice to know it. It is very nice."  A rare note
of true and deep feeling stole into her voice.
"I wonder if-" she said, a trifle shyly, "you
would say something still nicer ? "
'f will say anything you want me to say. But
what do you mean ?"
"Ralph, if I were a poor girl, if I didn't bring
you a great deal of money, would you still love me ? 
Or, if I had lost all the money, would you still 'vant i
your Kitty ?"
" My darling, need you ask ? Surely you 4d-not

suppose I am marrying you for the sake of your
money. The money is there and I cannot help it.
But I want you, my darling-you, and nothing else.
If you had not a penny in the world, you would still
be the only woman I could love. Why ? what is the
matter, Kate ? You are trembling."
"I am listening to your words. No wonder I
tremble. They mean a great deal. You do love me
just for myself ?"
" Just and only for yourself."
Kate's face went very white.
" But what is the matter, dearest ? Why should
this upset you ?"
"It doesn't really upset me; it gives me the most
intense pleasure. It is true, then, that you really,
really love me. Do you think, Ralph, you would
love me even if I were  -"
"Even if you were what ?"
" Even if I were not quite the best girl in the
world ?"
"Why, my dearest, of course you're not the best
girl in the world. I don't want to marry an angel: I
want my wife to be a sweet little human girl. What
are those lines of Wordsworth's ?
"'A creature not too bright and good

to find out, dear Ralph, that I  "
" Find out what, my darling ? What are you try-
ing to say, my little Kitty ? Any one would suppose
that you, who have led the most innocent, the purest,
the whitest of lives, had done something dreadful. I
have only to show you your own letters to prove
to you what a little white page your life's story has
been."
"Yes, yes," she answered restlessly. " But still,
even letters do not tell everything. Oh, I have often
had bad thoughts, and all sorts of things have happened.
I won't talk of them now, but sometimes I think I
would rather you knew everything, Ralph."
"You shall tell me what you like when we are
married. My poor little love, I suppose you think a
fit of temper or a little bit of a sulk the most serious
offence in the world."
Ralph looked down anxiously into Kate's face.
Lightly as he appeared to take them, her words
troubled him.  Of course, there was nothing in
them-only a girl's exaggerated way of looking at
things. And she was highly strung; there was no 
doubt whatever of that.
" Oh, Ralph," she cried, suddenly changing her
tone, " to think that you would love me even if I hadn't 
thirty thousand a year."
" My dear," he answered, " I have loved you since
you were eleven years old."
Kate's face, which had been brilliant and full of
strange emotions at the beginning of this speech, lost
some of its bright expression towards its close. The
fact that Ralph had loved the real Kate Bouverie was
little satisfaction to her.

"Let us talk about something else," she said rest-
lessly. "I can never do with sentiment very long.
Do you know what I have done ?"
"What ?"
"I have taken a little flat in Chelsea."
"You I What do you mean ?"
"I have done it, Ralph. I don't want to be at
the Grange all the time between now and our mar-
riage. I like best to live alone. Of course, I shall
like best of all to live with you, darling; but until then
I prefer being by myself, and just seeing my dear kind
relations when they choose to come to me or when I
can find time to run down to them. Whether you
like it or not, Ralph-and I am afraid you do not like
it, from the expression on your face-the deed is
done."
"Have you told Mr. Hume ?"
"Yes; and after a little persuasion he has made
up his mind that he quite approves."
"But you cannot live there by yourself ?"
",I shall live there with my maid, Marryat, and
my other servants."
"Why cannot you get Ethel or Mary to stay with
you ? I wish you would."
"They shall come and see me sometimes, but I
prefer to live alone. I am going to Chelsea to-morrow.
I have engaged servants ; everything is in train. Will
you come and see me to-morrow evening ? "
Just then Mary Hume came out and stood on the
balcony.
"Mother wants you to sing something for her,
Ralph. Will you ? She does so enjoy your songs."
Ralph gave a pleased exclamation.
"Good I Mary," he said, "I was almost forgetting.

Kitty will join me in a song, of course, won't you, 
Kate ?" 
"I am sorry to disappoint you," answered Kate,
"but the specialist whom I saw to-day won't allow
me to use my voice for some months."
"Your voice ?  Impossible!  I have been so
looking forward to hearing you sing. Surely there
is nothing wrong with it ?"
"My throat is in a relaxed condition, and the
vocal chords are out of order.  Just at present I
must not use it."
"What specialist did you go to ? "
"Sir John Orme, of Queen Anne Street. Uncle
Robert recommended him.".,
"And rightly," replied Henley. "You could not
be in safer hands. Do you know, I have a queer
piece of news to give you. Sir John and his people
are some of my oldest friends, and I am going there
to lunch to-morrow. I shall ask him all about you; B
it is most important that no stone should be left un-
turned to restore your voice." 
Kate was silent.- 



<pb n="83"/>
CHAPTER X
ONE or two days later, when Miss Bouverie was
thoroughly established in her pretty little flat, Henley
walked in. She had been practising for some hours,
and jumped up now from the piano bright and
radiant.
" No, you are not to hear me yet," she said, with
a smile. " I find I lost much of my former skill by
not touching the piano for some months, but long
before we are married I shall be able to play you
anything in the world you like, Ralph darling. Now,
then, let us sit by the open window. Oh, it is so good
to see you, and to feel that we shall not be interrupted."
"By the way, Kate," said her lover, "I have
something to tell you. I wasn't able to go to the
Ormes' yesterday, but I went to-day."
" Oh, don't mind about the stupid Ormes," inter-
rupted Kate. "Talk about yourself."
"But it is strange, my love; just listen.  Sir
John was present, and as he was leaving the room
I followed him and spoke about you.  He prides
himself on remembering all about his patients-their
names, and everything-but he could not recall any-
thing whatever about you. When he went to look in
his case-book, he found that your name was not
entered. I must say, I was dissatisfied."
" How funny of him to forget !" said Kate. " But
I'm afraid I have no solution of the mystery." Her

face had turned pale for a moment, but now her eyes
looked bright and resolved. " I called on him and got
his prescription. What can he be thinking about ?"
"He says you had better come again."
" So I will in a week or two, when I have given
his gargles a careful trial. But don't let us bother
about it any more now, Ralph. I am so happy here;
it is so much nicer than staying at the Grange."
" You don't seem to be very fond of the Humes,
when all is said and done," said Ralph. "And you
used to be devoted to them-more particularly to
your Aunt Susannah."
" I was a child then; you cannot expect girls to
feel exactly as they did when they were little children.
But I do like them all very much indeed."
" Kate, I knew there was something else I wanted
to say. Mr. Hume met me this morning, and said 
that he had an offer for the Pines; a very nice family
want to take it on lease, and they offer quite a big
rent.  I don't suppose for a single moment you
will approve, but Castellis is really a great castle of a
place, and-your uncle would have mentioned it him-
self but he asked me to do so, as Sir John Fenton-
Douglas wants to know as soon as possible. From
all accounts, the Fenton-Douglases will be pleasant
neighbours; but still -
"Tell Uncle Robert when you see him to let the
Pines, by all means," replied Kate.
" I am glad you take it in such a sensible spirit;
but of course you remember what a queer objection
your father had to letting the old house, and when I
wrote to you last spring on the subject, you replied
that nothing would induce you to allow strangers to
inhabit the Pines."

"You want me, madam?     What can I do for
you ?" she asked.
" I wish you, Marryat, to take this note immediately
to Sir John Orme's house in Queen Anne Street."
"Yes, madam; you mean the great throat
specialist ? "
"You know about him," said Kate. " Come a
little nearer, Marryat; I want to say something."
The woman approached.
"There are several things you can do for me if
you continue to be my maid. First, and above all
other things, you can hold your tongue.  Do you
quite understand ?"
"' Yes, of course, miss."
Marryat narrowed her dark eyes and fixed them
curiously upon Kate's blooming face. This was by no
means the first time the young lady had puzzled her.
"People can be paid for holding their tongues,"
continued the girl. "I am, as you know, Marryat,
very rich. Now, you quite understand. There is to
be no tattling in servants' halls, no breach of confi-
dence. You, Marryat, would not object to having a
little more of this world's goods, would you ?"
"Oh, certainly not, Miss Bouverie. Who would ?
And I have an invalid mother at home."
t Ah, I daresay. Here is a five-pound note. Have
it changed into postal orders and send it to your
mother to-morrow."
"Is this over and above my wages, miss ?"
"It has nothing to do with your wages; it is a
little present from me for doing that great thing-
holding your tongue. You quite understand."
" Yes, Miss Bouverie, I quite understand." 
"Then, that is all right. Now take a hansom

thought I had better wait, as the note seemed impor-
tant. Sir John was dining out, and didn't come in till
past eleven."
"Has he given you an answer for me ?"
"Yes, miss; here it is."
Kate hastily tore open the envelope and read as
follows:-
"Sir John Orme presents his compliments to
Miss Kate Bouverie, and regrets that he cannot find
her name in his case-book. He cannot, therefore,
supply the missing prescription. If Miss Bouverie
will call upon Sir John Orme to-morrow morning,
he will be pleased to see her."
"That is all right," said Kate. "Have you any-
thing to tell me, Marryat ?"
"The footman, miss, was very polite and con-
fidential, so to speak. Sir John has had a doctor
helping him lately-a Mr. Jacobs."
"Mr. Jacobs saw some of Sir John's patients,
did he ?"
"So it seems, miss. But he has gone away now,
owing to a case of illness in his own family in the
north of England. He won't be back, the footman
thinks, for some weeks."
Kate uttered a sigh of relief.
"You have done admirably, Marryat," she said.
" Please brush my hair now; I am very tired, and
will get into bed quickly."
About eleven o'clock on the following morning
Kate called upon the great specialist.  She was
dressed most charmingly, and looked her very best.
The moment Sir John Orme came in she gave a 
start.
"Are you Sir John Orme ?" she said impulsively.

"And you used to sing a great deal ?"
"Yes."
"Your voice was supposed to be a fine one ?"
"I think it was a very fine one, Sir John. It used
to give me great pleasure and also my father."
"And you say it has now completely left you ?"
"It has; I cannot sing a note."
"Then the vocal chords must be seriously injured.
You do not appear to be suffering from cold."
"I have none of the symptoms of the ordinary
cold."
"I will examine your throat. Come and sit in
this chair near the window."
The examination took place and was quickly over.
Sir John wrote a prescription.
" Is there much the matter ?" asked Kate, as she
was leaving the room.
"Nothing to be alarmed about. If you have got
the vocal chords which are essential to a great singer
they will soon recover their tone. Use this gargle
three times a day, and take this tonic also."
" And shall I see you again ?"
" It is scarcely necessary. If you have a voice,
and the voice is gone, what you have to do is to get
yourself stronger. Good-bye."
Kate laid her two guineas in the doctor's palm.
When she had gone he looked strangely at the
money.
"Not at all the throat of a great singer," he said
to himself. "I must be careful to question Jacobs
when he comes back. It is quite unaccountable his

seem to have such a fearful lot to do with regard to
my marriage settlements."
"Oh, that can be managed," said Ralph in a
somewhat inconsequent tone; "a few more lawyer's
clerks must be engaged in the matter, and the thing
is done.  Kate, my darling, you make me the
happiest man on earth.  A whole life devoted to
you will not be too much. You will see when I am
your husband how deeply I love you, my Kate."
"And I hope you will also find out, Ralph, how
much I love you. You suit me exactly. After all,
it was an experiment; but it has succeeded."
"An experiment ! What do you mean ?"
"I mean this. The chances were that things would
be quite different. Remember you have not seen me
since I was a little girl of eleven. How could you
possibly tell that you would like me when I was grown
up ? I also felt that there was great risk. I knew
it was quite on the cards that I should not like you;
but things are not so. The dream, Ralph, has turned
out to be much more delightful in the reality, and
I believe you feel the same about me. Yes, we are
lucky, and our combined fortunes-"
"Oh, don't talk about our fortunes in the same
breath," answered Henley with some impatience.
"The thing that worries me is your being so rich.
Compared to you, I am a poor man."
"What is your income, Ralph ?"
"I am supposed to possess between four and five
thousand a year."
"We could be very happy on that," said Kate in
a plaintive voice. She was silent for a moment; she
was thinking down deep in her heart. Suppose she
had won Ralph as her true self-as Kate Mildmay.  /

faster did the whirlpool of pleasure revolve round
her feet. She was raised to such a pinnacle of ex-
citement and bliss that she found it possible to banish
all serious thoughts. By this time she had persuaded
herself that she really was Kate Bouverie. The Kate
in her nameless grave at Mentone returned seldomer
and seldomer to haunt her. The future was her own
and the present was all that was delightful. She was
caressed, loved, and fussed over. Everything that
money could devise was used to enhance her re-
markable beauty. She had more dresses than she
knew what to do with, and these dresses were chosen
with the most exquisite care and-thought. In each 
costume she looked more and more fair. Jewels be-
decked her round throat and encircled her snowy
arms, jewels gleamed ip her dark hair and flashed a
radiance which was only vied with by the sparkle in
her eyes. Those eyes were now soft as well as
bright, the latent anxiety which could never be really
absent had given them that depth of expression which
in the old days they lacked. tYes, she was happy.
Her scheme had succeeded. Not only had she won
her heart's desire, riches with their magical power,
friends to love and make much of her, but she was
also in love-deeply, truly, desperately in love with
the man who to-morrow was to be her husband.
"When I was making all my plans," thought 
Kate to herself, "I never pictured this last and
crowning joy. It never for a moment occurred to
me that I should love Ralph Henley. I meant him 
to love me as a matter of course, but that I should
give him my heart in return, that I should tremble
when I hear his step, that my heart should leap when -
he speaks to me, that the dearest bliss of all is to feel

moved, and a lovely dress of the softest satin, richly
embroidered in pearls, was brought to view. The
dress had cost a small fortune, and came from
Worth.   No London dressmaker could have pro-
duced it.
"I wonder what the bill will be ?" said Ethel.
"Oh, never mind about the bill-that is Uncle
Robert's affair," answered Kate. " I told him I wanted
an elaborate trousseau, and he gave me carte blanche to
order what I pleased."
" Oh dear !" sighed Mary, "the money this one
dress has cost would keep Ethel and me in every
imaginable luxury for a couple of years."
"I think it is rather mean of you to talk in that
way, Mary," said Ethel, "when Kate is so generous
to us.  Could anything be more lovely than the
bridesmaids' dresses ?"
"Well, do help me into my dress now," said
Kate.
"By the way," continued Mary, as she slipped
the lovely robe over Kate's dark head, " Marryat has
been looking for you high and low. There is a person
somewhere in the ground who wants to see you."
" A person who wants to see me ! What person ?"
" I have not the slightest idea. Marryat says he
is a fussy sort of beggar person."
"Oh, it can be nobody of the slightest conse-
quence," said Kate. " I am much too busy to attend
to strangers to-day."
She had scarcely uttered the words before there
came a tap at her door and Marryat entered.
"Is this the wedding dress, miss?" she said.
"How very beautiful "  She stepped forward and
looked at it critically, turning her head from side

to side, pulling out the train and smoothing out the
|: soft folds by the young girl's waist.
. V   "It fits like a glove; it is a dream dress," said
:  Ethel. "I never saw anything so lovely; and it be-

I :Y ou look like-like an angel !"
:S ' No, no; do not say that," answered Kate, almost
|t etiy. "What do you think of the dress, Marryat ?"
I ;  arryat nodded her head; the admiration she
all too apparent in her'eyes.
1   '3nhile Mary was silent. She kept on looking
s'fce as if she were fascinated. Kate glanced
.. at her and then looked at herself in the glass. Never
- - had her eyes rested on a fairer vision. The tenderest,
softest bloom filled her cheeks, the brightness of her
eyes was veiled with a sort of mist of the purest
happiness. She knew that she looked lovely. She
was glad because she was going to give herself with
: all her loveliness to Ralph. She said to herself-
"Even though I am all false, even though I am
not Kate Bouverie at all, yet I am the loveliest Kate
in all the world. Surely that fact is enough; surely
Ralph is the luckiest of men."
"Yes, dress does help beauty," she said abruptly.
She turned aside, and a quick, half-strangled sigh
burst from her lips. Just for a moment she thought
-of the old days.
' In the old days," thought Kate, " there were
the little cotton dresses, the faded ribbons, the darned
i  'gloves. Oh, I was pretty in the old days; now-
:, : ow I am lovely!"

to see you, and he won't go away. I begged him to,
but he won't be satisfied. He seems to intend to make
a fuss. Can you manage to give him a minute ?"
Kate felt herself turning suddenly pale. Mary's
eyes were still fixed upon her.
" If the man is a beggar or anything of that sort,"
said Mary, "you ought to go to father. You cannot
be worried by these sort of people coming to see
you."
" Oh, of course he is a beggar," said Ethel. " Kate
is known to be so rich that all sorts of people will be
approaching her now."
" I don't think the man is exactly a beggar, miss,"
continued Marryat.  "By the way he spoke he
seemed to have seen Miss Bouverie before now. It
might do no harm for you just to give him a minute's
interview, miss."
"I'll see about it," answered Kate. "Tell him
not to come to the house."
( But you won't see a beggar, surely!"' cried Ethel.
" I wish you wouldn't; you really will be overpowered
with these sort of people if you begin to take notice
of them."
"He looked very miserable, miss," said the maid.
Kate glanced at Marryat, read in her eyes what
she did not dare to say aloud, and made up her mind
at any risk to see the man.
t" Tell him I will come to him, Marryat," she said.
" Oh dear me! Kate, I wish you wouldn't," said
Ethel again.
" My dear Ethel, I feel so happy to-day that I
cannot bear to turn any one away who is in misery.
Now do come down and let us show the dress to

" You talk as if- " began Ethel; but Mary
interrupted her hastily.
"I wonder who that man is who wants to see

" A man !" cried Mrs. Hume. "What man ?"
"Oh, a beggar of some sort. Marryat told her
about him. He won't go away, and that foolish Kate
absolutely declares she will see him."
" It is very imprudent of her," said Mrs. Hume.
"You had better go at once and tell your father.
Kate must not see beggars; they will prey on her
good-nature.  It is very immoral to encourage
begging."
"Then I will run at once and tell father," said
Mary. She tripped off to the study. Mr. Hume
was writing letters, looking through deeds, and wind-

"Well, Mary, what is it ? " he said. " I am busy."
"Mother sent me, father. She thinks you ought

"A man worrying to see Kate! What do you

" He wants to see Kate in the avenue, and she is
going to see him."
"Tell Kate to do nothing of the kind," said the
lawyer impatiently.
" But she intends to go, father."
"Then I had better put a stop to it. What a
nuisance it is ! That silly woman, Marryat, is not, in
my opinion, at all a suitable maid for Kate; I hope
she will get rid of her."

"Oh, I did not mean to be cross," she said then;
"but in father's lifetime I had so much liberty. Of
course, Uncle Robert, you are anxious about me
because you love me." Here she laid her slim hand
on his arm.
"Of course I love you, my dear Katherine. Who
would not love one so lovely and interesting ? But
the fact is ever present before me that you are a very
wealthy girl.  Now, wealth has its responsibilities,
and one of these is that the person who owns money
should never squander it. The man whom I saw you
talking to just now did not look like a gentleman."
"Of course he is not a gentleman; I never said
he was. Is it necessary that I should only speak to
gentlemen ?"
"My dear niece, don't cavil."
- "Oh, I won't. I will try to be patient," answered
Kate. She bit her lips, and her hand rested with a
slightly heavier pressure on the lawyer's arm.
"You have so much money that you cannot
shirk your responsibilities," he said; "and I, as your
guardian, will not let you squander your money. It
is sent to use, not to abuse."
"Oh, I know all that," said Kate, in her most
flippant voice. "Well, I suppose the upshot is that
you want to know to whom I have been talking. I
will tell you. The man's name is Rogers. Mrs.
Mildmay knew him very well at Mentone. He
happens to be in England, and she asked him to call
and see me. She is very poor, and wants a little
money. Out of my abundance-my great abundance
-she wants a little-just a little."
" Nonsense, Kate I What are you talking about ?"

was so very fond of her poor little daughter who
resembled me."
" I am sick of hearing of that likeness," said Mr.
Hume impatiently. "The whole thing is prepos-
terous, Katherine, and cannot be permitted for a
single moment."
"Very well, Uncle Robert. Then you really will
not help me ?"
"I will not give you a penny for that woman.
There, I have said it."
"Of course, if you refuse there is an end of it,"
said Kate. She turned away from her uncle, entered
the house, and went up to her own room. The
moment she did so she locked her door. Out of a
secret receptacle she now took one of the diamonds
which she had stored away in case of need. It was
an unset diamond, but a good one, and of the first
water. She knew well that it could be cut into a
lovely stone, and by no means wished to part with it
to the man who called himself Rogers, but whose
real name was Merriman. He had said some very
queer things, however, and had frightened her dread-
fully. She could not guess what he knew or did not
know; but that he knew something-something that
could implicate her, and perhaps ruin her whole
scheme-was all too evident.
"At any risk I must not see him again," she
thought to herself. "It would be too dangerous.
And yet I must give him what he needs. I must
stop his mouth. He threatened to go to see Uncle
Robert to-morrow-on my wedding day, too-but
he mustn't. Whatever happens, he must not. Just
when the cup of happiness touches my lips it shall
not be dashed away. I don't think the man knows

member such things; she would forget them. You

The maid drew herself up primly, and her face 
turned white.
" I will remember this against you, my proud
young lady, some day," she said to herself. "Yes, I
will remember and not forget."  Aloud she said, in a 
demure and conciliatory tone: "Of course, miss;
and I quite understand."
"I am glad you do. Now what I wish you to do
is this. Take this little parcel to the Swan Inn, ask
to see a man of the name of Rogers-Mr. John Rogers
-and give him the parcel. There is no message.
Just give it to him. Slip it into his hand when no

"No. You will wonder, Marryat, why I am

"Oh, don't be silly," said Kate, with a laugh.
"You know you are just dying with curiosity; and
you do use your brains-and pretty sharp ones they
are, too. If you had not sharp brains you would not
suit me at all. Well, I have made up my mind to
tell you; but, of course, you won't breathe it to a
soul." 
By way of answer, Marryat closed her lips tightly
together.

CHAPTER XII
MARRYAT walked quickly to the village-she had
Kate's little parcel in her pocket. She was a prim,
smart-looking, well-set-up young woman of about
eight-and-twenty.  The villagers admired her very
much. She had coal-black hair and flashing black
eyes and a high colour in her cheeks. Her teeth
were white and her lips red. The villagers con-
sidered her a rare beauty. Marryat knew, however,
the value of never giving herself away. She treated
the other servants at the Grange and the few people
she happened to know in the village with the highest
scorn. She was therefore regarded with consider-
able awe by her fellow-servants and by any acquaint-
ance she happened to have in the place.  She never
allowed liberties to be taken with her ; she knew her
position too well for that. As she walked quickly
now, with her red lips slightly pursed up and her
shining black eyes staring straight before her, her
brain was very busy. Kate was right; Marryat had
good brains, and 'cute ones.
" I must do this thing as carefully as I can," she
said to herself. " But what's afoot I'd like' to know.
I wouldn't split on my young mistress, not for worlds.
Why, she's a mine of gold to me; I'll make my for-
tune if this sort of thing goes on. But I should like
to know what it means just for my own sake. I

three mongrel dogs, and one of them barked as
Marryat passed by. She found herself quickly at the
other side of the green, and saw, just to her right, a
shady and also lonely road. She entered the road;
the man with the short briar pipe followed her at a
distance of about fifty yards.- Marryat walked a
little way down the road, then she sat under a tree
where a convenient bench had been placed, closed
her sunshade, and began to mop her somewhat
heated face.
The man approached, and, as naturally as pos-
sible, took the opposite side of the bench. Marryat
glanced in his direction, and he glanced in hers.
The man looked to the right and the woman to the
left; there was not a soul in view.
"Well," said the man then; "you've come from
the young lady. What's the message ?"
Marryat did not reply at once; then she looked
the man all over from head to foot. He was dusty
and tired, his clothes were shabby, his face was
slightly flushed, for he had just been indulging in
a copious draught of beer. Marryat's high colour
had already slightly faded. She looked exquisitely
neat, her dress was perfect, and there was not a
hair out of place on her shining head.    On
Marryat's smooth brow lingered no anxiety. She
felt that she had the key of the situation, and did not
intend to give it away sooner than she could help.
"I don't know what you' mean by staring at me
like that," said the man. "I have asked you a civil
question, miss."
"Eh ?" said Marryat. She looked at him again,
steadily, as if she had not heard him speak before.
The man flushed up angrily.

"Payment! Now, what do you mean ?"
"You have a hold over my young lady ?"
"I-a hold over her ? " said Merriman. He was
a very astute person, and he knew well that the
moment he shared his secret-even the tenth part
of his secret-with another, he would lessen its value
to himself. He therefore warily turned aside from
Marryat's question and said-
" I am an old friend."
-"Oh, indeed; that seems rather-queer. You don't
look the sort that my young lady would make friends
with."
"That's all you know."
"Have you been in the h'East, may I ask?"
"I don't know -what you mean." 
"Why this. If you're an old friend of Miss 
Bouverie's you must have lived in the h'East. Miss
Bouverie has been out of England in the h'East for:
the last twelve years of her life." 
"Oh," said the man, with a flash of intense merri-
ment in his eyes. "That's a good 'un-that's a rarei
good 'un." He laughed loud and long. Some people
were seen walking down the road.
"I will wish you good-evening now," said Marryat,
rising. "I am rested, and am going on with myt
walk."
She stepped forward, but the man followed h<
quickly. 
" What is it you want me to tell you ?" he sa

of a lonely lady for whom my young mistress has a
kindness ?"
"To be sure," said Merriman. He stood still
and reflected. He did not want to give Mrs. Mild-
may's address, but he did want those two sovereigns
badly.  Two sovereigns meant forty shillings, or
eighty sixpences. How many mugs of beer would
that money purchase ?  At the present moment,
he had only one-and-sixpence in the world. Kate
might or might not have sent him money. She had
positively refused to do so when he had spoken to
her, telling him that she had none. If she gave him
what he expected, namely, some article of jewellery,
he would have to wait a little time before he could
turn it into money. But the sovereigns !-the sove-
reigns could minister to his temporal needs at once.
He could have all that he required-a good meal, a
comfortable bed, what were to him the luxuries of
life-if he gave Mrs. Mildmay's address to Marryat;
and what possible harm could she do with it ?
A moment later Marryat had taken out her purse
and transferred the two sovereigns to the man's greedy
palm. A moment later also the little box containing 
the diamond pin was in his possession.
The man now walked rapidly from the village,
and Marryat returned to the Grange.

had given up his place in Berkshire to them for a
week, and afterwards they started in Henley's yacht
for Norway. They were absent for three months.
During that time the Humes heard very little about
them. But early in September a letter arrived from
Kate. It was addressed to Ethel, and ran as follows:-
"MY DEAR ETHEL,-When you receive this 
Ralph and I will be at Castellis. We have had the
jolliest and most delightful wedding tour in the
world, and now mean to settle down in our own
home. We want you, Ethel, to pay us a visit, and
if Mary likes to come too we shall be delighted.
Don't you think you could both manage to give us
at least a fortnight ? It will be delightful seeing you.
Wire to me to Castellis when you receive this, and I
will come and meet you at the station."
This letter was dated from Paris, but Kate had
added a postscript to say that she and her husband
would be at Castellis on the evening of the Ioth.
Oh," said Ethel, " I should like to go; it would
give me just the change I long for. You will let me
go, won't you, mother ?"
" Of course, dear. But I almost wonder Kate
cares to have visitors so soon. Surely she cannot be
tired of that nice husband of hers."
"For my part," said Mr. Hume, who happened
to come in at that moment, " I consider it very sen- 
sible of Kate. It is the worst thing in the world for 
a man and woman to tire of each other by having no '
one else to talk to. They have had three months of
billing and cooing, and is not that enough for any
sensible pair ?"

appeared on the scene I have had that sensation with
regard to her. But there, if you really wish me to
go, mother-   "
"I certainly do, Mary."
"Then I will go, of course, for it is wrong to
yield to prejudice."
Ethel laughed.
"You have the most absurd ideas," she said;
"we ought not even to listen to you. Oh, I am-so
glad we can both go. Father, I shall want a new
dress, and so will Mary. Kate, of course, will take
us out a good deal. I must have a new tennis frock;
may I order one ?"
"I suppose you may, my dear," said Hume, who
for some reason was in a high good-humour. "Will
a ten-pound note suit you, Ethel ?"
"Excellently, father. May I spend it all on dress?"
"Of course you may. You must make your-
self smart. There's no saying what charming young
fellow you may meet at Castellis."  He pinched his
daughter's cheek as he spoke. She flushed up rosily
and laughed for pure joy.
"You'll give poor old Moll a ten-pound note
too ? " she said.
"Oh 1 I don't want it," answered Mary, " I have
plenty of dresses."
"Well, take it, my dear, to buy what you like
with," said the lawyer, opening his pocket-book as
he spoke and presenting Mary with a note similar to
the one he had just .given to Ethel. "Now, girls,"
he continued, " what day will you start ?"
"This is Thursday," said Ethel. "We could get
some ready-made things at Redmayne's, and could 
go next Monday."              '

.Ralph?"   Here she turned to her husband. He
also gave Mary and Ethel a hearty welcome. The
three got into a pretty pony carriage, Kate whipped
up the ponies, and they started for Castellis. Ralph
shouted after that he would follow later on horse-
back.
Ethel and Mary had not visited Castellis since
they were children, and they were wild with excite-
ment at the thought of exploring the old place
again.
" But," said Mary, "it does seem so funny that
you should have let the Pines, Kate. You and my
uncle always had such an extraordinary aversion to
letting it. For the ten or twelve-years you were in
India the place wasj unlet, and now the moment you
come home you give it up to the first man who wants
to live there. You could not have done it for the
sake of the mere money."
Oh, by no means," answered Kate. "I only
thought as an offer was made for the place we might
as well accept it. It was going to ruin with no one
living there."
"What is the name of the man who has taken
it?" asked Mary.
" Sir John Fenton-Douglas. I don't know any-
thing whatever about him. I believe he has a large
family."
"Well, I am sorry for my part," said Mary.
" I think Kate was very sensible," retorted Ethel.
" What was the good of allowing the place to remain
idle ? 
"iSensible, but untrue to her early character,"
was Mary's answer.
"Well, don't let us talk about it any more," said

of us, and but for Ralph I do believe the bull would 
have gored you, Kate."
"What was the name of the beast ?" said Ethel
suddenly. " He was fierce and awful; and my poor
uncle was so proud of him; even after he had jeopar-
dised your dear little life he would not allow him to
be sold. What did we call him? He had a queer
name, I know."
"Taurus," said Kate, drawing a bow at a venture.
"Taurus I" replied Mary, with a somewhat scornful
laugh. " Nothing of the kind." She gave Kate a long,
attentive, penetrating glance. "The name was not
Taurus, I am certain," she 'continued. "What could
it have been ?"
She taxed her memory, knitting her brows in vain.
Kate said nothing further; she drove on.
"When will the new people arrive at the Pines ?"
asked Mary.
"To-morrow, I believe," answered Kate. "And
Ralph means to call on them immediately. I hope
they will be nice. Such near neighbours would be
terrible if they did not turn out satisfactory."
"Oh, they are sure to be delightful," said Mary.
"Only a man with taste would care to live in an
artistic sort of place like the Pines."
"Are you letting the house with all the old pic-
tures " said Ethel suddenly. "You know the picture
gallery is famous. You ought to have had the pic-
tures removed to Castellis. Didn't you think of that?"
"No, I didn't," answered Kate. "I cannot think
of everything all at once," she added petulantly.
" Well, here we are."
The ponies had drawn up at the front door; the
girls entered the wide hall. It was made of marble,

"A surprise " she answered.  "What do you
mean ? "
" You know the people who have taken the Pines ?"
"Yes," answered Kate, certainly-Sir John and
Lady Fenton-Douglas."
"I have quite a romance to tell you about them.
He has not long been Sir John Fenton-Douglas."
" Oh !" answered Kate. She stood perfectly still;
her arms had dropped to her sides. Although she
could not guess the reason, her heart gave a thump
and then began to beat quickly.
"Yes," she continued, struggling against an unde-
fined sense of uneasiness; "yes, Ralph ?"
"My darling, you look quite ill and tired. It
seems almost a pity that Sir John has ceased to act
as a doctor."
"A doctor! a doctor!" said Kate.  She was
puzzled by an undefined memory.
"Why, my darling Kitty, do you know who he
is ? No less a person than the Dr. Fenton who at-
tended your little friend, Kate Mildmay, at Mentone."
"No, no, Ralph; no, no-impossible!" Kate
staggered, turned white as death, and dropped into
a chair.
"I said you were ill. What in the world is the
matter ?"
"I am   astonished and-oh, Ralph! it brings
back old memories and old sorrows. But it is not
true. I don't like it, Ralph. It is not true."

CHAPTER XIV
FOR almost the first time in her healthy life Kate
spent an altogether wakeful night. Look where she
would, think hard as she might, she could see nothing
but danger ahead. Just when she was beginning to
feel most secure had come this unexpected and terrible-  7
blow. What had induced her ever to consent to the
Pines being let ? What ill wind of fate had driven
Sir John Fenton-Douglas of all people into her path ?
Why should he of all men have decided to rent the
Pines ? Whatever happened she must not meet him. 
Neither must her husband meet him. To live there-
fore at Castellis with Sir John at the Pines was an
impossibility. 
"This is Nemesis," she murmured to herself.
Am I to fail in the end ? No, no, no. I will carry '!
the thing right through. This man, this doctor,
this tiresome rubbishy inconsequent person, shall not 
destroy my whole life."
She listened to her husband's quiet breathing, and
felt that she would fight to the death-would go through .
any mire or any dishonour just to keep his affections.
" It is no longer wealth," she thought to herself,
"it is no longer the position I have attained, it is the
love of my husband which I want, which I must never,
as there is a God above, lose. Oh, what shall I do .:
He must not despise me. His love would go if 
knew the truth. He must never know it."

"But can't you come too? It will be nothing
without you."
"I cannot; -I have got such a bad headache that
I am quite prostrated."
Henley left the room reluctantly. A few moments
later Marryat appeared. 
" What is it, madam ? " she said, approaching her
young mistress and bending over her.
Kate sat up in bed and gazed at Marryat with
wide-open bright eyes.
"I am in a fix," she said, "that's all."
"I have brought you your post, madam, and also
your breakfast."
"Oh, thanks. Lay the post on the bed."
"You must eat your breakfast, madam."
Kate made no reply; she kept gazing at Marryat;
her teeth were chattering.
"There is another letter from that person," con-
tinued the maid. "It arrived by, the last post last
night. I thought you might as well receive it with '
the others this morning."
"Lay it on the bed," said Kate.
"What is the matter with you, madam? You
don't look well."
"Marryat, I am in a fix."
" How so, my dear madam ? "
" I wish I might confide in you," said Kate. " But
I cannot-I do not dare. Lock the door, please."
Marryat complied. She then returned to the 
bedside.
"'The first thing you must do is to eat your
breakfast," she said, assuming a tone of authority.
She arranged Kate's pillows, wrapped a white shawl :
round her shoulders, and then setting the tray on-a~-j

table by the side of the bed, stood herself at the foot.
Marryat's bright black eyes travelled all over Kate's
face; she then stood motionless.
Kate glanced at her letters. Even the letter with
the Mentone postmark, which generally excited her
keenest alarm, had now scarcely power to rouse her.
" Marryat," she said, looking full at the maid, "we
must go away. We must make an excuse and get
away."
"Away from Castellis ?" cried Marryat.
"And you must help me."
"But how can I ?" said the woman.
"That remains to be discovered. We have got
to think of a plausible reason for going away, and
I-I think I have found one."
, But surely, madam, you will think carefully over
:this. You have only just arrived, and the two young
ladies from the Grange only came here last night. I
j am told that the gentlemen and ladies living round
here are looking forward to enjoying a great deal of
your society, and already you have had many invi-
tations from them. It will look very strange-very
strange indeed, madam."
"I don't care the very least what the neighbours
thmnk. We must get away," repeated Kate. '*And
what is more, I must go to-day."
"But how ? and why ?" said the woman.
' " I am not going to tell you why, but I 'Ltell

"Of course I won't ask anyquestions, Mrs. Henley."
"Please, Marryat, give me my purse."
Marryat's eyes brightened.  She went to the
dressing-table and brought the little sealskin purse
to Kate. Kate opened it, took out ten sovereigns, and
laid them on the bed.
"These are for you-for keeping silence," she
said.
"Oh, I will keep silent till the day of doom for
a reward like this," said the woman, as she hastily
gathered up the money.
"I believe you will. And listen; I will give you
more, much more, if-if that which troubles me-
my secret, if you like to call it-is safe at the end of
the year. In that event I will make you a rich woman,
Marryat. I long for some one to consult with, some
one to advise me, some one with whom I may talk
things over."
"If you would only confide in me fully, dear
lady, Tour mind would be much relieved. And I-
I can be trusted."
Kate shivered.
"I cannot do that," she said. " Now go and pack
a few things. We will both go to Falmouth."
"When will you tell Mr. Henley ?"
"I will write him a letter; he can receive it after
I have gone. He and the young ladies will be out all
the morning; we will go while they are absent."
"But my master won't like it."
"He will follow me, of course. And the girls
can go home. They don't matter in the very least.
Go, Marryat, now, and begin to pack my things.
You will know what I shall require."
"Many things, madam ?"

t Oh, pack a good few. We will take a large trunk;

" Does this mean that you are not coming back ?"
' I shall not come back at present-perhaps not
for a very long time. I hate Castellis."
'"And yet it is the most beautiful place I ever
saw in my life," said the woman. "It seems a great
pity."
I    " Marryat, you have heard the story of the ghost.
You yourself told it to me yesterday."
"Oh, there is nothing in that. You don't mean
to say it is that which is sending you away ?"
Kate laughed.
"Not quite," she answered; "but it will do for
an excuse. Now, you understand. Go and pack."
t!:   "It seems a great pity," murmured Marryat.
i     "Oh, dont fret about Castellis," said Kate fever-
ishly. "I am rich, and can buy another place. Now
go, Marryat, and put the things into my trunk."
The woman left the room.
Kate toyed with her breakfast, scarcely touching
: it. She had opened her letters. Her correspondence
t'as numerous. She finally took up the last-the one
- with the Mentone postmark. She read it quickly. It
! contained the usual thing--a peremptory demand for
Xipney.  Kate rose hastily, took a five-pound note
? from' a private drawer, enclosed it to the writer of
1th letter, addressed and stamped the envelope, and
n  continued her toilet.
Presently her husband came up and knocked at
oor. Kate thrust aside her correspondence and
tto open it.  Her cheeks were feverishly bright
her eyes shining.
iiThe girls are so sorry about you, my darling;

and, I declare, you don't look a bit well. Won't you
go for a drive ? I'll stay at home and look after you.
Kitty, I don't like that expression on your face; you 
look quite woe-begone, my dearest love."
"Kiss me, Ralph, and leave me," said Kate. " My
head won't stand much talk this morning, and I shall 
be better alone; but give me a kiss before you go."
She raised her soft lips. He bent over her and
gave her a long kiss.
"My dearest, I hate leaving you," he replied.
"Oh, but you need not, for I am really better.
I will have a good rest while you are out."
Ralph said a few more comforting words and then
ran downstairs. Kate relocked her door and went
and stood by the window. A few moments later she
saw the three men, accompanied by the two girls,
cross the grassy sward and disappear into the coverts
at the farther end. Soon afterwards the report of
guns came to her. She looked with wistful eyes
over the beautiful autumn landscape. No place in
all the world could be fairer than Castellis; and the
view of wood, and meadow, and lake, and distant
mountains was superb.
"Mine. The fruit of my sin," she murmured.
"But-I must give it all up. Not that I mind; I don't
mind anything if I can keep Ralph."
She hurried eagerly into the dressing-room, where
Marryat was on her knees packing her trunk.
" I want you to select some of your dresses,
madam," she said.
"Oh, you choose them," said Kate.
"But it won't take you any time just to look into
your wardrobe and make a selection."
Kate crossed the room hastily; she unlocked the

with us another time. Tell them I am terribly sorry.
We are going to the Victoria Hotel. Please join me
there, and come as soon as ever you can-the sooner
the better.-Your own                KITTY."
Having signed the letter, Kate left it on the table
in the hall, and soon after one o'clock that day had
left Castellis accompanied by Marryat.
"I hear that the family are coming to the Pines
to-day, madam," said the maid, "and that they are
remarkably nice people. But what is the matter ?
How you shiver, madam."
"What carriage is that coming up the hill ?"
asked Kate suddenly.
" I don't know, madam. There is a lot of luggage
on it. It is a travelling carriage of some sort. Why,
there is only one gentleman inside, and he is bending
forward. He seems to know you."
A tall man with iron-grey hair was seated alone
in the carriage. The moment he saw Kate he started,
stared at her, and took off his hat. But Kate had
already pulled down her veil, and her head was
turned resolutely away. She whipped up her ponies,
who passed the travelling carriage at a gallop.
Marryat's curious eyes followed the carriage and
the man who sat in it. She then glanced at Kate.
"It's because of him she is going," thought the
astute woman. " Now, what does this mean ?"
The groom who sat behind touched Marryat on
her shoulder, and said-
"That is the gentleman who has taken the
Pines. His name is Sir John Fenton-Douglas. I
am told the family arrive to-night."



<pb n="137"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               I37
"Sir John Fenton-Douglas," repeated Marryat.
"He seemed as if he knew you, madam."
"Knew me?" said Kate. "You must have been
mistaken. What sort of person was he ?"
"A middle-aged gentleman, with grey hair. He
had a very keen face-clever and interesting, I should
say. He certainly seemed to know you quite well,
madami. He bent forward and bowed, and stared so
hard. Didn't you see him ?"
"No; these ponies are so fresh they take all my
attention. Don't talk any more, Marryat; my head
aches past bearing."
"I'm not a bit surprised at that," thought the,
woman.   "It's Sir John Fenton-Douglas who is 
sending her away. The mystery thickens. But what
-does it mean ?"'

CHAPTER XV
HENLEY, accompanied by the girls and the two men,
returned to Castellis for tea. The monment he entered
the house he asked eagerly for his wife.
" Is Mrs. Henley in her boudoir ? " he said, turn-
ing to the footman.
"No, sir; my mistress is not at home. She left
the house with Marryat immediately after lunch. She
has left a note for you, sir. She desired me to deliver
it the moment you came in."
Henley took the letter eagerly, tore it open and
read it. As he did so his healthy-bronzed cfeeks
went pale.
"What is the matter?" said Mary. "Is any-
thing wrong, Ralph ?"
"I don't know; I am afraid so. Kate is ill."
"Ill! But Harris says she has gone out."
"She has; she has gone to Falmouth. Fetch a
Bradshaw immediately," he said, turning to the man.
The servant, in some wonder, withdrew. Henley 
went to his study, followed by Mary and Ethel. The
two guests, seeing something was wrong, remained in
the hall. 
The footman appeared with the Bradshaw. Henley 
took it up, turned the leaves feverishly, and searched
for the trains to Falmouth.
"There is one which I might catch within the,
next hour," he said. "If I miss that, I cannot get to:

Falmouth to-night. Girls, I hope you don't mind my
leaving you."
"Oh, not at all," said Mary, " if you are obliged to.
But it seems so strange; do tell us more, please, Ralph."
" I must first order the trap to be got ready, and
then I can attend to you."
He left the room hastily.
"What does this mean?" said Mary, looking at
Ethel.      )
"How-can I tell, Mary ? How queer you look !"
"I don't like it, that's all," continued Mary;
Henley excused himself to his guests in the hall.
"My wife has been obliged to go suddenly to
Falmouth, and I find I must join her," he said. " I am
ever so sorry. I hope I shall see you some other day."
-  "Good-bye, Henley. We hope so too," said they
both; and then they went away.
Henley gave orders about the trap, which was to
be sent round immediately. He then returned to
the girls.
"Now, please, Ralph, tell us what is up," said Mary.
"I don't know myself, Mary. Kate has an attack
of the nerves. She has taken the idea into her head
;that she has seen the ghost who is supposed to haunt
this house."
"Oh, poor Kitty! We all know that Castellis is
haunted," said Ethel.
"But I really never supposed any person could
be so silly as to go away on account of a ghost," said
Mary, with scorn.
"But don't you remember, Mary, how nervous
, Kitty always was on the subject ?" said Ethel. "When
she was a child she used to hate to sleep here. We
'  lways spent Christmas here when your father was

alive, Ralph; but Kitty did so dislike it, and on one
occasion she and I went back to the Pines to sleep.
Don't you remember ?"
"To be sure; I can recall it," said Ralph, a look
of relief coming into his face. "Poor little Kitty I
I must reason her out of this."
" And you are going to her, Ralph ?"
"I certainly am; she says emphatically she won't
come back at present."
"Then what is to become of us ?" said Mary.
" You must please yourselves. She suggests that
you should come with me to Falmouth, or stay here,
or go back to the Grange."
"It would. be very dull returning to the Grange
now," said Ethel, "because father and mother are
away. They mean to be away for the next month,
and the whole place is in the hands of the cleaners." 
""We could go back, certainly," said Mary; "but,
as Ethel says, it would be dull."
"And I am dreadfully disappointed," continued  i
Ethel. " I did look forward to such a jolly time here."
"I am really awfully sorry, girls," said Ralph; 
"but you see how matters stand, and I cannot help
myself. Poor little Kitty must be humoured-poor
little girl I"
" Of course you would be sure to see it in Kitty's
light," continued Mary. " But still, what is to become
of us ? If we don't go back to the Grange, which we
neither of us wish to do, where are we to go ? "
i" Would you like to come with me to Falmouth ? "
Mary thought for a moment. She was positively
certain that Kate had not gone away because of the 'j
ghost. However frightened the old Kitty might have s
been, the present Kitty had no foolish, nervous fears. .

AN ADVENTURESS               I4I
"cShe is common-sense to her finger-tips; it is
in that particular where the immense difference lies
between the old Kate and the new," thought Mary.
"Yes, if there is anything wrong I may as well see it
for myself."
" I think it would be a good plan to go to Fal-
mouth," she .said. "I should like it."
-;: -Ralph tried to hide his face of dismay; he by no
wished to have Mary and Ethel with them at
I di l let us," said Ethel the moment Mary
fo "en  it would be terrible to be here alone,
,1 :?at-he Grange seems out of the question. Then,
i weare both quite anxious about Kate. I am sure I
.could comfort her next best to you, Ralph. She
.:always used to confide in me when she had her
--ghostly terrors on."
"Well, girls, if you must come, you must come
immediately," said Ralph.  "Run upstairs and get
ready; the trap will be round in less than ten
minutes."
The girls rushed off, forgetting even their tea.
In a quarter of an hour they had all left Castellis.
' They arrived at the station just in time to catch their
at train, and reached Falmouth between six and seven
i : the evening. They drove straight to the Victoria
::Hotel. Kate had already secured a large bedroom
a sitting-room opening on to a balcony. She
!Waes standing on the balcony when the carriage drew
ip which contained her husband and two cousins.
!$arryat was standing just behind her.
"They have all come, Marryat," she cried.  "I
almost sorry that Ethel and Mary are here; but
have come, and we must make the best of it.



<pb n="142"/>
142          AN ADVENTURESS
I never thought that Mr. Henley could catch that B
last train, but I am so glad to see him."
She waved her hand, as she spoke, to the travellers,
and then ran downstairs to greet them. Henley and
she retired as soon as possible into her bedroom.
" Now," he said as he shut the door, "what does
all this mean ? Let me look at you. What an awful
scare you have given me. But, Kitty, you don't look
bad now I"
"Bad!" said Kate. "I'm quite well again-as
well and jolly as possible. It was all that ghost; it
came to me last night; I told you it did. I saw it
come into the room. It walked so slowly, and stood
by the open window and gazed out, and I felt nearly
frozen with terror. It was the ghost of the Grey '
Lady, who, you know, is supposed to haunt Castellis.
But she never shows herself unless a catastrophe is
going to happen. I saw her. Yes, Ralph, I did.
Oh, Ralph, darling, don't ask me to go back don't'
ask me to go back" 1"
Kate was trembling. She trembled with such an
admirable resemblance to a real fit of terror that
Henley was completely taken in. He soothed and
kissed her, and told her that, after all, nothipg,
mattered if she kept well and happy.
"We won't go back for the present," he said:;
" It is a great nuisance that Sir John Fenton-Douglas
should have just arrived-for, of course, I promised '
to introduce him to everybody; but I suppose we
cannot help it."
"Oh    what does Sir John Fenton-Douglas
matter ?" said Kate, shivering. " I am so delighted 
I am away from Castellis. I shall sleep soundly te.
night."

"Well, come now and talk to the girls; they are
awfully disappointed, I can tell you."
"First of all, I must kiss you for being so good,"
answered Kate.  "You are the one darling of my
life. -Nothing matters in all the world to me if I am
with you."
Ralph's heart leapt with rejoicing at her words of
affection. She then returned with him to the sitting-
room.
The girls looked rather disconsolate and tired. 
"'Oh, you poor old dears !" said Kate, running up
to them. ' "I cannot tell you how vexed I am at all this
upset. Mary, I know you despise me-and you, Ethel ?"
"I certainly do not despise you," said Ethel.
"I remember the old days. Why, you were just
as bad when you were a child."
Kate immediately took her cue.   Until that
moment she had not heard that the old Kitty had
been much affected by the Castellis ghost. Marryat
had told her'the story of the ghost on the previous
day, and it occurred to her during the night that she
might utilise it to account for her sudden departure.
Now she began to talk eagely ofi^er childish terrors;
and' Ethel helped hef     mi  one incident after
another.
Meanwhile, Mary sat silent and watchful. Mary
feltmore sure than ever that she was on the brink of
|a discovery, but just at present she could not get any
gleue. After a long period of silence she spoke.
i:   "Well, Kate', she said, "I suppose you don't
dgetting my true opinion ?" 
Yes, I do," answered Kate; "for I see perfectly
VX by the expression of your. face that you are
to say something horrid." 
D



<pb n="144"/>
144-         AN ADVENTURESS
.-
"No, I shall not say anything specially horrid.
I am  your guest.  I simply want to say that I
think---"
"Think what?"
"That at this moment you are absolutely incon-
sistent with your true character. There never was
any one less nervous, and less likely to be affected by
ghostly terrors, than you."
" Oh, Mary I when you remember the old Kitty,"
cried Ethel.
" But I don't think of the old Kitty at all in this
matter. As far as I am concerned, as far as any one
who ever knew her is concerned, she is dead and
buried-buried down deep in her grave-and will
never come to life again."
Kate gasped and almost uttered a cry.
"Yes," continued Mary, fixing her eyes on Mrs.
Henley's white face; " I say the old Kate is dead,
and the present Kate has nothing to do with silly
fears. She could not act as a fool, however hard she
tried. There, I have spoken."
Kate soon recovered her composure.
" It is only Mary's way," she whispered to herself. 
"But I wish she would not speak as she has done
about Kate being dead and buried; it made my heart
th.ump. Well, after all, I am safe; I have got away
from Castellis. Wild horses could not drag me back.
No; poor old Castellis must go. We will buy another
place and be happy."
"Don't let us talk any more about me and my  i
weaknesses," she said suddenly. " I want now to
try and get you a nice room, girls. I am so glad
you have come with Ralph."
.f



<pb n="145"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               145
"That you are not," thought Mary; but she
closed her lips and was silent.
Two or three days passed. The Henleys took a
large suite of rooms at the Victoria Hotel, and the
girls had a right good time. Henley ordered his yacht
to be sent round to Falmouth, and they went on
many water expeditions. Kate recovered her wonted
health and high spirits. Nothing ever depressed her,
except the mention of returning to Castellis.
Marys suspicions began to sleep. She avoided
Marryat, however, who began to look at her with
watchful eyes.  It seemed to Mary as if in some
extraordinary way the lady's-maid read the cold
doubt which had gathered round her heart.
As to Ethel she was happy as the day was long.
Kate fascinated her more and more. She believed
that it was nothing but her love for the old Kitty
which was strengthened now that this Kitty had
grown up. She never guessed that it was a new-
born affection for quite a new person.
Meanwhile Marryat was slowly making up her
mind. It was all very well to receive ten golden
sovereigns, or five golden sovereigns, or a bank-note,
as the case might be, from Mrs. Henley, but Marryat
was convinced that she might drop suddenly into
absolute wealth if she played her cards well. She
- had not the slightest idea of betraying her young
: mistress. That would be, she knew, the worst pos-
^ sible policy for herself; but she did wish most ear-
~! nestly to hold her mistress's secret, to keep it as a
power which she might use at will. When Kate
L:was in trouble she hinted at many vague and dread-
| til things; but when Kate was happy she was wont
be reticent, to be haughty, when her moments of
K



<pb n="146"/>
146          AN ADVENTURESS             '
perplexity were alluded to, and, in short, to make ;
Marryat know what her (Marryat's) true position was.
These were the sort of things that the lady's-maid-; :
resented.
"If I am to help her when she is in a fix, she 
ought to be nice to me when she has got out of her 
fix," soliloquised the maid. " Now, if I could find
out what the whole thing means, why then I'd have-
the whip hand. It don't suit me at all not to have
the whip hand. She's as 'aughty a young lady as
can be, and I don't want her 'aughty h'airs to be
spent on me. I'll find out somehow."
Marryat thought and thought. Beyond doubt
Kate had a secret which she shared with a man of
the name of Rogers-a disreputable man, who had
evidently quite sunk below  his original position.
This man, and a woman who lived in Mentone, had
a strange hold over Kate. Marryat, for purposes of
her own, had secured the address of the Mentone
woman whose name was Mildmay. Mrs. Mildmay
was the mother of the girl who had been Kate's cqm-
panion-the girl who had died during the early part
of the year. Now there was a further strange de-
velopment of Kate's secret. She had left Castellis,
not at all for the rubbishy reason which she had
given to her husband, but for quite another cause. -
That cause, beyond doubt, was connected with Sir
John Fenton-Douglas's arrival on the scene. What
had this man to do with the past of bright and beauti-
ful Kate? He was an elderly and married man.
Kate had spent almost all her life in India. Sir John -:
Fenton-Douglas surely could not have met her. there.
" He is too old for any flirtation to have been- B
between them," thought the maid. "Besides, he is*



<pb n="147"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               147
married; and my mistress is not that sort. No;
there is something else. I wish I could see Sir John
and find out from himself. I would go to him, but
I doubt if it is a wise thing to do."
Marryat still kept thinking, and the more she
thought the more restless she became. Finally she
resolved on another step. She would go to see Mrs. 
Mildmay at Mentone. She would go to her as if
Kate had sent her on a message.
"And my name isn't Jeannette Marryat if I don't get
to the bottom of the truth," muttered the maid to herself.
Having made up her mind, Marryat lost no time
in putting her scheme into execution. One morning
at an early hour she went into Kate's room with her
hand to her forehead and her face deadly pale. She
had put on a-considerable amount of powder and had
not rubbed it all off; the room was in shadow, and
Kate, awakening from her rosy sleep, saw Marryat
standing at the foot of her bed.
"Why, Marryat, you are ill. You look very
queer," she said.
" It is because I have had bad news," said Marryat.
".Myj poor mother is taken with a serious attack. I
must go to her at once."
" And leave me ?" cried Kate, her first impulse
being one of pure selfishness.
"-Only for a week or ten days, madam."p
"But what shall I do ?" exclaimed the girl.
"There are those letters, you know."
"You have just sent off an answer to the last, so
it's not likely another will come till I return," said
_Marryat. " In any case, I am afraid I must go,
;n:madam. Of course, if you wish it, I will give you
i~:otice and not return."



<pb n="148"/>
148          AN ADVENTURESS
"Oh, I could not think of that," said Kate. " You
know perfectly well, Marryat, that I cannot do with-
out you."
"I am pleased to think I am of use to you, Mrs.
Henley."
" Must you go to-day ? " said Kate.
"I am afraid I must; the accounts of my mother
are rather bad. She suffers from her lungs, and has
had a fresh attack of hemorrhage."
" Where did you say your home was ?"
"I have no home myself, madam. My mother
is in the south of France."
"The south of France?" said Kate, starting.
"The south of France, Marryat ?"
"Yes, ma'am.   She has lived at a place called
Mentone for some time."
" How queer " gasped Kate.
"You see, madam, it is a long journey, and I
ought to start immediately. My mother has been
moved into a small private hospital; she wants to see
me at once."
"Of course you must go."
"I thought I might take a train to-night which
would reach Dover the first thing in the morning,
then I could cross by the first boat."
" Of course," said Kate. She looked very sad and
troubled. Marryat gazed at her attentively.
"Is there anything I can do for you while I am
at Mentone, madam ? Those letters that come from
there ?"                     '
"To be sure; I was thinking," said Kate. "There
is a person I know in Mentone. You might take her 
a message from me." 
"I certainly will, madam." 
.,. 



<pb n="149"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                I49
"Her name is Mildmay. I should like to write
her a letter and send her a few little things. She is
the mother of the girl whom I was so fond of-the
girl who died there. I should love to send her
something."
Kate sat up on her elbow; her eyes were shining
and her lips trembling.
"She is wonderfully fond of that woman at
Mentone," thoufght the maid.
"Yes, madam," she said aloud; "I'll do anything
in my power."
"Well, if you must go, I dare say I can manage
to live without you. You had better pack your things
and make arrangements."
"I shall be exceedingly obliged, madam."
The maid left the room and Kate sat up in bed.
A moment after she rose and began to dress. As
she did so she felt her heart beat a little quicker
than usual. If there was a person except her hus-
band for whom the desperate girl felt an undying
affection, it was for the worn-out and sad mother
whom she had, as she thought, parted from for ever.-- -
All the time she was dressing she was wondering   ' 
what little comforts she could send her as tokens of
her regard. It would be most dangerous to confide
any more of her secret to Marryat. She was very
sorry that Marryat was going to Mentone. She
thought it most unfortunate that the woman's mother
should be ill there, but as Marryat was going, and
nothing could possibly keep her from going to her
own mother during her illness, Kate thought she
might make the best of a bad job.
"There's One thing certain," she said to herself;
"Marryat cannot guess the truth. Yes, she may

as well go and see mother, and take her some 
things."
Having dressed, Kate looked through her posses- 
sions. From her wardrobe she took handkerchiefs,
collars, cuffs, and gloves. She denuded herself of
several pairs of silk stockings; she even put into
the parcel a little pair of bronze shoes with steel
buckles.
"For mother's feet are so pretty," thought the
girl, "and she never had them nicely shod." Finally,
she wrote a tiny note.
"From Kate, for the sake of Kate Mildmay," was
all that she dared to write. She dared not correspond
with her mother. From her own purse she took a
twenty-pound note and a ten-pound note, and, wrap-
ping them in tissue paper, placed them inside the
envelope and then sealed it with her own little seal.
She made up the parcel as neatly as possible, and
then left it ready for Marryat to put in her box.
"Is this it, madam ?" said the woman later in the
day. " I am to take this to Mrs. Mildmay ?"
"Please, Marryat. You will see her address on
the parcel. And you may tell her about me if you
like. She will be interested to hear."
"Shall I tell her that you are happy, Mrs. Henley ?" 
"Yes-do. Tell her I am very, very, very happy.
She is fond of me, because I remind her of her own 
daughter who died. And, by the way, Marryat, if
you are in the neighbourhood, you might go to the 
English cemetery and see poor Kate Mildmay's grave. 
Buy white flowers, Marryat, for me, and put them.
on the grave." 
Late that evening Marryat took her leave. Kate ':
looked sadly depressed when she bade her good-bye. |:'

"Don't be long away," she said. "You are a
great comfort to me, Marryat."
"I would do anything in my power for you, my
dear young lady," said the maid; and then Kate shook
hands- with her and she departed.
"I declare," thought Marryat, as she stepped into
the cab. "I'm not an affectionate woman, but I do
like her, poor thing, whatever she has done. All the
same, I'll get hold of her secret. I won't betray her
-I'm "not quite so mean as that. I'll know every-
thing though, and then I'll have the whip hand. What-

CHAPTER XVI
MARRYAT arrived at Mentone on the evening of the
next day but one. It is needless to say she had no
mother to visit, her mother having been in her grave
for the last ten years; but the excuse had served her
purpose, and she did not feel the slightest remorse
for the lies she had told.
It was now the beginning of October, and the
little winter resort was still comparatively empty.
Marryat fully intended to act the part of the lady
during this trip. She meant to see Mrs. Mildmay,
and to overawe that good woman into at least a
partial confession of the strange hold which she 
possessed over Kate Henley. For this purpose she "i
(Marryat) must make as much of herself as possible.
On arriving at Mentone, therefore, she desired the
cabman to take her to one of the fashionable hotels.
There she ordered a private sitting-room, and did
everything like a grande dame.                  -
Early next morning she set out in quest of Mrs. 
Mildmay.
"And I should uncommonly like to see the man 
who calls himself Rogers," she said to herself as she
walked down the narrow streets, and then crossing a -
side street, pursued her peregrinations along the shores
of the Mediterranean. Presently she stopped at a
neat 'and comfortable-looking Hotel-Pension which  i
bore the name of Mildmay over the door. It was
52             '   .   :  , B



<pb n="153"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               153
called the "Mildmay Pension," and was specially in-
tended for English people.
Marryat stepped inside, asked to see the manager,
and then boldly demanded an interview with Mrs.
Mildmay.
"The proprietress is out at present," said the man,
speaking in excellent English and staring with some
admiration at the smartly dressed visitor. "But if you
happen-to want rooms, madam," he continued, " I can
supply you. We have plenty of vacant rooms, the
English season having hardly commenced;"
"It is very probable that I shall take rooms here,"
said Marryat. It suddenly occurred to her that it
would be an excellent plan to do so.
"For on the spot I can learn so much more than
during a chance interview," she said to herself. She
was, however, silent for a moment; then she asked the
man to show her the best suite of rooms in the house.
He asked her to step into the lift, and, taking
her upstairs to the first etage, showed her a charm-
ing bedroom  and sitting-room  opening one into
the other.  Out of the season she could have
these two rooms, attendance, and all meals for the
moderate price of twelve francs a day. As this was
considerably less than Marryat was paying at her
hotel, she clbsed with the offer at once.
" I will have my things sent in and will sleep here
to-night," she said.
"Will you have the goodness to leave us your
card, madam,?"
Marryat, grand as she was, had no visiting cards,
'but she wrote her name on a slip of paper  Miss
: leannette Marryat.  She then took her leave, not
!hing again inquired for Mrs. Mildmay.



<pb n="154"/>
154          AN ADVENTURESS
In the course of the evening she arrived with all
her luggage, and was present at table d'hdte. There
were only a few Germans and some Italians now
staying in the pension. Marryat, who knew no tongue
but her own, thought them rather dull, and wondered
how soon she might have an interview with Mrs.
Mildmay. She had no intention, however, of hurry- 
ing matters, and thought that it would rouse suspicion
were she to inquire for the proprietress that evening.
She therefore returned to her sitting-room, ordered a
lamp to be supplied to her, and, taking out a yellow-
backed novel, amused herself reading it until it was
time for bed.
The next day, thoroughly refreshed and with all
her wits about her, she wrote a note to Mrs. Mildmay.
"DEAR MADAM,-I should be glad to see you as {
soon as possible on a private matter. I have a message
from Mrs. Henley for you, whose name before her
marriage was Miss Kate Bouverie.-Yours faithfully,
dear madam,            JEANNETTE MARRYAT."
This note was addressed and then given to a:
chamber-maid, with directions to deliver it at once 
to the proprietress of the hotel.
Mrs. Mildmay was in her private sitting-room, 
going carefully into her daily accounts, when the
missive was put into her hand. When she-read it
she gave a violent start and turned very pale; buti
quickly recovering her composure, said to the girl
X that she would wait on Miss Jeannette Marryat in heri
own room in about a quarter of an hour.
The maid tripped back to give her mistre  l
message, and Marryat, on receiving it, smiled. 
· And



<pb n="155"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                I55
manners to the servants at the hotel were intensely
haughty, and most of them thought that she was a
lady of quality, and in consequence all treated her
with immense respect.
She had dressed herself with extreme care in black
silk, and looked, as she herself expressed it, every inch
the woman of position.
In rather less than the time specified there
came a knock at Marryat's door, and Mrs. Mild-
may, dressed quietly in black, with a white lace cap
on her head, and a white muslin apron, entered the
room.
"Mrs. Mildmay, I presume ?" said Marryat.
"Yes, that is my name," said the widow. "You
say you have come from    my--from   Miss Kate
Bouverie?"
"I have come from Mrs. Henley, madam. I think
I must be frank with you and have no concealments.
I happen to be the dear young lady's maid."
Mrs. Mildmay gave a quick glance at her visitor.
She was inwardly trembling much. She was, she
knew, a very bad person to hold a secret, particularly
an important one. But a glance at Marryat now
caused her to make a strong resolution. She would
fight for Kate-her own Kate-to the death, if neces-
sary.  It was only to look into Marryat's eager face
to see that the woman was devoured by curiosity.
It behoved her,; therefore, to be extremely careful
about what she said and did.
"I shall be glad to receive the message from Mrs.
--Mrs. Henley," she remarked, in a slow and cautious
Voice.
,)-:  "Certainly, madam.  My mistress is extremely
efrnd of you, Mrs. Mildmay. I never saw a young



<pb n="156"/>
156          AN ADVENTURESS
lady so taken up with another as she is with 
you." 
Mrs. Mildmay's first impulse was to say, "That
is scarcely to be wondered at," but again she shut
her lips and fixed her light-brown eyes on the astute 
face of her visitor.
"My mistress has sent you a parcel, which she
begged me to deliver into your own hands."
"Oh, thank you. How kind of her. She was 
always a very sweet child."
"Sweet child I" said Marryat, tossing her head. 
"There ain't much of a child about her now; she's
a woman, and has the ways of one. But I'll fetch 
the parcel and give it to you."
Marryat went into her room, returning a moment
later with the parcel which Kate had made up with
such trembling finers and with so much love in her
heart. The parcel had been securely tied and sealed
with many seals, otherwise Marryat would before now.
have acquainted herself with its contents.
"I believe there is a letter inside," she said as:
she handed it to the widow. "Pray, don't mind me,
if you would like to open the parcel and read the 
letter. I am not in the slightest hurry.":'
"Oh, thank you; but the contents of this little 
parcel can keep," said Mrs, Mildmay. She laid it.
quietly by her side on the nearest table. She was 
dying to leave the room, cut the string, and see tlo
precious contents. Her whole soul was on fire t
hear news of Kate, and, above all, to read such    l
precious thing as a letter from her, but she felt that s
must betray none of her emotions before Marryat.:' 
"If you are her maid you will tell me about hery

158          AN ADVENTURESS
"You did not come here on purpose to see me, did
you ?" said Mrs. Mildmay.
"Well, not exactly," answered Marryat.
"It is a queer time of year for English people to
come to Mentone," continued the widow, "for the
heat is still very great."
"Oh, I thought nothing of that; I just wanted a.
holiday, and as I saw my young mistress would like
to send you a message, I came here."
"Well, I am much pleased to hear of her. I will
leave you now if you have nothing more to say; but
if you will come and have tea with me in my private
sitting-room this afternoon you will, perhaps, tell me
more about Mrs. Henley. I will go downstairs now."
Mrs. Mildmay got up, took the little parcel, gave
her guersa sweeping inclination of the head, and left
the room.
"Upon my word, quite a lady," said Marryat,
when she had done so. "Yes, and a lady who has 
seen bad times. Now, who does she remind me of ?
She's not exactly like, and yet there is a likeness.
between her and my young mistress.   No, there
cannot be a real likeness; she's a plain woman, and
my young mistress is quite lovely. I declare I'm all
on the twitch to go and have tea with her. I must
find out more. I do wish I could get hold of th
man Rogers. He would let out everything he know
if I had money enough to bribe him." Marryat opene
her purse and examined the contents. "AndI coul
spare five sovereigns," she said to herself. "( It wou
be money well spent. I do wonder where he is. 
declare, I'll call at the bureau and ask if they know
man of the name of Rogers."          - 
No sooner had Marryat thought of this than, 



<pb n="159"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               159
ting on her hat, she resolved to act upon it. She made
her inquiry at the bureau, but without any satisfactory
result. No one of the name of Rogers frequented the
hotel. The man at the bureau could give her no
information.  She then went out for a walk, and
during her walk the thought came to her that the
man she had seen at the Grange had probably adopted
the name of Rogers for reasons of his own.
"Anyhow, I know his face," she said to herself,
"and if he has much to do with the widow Mildmay
he is certain to be somewhere near. I'll just take a
good look now, and explore on my own account. I 
must get to the bottom of this business, whatever
happens."
Search as she would, however, Marryat could
nowhere see a sign of Merriman. Mentone is not 
a large place, and he was not lingering round any
of the shops, nor was he in the neighbourhood of the
fashionable hotels, nor sauntering by the shores of 
the Mediterranean. Marryat took a bird's-eye view
of the entire place that morning. She swept it all
over with her sharp eyes, visiting both the East and
the West Bay; but nowhere, search as she would,
-could she see Merriman, alias Rogers.
Almost in despair she went to the post-office, ask-
ing there if the people could give her the address of
a man of the name of Rogers. There happened not
to be a single person of that name staying in
Mentone. 
The lady's-maidwas nonplussed. She little guessed
the reason why she did not see Merriman. As a rule,
he was a lounger, and a lounger of the sort who is
always to be found whether he is wanted or not. But
just now he happened to be on his way to England

I6o          AN ADVENTURESS-
to interview Kate himself. Not being in Mentone,r
Marryat could scarcely find him.
She returned to the Pension Mildmay for lunch,"
and then wondered how she could kill time until the 
moment when she was to have her interview with.
Mrs. Mildmay. Suddenly she remembered Kate's
injunction to visit the grave of the girl who had died.
She asked her way, therefore, to the English cemetery,
and soon afterwards was standing by the white head-
stone which Mrs. Henley had ordered to be put up.
Marryat bent low over it and read the words half
aloud, a critical expression on her face.
"To KATE,
Who went from the Villa Beau Sdjour to a more
abiding Home on the 25th March 1897.
Aged I9 years."
" Queer, queer," muttered the maid.  " Pretty
words, but queer all the same. Now why didn't they
put Kate Mildmay? I'll speak to the widow about 
that omission. It looks very odd-very odd, indeed.
I can make nothing of it; but it puzzles me, that: it
does. Well, I must hasten back now. It's near time
for Mrs. Mildmay's tea."                     -
Marryat returned to the pension, asked for the.n
proprietress, was told that she was out, but that she.;
(Marryat) was expected to tea.            , 
" Perhaps, miss, you would like to wait in Mr.a.

questioned. 
" Certainly," replied Marryat. "That is ra good
idea."                                .'

sharp dancing eyes took in all its contents. It was a
very dull and plain room, quietly furnished. There
was nothing to arouse suspicion about it. At one side
was a large secretaire. This was locked. Not a paper
was about, not an account-book visible. In another
corner was a bookcase filled with old-fashioned and
dull-looking books. There was no other furniture in
:; i the - om except a centre table, a few chairs, and an
.        .ordinry  dismal sofa covered with American cloth.
he room had a sort of uninteresting English effect,
;i:withut any of the comforts which the ordinary English
room possesses.
Marryat rose from her seat. She walked to the
window, she walked to the door, she viewed the room
from each vantage-point, raising her eyes to take in
the ugly prints which decorated the walls. All of a
sudden she gave a sharp exclamation. Amongst the
books in the bookcase was an old-fashioned photo-
graphic album. In an instant she had pounced upon
it, taken it to the centre table and opened it.
' Now, what have I here ? " she cried half aloud
in her excitement. She was looking at a portrait of
Kate Henley taken nearly ten years ago-a childish
portrait in a shabby frock.
." My mistress !" she said to herself. She had
scarcely murmured the words before Mrs. Mildmay
came in. Mrs. Mildmay walked straight up to where
Marryat was sitting, looked at the photograph and
smiled.
"What is -the matter, madam ? " said Marryat.
' I hope you didn't mind my examining these old
photographs. I see a portrait here of my dear young
lady. I didn't know, madam, that you knew her when
she was twelve years old."
T.

"That happens to be a portrait of my own
daughter," said Mrs. Mildmay in a quiet voice.
"Have you never heard how very like the two girls
were the one to the other ?"
"They must have been," said Marryat. She
closed the book, returned it to its place on the book-
case, and turned to face Mrs. Mildmay.



<pb n="163"/>
CHAPTER XVII
MRS. MILDMAY gazed at her steadily. At that moment
she knew quite well why Marryat had come to visit
her. She had come to tear that secret from her breast
which the widow guarded so jealously.
"But she never shall," thought the trembling
woman. "If I ever was a coward, I will be brave
now for Kate's sake-for the sake of my poor, rash,
wicked, but beloved child."
"I see you are puzzled by the likeness," she said;
"but let me show you this."  As she spoke she took
a key from her pocket, and, opening her secretaire,
took out a photograph case. It was an old-fashioned
morocco case, opening with a spring.   When it
opened it revealed the portraits of two girls-two
girls side by side-one dressed richly and fashion-
ably, the other also with a certain style, but in poor
and shabby clothes.
"There," said Mrs. Mildmay, pointing to the
likeness of the girl in the shabby frock, "that is my
daughter, Kate Mildmay; and there," she added, "is
Miss Kate Bouverie, who married Mr. Ralph Henley."
"Remarkable," said Marryat. She took the photo-
graph case in her hand and held it near her eyes,
glancing from one face to the other with a more and
more puzzled expression.
"A speaking likeness of my young lady," she said,
looking hard at the portrait of the real Kate Bouverie
163

*r
164          AN ADVENTURESS
as she spoke. "It is strange how remarkably alike
the two girls were."
"They might have been the very same," answered 
the mother; "you would scarcely know one from
the other." 
" Well, thank you for showing them to me, madam.
I am much obliged."
Mrs. Mildmay shut up the case and returned it to
her desk.
" Now you must tell me all about Mrs. Henley,"
she said. " Sit down, won't you ? in this comfortable
chair. I want much to hear of her; no one was ever
so good to my darling Kate as she was."
"By the way," said Marryat, fixing her sharp,
suspicious eyes on the face of the widow, "I hope 
you won't think me impertinent, but I will own that
I am strangely curious. Mrs. Henley asked me to be
sure and go to see the grave of your daughter."
Mrs. Mildmay suppressed a start.
"I had nothing much to do this afternoon, so I 
went. The inscription on the tomb was very affect- .
ing, very affecting indeed; but why did you not put 
her full name-Kate Mildmay ? It seems queer, very A
queer, only to speak of her as Kate. It don't seem a .
proper record." 
Mrs. Mildmay now put on a little haughty air,
which sat very well upon her.
"Does it matter to you what my reasons are ?" :
she said. " My dear child can never be forgotten by  1
me. I like the inscription best as it is. Ah I here -
comes tea. Let me pour you out a cup." :
"She does it well," thought Marryat f"but she ;
is hiding something, as sure as my name is Jeannette .
Marryat."           I.- 'g.?

Miss Marryat, the lady's-maid, and Mrs. Mild-
may, the proprietress of the Mildmay Pension, had
tea together, and during that meal, probe as she
would, use her ingenuity with all the tact and clever-
ness of which she was capable, Marryat could get no
further clue to Kate Henley's secret. She finally left
the widow, and when she had done so Mrs. Mild-
may locked the door, then she fell on her knees and
covered her face with her trembling hands.
. I_ -"What an escape my child has had !" she cried.
^"Biit I don't think I let anything out. That maid
is a terrible creature! I wish I could warn Kate;
that woman will worm her secret out of her before
long unless she is very careful.  But I dare not
write to her. What is to be done ?"
Two days later Marryat left Mentone and re-
turned to Falmouth.  She arrived at the Victoria
Hotel just as Kate was dressing for dinner. When
Mrs. Henley saw her she gave a cry of alarm.
"Why, Marryat," she said, " how you startled me!
Who ever expected to see you back so soon ?"
"I wanted to get back to you, madam. My mother
took a turn for the better, and I didn't see any sense
in putting myself to unnecessary hotel expenses any
longer. I have very pleasant news for you, madam,
about Mrs. Mildmay.   I took rooms at her nice
pension."
"Oh ! do tell me," said Kate in an eager voice.
"Certainly, Mrs. Henley. I will tell you all about
Mrs. Mildmay when I am brushing your hair this
evening.  Now let me help you to dress for
dinner."'
"I don't really want dinner. I would much rather
hear about Mrs. Mildmay."

CHAPTER XVIII
WHEN the girls left them Mr. and Mrs. Hume decided
to take a holiday on their own account. They went
into Yorkshire, and, when there, travelled about from
p   tace to place. In consequence, letters from Mary
and Ethel did not reach them as frequently as they
would otherwise have done.
A fortnight had passed and Mrs. Hume was feel-
ing very much better for the change, when one day
she remarked to her husband that they had had no
news from the girls for a long time.
"Except a very short letter announcing their
safe arrival wJknow nothing whatever about them,"
she said.
"Well, my dear Susannah, if they were ill we
would be certain to hear," was the short reply.
'(But what is the matter, my love; you are surely
not anxious ?"
"Oh no-not really anxious, but I wonder they
have not written."
t Doubtless a budget of letters awaits us at home.
Remember, we said that ordinary letters were not to
be forwarded."
"I forgot that.. Well, I think I will send a line
and tell the servants to let us have our letters," said
Mrs. Hume.
Mr. Hume gazed for a moment at his wife;
then he spoke.

"I tell you what it is, Susannah; I see you are ai

migd is to go to Castellis."
"Oh ! my dear Robert."
" Yes; it will suit me from many points of view.,
I want to see Kate on a matter of business. Those 
investments in Australian gold mines are not to my
liking. If more satisfactory news does not reach the
market in a day or two I shall insist on Kate selling
out. She has taken a very large number of shares.
I can bring you back word about the girls at the same

Would you like me to bring Mary back with me ?"
"Nothing of the kind, Robert. I would not inter-
fer# with the dear child's pleasure for the world. But,
suily, it is a long way to Cornwall ?"
"Not too long to manage within a day," replied
the lawyer. " I will start by an early train to-morrow
morning.  You are sure you don't mind being
left ?"
's Not in the least. Thompson is always so kind-
and attentive. Do go, of course, if it is necessary." '
This matter being satisfactorily arranged, Mr.
Hume made preparations for his journey, sent a tele-
gram to Mrs. Henley at Castellis to announce his
arrival on the following evening, and the next morn-
ing started for Cornwall.
He had an uneventful and dull journey, and ar-
rived at his destination between nine and ten in the :
evening. It had been dark for several hours before he
got to Wavertree Station, the nearest to Castellis.
The moment he landed on the platform he in-s.
quired of a porter, who came hurrying up, if ~''
carriage was waiting from Castellis.

AN ADVENTURESS               I69
I do*ti think so, sir," answered the man; " but
I'll inquire."
He returned in a moment to say that no carriage
had come from Castellis, that the only carriage waiting
was a brougham from the Pines, which had been sent
to await the 'arrival of Sir John Fenton-Douglas, who
was coming from town.
"Ah! and there he is," said the man. "I'll go
and tell him that. his carriage is here."
"'But this is very awkward," cried Mr. Hume;
'and I am very much surprised. Can I get any sort
of trap to take me to Castellis ?"
" Yes, sir; certainly, sir. We'll send to the village
-it is about ten minutes off-and a fly can be here
in less than twenty minutes."              *
As the man spoke Sir John Fenton-Dougias
was seen approaching. He heard Mr. Hume speak
about Castellis, and, taking off his hat, came
forward. 
"If you are going to Castellis I shall be very
pleased to give you a lift," he said. "My place, the
Pines, adjoins it."
"Thank you very much," replied Mr. Hume.
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hume;
I am Mrs. Henley's uncle. I shall be only too glad
to accept your kind offer."
"Then come this way," said Sir John Fenton-
Douglas. He led the way out of the station, and a
moment later he and Mr. Humewere bowling smoothly
along in the direction of the Pines.
"It was lucky for me that I met you," said Hume.
"I cannot understand my niece not sending a carriage
to meet me. I sent a telegram early this morning to
announce my arrival."



<pb n="170"/>
170          AN ADVENTURESS
"Perhaps I can explain," replied Sif John. "The
family are away from home."
"Away from home I" answered Hume, turning
and facing his host.  "You astonish me. Surely
you must be mistaken, my dear sir.    My two
daughters happen to be staying with the Henleys;
they would not leave home without letting us
know."
"It is a fact, however," replied Sir John. "The
family left Castellis on the day that my wife and I
and our children arrived at the Pines. It-was a serious
loss to us, as Henley had promised to introduce us to
the neighbours; but, no doubt, they will soon be back,
and then it will be all right."
"Odd, very odd," muttered Hume. "And my
girls never mentioned it. Have you the least idea
where they are ?"
"I have not inquired."
"Well, well; it is queer, very queer."
Sir John said nothing.
" I hope you like the Pines," continued Hume 
after a pause.
"We are charmed with the place. It is Mrs. 
Henley's property, is it not ?"
" Yes; she was a Miss Bouverie-a great heiress. 
The fact is, she has more money than she knows what
to do with, and she is as handsome and clever as she 
is rich. I am her guardian and the principal trustee 
to her property. It is a great responsibility."
"Would she be induced to sell the Pines ? "  i
"I do not think so. The fact is, I ami astonished
at her allowing you to have it even at a rent. Her 
father was very fond of the old place, and never woul
hear of any one else living there. Kate adores b,

father's memory.  No, Sir John, I am afraid the
Pines will never become your property."
Sir John said nothing; after a pause Hume spoke
again.
"I hope my niece and her husband will soon
return. There are few more charming people than
they both are; and Kate, as well as being a great
heiress, is also a great beauty, and is as bright and
,amiable as she is good-looking."
"Did you say that your niece's name had been
Miss Bouverie -Kate Bouverie?" said Sir John,
speaking slowly.
"Yes, before her marriage that was her name.
Why do you ask?"
"Merely on account of a curious coincidence  "
Sir John paused. Mr. Hume turned and faced him.
.After a moment Sir John continued-
.,:  "I ought to tell you," he said, "that I have only
lately come into my property and title. A year ago
;  I was a comparatively poor man'-a doctor. My

"Quite well  Of course she is. She is in superb 
health."
"Let me congratulate you."
Mr. Hume did not speak at all for a moment.
Then he said- 
"Kate never mentioned being ill. Your tone
seems to imply that there was something serious the 
matter with her. What do you mean ?"
" People have recovered from serious complaints 
before now," said Sir John.
"Then when you attended her she had a grave 
illness ?"
"She had; she was very ill. I am glad that she
'i!   has recovered."
"She is quite well I I wonder she never men-
tioned it. Where did you say you attended her ? '.
.i     "I have not told you up to the present, but I
will now, At a villa up one of the valleys-the Villa;
Beau Sejour."
"The very place I" said Hume.  "It is extr
ordinary. I went there to see her. Her young com;l
panion died suddenly, and she was in great trouble.'
"What I Miss Mildmay? A remarkablyfine girl! 
"Yes, now that you mention it, I believe her nam
was Mildmay. Kate fretted dreadfully for her; she'
was much attached to her."         '

After a long pause he said-                 .
"I am glad your niece, is well. Doubtless, happ

"Oh, she is really very strong," said Mr. Hum.
" I thought her consumptive," replied Sir John.
"Did you?    When a child her father i

anxious on that point; but she has evidently quite
got over it."
" I am delighted to hear. it."
The two men did not speak again until they
reached the Pines.
" I will dismount here," said Sir John, " and send
the carriage on to Castellis with you."
"Thank you; you are very kind. It is extremely
lucky for me that I met you."          '
They shook hands, exchanged hopes that they
should meet again, and a moment later the brougham
was bowling along in the direction of Castellis.
On arriving there Mr. Hume soon contrived to
make himself comfortable. He obtained Henley's
present address, spent a night under the old roof,
and early the next morning started for Falmouth.
He there transacted his business with Kate, saw that
she looked well and blooming, scolded her for her
nervous terrors with regard to the Castellis ghost,
and announced his intention of leaving Falmouth
for'Yorkshire on the following morning. 
'iBy the way," he said, later on that same day,
u I have a curious thing to mention. I had the good 
;luck to accompany your next-door neighbour, Sir
John Fenton-Douglas, as far as the Pines last night,
otherwise I should have had either to wait for a trap
from the village or to walk the whole way. In future,
Kitty, when you leave home unexpectedly, let your
relations know."
"Oh I it was all my fault cried Ethel. "I have
been so lazy I hardly ever wrote; and then, father,
you said the letters were not to be forwarded."
." So I did, my child."
" Would .you suppose, father," said Mary, speak-

ing suddenly, "that Kate was a nervous person-the
sort of person who would be terrified by a ghost ? "
"I don't suppose what is a fact," replied Hume.
"Kate is evidently terrified of the ghost, as she has
run away from it. She inherits her fear from her
mother. What a little goose you made of yourself
about that same ghost when you were a child, Kitty 1"
"Yes, yes; how well I remember," answered
Kate."
"And that reminds me," said Hume, "I have
something to scold you about, Kate. You never
mentioned how ill you were last year.'
"Ill-last year?" she said, colouring. "What
do you mean ?'
" My dear girl, I can quite understand your very
unselfish wish not to alarm us unnecessarily, but you
must have been very bad indeed. Sir John Fenton-
Douglas told me all about it."
Mary uttered a short laugh.
"This is most interesting," she said. " How in
the world did Sir John Fenton-Douglas, who ha*
never seen Kate to nly certain knowledge, get the
information of her illness ?"
My dear Mary, you have a very rude habit of ;
interrupting," said her father, with some iWpatience. 
"But under the circumstances I will forgive you.
There is quite a little romance about Sir John. He
only came in for the property lately, and was a
doctor at Mentone when Kate happened to be there.
'He says that he attended you, Kate:'
" Kate Mildmay he means," replied Kate.
"No, my dear, he said he attended y(i, and that
you were very ill. He even seemed to thila at
you were threatened with consumption." :

AN- ADVENTURESS              175
"Oh, nonsense I that she is not/' said Mary, with
a short laugh. As she spoke her eyes grew bright and
round. She fixed them upon Kate's face.
"Did you know," she said suddenly, " that Sir
John Fenton-Douglas and the Mentone doctor were
one and the same ?"
" Ralph mentiond the fact to me," replied Kate.
,  " And you nir told us ?"
;"' It escaped my mind.    But I remember now
I    :: had a bad cold, and that Dr. Fenton attended

'oily visited we two or three times."
"He must have done you a great deal of good if
he really thought you consumptive, and if you have
recovered."
"His prescriptions were excellent  The balmy
air also put me to rights."
As Kate spoke she rose to her feet.
" It was really Kate Mildmay he must have been
thinking about," she said.  "She, poor girl, was
very ill."
"Now, my dear Kitty, I d6 not know what you
mean," said her uncle. "He spoke of Kate Mildmay
as in robust health. What are you talking about ?"
" It seems to me," said Mary, "that you, Kate,
and father are having a game of cross purposes.
What fun this is I You say you were quite well at
Mentone. Sir John Fenton-Douglas says you were
very ill indeed. You say your friend, Miss Mildmay,
was very ill, and Sir John says she was in. perfect
health. Now who speaks the truth on this occasion,
you or the doctor?"

I see Sir John I shall laugh at him for his very short
memory."
"Well, well," said Ralph Henley, who was stand-
ing by his wife; "do not let us discuss this matter
any more. But, Kitty, my love, if you really at any
time of your life had a tendency to consumption, had
we not better go abroad for the winter ??"
"There is nothing in all the world I should like
better," replied Kate. 
"Then we will do it," he said.
"It is not a bad idea, Kate," said Mr. Hume.
"Of course, any one to look at you now, can see
that you are in buoyant health; but it is best to be
on the safe side. And your poor mother died of
consumption. Well, I shall go to bed now. I have

had retired to their rooms, Kate sought her husband.
Anxiety had made her blooming face look pale, and
there were dark shadows under her eyes. She had
already dismissed Marryat; and now she sat down
close to Henley, and laid her head on his shoulder. ;
"Oh, my darling, how I love you I" cried the:- !

"No, my dearest, I love you for yourself-for
your bonhy, little, darling, sweet self-for the lov-
ableness which is in you. I love you because you
are so affectionate, so womanly, so true:'
"Don't 1" cried the girl, a sudden passion and
pain in her voice. "Ralph, dearest, best beloved, I
have come here to-night to confess something to you."
" To confess to me ? My darling, what can you
have to confess ? If there ever was a white little life, 
it is yours ? What do you mean, Kitty ? "
"Nothing dreadful," she answered, with a laugh.
"And yet I think you ought to know."
"Well, I am listening."
"I did not tell you, nor Uncle Robert either, how
seriously ill I was at Mentone last year."
"Then it was true?" said the young man, his
heart beating hard. "You were very ill?"
" Yes, Ralph, I was very ill."
"And Dr.Fenton, who is now Sir John Fenton-
Douglas, attended you ?"
"He did."
" But Kitty, why didn't you tell us ? Why should'
there be any mystery about the matter? Had we
known, we -"    He broke off abruptly. "The fact
is, Kate, we always looked upon you as very strong."
"And I am very strong now-at least, I think I
am. But I was ill then, and Dr. Fenton was nervous

"My love, even looking after you would not give
her consumption. Why, Kitty, you are trembling all
over."
"Put your arm round me, Ralph. Ah that is
better. When I feel you close to me, and your great,
strong heart beating against mine, I am calm and
happy. Ralph, all the world may be on one side
of the scale, and you on the other. If such were the
case, I know which side the balance would go down.
I don't want the world, nor beauty, nor wealth-I
only want you. Oh, my husband, I shall go mad if
we are ever to be parted 1"
"Why should we be parted?  Kate, you really
must be ill again now. Altogether, my dear little
girl, your nature is developing in a very queer
way. You have become so nervous about the ghost,
and--"
" I was alwayopus about the ghost. Why do
you forget it? Ralph, Just speak of that, too. I
cannot go back to Castellis; I can never go back."
" On account of the ghost ?"
" Partly on account of the ghost, and also- "
-   "Ah I perhaps we are coming to the true reason
now."
"The ghost is one of the reasons, I assure you; but
there is another. I don't want to meet Dr. Fenton."
" But, my dearest Kate, why not ? My dear girl,
this is very awkward. We really must return to my
home some time; and Dr, Fenton has taken the Pines
for five years."

I determined that you should never know."
" I should have married you in any case," said the
young man gravely.
" I feared you would not. I was a coward, and
I kept the secret of my illness to myself. But, Ralph
dear, don't look so gloomy. I am quite well now."
" I hope you are. You look very pale, and how
you are trembling to-night  I have often noticed
lately, too, that you seem depressed."

as possible. A winter in Australia will set me up. I
know I am really strong, and at present there is no
danger."
"But there is. This is most terrifying I" cried
Henley. "You must come up to town with me and
see one of our best doctors. I insist upon it."
"No, no; please don't ask me. Do take me away.
If I happen to be ill when we get to Australia, then I
will see some doctor. Oh, Ralph, don't delay."

CHAPTER XIX
As Sir John Fenton-Douglas walked slowly up
the winding avenue of the Pines after his somewhat
startling interview with Mr. Hume, he thought much.
"So that healthy, bouncing, clever-looking girl is
dead," was the hurried exclamation which dropped
from his lips; "and the other girl who was in the
last stage of consumption is alive. The consumptive
girl has recovered her health, and is now a married
woman. I left her dying. In my opinion she had
not a week longer to live. She is now married to
'Henley, and is, according to her uncle, in superb
bi:dtb. Impossible 1"
Ij;--irJobn stopped in his walk.
.yaElF~i~e   are no miracles in these days," he
; 't: :"II could not have been mistaken; I
attended her for some weeks. One lung was gone,
and the other nearly so. The girl who died, and
who must have died pretty quickly, was in the
ruddiest health when I saw her last. The consump-
tive girl, who had, in my opinion, not a week to live,
is now quite well. What does this thing mean ?"
.tn   Sir John thought hard. He was not an imagina-
tive man, nor one likely to suspect anybody. The
. Idaiing game which Kate had played would have been
:7 "i opo.sible for him even to conceive, but he was so far
:i.trbed by Mr. Hume's news that he could scarcely
-iUt his Ildinner, and his wife noticed his abstraction.



<pb n="182"/>
I82         AN ADVENTURESS
"There must be another Kate Bouverie," he said 
to himself; "that is the only explanation. And yet 
Mr. Hume-id speak of the girl in question as living 
at the Villa Beau Sdjour."
"What is the matter, John ?" said his wife. 
"Nothing," he replied. He was always a very 
taciturn man.
Lady Fenton-Douglas looked as if she did not
quite believe this statement.
"My dear," he said then, "I am trying to untie
a knotty problem."
He did not tell his wife anything about his meet-
ing with Mr. Hume. She was rather sore on the
subject of the Henleys, considering that Kate and 
her husband had been guilty of rudeness in leaving
Castellis just on the arrival of herself and family.
Sir John spent several hours in his study that
night. While there he studied the latest medical
works on tuberculosis.  He looked into that tre-
mendous subject from every point of view, trying to
bring the newest lights to bear upon it. At the end
of his reading he shook his head, feeling more puzzled
than ever. 
By the next morning he came to a resolution.
Why should he not visit the Henleys ? Why should
he not see Kate Bouverie, his old patient, once again ?
Nothing would be more natural than for him to call
on her. Mrs. Henley was his landlady-Henley he
already knew. If she were indeed his old patient,
how glad she would be to talk of her marvellous
recovery  and, doubtless, he could induce her to
allow him to sound her lungs-thus many perplexities
would be laid to rest.
Notwithstanding his great change of fortune, Sir



<pb n="183"/>
AN ADVENTURESS              I83
John Fenton-Douglas had still an intense love for  1  -
profession, and there were days when he longed for
the old busy practical life. 
"A case like this ought to be reported in tht
Lancet," he said to himself. "Yes, I must get the 
young lady to let me apply the stethoscope. I will
go to Falmouth by the first train this morning."
But all that day Sir John found that he could not
go to Falmouth.  A large Pltty of friends were
coming, and Lady Fenton-DoJis meant her husband
to meet them. The next day, however, nothing pre-
vented his carrying out his intention, and between
twelve and one o'clock he found himself walking up
the Parade in the direction of the Victoria Hotel.
He reached the hotel, inquired for the Henleys, and
sent up his card.
Kate had just come in' from a walk. She, Ethel,
and Marywere standing near one of the windows
examining some purchases they had made. Henley
was writing at a little table some way off. From
wkere1 h sat he could see his wife's face in a mirror.
He glanced now and then at her blooming, healthy
face with a puzzled expression.  Surely what she
had said to him the night before was only a
dream I Surely she, his lovely Kate, was not con-
sumptive I It is true he had heard before now that
consumptive people often looked in robust health.
Perhaps this was the case with Kate; and, beyond
doubt, the taint was in the family, the girl's mother
having died of the dreaded disease. He must not
delay in taking her away. He hated the thought of
going to Australia; he was an Englishman, every
inch of him, and loved his native land, but all wishes
o .f his own must be put into subservience to the one

most passionate desire of his life-to keep the young
wife so precious to him by his side.
Just then a waiter entered the room bearing Sir
John Fenton-Douglas's card.
He brought the card to Kate.
"The gentleman has inquired for you, madam,
and is waiting in the coffee-room," he said.
Mrs. Henley glanced at the card, then went
across the room to her husband, bent down, and
began to whisper in his ear.
"Sir John Fenton-Douglas has come," she whis-
pered. "Go and see him for me,Ralph; I cannot. Make
any excuse you like. I cannot see him. I won't "I
"My dear Kitty, don't you--"
She placed her hand across his mouth.
"No, no, I cannot. I won't see him. Take him
out lor a walk; give him lunch in the coffee-room.
Don't ask me to see him."
"All right, darling; don't distress yourself.  I
will look after him."
Henley turned to the waiter, who was still stand-
ing in an attitude of attention near the door.
"Tell Sir John Fenton-Douglas that I will be with
him immediately," he said.
The man withdrew.
Ethel, who was returning her packages to their
brown-paper wrappings, looked up now with a start.
-  Has Sir John Fenton-Douglas called?" she
said. "Oh, I should so like to meet him I He is
the man with the romantic history-the doctor who
4 ttended your poor little friend Kate Mildmay when
you were in Mentone, Kate."
"So should I greatly like to see Sir John," said
Mary in that slow, somewhat emphatic way in which

she had lately learned to speak. "Of course, Kate,
you are going to ask him up ?"
"No," replied Kate.
"But," echoed Mary, "what do you mean ?"
"Because I do not wish to see him."
"But this is most extraordinary," said Mary.
"Oh, never mind," interrupted Ralph, coming
forward at that moment. " For goodness' sake, girls,
don't worry Kate; she is not well. There, my love, -
you shall do just as you wish. I will see Sir John."
Henley slowly left the room.  He went down-
stairs, pausing at every third step. He was com-
pletely puzzled.
"How could any one guess even for a moment
that my brilliant, darling, spirited Kate had once
been consumptive ?-and ·is now   devoured  by

"She certainly was."
"Shall we go on the Parade for a little? You
will lunch with me presently, of course; but I should
like to talk this matter out thoroughly with you."
A satisfied expression crept over Sir John's face.
This was exactly what he wished to do himself.
Henley gave orders with regard to lunch, and then
took his guest out.
Kate, who had now retired to her bedroom,
watched them from behind a curtain. She had left
the girls to wonder and speculate to their hearts 
content. She was alone.
" Oh, what is he going to tell him ?" she thought.
She clasped her hands tightly together in her agony.
The two men turned in the direction of the sea.
"'I am really sorry I cannot see Mrs. Henley,"
said Sir John. " Her recovery has given me the
most unfeigned pleasure, and I wished to congratu-
late her. I was much astonished when I heard from
Mr. Hume two nights ago that the young lady whom 
you had married was the same whom I attended at
Mentone last year."
"Yes, she is the same. As I said just now, she 
told me last night that she had been very ill when.t
you attended her." 
" She told you the truth." 
"Will you be quite frank with me, Sir John, and
tell me if, in your opinion, my wife was in danger at
that time ?"
"Danger I" said Sir John, thrown off his guard ; l
and a little nettled at Kate's refusal to see him. " M i.
dear sir, in my opinion your wife at that time ha4[
not twenty-four hours to live." 
Impossible I You cannot be telling met

Some accident."
' Nothing of the kind."
" What ailed her then ?"
"Consumption, sir-galloping consumption, if
you like to give it its true name I One lung gone,
the other nearly so I"
"You must be mistaken," said Henley.    He
started back. It seemed to him as if a hand had
clutched his throat. His bonny, blooming Kate ill
-ill unto death.
"I see you are overcome," said Sir John. "Some
miracle has taken place if your wife is well now;
but I am telling you the truth with regard to her
condition then."
"But, my dear sir, people as ill as all that-I
have studied the subject a little myself-do not
recover as my wife recovered. She is nervous and
fanciful, it is true, but I have never even heard her
cough. She is absolutely healthy."
"I am astonished and delighted to hear it," said
Sir John. " I called to-day for the express purpose
of seeing her in order to ascertain with my own eyes
if her recovery is likely to be permanent."
"Oh, you must see her. She is queerly nervous
about you, and says that her old unpleasant feelings
[ will return if you visit her."
~ . "She must not be so silly," replied Sir John. " I

three or four minutes; I will promise not to worry
her."
"Of course she shall see you. I will tell her
that you need not meet again for some little time.
It is not, of course, that she dislikes you personally,
but-I think you understand."
"I am puzzled," said Sir John; "and, doubtless,
a sight of your wife will clear up some mysteries.
For instance, her young companion-a fine, bloom-
ing, handsome girl-has died, and your delicate wife
is restored to health."
"That is so; but do not let us say any more.
Come back with me now to lunch. I will tell Kitty
afterwards and persuade her to see you."
The men returned to the hotel, had lunch together,
and soon afterwards Henley went up to his wife's
room. He entered the drawing-room. Mary was
lounging in an easy-chair. Neither Kate nor Ethel
were to be seen.
"Mary," said Henley, "do you know where
Kitty is ?"
"I suppose she is in her room. She wouldn't
take any lunch. Sir John Fenton-Douglas's arrival    |
upset her very much. What does it mean, Ralph ?  i
"Why should you suppose it means anything,
Mary    But there, I must tell you the truth. My
poor darling Kitty has an hereditary tendency to 
consumption, and I mean to take her to Australia .
immediately.
Mary gave a scornful laugh. 
' Why do you laugh like that, Mary ?"
"Because you are such a goose, Ralph. Forgive?
me for saying so. Kate is no more consumptive tha",
I am." '                                     ' ?!:

"Out    Did she tell you where she was going ?"
"No, sir."
"That will do, Marryat."
Henley went downstairs.
"Well, will she see me?" said Sir John.
"She has gone out, Sir John. I cannot find her."
"Then I will call another day. Give my compli-
ments to your wife, and tell her that I am delighted
to hear of her marvellous recovery to health. Say
that I will do myself the honour of calling on her
some day next week."
He took his departure, and Henley, with a sigh
of relief at seeing the last of him, went to the smok-
ing-room.
" How uncomfortable he made me feel 1" he said
to himself. "On the whole, I am glad that he has
gone.  He must have had a dream about Kitty.
She never, never surely was so near the point of
death":
Between five and six o'clock he saw Kate return-
ig. He went into the hall to meet her.

"Well?" she said, looking at him.  Her lips 
trembled and her eyes were brighter than he had    ;
ever seen them.
"Sir John has gone, darling. But oh, Kitty, I
must have a talk with you. Come to our room. I
want to say something to you all alone."
Kate immediately turned and went upstairs. Her
steps were firm but her heart was like lead.
"' He does not know all. He does not even sus-
pect.the truth yet," she said to herself. "And yet
he knows far, far more than he ought."
They entered the bedroom, and Henley shut the
door.                 a
t Well, Kate," he said, " I wrung the truth out of 
Sir John, and he really gave me a most alarming
account of your health last year at Mentone. My
darling, we must go to Australia immediately; but
beforehand I want you to do something for me."
"I will certainly do what I can, Ralph."
"I want you to relieve my fears."
"How? "
"You can do it easily. Sir John is a very kind:
and courteous and, I am sure, clever man. He saw
you in your illness; he wants to see you again."
"No, no," said Kate, turning awky. "I cannot
see him; don't ask me.'                 *
"But, dearest, do be reasonable. He wishes to 
examine your lungs. Will you not let him for my;:,
sake ? "
"Not even for your sake," said Kate.
"Not if I beg and beseech of you? Kate, 
dear, you are not a silly, nervous woman-not reallI
I mean. Do relieve my anxiety." 
Kate remained silent for a moment or two.  .

AN ADVENTURESS              I91
" If you really wish it, and it is indispensable, you
must get some other doctor to examine my lungs,"
she said, "but not Dr. Fenton. I hate the man, and
I won't see him."
Henley looked at her with much distress.
" I tell you what it is," he said suddenly. "You
and I will go up to town to-morrow. We can stay
for a couple of days, and you shall see Dr. Martin
Hewitt, the best man for consumption. Will you
do that ?"
"If you insist, Ralph. But why will you not
believe that I am better? Do I look like a con-
sumptive person ?"
"I told Sir John that you did not."
" Ah, you told him that ? "
"Indeed, I did; but then you know, darling, con-
sumptive people often look well. You must relieve
my anxiety. I insist on your seeing a first-rate phy-
sician. Australia may not be the best place for you
tp go to. Consumptive patients are often now sent
tb high altitudes. We must take the very best ad-
vice, Kate. You know, my darling, you are no
ordinary person; you are my precious little wife,
and a very rich woman. You shan't die, my own
Kitty, not if I can keep you alive."
"Ah 1" she said, with a pant; " how much you
love me I'"  Her lips were parted, tears trembled in
her eyes, and the next moment she ran to her hus-
band, put her arms round his neck, laid her head on
his shoulder and burst into tears.
"Oh, my dearest," she sobbed, "I want to live
for you. I won't die. Can you not believe that I
am stronger now? Can you not believe that I am
quite well?"

"There is nothing I more earnestly wish to believe,
Kitty; but this London doctor must see you."
"Very well," she answered. Her heart sank.
"We will go to-morrow morning."
She thought hard.  Her wits must help her
through the coming ordeal.. After all, anything
would be better than staying in the neighbourhood
of Sir John Fenton-Douglas.
" I will get an A B C," said Henley, "and we
will look up the trains."  His usual good spirits re-
turned at the prospect of immediate action.  He
brought the railway guide into their room, and they
looked up the trains together.
it It is a long journey," said Henley; " but the best
train leaves here at eleven. We shall reach Padding-
ton about seven in the evening. On the following
morning we will go to see the doctor, and we can
return here.the next day if you wish it."
" Very well," answered Kate.
Her husband looked at her, noticed the weary
tone of her voice, uttered a sigh, and .left the room. ·
Kate rang her bell, and Marryat appeared. 
Marryat looked important, and as if she were
bubbling over to say something. Kate knew that
expression on her face only too well.:
" What is it?" she said wearily. "Anything fresh ?"
"Nothing particularly fresh, madam; but that
man Rogers is in Falmouth. I saw him tbday."
Kate turned white.
"Then I am doing right to go away," she said tc~'
herself. " Marryat," she continued in a brisk voic
which concealed the fear which was eating int
her heart, "Mr. Henley and I are going to Londoi.
to-morrow."



<pb n="193"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               I93
" Of course, you will want me to pack your things
and go with you, madam."
"You must pack for me, of course, but you can
stay here. You must see Rogers and keep him at
bay. You may give him a trifle. Here is a five-
pound note. Get it changed into sovereigns, and give
him one at a time. Whatever happens, Marryat, keep
him at bay; he is dangerous."
"He knows something of your past, Mrs. Henley ?"
"He knows something which I do not wish men-
tioned. To have it known would annoy me very
much. We need not discuss that matter."
"It seems a pity you wouldn't see Sir John
Fenton-Douglas to-day, madam."
"I could not, Marryat; the man got on my
nerves."
" You won't tell the reason ?"
"No; I am tired and have a headache. Marryat,
you are to keep the fact that I have gone to London
a secret from Rogers."
Marryat remained silent, looking fixedly at Kate.
After a time she came forward, bent low over her
mistress and said-
" You are going to London, and, doubtless, that is
well; but if I were you I would do something else."
"What is that ?"
"I would take the two young ladies up to town
with me,"
"Why so? Surely Ethel-    "
"Oh, as to Miss Ethel," said Marryat in a tone
of contempt, " I am not considering her one way or
the other; but Miss Mary is dangerous."
"Dangerousl" said Kate. "What do you mean?"
" She knows a little, and she means to know more.
N



<pb n="194"/>
I94          AN ADVENTURESS
She distrusts you, madam, and is not friendly. I have
read her thought in her face, and I know I am right.
Don't leave her behind. She might come across Sir
John Fenton-Douglas, for instance, or she might meet
Rogers. In such a case there is no saying what mis-
chief might take place. Take the young ladies to
London; it will be safer."
' Thank you, Marryat; I will do so."
"Soon afterwards Kate left the room. Dinner
was announced, and the little party took their usual
meal just as if nothing had occurred. Kate laughed,
talked, and made herself merry as if no sword of
Damocles was hanging over head.  Mary watched
her, but could detect no unwonted alarm or uneasi-
ness in her blooming face.
Ralph also watched her, and comforted his heart
with the truism that the wisest doctors make mistakes,
,  and that Kitty, his darling, was not seriously ill.
When dessert was placed on the table Kate bent
forward and touched Mary on the arm.
" Will you and Ethel pack your things to-night ? "
she said.
Mary started.
"What do you mean ?"
"This. Ralph and I have to go to town to-
morrow on business, and it will be a good opportunity
for you and Ethel to come with us."
" But, Kate, what do you mean ?" cried Ethel.
"Father and mother are still away, and the Grange
is dismantled."
"Really, my dear Kitty," cried Henley in astonish-
ment, "the girls may just as well stay here; you know
we intend to return on Friday."
"We cannot tell what our plans will be," replied

AN ADVENTURESS               195
Kate. I am sorry to seem inhospitable, but there is
no use keeping rooms on at this expensive hotel, and
surely Ethel and Mary know me too well to be of-
fended. My dear cousins, the facts are these. It is
inconvenient to me your remaining at Falmouth any
longer.  If you will get ready we can all go to
London together to-morrow, and the next day you
can proceed to the Grange. We will take you to our
own hotel for the night."
Ethel turned pale and then red.
" If you really wish it, Kate," she said.
Mary was silent for a moment. '
"Come, Ethel, and let us pack," was her short
remark then.
"Marryat must help you," cried Kate.
"No, thank you," answered Mary.
The girls left the room and went slowly upstairs.
" She is afraid-and that is why she is sending us 
away," said Mary.
Ethel stared at her sister but did not reply.

CHAPTER XX
THE little party went up the next day to London.
Their journey was without adventure. Marryat went
to the station to see her mistress off, and Kate was
glad when the train moved on and she knew that each
instant she was putting a greater and greater distance
between herself and Sir John Fenton-Douglas and
also Rogers. 
During the journey her spirits rose, and by the
time she got to town she was so gay and bright and
charming that Ethel and Ralph were quite at ease
about her. Even Mary's watchful glances had now
scarcely power to affect her. The very imminence
of the danger had roused her mettle. She felt that
she might defy Mary, who suspected much, yet knew
nothing. The real danger lay in the fact that she
must see one of the great doctors for consumption on
the morrow. She knew well that he would pronounce
her lungs absolutely sound, that he would say, further,
that those lungs had never been affected. Perhaps
never before in the world's history did a healthy young
woman earnestly desire to have diseased lungs, but at
that moment Kate in her extremity would have gladly
welcomed some traces of tuberculosis, terrible as the
disease is.
During tle journey, however, an idea came to her,
and she quickly resolved to adopt it. They reached
town and drove to the "Metropole."  Here they



<pb n="197"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               197
engaged rooms, and immediately after dinner Kate
pleaded fatigue and begged to be allowed to retire to
her room and to go to bed. As she bade her hus-
band good-night she spoke again of the great and
overpowering weariness which had visited her. He
kissed her and looked anxious.
"Would you like me to send for Dr. Martin
Hewitt now ?" he said. " I believe he is quite the
greatest authority of the day on lung diseases."
"No, no," answered Kate. "What a goose you
are, Ralph I my lungs are right enough."
"But you were very ill last spriig."
"Last spring is not now, remember. I will see
the doctor, as you insist on it, to-morrow, but do let
me be in peace to-night.'
"My room is exactly opposite to yours, Kate, at
the other side of the passage. If you want me you
will be sure to call me."
" I will."
"I wish you had brouht up Marryat. You are
sure you want for nothing?"
"Yes; I want my bed and a long, sound sleep.
I'll see you in the morning, Ralph."
As his footsteps sounded down the passage Kate
locked her door.  She had now several hours in
which to perfect her plan. She took her watch out
and looked at it eagerly; it was a few minutes past
nine--still comparatively early. Marryat being out
f the way made matters all the better. The fewer
knew of Kate's present intention the better for
safety. She changed her dress, putting on an old
ue serge, which she had worn long ago when
B sn innocent girl. Over the dress she slipped
- tmerproof cloak, put a nurse's bonnet on her

head, a thick veil over her face, and, opening her door, :
locked it on the outside; she then slipped the key'
into her pocket and ran downstairs.
Henley, Mary, and Ethel were amusing themselves
as best they could in the drawing-room, but even
if Henley had met Kate now he would scarcely have
recognised her. She passed through the hall and stood
for a moment on the front steps. A porter who was
standing by asked if he might call a cab. Kate shook
her head without replying. She walked up the-street
in the direction of Trafalgar Square, and hailing the
first hansom she met, got in and gave the driver an ad-
dress-" 40 Mortimer Street," she said. 
The man whipped up his horse, and in about a
quarter of an hour Kate had reached her destination.
Before her marriage she had insisted on her uncle
allowing her to have a separate banking account, and 
she had further made a special request that he should
place to her credit in the bank the sum of six thou. 
sand pounds. Up to the present she had drawn very
little upon this sum, but she knew the time had come 
when she must sp e  it frely. She laughed when 
she thougleof theWler this money gave to her.
The house&i Mortimei Street was a quiet one. '
Kate got out of the hansom, paid the fare, and then
rang the bell. A maid-servant answered her summons.
"Is Mrs. Johnson in ?" asked Kate.
The woman replied in the affirmative.
"'I wish to see her."
" Have you an appointment, madam ?"
"No; but I wish to see her, and my business is
urgent."  :"-;
The woman stared at Kate, but finally admitted :'i
her into thela.ll. 



<pb n="199"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               I99
"I will see if my mistress can attend to you," she
said. " What name shall I say ?"
"Miss Pryce," answered Kate.
The woman left Kate standing in the hall. It was
dimly lighted and the furniture was of the barest, but
it was quite neat and clean. In a minute or two the
servant returned and invited Mrs. Henley to follow
her to a room on the first floor. This room was also
furnished barely, and had something the appearance
of an old-fashioned drawing-room. There was an ugly
centre table, a few chairs of conventional pattern, the
usual lodging-house sofa, and one fairly comfortable
easy-chair, into which Kate sank. She kept her veil
down. In spite of all her efforts her hands trembled
-otherwise, she knew that she was calm and steady.
After waiting for about five minutes the room door
was opened and a little middle-aged woman in rusty
black entered. She went straight up to the gasalier in
the centre of the room and turned all the lights on full.
Kate still remained with her veil down.
"Miss Pryce?" said Mrs. Johnson in an inter-
rogative way.
"Yes," answered Kate; and she added, "You
are Mrs. Johnson ?"
"I am Mrs. Johnson; but you are not really
Miss Pryce ?"
"That is true; but I thought it safer to come to
you under a feigned name. My errand is important
:.  and secret:'
" I can do nothing for you unless you wholly con-
fide in me. Before we proceed any further you must
- tell me who you really are."
>. ,; Kate sat absolutely silent: her heart beat hard.

veil, flung it back,.and turned her lovely face full on
her hostess. 
"What a beautiful creature " murmured the
woman under her breath. She gazed at Kate as if
she could not remove her eyes. Kate slowly un-
fastened one of her gloves, slipped it off, and exposed
her hand with its wedding ring and magnificent
diamond keeper to full view.
I thought you were a married lady," said Mrs.
Johnson.
I am. I have made up my mind to trust you.
It is dangerous, but not so dangerous as my present
position. My name is Kate Henley. I am in trouble,
and I want you to help me:'
" If in my power," said Mrs. Johnson.
"It is quite in your power."
"What do you want me to do ?"
"You are a doctor, are you not ?"
" I am. But how did you hear of me ?"
"I have known of your existence for some time.
I have made myself acquainted with many strange
characters; it has been necessary in my life."
Then you are not what you seem ?"
"I am quite what I seem. I am Mrs. Henley,
the wife of a rich man. I am a very rich woman my-
self, too, independent of my husband. I can pay you
well for what I want you to do."
"What is that?"
"Before we come to that question we must arrange
terms."
"Certainly," replied Mrs. Johnson.  "I quite
agree." She now drew her chair close to Kate's.
"Just excuse me a moment," she said suddenly. She
got up, crossed the room, locked the door, put the



<pb n="201"/>

key in her pocket, and then returned once more to her
seat opposite her beautiful visitor.
"Now," she said, "I am at your service."
"Are you a fully qualified medical practitioner ?"
asked Kate.
"Why do you ask?"
"Because I wish to know."
Mrs. Johnson was silent.
"There must be no concealment between us,"
continued Kate emphatically. " If I tell you my secret,
you must tell me yours. There I I will tell it to you;
it will save trouble. You are not fully qualified. You
cure people, but you have no right to cure them. In
other words, you are what the profession would call
a quack."
Mrs. Johnson's face grew very red.
"I don't care that for the profession I" she said,
in an emphatic voice. "Curse every one of 'eml
Yes, you may call me a quack if you like. I have
performed more wonderful cures than any other
doctor in London."
" I am delighted to hear you say so. I am also
glad that you are what the profession call a quack.
If you were not the character you evidently are you
would not be of the slightest use to me."
"Why so?"
"Because what I want you to do is-shady."
"Ah I" Mrs. Johnson did not again change colour,
but on her hardened face the lines grew deeper, the
lips became more compressed, the dark, closely-set
eyes more watchful. It was a thoroughly evil face
which now looked full into Kate's.
·  It is all right," said Kate, but she trembled as
'.e spoke. Bad as she was herself, wicked as all her

actions had been since the death of the real Kate
Bouverie, she had never before come face to face
with evil in others. As she looked into the face of
the woman before her she knew that she was close to
evil. She watched it, and then, as in a vision, she saw
another face-the high-minded, proud, honourable
face of her husband. Could there in all the world
be a greater contrast than the face of Ralph and the
face of Mrs. Johnson ? And yet, because she wanted
to keep the one always by her side, she must use the
skill and power which was manifest with all its sin
on the face of the other.
She gave a shudder, and just for a moment it
rushed through her mind that she had chosen badly;
but she pushed the thought out of sight; she meant
to carry on her scheme now to the bitter end. To
do anything else would part her from Ralph-to part
from Ralph would be the straw too much. She might
stand a good deal, but not that.
"Well?" said Mrs. Johnson.
Kate looked at the clock on the mantelpiece, the
minutes were flying. She might be discovered if she
went back too late to the " M4tropole."
"' I want you to help me," she said. "But, first
of all-terms."
" What do you require ? "
"Absolute and complete secrecy."
"If that is all, you shall have it. It would be
against my own interests to betray you."
" I think so; I have thought over that," said Kate,
with a sigh of relief. "Well, I am prepared to pay
you."
" Naturally,'" said Mrs. Johnson, with an unpleasant
laugh.

"A large sum," continued Kate.
" I should not dream of taking anything else."
"I have now in my pocket a cheque-book. I
will fill in, after I have explained matters, and you
have assured me that you will do what I want, a
cheque for two hundred pounds."
"Not enough-nothing like enough."
"You shall have that cheque to-night."
"Not enough," repeated Mrs. Johnson.
Listen. That is not all that I mean to do. I
want to go to Australia."
"Ah I"
"I want to start in a week."
"Yes."
"You can help me to go there."
"How ?"
"I will explain in a moment-our terms are not
settled yet."
The woman in the shabby black dress waited,
suspense now visible on her face and in the lines
round her cruel mouth.
Yes," she repeated.
"'The day I sail you shall have a further cheque
for eight hundred pounds. You see, therefore, that
for what you do for me you will be paid one thousand
pounds."
"By cheque? How do I know the cheque will
be honoured ?"
"It will be on my private bank, where I now have
a sum to my credit of six thousand pounds."
"Have you ? Then I shall want more out of that
sum. I cannot do what you want for a thousand
pounds."
I will not pay you another farthing."

Mrs. Johnson looked hard at her visitor. She had
been paid heavily before now for work she had done;
but she thought that Kate was desperate, and she knew
she was rich. With all her recklessness and misery.
however, Kate Henley was practical.
"Make your decision quickly," she said  "there
is another woman to whom I can go."
"I will accept your terms," said Mrs. Johnson.
"Two hundred pounds now and eight hundred on
the day you sail for Australia ? Will you write those
terms down on a piece of paper ?"
"No; you must trust me. There must be no
writing between us," answered Kate.
"Very well; I think I can trust you. I could
make it too hot for you if you didn't pay up."
"I believe so."-
"Remember, I am cruel and without mercy to
those who cheat me," said Mrs. Johnson.
"I believe all that.  You would not be the
woman for my present need if you were not cruel,
heartless, and without mercy." 
Mrs. Johnson winced. 
'You say very plain and frank things, Mrs.
Henley."
"This is no moment to mince matters. Now 
I will tell you what I want."
The woman bent forward; and Kate began to
talk in a low tone. In about an hour's time she
left the house, and Mrs. Johnson herself called a
hansom fot her. She drove back to within a few
doors of the "Metropole."  She then dismissed the
cab and walked to the hotel. No one noticed her
as she glided ulstairs, unlocked her bedroom door
and entered. She shut the door, locked it, and un-

dressing, got into bed. During that night Kate did
not sleep. The end was in view, however, and the
thought of that supported her. In one week she
would be safe. She had taken, under the circum-
stances, the best possible steps to ensure her safety,
but the ordeal was not yet over. Should she suc-
ceed, or should she fail ?

ABOUT seven o'clock on the following morning Kate
rose and partly dressed. She opened the door of
her room, crossed the corridor, and tapped at her
husband's door. He did not hear her. She turned 
the handle, found that the door was not locked, and
entered.
Henley started up in bed when he saw her.    A
"My darling Kitty, what is the matter? You 
look worse than ever."
"I have spent a sleepless night, Ralph, and have
much to say. Do dress and come into my room; I 
want to talk to you." 
"Certainly, dearest."
Henley entered Kate's room in about five minutes.
He was fully dressed. Kate herself had returned to
bed. He sat down by her and took one of her hands
in his; he began to stroke the soft fingers.
"My dearest, how thin your hand is getting I"
"'Oh no, Ralph; you are really imagining."
Kate held up her somewhat plump hand and looked
at it, then she burst into one of her old merry laughs.
" Ah I that sounds good," said the young man;
"it cheers me. Kitty, I have lived through a miser-
able forty-eight hours. Ever since Sir John Fenton-
Douglas appeared on the scene I have been too
wretched for words."
"I know why you are wretched," said Kate.

" Because you think that I shall die." She moved
towards the edge of the bed and laid her head on
her husband's shoulder.
" If you die, I shall die," he said-either die or
go mad. You are all my world. I have loved you
for almost the whole of my life, and, Kitty, I cannot
live without you."
"You shall not live without me, Ralph; you
shall live with me, and we'll be happy as the day.
is long. But now I want you to listen, darling."
'" What is it you are going to coax me to do ?"
"Ralph, I do not wish to see that horrid man
doctor. I won't see him."
" What, Martin Hewitt? But how do you know
he is horrid ? He is probably most kind, most sym-
pathetic."
' I do not wish for either his sympathy or his
kindness. I won't see him-I can't see him.
" But, Kitty, Kitty-your promise I Kitty, you
compel me to be harsh with you." A tremor of
real distress had now come into the young man's
voice.
"But oh, darling Ralph, if you would but listen.
I hate all doctors; I don't believe in them. That
man, Sir John Fenton-Douglas, was simply odious.
If I had believed in him I should be dead by now.
But I had the courage-yes, the courage-to pull
myself together, and here I am quite well-or almost
quite well. Oh, you may call me unreasonable if you
life, but I hate all doctors."
"You certainly are unreasonable, Kitty; and,
.w*at is more, you must overcome your unreason-
ableness, for see Martin Hewitt you Shall."

<.-  for it. But do, do listen. I know I am all contra- 
dictions. I am your brave and devoted Kate; but I
am also a mass of nerves-sometimes I think I am
all nerves. My terror of the ghost of Castellis can
testify to that,, and rushing away from Sir John
testifies to it again."
' It certainly does.  You have as many contra-
dictions in your character as if you were the Shrew
in Shakespeare's play."
"' Most people are like that, after all," answered
Kate. "But now, Ralph, we must effect a compro-
mise. You want me to see a doctor ? "
"Certainly; and I also want you to see Martin
Hewitt. His opinion is beyond dispute. If he says
that your lungs are sound, all the Fenton-Douglases
in the world cannot alarm me again on your account."  ?
"Your mind must be relieved, Ralph, that is^
absolutely necessary. ABut still, I hold to my resolve;
I will not see that special doctor. I hate all doctors;
but I don't hate medical women as much as men.
Let me see a lady doctor, and then your heart will
be at rest, and I shall not be quite so much disturbed."
"But I don't believe in lady doctors," said Henley,
a puzzled expression coming into his face.
't Don't you ? Then, my darling boy, you show
your ignorance. There are some splendid women-
who have entered the profession-women with great
brains. Who could say a word against such a woman
as Dr. Garrett Anderson ? "
" Of course; but she is quite an exception," ad-
mitted the young man. 
"Not at all; there are several more, almost, if
not quite, as clever."
Well, well, you shaH see Dr. Garrett Anderson."

' I would gladly see her, but I do not believe she
is in town at present. But there is the great Dr.
Stevenson, who performs most wonderful cures. I
remember hearing last year of three or four society
people whom she brought back from the very brink
of the grave. You must surely have heard of Dr.
Agnes Stevenson?"
"I grieve to say, Kitty, I have not."
'- "Well, you have but to look in the 'Medical
.ir.ctory'; her name is there blazoned in big letters,
'      ald  U sorts of distinctions after it. May I see Dr.
siroaon, Ralph ? You can go to the reading-room,
: look up the 'Medical Directory,' and find out for
yourself that all I say is correct."
"And if I do find that such is the case, will it
make you happy if I yield in this matter, Kate ?"
- Intensely happy. My nervousness will go; I
shall feel certain that a lady doctor will sympathise
with me."
.:.   There seems to be reason in it," said the young
man, looking attentively at his wife.
"Do go down and find out about her, Ralph,
and if she is all that I say, telegraph to her. Ask her
to come and see me here. I will stay in bed; she
can examine my lungs better before I dress. If we
'send her a telegram now at once, and prepay the
answer, we shall know the exact hour when she will
, arrive. Do this for me, won't you, dear Ralph ?"
Henley looked puzzled and undecided.
"I am old-fashioned enough," he said, "to prefer
men doctors to women. But, of course, if this Dr.
Stevenson is really the great doctor you say--"
"L My dear Ralph, you have only' to look in the
f 'Medical Directory,' or to speak to any chemist.

Bring me her exact address, Ralph, and we will send
her a telegram." 
Very unwillingly Henley left the room. He re-
turned in about a quarter of an hour, having got the
address of the great lady doctor. She had certainly
a number of letters after her name, and was fully
qualified.
" Now, then, to fill in the telegraph form," said Kate.
"' What time shall I ask her to arrive ?" queried
Henley.
"She had better make her own appointment,"
replied Kate. "Do be quick, Ralph, for I want to
get out of suspense."
Henley seated himself and filled in the form.
"It would be easier and simpler for me to go
and see her," he said suddenly.
" No, no, stay with me; I cannot bear you out
of my sight this morning.  I feel so nervous and
wretched." 
Henley filled in the telegram and left the room.
Presently he returned to his wife. 
" I have sent it off," he said.  " Now are you
better ?"
"Much, much better. Oh, it is all right, and I
need not worry any more. After she has gone I
shall feel absolutely at rest. It is much better to
have a lady than a man to attend a woman. You
see, Ralph, the patient can confide in her as she will
not in a tnan doctor. Now, Ralph, you have been
good and sweet about it, and I must ask you to do
something else for me."
"What ?"
"Get Mary and Ethel away-see them off to the
train."



<pb n="211"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               211
"My darling Kate, I must say I think you are a
little inhospitable to your cousins. They are both
such dear, jolly girls, and so fond of you--par-
ticularly Ethel."
"You may well say particularly Ethel, for I
believe Mary almost hates me.  But, Ralph, they
must both go; I am dead tired of them. I want
you all to myself. I invited them to visit us much
too soon. Go and manage it, Ralph darling. A
good train leaves Paddington at eleven o'clock. Get
them away; they must not see Dr. Stevenson."
Ralph, in some wonder, went downstairs. It was
now between eight and nine o'clock.  He found
Mary and Ethel waiting for him in the coffee-room.
They were in neat travelling dresses, and Mary's face
had a determined, stubborn look about it. The
moment she saw her cousin she went up to hip.
"We have decided to go home by the eleven
o'clock train," she said. 
i .  sAh I" said Ralph, an expression of relief cross-
!   ing his face,
E   "All :outhings are packed," continued Mary,
: 'and wo'4e not wish to stay here any longer. I will
be frank with you, Ralph. Kate's conduct has hurt
us very much. She has shown a distinct desire to
get rid of us, which, seeing that we are cousins and
old friends, seems scarcely natural."
"Kate is not well," replied Ralph; "you must
not judge her too hardly, Mary. To tell the truth,
.1 am most anxious about her, and have sent for Dr.
i tvenson. I expect her this morning. It may be
be;it under the circumstances, that you two girls
ibla d be out of the way."
[ ' :'tt lwould be much more natural if one of us

stayed and helped to nurse Kate," said Mary, in her
blunt voice; '"but we certainly are not going to
offer, for we are not wanted."
"But is Kate so bad as to require Dr. Steven-
son ?" cried Ethel.
"Yes; I want to get a first-class opinion about
her.  By the way, do you know Dr. Stevenson's
name ?"
"The great lady doctor, Agnes Stevenson ? Why,
certainly-of course we know her," was Ethel's
reply.
" I am glad to hear you say so. The poor child
has taken a dislike to seeing men doctors." 
" I can scarcely blame her for that," replied
Mary. " Now come, Ralph, let us sit down; we are
starving for breakfast."
The girls ate their breakfast, and before it was
finished a page entered the room and put a telegram
into Henley's hands. He tore the little-brown en-
velope open and read the contents-
"From Dr. Stevenson, Harley Street. Will call
to see your wife at two o'clock to-day."
"Then there is no hurry about our train," cried
Ethel.
"Oh yes, Ethel; we'll go by the train we ar-
ranged to take," said Mary.
Soon afterwards the girls went upstairs and
entered Kate's room.  She bade them  good-bye
almost atfectionately.  As Mary was stooping down
to kiss her she looked full into her eyes, and the
words almost rose to her lips, " You are the greatest
sham I ever met in my life," but she did not say them.
A moment or two later, in Ralph's company, they 
left the house. They had scarcely done so before 



<pb n="213"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               213
Kate sprang out of bed and ran to one of the win-
dows. The windows of her bedroom looked on
to the front. She threw this one open now and
craned her neck out. She saw the two girls and
Henley get into a cab and drive away. She then
immediately shut the window and began to dress as
fast as ever she could. It was wonderful with what
expedition she got into her clothes. In less than a
quarter of an hour she was fully dressed and had
gone downstairs. She wore a long travelling cloak
over her dress, and a thick veil concealed her face.
She went out, and in a few moments had reached
the nearest telegraph office. Here she filled in two
forms. One ran as follows:
"To Dr. Agnes Stevenson, 204 Harley Street.
Sorry to have to ask you to postpone your visit.
Wife and I called out of town in a hurry. Expect
to hear from me later.-RALPH HENLEY."
The second telegram was to Mrs. Johnson, 40
Mortimer Street.  " Be at Metropole as arranged
sharp at 2 o'clock.-K. H."
The two little messages were sent speeding on
their way, and Kate returned to the hotel. She got
back to her room, took off her things, and returned to
bed. When Ralph came back about twelve o'clock
he found her lying down with flushed cheeks. She
now complained of slight headache. It rather suited
her rOle to appear ill. She asked Ralph if he did not
think her feverish. His anxiety about her was all too
manifest; he could scarcely take his eyes from her
lice, and was looking out for every imaginable bad
Smptom.
i', Kate, although she was terribly hungry, refused

"I cannot eat," she said; "it is all this suspense
and excitement. How can I tell what awful news
that dreadful Dr. Stevenson may have to say to me ?
I shall not know rest until I am told the worst."
"Or the best," answered her husband. "Don't
despair, Kitty.  No doctor, to look at you, could
consider you very ill."
As Henley spoke he gave his wife a long, attentive
glance. Those rounded cheeks, flushed as they now
were, showed no apparent trace of consumption, and
as he gazed at them attentively, he owned to himself
with intense relief that the bright eyes looked more
anxious than ill.
At the appointed hour Dr. Stevenson, in a neat
claret-coloured brougham, arrived.  Her card was
taken up to Kate's bedroom-" Dr. Agnes Stevenson,
204 Harley Street."
"I will go down and see the lady," said Henley.
He ran downstairs. ' A quiet-looking woman, neatly
dressed, was waiting for him in one of the reception
rooms. Bright dark eyes looked full into his, and a
small hand, but hard as iron, lay for an instant in his
clasp. He felt a sudden degree of confidence, and
asked the lady doctor to seat herself.
I am glad to have a talk with you before I 
examine your wife," said the supposed Dr Stevenson.. 
"Please tell me as briefly as you can what is wrong
with her. Give me any particulars you like with
regard to'her age and general health."
Ralph told his story. Until quite lately he had
always believed that his wife enjoyed robust. health.
He had been dreadfully puzzled and shocked at Sir
John Fenton-Douglas'. report. As Ralph said these
latter words he looked full into the small dark face of

the lady doctor, as much as to say that he expected
her to share his astonishment. But Dr. Stevenson's
face was to all appearance an absolute blank.
"Take me to the patient," she said, rising.
Henley accompanied her upstairs.
"I should like to see the doctor alone, Ralph," said
Kate.
.Henley withdrew at once into his own bedroom
at the opposite side of the corridor. What he endured
aring the next quarter of an hour he was not likely
S 1-oon to forget. His passion for his wife was growing
stronger week by week. The mere thought of losing
her was agony to him.
- "She shall live l I defy death to take her from
me I" was his inward cry. Just then he heard a step
on the landing, and left his room to come face to face
with Dr. Stevenson. There was a sparkle in the eyes
of the doctor, and her lips were smiling.
"Come,'" she said, looking at the young man;
:  it is not so bad as you fear. But I must speak to
you alone."
, Henley conducted her to a private room down-
stai. There Dr. Stevenson gave a careful report of
Kate's symptoms.
"The lungs undoubtedly bear traces of serious
mischief in the past," she began, " but at present the
old trouble has healed over, and the disease has
been arrested. The proper thing now to do is to
give it no chance of revival."
"My God I then it is true," said Henley. " Kate
consumptive I I did not know it when I married
her."
"I am sorry for you," said Dr. Stevenson. " But,
with care, you may keep Mrs. Henley alive for many

years. I should recommend her to go to a warm
climate without delay."
"Why not to Davos in Switzerland ?"
"No, your wife's is not a case for Davos; I should
recommend Australia."
"That is her own wish."
" It is the climate of all others to suit her. Believe
me, that at present she is not in the slightest danger.
With care she may live to be an old woman."
After this Henley and Dr. Stevenson had a long
conversation. Finally, he asked her if she would
prescribe a tonic for his wife ?
"Quite unnecessary," was her answer.   Mrs
Henley does not require medicines; she needs rest
of mind, which, I think, she will have when she leaves
England."
"' But why should her mind be anxious ?"
"Her health, my dear sir. A woman who was
so close to death in the spring of this year cannot
immediately forget what she suffered. I have assured
her that if she goes to Australia before the cold weather
sets in she is safe."
"What is your fee, Dr. Stevenson? and will you
see my wife again ?"
"My fee is ten guineas. She need not see me
again."
Henley paid the fee, and the supposed great
doctor got into her claret-coloured brougham and
drove away.
Henley did not know whether to be relieved or
not. The undefined sense of uneasiness which had
worried him with regard to Kate's health, was, it is 
true, not altogether removed.  But, after all, the 
clever lady doctor had assured him that if he took

his wife to Australia she would be safe. He bounded
upstairs, eager to get to Kate in order to make the
best of Dr. Stevenson's verdict. He had scarcely
reached the first landing, however, before he saw her
flying down to meet him, her eyes sparkling, her
cheeks radiant, her lips wreathed in smiles.
"The doctor has come and gone-the ordeal is
over," she cried. "Come out, Ralph. I am sick
of the house. I want some fun."
"My darling Kate, how well you look I"
"Of course, I am well. She has relieved my
mind, and I have got over the horrid nuisance of
seeing her. Come out, Ralph; we must buy dresses,
jackets, bonnets, hats, and for all the rest of the day
we must have fun, fun-pleasure, pleasure I Ralph,
my darling, there is no one looking-just give me
one little kiss and be quick. Oh, I am so happy-

CHAPTER' XXII
WHEN Ethel and Mary arrived at the Grange they
found that it wore an unpleasantly deserted appear-
ance. It is true that most of the servants were there, 
but the windows were curtainless and in several of
the rooms and on the stairs the carpets were up. The
old butler received the girls with dismay.
"You didn't even send us a telegram, miss," he
said, addressing Mary.
"We had no time," answered Mary; " our return
was unexpected. But it does not matter at all about
the state of the rooms. We can have something to
eat in the library, I suppose ? "
"Certainly, Miss Mary; and I'll speak to Ann
about your rooms at once, young ladies.", 
"Please do," said Mary, turning in the direction  l
of the morning-room. Ethel, looking dreadfully dis- , .
contented, followed her.
"Dear, dear," said Ethel, "it is horrid coming
back like this. I must say Kate has not behaved very
kindly to us. I don't understand her. If she is so
ill as Ralph seemed to think, she ought to have kept
us both to nurse her."
"For my part, I should have disliked very much 
being Kate's nurse," answered Mary; "and as to the
trivial discomfort here for a few hours, what does it
matter?" 
"But it is so lonely in this big house without
father and mother," continued Ethel.

"We shall not ibe here long, and while we are
here we shall have no time to think whether we are
lonely or not," was Mary's reply.
"Now, Molly, whaf do you mean ?"
"I am going to st hmeyiQu a little bit, Ethel; but
I intend to take thie inptive at last in a certain
matter which has long-perplexed me. My mind is

"Oh, good gracious, Mary, how mysterious you

" To return to Cornwall to-morrow."
"To Cornwall?"
"Yes. You need not stare at me as if you had
lost your senses. You can stay here by yourself, or
come with me, just as you please."
"Mary, I don't understand you."
"Very likely not; but in any case I go to Cornwall
to-morrow. I will tell you why, if you care to listen."
"Please do," exclaimed Ethel.
" I daresay I have puzzled you a good bit lately"
answered Mary, staring straight at her sister as she
spoke, "but, if so, you must be satisfied with the fact that
I puzzled myself still more. But now I am puzzled no
longer. I mean to go straight ahead. Each obstacle
as it arises I shall overcome. There is a mystery, and
I must reach the bottom of it. In the bottom of the
well lies truth. I am going to explore to the very
bottom of this particular well, and will bring truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth to the surface."
.  "Now, I think you must be quite mad," said
{ i  toel, "for I suppose you are alluding to those queer,
i!? i.er thoughts of yours about poor Kitty."

"Do you mean to return to Falmouth ?"
"No; I am going to the neighbourhood of the
Pines."
"The Pines    Kitty's old home?  Where Sir
John Fenton-Douglas lives?"
"Precisely. I mean to see Sir John Fenton-
Douglas and to have a long talk with him."
" Mary I again I say that I think you mad."
"Think what you like-do you mean to come
with me ?"
"I must; it would be scarcely safe for you to go
alone. But how strange Sir John will think your
conduct 1"
"He may think what he pleases. There are a
few questions I mean to ask him; answer those qtues-
tions he must."
"Won't you tell me what the questions-are ? "
" Not until I have got the answers which I expect
to get. Ethel, how would you like to be  "
"What ?"
"Rich-very rich."
"I don't know," said Ethel. "I am never going to
be rich, so where is the use of bothering about it "
-" If Kate were dead you would be rich. We are
our uncle's next heiresses."
"But Kate is alive," answered Ethel. "Mary, I 
hate that sort of expression which your face so often
wears lately. My darling, sweet Iitty is in the
world, and long, long may she remain there. I would
rather be poor and have Kitty, than rich without her."
"I don't at all know that I should," answered
Mary.
She stole out into the garden, leaving Ethel much
puzzled and feeling thoroughly miserable.



<pb n="221"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               221
" How horrid everything is just nowl" thought the
girl. "I wonder if Mary is really quite right in her
head-that queer craze has been coming over her for
some time now. What does she suspect poor dear
Kitty of ? What is the truth which she is going to
dig out of the well ? Really, Mary's manner is most
alarming. Is her brain really going ? If so, I must
be very patient with her."
Meanwhile Mary was walking rapidly up and
down at the end of the garden. The small suspicion
which had entered her head some months ago had
now grown large-so large, that turn where she
would she could think of nothing else.
Why did Kate leave Castellis? Why did she
refuse to see Sir John Fenton-Douglas ?
"The answer is plain," she thought. "Sir John
was Kate's doctor at Mentone; she confessed that
fact herself. He knows a secret about Kate, and Kate
is afraid, terribly afraid, that he will tell that secret
to us. Well, it will not be my fault if he does not
confide it to me."
The luncheon bell rang, and Mary returned to
the house.
"Where are we going to stay when we get to
-Cornwall-?" asked Ethel.
"The village of Castellis has an inn," answered
Mary; .' we will sleep there for one night. Our stay
will be quite short-one interview with Sir John
Fenton-Douglas will in all probability be sufficient."
Ethel was silent. If Mary's mind was going she
ought not to contradict her.
Early the next morning the girls started for Corn-
wall. When they arrived at the railway station Mary
wrote..a telegram-it was to Sir John Fenton-Douglas.



<pb n="222"/>
22-          AN ADVENTURESS 
Ethel did not know what she had put into the telegram.
It was despatched, and the journey began. They ar-
rived at their destination late in the evening. Here
a fly was waiting for them, and they drove straight to
the little village inn known as the "Beehive." The
landlady came out to receive them with smiles and
welcome.
"Welcome, young ladies, welcome," she said. "I
have got the front bedroom ready for you both. I am
glad you sent me that telegram last night, Miss Mary,
for I have got everything as snug'as possible. A nice
little dinner ready, too-a youig tender duck, and
bottled peas as green and fresh as if they had just come
out of the garden, for I bottled them my own self."
"Has any message come for me?" asked Mary,
in an eager voice."
"Yes, miss, there's a letter; a messenger brought
it from the Pines not an hour ago'.
"Give it to me, please."
Mary tore open the thick envelope. A brief note
lay within.
"e DEAR MISS HUME,-I will call to see you this
evening at nine o'clock.-Yours faithfully- 
"JOHN FENTON-DOUG4S.:'
" Dinner-quick, please," said Mary, her .eyes
sparkling; "and, by the way, Mrs. Grace, can we
have a private sitting-room."
" Certainly, Miss Mary; 'tain't likely you would
want your dinner in the bar. There's a cosy little
parlour at your service. Come this way and I'll
show it to you."

her guests was bright with flowers; and the next
moment a small rosy-cheeked handmaid appeared, to
lay the cloth for dinner.
" Ethel," said/Mary to her sister the moment they
were alone, "If must see Sir John Fenton-Douglas by
myself to-night."
" As you please, Mary."
Mary went up to her sister and kissed her.
"I see you are dissatisfied with this place," she
said; "but never mind, our visit will be very brief;
we can leave to-morrow morning."
" I cannot make you out," answered Ethel.
Sir John called sharp to the moment. Ethel had
left the room, and Mary was standing by the fire,
looking very pale when he entered.
"It is good of you to come to see me," she said.
"Won't you sit down ?"
"Can I serve you in any way, Miss Hume?"
answered Sir John. He sank into the chair which
Mary had provided. She looked at him for a moment
without speaking, then she said slowly-
"I will come to the point. I asked you to call
in order to make some inquiries from you."
Sir John raised his eyes now and looked her full
in the face.
"Are you Mr. Hume's daughter ? "
" His eldest daughter."
"Does your father know of this visit ?"
"He does not. I have come on my own account."
. Sir John stared again at the young lady; then he
iid gravely-
" Your questions ?"
: "They have to do with Mrs. Henley."
' . '8i? John pulled himself together, and Mary noticed



<pb n="224"/>
224          AN ADVENTURESS 
with pleasure the alert look which came into his
eyes.
"Ah I" he said.
"You are surprised, Sir John, at my cousin, Mrs.
Henley, not seeing you the other day ? "
Sir John did not answer. He said, after a mo-
ment's reflection-
" She has returned to London."
"Yes."  Mary suddenly seated herself in a chair
close to Sir John, and brought her face to within a
few inches of his.
" I am intensely curious about Mrs. Henley," she
said.
"Your cousin ?" answered the baronet.
"She 'calls herself my cousin, and I have every
hope that such is the case."
" But can you have a doubt ?"
"I have many doubts. I am much disturbed
about her. It has occurred to me that you, Sir John,
can set my mind at rest."
Sir John did not speak.
Red spots had now appeared on Mary's cheeks;
there was a cruel eagerness on her face.
"I want you," she continued, speaking very
slowly, "to give me full, full particulars with regard
to my cousin's illness last spring at Mentone."
"Why ?"
" Because I will know."  Mary stood up now, her
breath coming hard and fast. "I will know," she re-
peated, "and I will tell you why. I am firmly con-
vinced that she is acting a part. In what condition
was-she when you attended her at Mentone ?"
"There is no reason why I should not tell you.
Your cousin was very ill."



<pb n="225"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               225
" Seriously ill?.:"
"Yes."
"What was the nature of her complaint ?"
f I thought her to be suffering from consumption."
"Then, of course, her lungs were diseased ?"
"Extensively}'
"I wish you could see her now," continued
Mary. "To all appearance she has no trace of
consumption; she looks strong-very strong. You
know the delicate colour which most consumptives
have ?"
" Your cousin had that colour," said the baronet.
In spite of himself he was much interested.
" If she had,she lost it before she came to England,"
said Mary. "She looks what she is-a strong and
beautiful woman. But now I have one more question
to ask. Why does she dislike meeting you ? "
" Her husband explained that," answered Fenton-
Douglas slowly. "He said she showed a very marked
nervousness at the slightest allusion to that time of
dangerous illness. I think I can understand her feel-
ings. My presence would, of course, have revived
old associations."
"For instance, the death of her companion?"
said Mary.  "She seemed much attached to her
companion."
"A fine girl," said Sir John-" a very fine girl."
"What was her name ?"
"Miss Mildmay."
"Ahd the two were remarkably alike in appear-
.nce ? " said Mary, in a musing tone.
"Yes; now that you speak of it, the likeness
between them was extraordinary. But why all these
utions., Miss Hume ?"

226          AN ADVENTURESS 
I have one or two more to ask, then I will tell
you. Did you see Miss Mildmay die ?"
"Certainly not; when I last saw the poor girl
she was, to all appearance, in robust health."
"Like this, for instance," said Mary. She had
taken a photograph out of her pocket, and now thrust
it into Sir John's hand. He stared at it.
"Yes," he said, "that is the girl; that is exactly
how she looked, poor thing, when I last spoke to her."
"That happens to be a photograph of my cousin,
Mrs. Henley," said Mary.
"Imposs-" began the baronet; then he
stopped-the words were arrested on his lips. He
looked at Mary in an almost frightened way.
"I cannot understand this," he said; "I could
have sworn that that was the portrait of Miss Mildmay."
"The two girls were remarkably alike," answered
Mary; "I have been often told of the strange likeness
betweenthem. Andyet,when you last saw Mrs. Henley,
she was, in your opinion, far gone in consumption ?"
"Such was my opinion."
"How long did you give her to live ?"
"She might have died at any time. When I last
saw her I did not think she would survive a week.
Sudden business called me to England, and I did not
see her again. I left the case in the hands of my
colleague-a Dr. Gardner; but Miss Bouverie even
then had a strange dislike to seeing medical men,
and earnestly requested that he would not call unless
specially sent for. I have learnt since that he was
never sent for. He has since died-otherwise he
might throw light on what puzzles you."
"And yet," continued Mary, " Miss Mildmay died
a week later, and Kate Bouverie got quite well. This



<pb n="227"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               227
picture you have just looked at is supposed to be one
of Kate Bouverie; when you saw it you thought it
was Kate Mildmay. Sir John, I think I can guess why
my cousin, Kate Henley, refuses to see you."
" If so, except for the natural reason which I have
stated, you know more than I do, Miss Hume."
" I will tell you why she won't see you. She does
not wish you to sound her lungs because they are
perfectly strong and healthy, because there has never
been anything the matter with them."
"Here you make a mistake," answered Sir John.
"What do you mean ?"
"I will read you part of a letter which I received
from Henley this morning."
Sir John took a letter from his pocket, opened it,
and read the following lines:-
"My dear wife, at my express desire, at first con-
sented to see Dr. Martin Hewitt, who, as you know,
makes consumption his speciality. I meant to take
her to him this morning, but found that her nervous
dread of consulting a male doctor was almost bring-
ing on an illness. At last, to compromise matters, 
she allowed me to call in the very well-known lady
doctor, Dr. Agnes Stevenson of Harley Street. Dr.
Stevenson has just left, and her opinion in all particulars
coincides with yours. Both lungs are now healed
over, but the left lung in particular was gravely affected
last year, and traces of the past mischief are abund-
antly evident. My wife and I go to Australia imme-
'diately, in compliance with Dr. Stevenson's orders."
·..ou see," said Sir John, as he folded up the
'let;4.that Mrs. Henley really was very ill last year.



<pb n="228"/>
228          AN ADVENTURESS
I will own, Miss Hume, that your questions have
puzzled me. I cannot imagine why you should 
have ever doubted my opinion with regard    o
Mrs. Henley's case."
"I never for a moment doubted your opinion,
Sir John."
"This letter is conclusive," said Sir John, rising
and putting it into his pocket. "Why, what is the
matter ? Have you any other questions to ask ?"
' No more questions of you at present," answered
Mary, " but I have one remark to make."
"What is that ?"
"Kate Henley is the cleverest woman that ever
lived."
"What do you mean?"
"This. I don't believe that testimony. I am
going to see Dr. Agnes Stevenson myself."

CHAPTER XXIII
MARY did not enlighten Ethel with regard to her
interview  with Sir John Fenton-Douglas.  Poor
Ethel was devoured with curiosity, but she had to
keep her feelings to herself. Mary was glum and
severe; there was a malicious look in her eye, and
also a certain gleam of satisfaction. Ethel considered
her sister not only dull, but disagreeable.
" Whatever she has at the back of her head,"
thought the girl, "she certainly is nothing like as
nice as she was before poor dear Kate came back
from Mentone. It is all very queer, and why she
won't leave the poor dear girl alone puzzles me more
than I care to say."
It was a relief, however, to Ethel to hear her
sister remark casually that they were to return to
London and to the Grange on the following day.
" I am glad to hear it," said Ethel, " for I cannot
say that I care to be in Cornwall so late in the year."
"My business being concluded, I am going back
to town," said Mary.
"Oh   is it concluded, really, Mary? Then I
suppose you will be your old self again. You will
return to the sort of life we led before Kate came
back."
" My business is concluded in Cornwall, but that
does not say that it is concluded in London," said
"Mary; "on the contrary, I may say it has only begun."



<pb n="230"/>
230          AN ADVENTURESS
Ethel made no further remark.   She sighed
heavily.
The next morning at an early hour the girls left
the little inn and took the next train back to towp.
They arrived in town in the evening, and there, to
Ethel's amazement, Mary still proceeded to act in a
very eccentric way. During the journey up Mary
had absorbed herself in a book, although Ethel
strongly suspected that she was not reading it.
When they got to town Ethel took out her watch.
" If we are quick, Mary," she said, "and secure a
cab in a hurry, we can just catch the train at Victoria,
and shall reach the Grange about ten o'clock to-
night."
"But I am not going into the country to-night,"
said Mary. 
" Oh dear me, what next ?" said Ethel, gazing at
her sister with round eyes.
"I mean to stay at a hotel in town."
We two by ourselves at a hotel I Then I sup-
pose we had better go to the M6tropole. How
surprised Kate and Ralph will be to see us-oh, dd
let us go to the Metropole, Mary."
" I think not," said Mary. " It certainly would be
a temptation," she said, speaking slowly, "to see
Kate and just mention casually that I have been
having an interview with Sir John Fenton-Douglas,
but on second thoughts it may be best not to warn
her. She is too clever, and might try to circumvent
us. No; we will go to the Grosvenor Hotel."
"Would father like us to stay alone at one of
these big hotels ?" queried Ethel.
" Oh, nonsense, Ethel, I am not a baby. As long
as you are with me you need not be frightened.



<pb n="231"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               23I
Come, w  will take this hansom and desire the man
to drive us to the Grosvenor Hotel."
Ethel had nothing more to say, but she felt more
and more uncomfortable. What did Mary really
mean? What was at the back of her head? She      ail
had a queer sensation that there was trouble ahead,
but could make nothing of Mary's attitude.
The girls arrived at the hotel, whlre Mary acted
in a very prompt and business-like way. She secured
a comfortable- room for herself and sister, ordered
dinner to be sent to them in a private sitting-room,
and was not seen downstairs again that night.
"You can trust yourself to me most comfortably,"
she said to her sister. "I would not do anything
fast or strong-minded for the world."
Ethel had now ceased to make any remonstrance.
" I suppose," she said once, in a rather timorous
voice, " you will allow us to return to our own home
to-morrow ?"
" It will all depend on what to-morrow brings
forth," answered Mary. She opened her book again
and once more hid herself behind its pages.
"Really, she is unbearable," thought Ethel.
"Why should I be ordered about by her ? and it
is so dull to stay here doing nothing while she thinks
her thoughts behind that book. I will just watch
her and see how often she turns a page."
Mary's eyes were glued to the pages of her
yellow-backed novel.
" She never turns one at all," thought the other
girl. " She is just thinking, thinking, and she really
becomes most disagreeable. I shall be glad when it
is time to go to fed. I wonder if I might slip away 
and get into a hansom and drive off to the Metropole



<pb n="232"/>
232          AN ADVENTURESS
and see my dear darling Kitty-really anybody is a
better companion than my own sister in these days;
and what is she driving at ? I do wonder if her brain
is going; nothing else can account for her remark-
able conduct."
Mary jumped up hastily.
" I am tired and shall go to bed," she said; "you
can follow me when you like."
She left the room, and Ethel was left alone.
"Worse and worse," thought the girl. " Bad as
she was, she was some one to look at, and it is not
ten o'clock yet. I cannot go to bed before ten, I am
not a baby. Really, Mary is very queer."
Ethel passed the rest of the evening as best she
could. At last, perforce, she was obliged to retire
to rest.
At an early hour in the morning Mary was up
and stirring.
"I am going out for a little," she said to her
sister.
"Well, I suppose I may come with you, Mary ?"
"I think not; I should prefer to go alone."
It suddenly occurred to Ethel that nothing now
should prevent her going to the Metropole to talk to
Kate and Ralph.
"I must see them," she said to herself, "and I
won't submit to Mary's dictatorial ways another hour."
Accordingly, she pretended to be quite satisfied to
stay behind at the hotel, and Mary, dressed in her
quietest and most severe style, went downstairs.
The hall-porter called a hansom for her, and she
gave the address of Dr. Agnes Stevenson in Harley
Street.
"I have plenty of money in my purse, I will pose



<pb n="233"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               233
as a patient, burst into her presence and learn the
ruth," thought the excited girl.
She arrived at the house. This was the hour
when the great doctor was seeing patients. Mary
gave her name, and asked if Dr. Stevenson were in.
The footman who opened the door replied in the
affirmative. He then asked the young lady if she
iad an appointment.
"No, I have not; but my business if urgent. I
want to see Dr. Stevenson this morning. Is it pos-
sible for her to see me ? I shall not keep her very
long."
I will go and inquire," said the man. He con-
lucted Mary into a large waiting-room, which was
already half-full of ladies and children who
were waiting anxiously for the moment when the
loctor could receive them. Mary took her place
near the door, feeling somewhat forlorn; her whole
heart was hot and impatient, she did not want to
wait long. If she slipped a sovereign into the foot-
man's hand would there be any chance of his ad-
mitting her first into his mistress's presence? She
accordingly went into the hall. The servant, how-
ever, seemed to guess what she was going to say,
.or he put his hands impulsively behind him.
" Dr. Stevenson will see you if you like to wait
after the other patients have gone," he said, "but she
would rather you made an appointment. Can you
come to-morrow morning instead?"
"No, I'think not; I will wait now."
"You will have to wait for a couple of hours at
least."
"Oh, it does net matter, I will wait. Please tell
the doctor that I am waiting."



<pb n="234"/>
234          AN ADVENTURESS
"Yes, miss," replied the man.
Mary went back to the waiting-room. One by
one the patients were shown into the doctor's presence.
Mary seldom passed through a longer two hours, the
minutes seemed to drag. She wondered what Ethel 
was doing in her absence.-
"Poor Ethel I but she will thank me some day,"
thought the girl, "some day when wrong is made
right. Oh, I am sure, I am certain, I shall soon dis-
cover the great fraud which is being played upon us.
I have no longer the least doubt on the subject."
At last the time of waiting was over, and Mary
Hume was admitted into Dr. Stevenson's presence.
Dr. Stevenson was a very bright-eyed little woman,
not so very unlike the other bright-eyed little wonan  '
who, posing in her name, had seen Kate at the M6tro- 
pole a couple of days ago.
Mary entered, and Dr. Stevenson motioned her to'd -
a seat.
"What can I do for you ?" sle said. "What are
your symptoms?"
"Oh, I am not ill at all," said Mary in a slightly
defiant voice.
"Not ill at alll--then why have you come to
me?"
"I have come to speak to you about one of your
patients."
"Indeed, but that is rather unusual.  Is the
patient, may I ask, a relation of yours ?"
"By way of cousin," said Mary in a blunt voice.
"And by what authority do you come to ask me
questions about her ?"
"Simply because I want to know. You said that
her lungs were very much affected, whereas I am



<pb n="235"/>
,/  '      AN ADVENTURESS               235
persuaded thatIher lungs are absolutely healthy. I
want you to tell me the truth."
" Do you-mind telling me the name of the patient
about whom you have come to make inquiries ? " said
Dr. Stevenson in a very icy voice.
"Yes, of course, Mrs. Henley-Kate Henley. She
was staying at the Metropole-you saw her a couple
of days ago." 
Dr. Stevenson did not speak for a moment. She
got up then, crossed the room, and, opened a large
book. She looked quietly in the book for a moment
and then returned to her seat.
" And you want me to tell you about this patient ?"
she said then in a grave voice.
" Oh yes, if you only would."
I am sorry, but I must refuse." ,
" Refuse ? Why ?"
"Because it is against my rules ever, except to
the father or mother or husband of a patient, to dis-
close anything whatever about her condition."
"Is that rule absolute ? This is a most important
case r in fact, I suspect fraud," said Mary, who for
the moment, with the keen eyes of the lady doctor
fixed on her face, forgot her customary prudence.'
"I am   sorry for you, Miss Hume," said Dr.
Stevenson, rising; " but if that is all you have got to
say to me it is a pity you waited so long this morning."
"And you absolutely refuse-absolutely ?"
?  "I am sorry-it is against my rules-I cannot
oblige you."
"! Thank you."
Mary fumbled in her purse for a fee.
"No fee," said- Dr. Stevenson. " I have done
nothing. Good-morning, Miss Hume." 



<pb n="236"/>
236          AN ADVENTURESS
Mary left the house. Lunch was waiting for Dr.
Stevenson, and she was tired and hungry and had
earned it well, but nevertheless she did not go into 
her dining-room until quite ten minutes after Mary
had left her. She was standing once more beside the
large case-book which she had opened. There was
a brief entry under the name of Kate Henley, an entry
to the effect that the patient and her husband had
left town unexpectedly and could not see her for the
present.
"What does this mean?" she said to herself.
"What can this mean?   That girl who called just
now, and whose unpleasant face I by no means took
to, said that I had seen the patient and had reported
that her lungs were very much affected; but I never
saw that patient; she had left town. Miss Hume does
not know of this, and she says she suspects fraud.
What does it mean ?"
There were few keener, shrewder women in
London than the celebrated lady doctor. She thought
for a minute or two, then, taking up her Swan foun-
tain-pen, made a few remarks on the margin of her
case-book. These remarks were made in cipher, and

CHAPTER XXIV
MEANWHILE Ethel, with the daring and courage of
which she-had never believed herself capable, had
ordered a hansom and had driven straight to the
Metropole. She found Kate in her bedroom.
"My dear Ethel, how glad I am to see you," said
Mrs. Henley.
Kate was looking quite blooming; she had cast
off the last vestige of care, her daring idea had suc-
ceeded, she was soon going to leave England and these 
cares, these dangers, these terrors, behind her for ever.
Already she and her husband had taken their passage
on one of the largest Orient liners. They were to
sail for Australia in a week's time.
"it's very nice to see you again, Ethel," said
Kate; " but where is Mary ? "
"Oh, goodness knows.   Don't ask me where
Mary is," said Ethel. " It is perfectly distracting; I
cannot imagine what is the matter with her; she grows
queerer every day. What do you think we did the day
after we left you ? Where do you think we went ?"
"How can I tell ?"
"Well, my dear Kitty, if I am worn out with 
Gravel and anxiety don't be astonished-we wen
down to Cornwall."
"To Cornwall ? What for ?" said Kate. A littl
of the old anxiety visited her clear eyes, but she
quickly veiled them. She was learning better day by
day to suppress all undue emotion.

"To Cornwall!" she repeated. She turned and
began to fold up different ribbons which she was
putting into a hat-box.
"Do - look at this unique, delicious travelling
case for hats and bonnets," she said. "See all
these little pegs--everything in such complete
order.  I can take eight hats in this trunk, and
they will be as fresh and as little likely to get
injured, as if they were reposing in my wardrobe at
home. Oh dear, oh dear, how tired I am I But
what took you to Cornwall? You were just telling
me."
"If you want to know who took me to Cornwall
-Mary took me," replied Ethel. "'I always go
where Mary goes; I have done so all my life. She ,.
wanted me to accompany her, so I went. We went 
down the day before yesterday, and who do you
think we saw in the evening? We went to your
place, you know."
"To my place-to Castellis ? " said Kate.
She was getting intensely, fearfully interested,
but she did not dare to show it.
"t Yes, to Castellis. Not to the house, of course,
but to the village. We put up at the inn, and in the
evening we had a visitor."
"Who ? "
"Oh, can't you guess ? We don't know many
people round there. Sir John Fenton-Douglas."
. ;.  "Oh, do be careful, Ethel; you are spoiling that
.q:;  Marabout feather."
."     Kate sprang towards her cousin' and, almost
roughly, took the small pink Marabout feather which
Ethel was playing with from her hand.
"There, do forgive me. I was cross," she said.

|               AN ADVENTURESS               239
"You certainly were; you jumped on me almost
as if you meant to give me a blow. And I really was
not injuring the feather."
"I am so sorry, darling. Sit down here and let
us talk. How very funny of Mary to go to Corn-
wall l-but what did she say to Sir John Feiton-
Douglas?"
"Ah, I wish I could tell you thi, Kate, but I
.  canmot. , They had a long interview, a very long in-
: :tniew -, but when she came up to bed afterwards she
i tLd    not tell me a word of what they had said."
W Then- you were not present ?   Oh, Ethel, I
wish you would not fidget I"
' Fidget ? I am sitting as still as a mouse. You
seem to have got Mary's nerves. I was not present
because Mary wished to see him alone. Oh, it was
a great mystery, and she was frightfully excited. I
cannot think what has come to her: she seems to
have a sort of suspicion about you, Kate -why,
Kitty darling, how white you are I"
. "It is because I am  not strong," said Kate.
",What in the world can Mary suspect me of ? But
-I have noticed it, Ethel; I don't mind confiding in
you." 
"I should think you could scarcely help noticing
. it. She has been suspecting you ever since you came
home, and it breaks my heart, Kitty-that it does."
Here the impulsive Ethel sprang towards her cousin,
tflung her arms round her neck, and burst into tears.
"Oh--I love you so-- love you so 1" whispered
&thel. " Its horrid of her-it is-it is l"
"Never mind," answered Kate, "she cannot do
me any harm; only I should like to know what she
.eally thinks."

"Oh, who cares what she thinks ?" said Ethel. 
"But it is a sign of insanity, isn't it, when one begins
to suspect people ? "
"A very grave sign," said Kate.
"Well, I am awfully nervous about Mary. Did
you ever hear, Kate, that any of our family were-I
scarcely like to ask it, but did you ever hear that any \
of our family were insane ? * 
"Oh, don't question me," said Kate. She turned 
away and began once more to fiddle with her ribbons
and feathers.
"But why don't you speak ? You know all about  ! 
our family, of course." 
"I was only thinking of a story my father once 
told me; it was about an aunt of both of ours."
"Oh, tell me-do tell me I"
f "She went queer, very much as Mary is going
queer. She began to suspect all kinds of people.
They locked her up for a time, then she got better. 
That is the only case I have heard of, and her name
was Julia-Aunt Julia."
" Aunt Julia-why, of course, we have her picture
at home."
"Poor thing, she made a very low marriage-
married beneath her." 
"We have the picture up in the attic," continued
Ethel. "It is not thought anything of.  She was
very pretty, sweetly pretty."
"Yes, that was her. Sje married beneath her, 
and then she got queer. She began to suspect her  ',
husband of all sorts of things, and he was a very
good man and very faithful to her; and they locked
her up, and she came out again, but she did not live
very long-she died of consumption. We are not a

considered carefully for a moment. After all, it would
be an excellent plan if she took Ethel with her and
left Marryat behind. larryat knew too much. She

"We will think of it," she said; "I will speak to
Ralph when he comes in. But if you come, Ethel,
you have very little time to prepare, for we are sail-
ing this day week."
"Oh yes," thought Kate to herself, " we must on
no account postpone our departure-Mary is getting
quite terrible. I must foster that idea of Ethel's that
Mary is going off her head. It is an excellent thought
which Ethel has put into my brain."
Ethel presently left her cousin. She did so before
Ralph appeared on the scene.  She drove straight
back to the Grosvenor Hotel. Mary had just returned
from her non-successful interview with Dr. Agnes
Stevenson. Mary was feeling not only cross but.
snubbed; she was just in the humour to snub others,
and Ethel had the reverse of a gay time at lunch.
Ethel mentioned casually that she had taken the bull
by the horns and had gone off on her own account
to visit Kate.
'" And Kate is going to Australia this day week,"
said Ethel.
"Oh no, she is not," replied Mary. She raised her
eyes and fixed them on her sister's face.
"She is not ? " said Ethel in absolute terror. She
was now certain that Mary was insane. "Why do
you say that ? She has taken her passage-she and
Ralph are both going. Dr. Agnes Stevenson saw4Reri 
and says that dear Kate is veryfar from strong,her lungs
bea traces of serious disease in the past, and she must
get away to a more equable climate immediately." 
"Oh, I know all that," said Mary; "but all the
same she is not going-not if I can prevent her."
"I don't understand you, Maryt But there, take

"Have you not? But you ate not remarkable,
my dear Ethel, for your powers of observation. 'Now
then, I'll desire the waiter to bring' our bill; we will
settle up and go home by the next train."
This was done, and on the evening of that day
Ethel found herself pacing up and down the shrubbery.
by her father's side.
Mr. Hume was in excellent spirits. He was glad
to be back again. The house was in perfect order;
his wife had benefited by her change;' his own busi- ,
ness prospects were excellent; he enjoyed the thought
of being back again in town day after day, very busy
at work. He was delighted to have his girls-with him,
and now pinched Ethel's ear playfully.
"Well, little lass," he said, " what is the matter ?
You look as if you meant'to ask me something."
"And I do mean to ask you for a great, a very
great fafouf, father."

"But will you grant it ?"
"Certainly not, until I know what it is." '

Well, ask it, my child, ask it."

Ethel sighed. The little hand wlich rested on

this mean ? You are sorry to part from Kate, eh?

CHAPTER XXV
MARY'S nature was stronger than Ethel's, and after a
moment's hesitation, during which she struggled to
resist Mary's authority, the younger girl gave way.
She walked slowly back to the house.
" I will go and see mummy," she said to herself.
" Perhaps mummy will understand. How queer
Mary is-how different from what she used to be I
What can it all nan P  Oh, if I only might go to
Australia with Kate how very happy I should be!l
During our absence Mary would forget all that now
worries her, and when we came back again she would
be her own dear self."
Ethel quickened her steps. She soon reached her
mother's room.
Mrs. Hume, tired from her journey,-,was lying on
the sofa. She was considerably better, her eyes were
bright, and there was a healthy colour in each of her
cheeks. Ethel ran up to her impulsively, knelt down
by her side, and took one of her hands in hers.
" It is good to see you again, mummy," she said.
"And it is very nice to see you, my little Ethel,"
replied Mrs. Hume. "Sit down, darling, and tell me
all you have been doing."
"All, mummy ? That will mean a long narrative."
"Well, begin; tell me something at any rate.
How did you enjoy your time at Castellis ?"
"Oh I but don't you know," cried Ethel, " w&hiad .

full of suspicion about-about our Kate-our Kitty,
mother I"
"Our Kate-our Kitty? Mary suspects Kitty ?"
said Mrs. Sume. "But of what ?"
"Really, mother, I cannot say. She is so strange
about it. From her attitude and ways one would
think that Kate had done something very, very wrong, 
and that Mary's mission in life was to find it out.
Let me tell you, mother. Listen, won't you ?"
Mrs. Hume did listen while Ethel repeated- the
various things she had observed with regard to Mary
-her hurried visit to Cornwall, the interview with
Sir John Fenton-Douglas, their coming back to town,
were all graphically described.
Mrs. Hume listened without making any comment..
.Jer life of invalidism had made her thoughtful and
-wary. In the old days she used to be impulsive; now
she held herself in firm control, and allowed Ethel to
i-:     very little of her mind..
i..:.-,  "What does it mean, mother-?" said the girl in
concllusion. "What is wrong ?"
"/Nothing, I hope, darling. What should be
wrong?"
" But she has no reason whatever for her strange
conduct I What can Kate have done wrong?"
"I hope nothing, my dear."
" But Mary thinks she has. Mary suspects her.
Sometimes I almost think that she-it seems incredible  f.
-but I almost think she suspects Kate' of not being
Kate at all I"
"Now, my dear Ethel, you are getting a little
unintelligible."
" Oh I I know, mother, it all sounds very strange;
but let me tell you what fear troubles me."

Do, darling."
" I am so awfully afraid that our Mary is growing
like Aunt Julia."
Now, indeed, Mrs. Hume turned pale.
" No," she said, half rising from her sofa. " No.
Impossible 1"
" People who go out of their minds get affected
that way; don't they, mother ?"
:" Y, darling; but I am sure it is bt true in
Mary's case."
Just then steps were heard in the corridor; they
stopped outside Mrs. Hume's door. The next instant
Mr. Hume and Mary came in.
"What are you talking about, Ethel ?" said Mary,
glancing at her sister, who flushed vividly at sight of
her.
"I was talking to mother."
"About me ? " said Mary.
"Well, yes, Mary. I cannot deny it."
l I suppose you won't tell me what you have been
saying ?"
" I don't think I can."
" Certainly not, Mary," said Mrs. Hume; she
looked at her elder daughter as she spoke. "Ethel
is at liberty to talk privately to her mother without
being forced to repeat her words."
. "Oh, of course, mother," said Mary; "but you
look fagged and tired, just as if Ethel's words were
exciting-too exciting for you to hear. I think I can
guess what Ethel has been saying. I have seen the
thought in her mind for the last couple of days."
"What thought, my dear ?" said her father.
Mary laughed. Her laugh was scarcely tuneful.
L tr i£ai had altered very much during the last few

months; it had lost the first comeliness of youth, the
cheeks were a little hollow, there were black shadows
under the large dark eyes. The complexion was, no
longer clear, but was somewhat inclined to be sallow.
Mary's lips trembled, too-there was a want of repose
just now round the lower part of her face which any-
thing but improved her appearance.
" I know what you mean," she said, and she stood
where the full light of the evening sun fell all over her.
"You think, father thinks, Ethel thinks, that I am
following in the steps of Aunt Julia."
"Oh, don't, my child, don't," said Mrs. Hume.
She gave a little cry of distress.
"I am not doing so," continued Mary. "I am
more sane than any one of the rest of you. Some-
thing is hidden from you which I see quite clearly."
"They all think that," murmured Ethel under her
burath, and something like the same thought occurred
toMrs. Hume. She knewthat those whowere goingout
of their minds were, as a rule, the last to recognise it.
" Yes, mother," said Mary, with passion, "it is very
hard to be misunderstood; but I vow, I declare here
before my father, before Ethel, before you, that I will
tear the disguise from that adventuress Kate Henley."
"My dear I" cried her mother.
"She is an adventuress," repeated Mary. " She
is robbing us of our money-she-she is not the
Kitty we used to know."
" How dare you say it, Mary?"exclaimed her father.
"My poor child " cried her mother. "There,
there, Mary, come to me."
Mary knelt by her mother's side. She suddenly
burst into tears.
"Oh, don't think me mad," she cried. "You are

^r. Hume. " I could see no coherence in her story.
^i.lhy should Kate for a single moment be any other

" Mary does not seem to quite know that herself;

something wrong with her. She says that from the
moment she first appeared in the house she had name-
less suspicions about her, that these have strengthened
as the time went on, and during her visit to Castellis,
and more particularly to Falmouth, the suspicions
became certainties.  Mary believes that her maid,
Marryat, knows something of Kate's secret; but she
says she would not haxe moved herself in the matter
had it not been for Kate's most curious aversion to
seeing Sir John Fenton-Douglas."
" I noticed that myself," said the lawyer thought-
fully. "I considered it very queer, and was sorry
that Kitty retained so much of her childish nervous-
ness; but all these remembrances make it more
certain that the girl we know and love is really the
Kitty of long ago. How can it possibly be otherwise ?
There is no sense in the thing. Sir John recognised
er -as the girl he had attended at Mentone."
"Ay," said Mrs. Hume, "but why would she not
see him '"
"Because of that same nervousness, my dear.
Susannah; it was only the failing of the child mor
marked in the woman."                  .-'
"Quite so; but then the little Kitty of longigo
would have yielded to her husband's entreaties, and
allowed SirJohn Fenton-Douglastoexamine herlungs."
Mr. Hume stared at his wife.
*  Really, Susannah, one would suppose that you

"Oh, I am not-not at all; but it is only fair to
our child that her suspicions should be treated, at
least at first, with a certain amount of respect."
"Not at all  I have no patience with he.,' said
Mr. Hume. "She opened up the most perplexing

and, indeed, terrible questions. She is nervous. We
ought all to be anxious with regard to her, bearing
poor Julia's history in mind; but as to Kate, I refuse
to allow her to be discussed any longer."
"All the same, Robert," said his wife, "ybu
might go up to town to-morrow to see her."
' I shall certainly do so and early in the morning
too. Their hurried visit to Australia makes it necessary
that I should have a good deal of talk with Kate with
regard to moneyiatters." 
" And meanwhile Mary ?" said the mother.
"Mary had better be taken no notice of. If she0
wants change, she shall have it. She shall go abroad
if she likes. By the way, Susan, what do you-think of
the proposal that Ethel should accompany her cousin

private sitting-room which she and her husband 
engaged at the hotel, with both-hands extended 
her lovely eyes dancing. 
" Ah I it is good to see you, Uncle Robert," she
"And good to see you, my dear Kitty," he 
plied, bending forward and kissing her on her for

"Oh, I am well now, but I was a little anxious
few days ago. I am so fearfully busy, however, 
I have no time to think of my health. We are off

darling Ethel may come too ?"
·  "I have not come to say anything of the sorti

to the Grange this evening."
Oh, I am sure we- will with pleasure," said Kate,
without a moment's hesitation.
"Then- that is all right, my dear. Your sudd
visit to Australia necessitates my having a long t

"I expected something of the sort," replied Kate,
"but don't make our interviews too collicate
please,- Uncle Robert.  Remember that your Kit
has not got the brains of a lawyer."
" My Kitty has got a very astute brain for all that,
said Mr. Hume. He lookeg her up and down as he
spoke. He noticed the breadth of the brow, the
massive head, the broad, well-defined shoulders, the.
noble figure. He said to himself: . That woman han 
got courage, shrewdness, intellect of a high order. 
The little Kitty of long ago has developed into a finer

" Yes," said Kate."
As Mr. Hume was walking down the steps of
the Metropole, having bidden his niece good-bye, he
was attracted by a four-wheeler which had drawn up
at the kerb. One of the waiters from the hotel was
helping the cabman to take a trunk off the roof.
Out of the cab, meanwhile, was stepping a neatly
dresed,dainty-looking person. She turned as she came
up the steps of the hotel, and Mr. Hume saw her face;:
"Ah, Marryat !" he said.
Marryat dropped a respectful curtsey.
"I have been anxious about my mistress," she'
said. "Do you happen to know, Mr. Hume, if she,
is in ?"
"Yes. I have just come from her," replied Hum
" I am glad you are baclk Marryat - Mrs. Henley i

"I am very pleased to be back in order to attend4.

raise the fears of any one. Poor Henley, how devoted

The lawyer's eyes glistened, and just for one
moment some of the avarice which had appeared in
Mary's dark eyes visited his, for Kate's was an enor-

having children, in the event of her death it would
go to his daughters.

"Yes, ma'am," said Marryat. "Not hearing from.j
you for several days, I thought it best to come up".'
" But I didn't tell you to," said, Kate. "Why did
you do it?"
Marryat stood very still, and gazed gravely at Kate.
"I had my reasons," she said; " and one of them
is this: Mr. Rogers has returned to the Riviera; that
being the case, there was no longer any necessity for
me to stay at Falmouth."
"Oh I He has gone ? " said Kate, with a sigh of

"He has gone for the present," replied Marryat.

CHAPTER XXVI
THAT evening the Henleys, Marryat' accompanying 
them, arrived at the Grange. Kate looked radiant,
and yet there was a pallor about her which made
her face even more interesting and beautiful than it
generally was. The fact is, after Marryat had left
her she boldly locked the door of her sitting-roomn'
and flinging herself on a sofa had burst into a storm
of weeping. Never since the moment when she had
first thought out her bold and wicked scheme of sub-
stituting herself for the real Kate Bouverie had she
given way to tears. These tears now came, however,
with such overwhelming force that she could not
resist them. At first this great torrent of weepin
was accompanied with physical agony, but after
time the pain ceased and the. relief began. Sh
cried until she could cry no longer, then suddenl
remembering that tears would be fatal to her appea
ance, put on a hat which' was lying on the tab
near, concealed her face under a thick veil, an
went out to walk up and down on .the Embankmen
She came back about lunch-time, and no one now
noticed any traces of her great fit of weeping. But
in the evening those tears had given her eyes a pecul
arly pathetic expression, and had certainly taken so
of the bloom from her cheeks. She looked deica
enough when she entered her aunt's presence to cau
that good lady to itter an exclamation-
"Oh, my dear Kitty," said Mrs. Hume, "y

matter scarcely rests in my hands; but I know your
uncle is thinking about it; you can speak to him if
you like after dinner." 
"I will,I will;" cried Kate, springing to her feet,
as she spoke. "There is no time to be lost, as if
Ethel does come we must take her passage early to.
morrow. I will go to my room now if you don't mind,
Aunt Susannah; I want to change mydress for dinner."
As Kate was passing through the wide hall she
came face to face with Mary. Mary stood and con-
fronted her.
"Are you going on with it?" said Mary Hume,
going up then to Kate and looking her full in the face.
" Going on with what, Mary ? "
" You know what I mean. You know perfectly
well that you are a base impostor, you are nothing
better than an adventuress, there I"
"Mary I" said her father, who just then appeared
on the scene, "I am v.y much annoyed with you;
you must not speak i this way to my niece Kate
Henley again." 
"Oh, don't let her, uncle," said Kate; " she quite
frightens me." Kate ran up to her uncle and put her
arms round his neck. "Say that I -am not an ima
postor, Uncle Robert. Mary terrifies me; what can
she mean ?"
"I mean exactly wht I say," answered Mary,
"but as the time is not yet ripe for any one to
believe me, I will try and be civil to you while you
remain in the house, but shake hands with you I
will not."
She turned and went upstairs.
" Her mother and I are quite anxious about her,
Kitty," said the lawyer, looking now into Kate's white

at an enormous cost, and rather at a venture, but it
had turned out, as far as her appearance went, a most
complete success. Marryat helped her to get into it,
and laced it to the slim young figure. Kate walked
up to the mirror and looked at herself.
" I am a handsome woman, am I not, Marryat ?"
"You are indeed, madam.".
"The sort of woman a man would love ?"
"Ay, madam, just so."
" Marryat, my husband loves me, does he not ?"
"Poor fellow, he worships the ground you walk
on," said the maid.
"And I love him," said Kate; "he must go on
loving me intensely, passionately, and my Uncle
Robert must love me, and Ethel must adore me, and
Mrs. Hume must think me the sweetest, prettiest crea-
ture she has ever seen; and even you, Marryat, even
you must have a spark of affection in that funny, queer
heart of yours for the girl who is your mistress."
"Ay, madam, I have, I have-you are a very
bewitching young lady."
"Marryat," said Kate, skipping upt:f: her, "you
shall come with me to Australia-you shall come and
I will pay you, oh, so well. Will you come, Marryat,
will you ?"
"That Iwill," answered Marryat, her eyes sparkling.
"If you come, you uncerstand ?"
" What, madam ? you must put it into words."
But that's just what I hate to do., The more
words I put things into, the more muddled I get. If you
come you will be true to me, faithful to me in word
and deed. You will think of no one in comparison
with me. You will put my welfare first of all ?"
" And if I do all this ?" said the maid.

"But will your that is the question."
I will tell you that when you say what my
reward is to ibe."
"Ah, then you cannot care for me," said Kate im-
pulsively; "it isa money bargain. You need not come;
stay in-England  I won't have you on those terms."
She turned petulantly away; the colour had risen
to her cheeks, but again had faded. When her hus-
band entered the room she turned, a pale Kate in her
caison -dress, to welcome him.
' Marryat left the room by one door as Henley
entered by another.
"Well, Kitty," he said.
Kate ran up to him.
"Do you like me in my crimson dress ?" she said;
"I bought it a week ago. It was something of a spec.;
do. I look nice in it-the sort of Kitty you would be
proud of ?"
"I am always proud of you, Kate, whatever you
wear," answered the young man.
There was something in his tone which caused
Kate to regard him attentively.
"Why, what is wrong with you ?" she said, ' are
you ill ? You look very, very queer."
"I don't know what is the matter with me,"
answered Henley; ', I did not feel well this morning,
and I have been getting steadily worse all day. I
have a horrid sore throat and a splitting headache,
and I am a bit feverish."
"I will take your temperature," said Kate. " You
see what a wise woman I am; I always go provided with
things for an emergency. You have just got a cold,
darling, nothing to make you the least bit anxious.

little tiny bit consumptive, too, then you won't be 
quite so angry with your own Kitty for marrying you."
"Whatever you did I would never be angry with
you," he said, and then he sank into the first chair he
could find. Ordinarily he was a remarkably healthy-
looking man with the bronzed and yet clhar com-
plexion of perfect health. He was a big fellow, broad
shouldered, long limbed. Now he had a curious col-
lapsed sort of appearance. The bronze in his cheeks
had faded to an ashen grey, his eyes were very dull.
Kate got out her thermometer, and made him hold
it in his mouth. It registered 102°.
"Then you are really ill," she cried, her eyes
dilating. "You must lie down; we will send for
the doctor."
"Oh no, I don't want to make a fuss," he 
answered; " I will dress and come down to dinner;
don't say anything about it.  Perhaps after I have 
eaten I shall feel better."
"Well, stay where you are, darling, and I will
brush your hair and bathe your forehead. You don't
know how much nicer you will feeA when my hands
are touching you." 
He smiled at her, but it seemed almost an effort
to do even that. Kate fussed round him, giving him
that feeling of pleasure which her mere presence
always provoked.
With an effort he got into his evening things
and they both went downstairs. Kate's pallor, and
yet her beautiful appearance in the crimson dress,
prevented any one from specially noticing Henley,
and as Kate sat at the same side as he did at
the long dinner-table she was not at  to discover
whether he was eating or not. She Weard his voice

AN ADVENTURESS                267
as he spoke to her uncle, and his tone seemed to her
to be quite.as full, and strong, and joyous as ever.
Once she gave a sigh of relief when she heard him
give way to on of his hearty laughs.
At last the, tmsal came to an end and the ladies
withdrwnto the dramwing-room. They had not been

"Don'tbesilly, Mar; youraffectations arepast bear.

yourself, make yourself useful. Henley is ill, he wants
his wife; send her to the dining-room immediately."
In some astonishment, but still with marked un-'
willingness, Mary rose to her feet; she went out.
Ethel and Kate were pacing up and down at a little dis-
tance. Kate was expatiating for the benefit of Ethel's
all too willing ears on the delights of the voyage
and the happy time they might hope to spend to-
gether in Australia. Mary, who guessed what they were
talking about, called out now in a tone of triumph-
'i Come in, Kate, you are wanted; your husband
is ill."
Kate leapt away from Ethels side almost as if
some one had shot her; she rushed past Mary and
ran into the house. A moment later she was kneeling
by Henley's side; he was lying on the sofa, his eyes
were shut, there was a slight dew on his forehead,
and his brows were contracted with pain. Mr. Hume
was standing near.

268          AN ADVENTURESS
"Don't be frightened, Kitty,' he said, "I have
sent for the doctor, but there is no doubt that Ralph
is ill. He just slipped off his chair in a dead faint
after you left the room. I brought him'to-before I
called you. We will put him to bed, and the doctor,
I hope, will order him something to put him right."
The doctor, a bright-looking young man of about
eight-and-twenty, soon afterwards appeared.  His
name was Thornton. He examined the patient very
critically, ordered him to bed, and helped to put him
there. Kate entered the room as soon as the sick
man was lying between the sheets.
"We shall want a nurse," she heard Thornton
say to her uncle.
"A nurse I" said Kate. For the first time she was
seriously alarmed. Was her husband, her darling,
seriously ill? Was there something at the eleventh
hour going to prevent her taking that trip which
seemed to her her only way of salvation I She even
forgot Henley in her intense anxiety about this latti
fact. She ran up to the doctor.
"A nurse," she said, "for my husband? But I
will nurse him."
" You can do as you please, Mrs. Henley," was
the medical man's reply, "but do not raise your
voice so loud; -I will speak to.you in another room
-follow me."'
Kate followed him very unwillingly. She led him .
into her husband's dressing-room and immediately
closed the door.
"Now, what is wrong?" she said: "He has
taken a chill, has he not ? I told him before dinner
'hat I was quite certain he was in for a bad cold."

CHAPTER XXVII.
BY the next morning Henley was delirious, his tem-
perature registered i04; it ascended yet higher and
registered. the dangerous figures Io5 on the little
clinical thermometer. Kate, who had really known
very little of illness before in her life, was, for a few
hours at least, carried completely out of herself. Her
love for the sick man rose in all its passionate intensity.
She had sat up all night devouring his face, her heart
beating high, her own pulse almost at fever speed,
and when the doctor came in the morning the look
that she fastened on him almost unnerved this some- 
what stoical but kind-hearted young man. He saw
her and Mr. and Mrs. Hume in the next room. 
"What I feared last night I am now almost cer-
tain of," he said. "This is a case of blood-poisoning,
and I believe that Henley is sickening for a very
serious typhoid attack.  We cannot be absolutely.'-
certain whether it will turn to typhoid or diphtheria for
the nait twenty-four hours, but I do not think the
condition of the throat sufficiently inflamed for diph-
theria, and there are other symptoms which point
directly to typhoid." 
"Typhoid I Diphtheria I" said Kate in a low tone.
She raised her eyes and looked for a momentabso-
lutely dumb with misery.
"Which is the longest of the two complaints ?"
she asked then.



<pb n="271"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               271
"The longest; and in my opinion the most
dangerous, is typhoid," answered the doctor. "We,
now have certain remedies for diphtheria which as a.
rule minimise its danger, but I do not think your
husband is going to have diphtheria, so we need not
discuss it.  His throat is much affected, but this
symptom may quickly be relieved."
" And how long is an attack of typhoid "
"Any time from twenty-one days to six or even
eight weeks."
Kate turned so white that she had to catch hold
of the nearest chair to support herself.
" Well, dear," said her aunt very kindly, "it is a
good thing you are here, far better than being at an
hotel. All that this house contains is at your service."
" There is one thing, Mrs. Henley," said the doctor
in a quick voice, "you must have assistance in the
nursing, you must have not only one, but two, nurses
-one for day duty and one for night duty. You
yourself of course can be present with your husband
as much as your strength will allow, but this typhoid
is a nasty thing; it is a severe struggle between life
and death. Even the most favourable cases may
become dangerous at a moment's notice. You never
can tell what the fell disease will do, nor what turn it'
will take. Much more depends on the nurse than
the doctor, and the patient's strength must be kept up.
He must have food day and night at least every hour
-food of a certain quality, directions for which I will
leave. I will send in two capable nurses accustomed
to typhoid within the next few hours. I will go at
once and see about them."                      4
He loft the room and Kate listened to his retreat-
ing footsteps as he went downstairs. He was wearing

27Y          AN ADVENTURESS
new boots and they creaked very, very slightly. The
creak of the doctor's boots seemed to get upon her
tired brain. She raised both her hands and clasped
them round her head; her face wore a wild expression.
"Don't give way, Kitty," said her aunt; " I know
how devotedly you love that poor fellow, but pray
God, he may recover. We must turn to our God in
this hour of sore trouble, my child. Oh, my Kitty,
don't repulse me."
Mrs. Hume had held out her motherly arms; the
girl hesitated for a moment, then she flung herself 
into them.
" Help me, pray for me," she said with a sob;.
my burden is greater than I can bear."
! No, no, Kate; no burden can be that," said Mrs.
Hume. " Pray to God, child; turn to the Deliverer
in this hour of your need:'
'I cannot," said Kate, in a dry choking voice,,
I' and it is that which makes it so hard/'
"Why not, my darling ? in the old days you were
religious, Kitty."
"In the old days I" said Kate-" for God's sake
don't remind me of them now; I shall go mad if
you do. Oh dear I oh dear I oh my hetheart I my heart "
She clasped her hand to her palpitating breast, her
eyes looked wilder than ever. The handle of the
door was softly turned and Hume came in.
" This is very sad news," he said. " Dr. Thornton
is full of apprehension. 6h, Kate, my poor child,
I did not notice you.'
" Never mind me, I have heard a very plairnspoken
opinion," said Kate. She leant up against the wall.
;" We will do all we can for him, and I don't believe
myself half what doctors say," said Mr. Hume; " they

always make the' worst of things, imagining that
their glory will be the greater when recovery'takes
place. It is not at all likely that a strong man like
Henley will succumb to a mere illness. He will just
have a sharp bout and be as well as ever again. But,

some other passengers will be only too glad to avail
themselves of them. Find them, dear, and I will take
them at once and try to get rid of them. You will have
to postpone your voyage for at least three months."
.,.Oh, then we may as well never go," said Kate.

l. . do you say that ?"
t speak to me about anything now, Uncle
i'rt; I cannot take in what you are saying, every-

She left the room and went to the room which
had been arranged for herself. There she found the
: tickete and brought them back to her uncle. She
h- 1anded them to him without a word.
l Mrs. Hume stole softly into the sick-chamber; she
to sit for a few hours with Henley until the
,,F nurses arrived. Kate went and stood by the
_iB ^of her own room. Presently a light step
' in the room; she turned her head, Marryat
4k.



<pb n="274"/>

"I am very sorry for you, ma'am; this is very'
bad news."
A It is distracting news," said Kate. "' I wish to
heaven I had not given up the tickets; I was mad to
do it."
"Why, madam, what possible use could they be
to you? Mr. Henley certainly cannot be moved
from here on Thursday."
"Oh, I know that; I don't realise what I am
saying. Oh, Marryat, aren't you-not that it matters
-but aren't you sorry for me ?"
"I am, and for him, dear gentleman," said the
maid stoutly. " You ought to think of nothing now,
ma'am, not even of that secret of yours, but just of
your dear husband alone... May it please the Al-
mighty to raise him up I But you must nurse your
own strength, madam. You stay here and I will
bring you some breakfast.  Don't fret now, dear;
you-have been up all night, and, dear heart, you are
not used to it. Let me take off this dress and put
you into one of your comfortable tea-gowns, then.
you shall lie down and I will bring you some break-
fast myself."                  .
'   "Oh, do, Marryat; how kind you are 1" said the
poor girl. 
"There's just one thing I should like to say,"
continued the maid, as she unhooked Kate's dress and
took it off, and got her mistress into a warm and
comfortable tea-gown, " there's just one thing I
should like to say, and it's this: Keep away from
Miss Mary, stay up here as much as you can. I am
not the best of women, and II always look to number
one, but there are times when I'd'be a fiend if I
didn't take your part, madam."



<pb n="275"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               275
"Oh, yes, yes, you would indeed be a fiend," 
said Kate, "but my head aches so much that I can
scarcely think. Get me a cup of strong tea, Marryat,
and then for God's sake leave me alone."
Marryat slipped softly out of the room, she glided
downstairs. There was no fear of her boots creaking
as she walked, she knew better than that. In the hall
downstairs she came plump up against Mary.
Well," said Mary Hume in an eager voice, " how
is she bearing it ?"
"Much as you would bear it, Miss Mary, if your
husband, that is, if you ever have the luck to have one,
was lying at death's door."
" Oh that's no answer whatever," said Mary. ," Is
she feeling put out about not going on Thursday ?
That, doubtless, is the sorest of her present worries."
"She naturally, Miss Hume, thinks of no one but
the man who lies in such terrible danger," said the
maid. "But don't keep me, Miss; I want to fetch
some breakfast for my poor mistress."
Marryat brought the breakfast and Kate was in-
duced to eat a little; then the maid, seeing she could
do nothing further, left her.
"s Mrs. Hume is in the sick-room," she said, " and
I also shall be within call. The nurses are expected
any moment. Now you will rest for a little, Mrs.
Henley; promise me, ma'am, that you will lie down."
Kate promised-she would promise anything at
that moment to get rid of Marryat. At last the door
was shut and she was alone. When she found her-
self so she sprang immediately to her feet. She began
to pace up and down the length of the room. She
found she could think more clearly and consecutively
while in motion than when perfectly still. The more



<pb n="276"/>
276          AN ADVENTURESS
she thought, the more perplexed, miserable, and terri-
fied she grew.
" If I allow this terror to gain the upper hand I
shall be undone," she thought. "It is not only the
fact that Ralph is so ill, that the man I love to dis-
traction is at death's door, it is not only that-I my-
self am in peril, in the most awful peril. This delay
is exactly as if God Himself, with a flaming sword,
stood in my path. What am I to do? What shall
I do?  I dare not pray, I cannot pray, and yet I
must, I must do something."
At that moment a sound of voices outside reached
her ears, she stole softly to the window and saw with
a momentary sense of satisfaction that Ethel and Mary
hadgone for a walk. They had stood for a moment
under her window talking together, and then quickly,
as if in a hurry, had started to walk down the avenue.
She is out of the house, that is one comfort,"
thought Mrs. Henley, as she looked after Mary.
"o If only I had not parted with those tickets," she
said to herself. " If I had them I should feel that
there was at least a chance of my getting away, then-
should the worst come o/it I should be in anothier
hemisphere, the danger to myself would not be so
great. The best thing I can do after all is to go.
Oh dear I oh dear I why did I part with the tickets "
She thought hard for a moment or two, she had
not seen her uncle go to-town. As a rule, the dog-
cart came for him and he started on his way to
his place of business an hour or an hour and a half
before now, but as she had not heard the sound of
wheels it occurred to her that for some reason he
might have postponed his departure.
"If so, I will try and get the tickets from him in



<pb n="277"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               a77
some way or other; I will get them, I will make an
excuse, anything to-have them back again in my
hands," thought Kate.
This idea had scarcely come to her before she
proceeded to act upon it. Her soft tea-gown made
her look completely dressed. Without waiting to
make any addition to her toilet she ran downstairs.
She knocked at her uncle's study door; there was
no answer, she went in. Yes, beyond doubt the
bird had flown-the fire had not been lit in the
grate, the windows were partly open, and there, on
the study table, just as if he had laid them down
and forgotten them, was the envelope which con-
tained the tickets for the voyage to Australia.
"He has gone, he has forgotten all about these,"
thought Kate. " He shall not have them now." She
clasped them wildly to her heart, slipped them into
the front of her dress and ran upstairs, She was
quite panting with excitement. Not a soul had seen
ht. leave her room, not a soul had seen her return to
it: ;ihe felt a sense of immediate comfort with the
viJwl- edge that the tickets were in her possession.

gently. She went downstairs-her daughters had      .
now returned from their walk.
"Well, my dears," said,Mrs. Hume, "we must
make up our minds to a sick house for the present.
I have been planning how things ought to be. The
doctor says that Ralph is in for a very long illness.
Fortunately I gave the young people the largest room
in the house, and there is a nice dressing-room
attached which could be for the use of the nurse. The
nurse off duty could have a room next to the servant's
to sleep in, but I was thinking, Ethel and Mary,
that it would be a good plan if you moved from your
present rooms to some in the west wing, so as to
allow poor Kate to have her own part of the house to
herself."
"Most inconvenient," said Mary; "why should
we do it ?
"Only out of kindness, dear. She is terribly to 
be pitied."
"Indeed she is," said Ethel, "so loving as she is
-such a darling. It is a fearful blow to her."
" Not going to Australia on Thursday must be a 
frightful blow," said-Mary in her quietest tone.
" Oh, Mary, how can you speak like that ? Your
father has gone to try and exchange the tickets; he
will doubtless be able to succeed."
"Did Kate give up the tickets to father?" said
Mary.
t Yes, why shouldn't she ? what possible use could 
she have for them on Thursday ?"
"Oh, none," said Mary, "onry I rather won-
dered, that isall.  Mother, I see I. am in the way
here. I canobt feel at present any Charitable feelings
towards Kate.  You and Ethel can pet her to your

heart's desire; you still believe in her; you think her
good and true-well, I don't."
"Oh, my poor Mary!" said Mrs. Hume.
"You may pity me, mother, for I am very un-
happy at present, but I am in full possession of all
my faculties. I should like, however, to leave home;
I will go and stay with Aunt Maud in Russell Square."
The Aunt Maud to whom Mary referred was her
mothtes sister. Mrs. Hume's brow quite cleared.
' .,!i'That is an excellent idea," she said, "but are
mre that your aunt is at home ?"
.--; i.:tYou had a letter from her yourself last week,
maoter, and I think she said in it she would return
yesterday. I will go to her and ask her to take me
in. My absence from home just now will be a relief
to you all!'
"Well, if you still continue to distrust Kate, it will
be a relief," said Mrs. Hume.

"Here are the nurses, dear,' she said. "Nurse
Bryan, who wishes to take the day nursing, and Nurse 
Simpson, who will look after your husband at night.
Nurse Simpson has been up all last night, and would
be glad to go to bed at once. That I can manage.
Nurse Bryan says she will go on duty immediately."
"t I should just like to put on my cap and apron,"
said Nurse Bryan, speaking in a cheery voice," and 
then, perhaps, Mrs. Henley, you will take me into the 
sick-room and just show me where I can find things.
I will soon have the poor gentleman quite comfort-
able. You must bear up, my dear," she added, and 
the kindly woman laid her hand on Kate's arm.
Kate shuddered at the touch. What did nurses
mean?    Horrible illness, often death.  Oh, she
loathed the look of both these capable women; then
they would take possession of her husband and keep
her away from him, and if things really came to the
worst-and she-she had to leave-she would like
to say good-bye to him all-yes, quite alone. Oh, it
was awful I How was she to bear the terrible strain?
Mrs. Hume motioned to the two nurses to follow
her; just as she got to the door she turned to Kate.
"I am making arrangements for your comfort, 
Kate," she said, "and Mary and Ethel are moving
out of their present bedroom. The room can be used
as a sitting-room for the nurses, and to keep medicines
and all sorts of nourishment in. It will be very use-
ful. Thus, my dear, you and your husband will have
the entire of this east wing to yourselves."

CHAPTER XXVIII
AT lunch that day there came a telegram from Mr.
Hume. Its contents'were as follows:-- 
" Left tickets for the Hydra on my study stable by
mistake. Please send them into town to my office
by special messenger." 
Mary had already gone to London, and Ethel had
accompanied her. Mrs. Hume and Kate were the
only'people seated at the luncheon table.
"I will go to the study and look for them," said '
Kate. She left the room, returning in a few minutes.
" I cannot find them," she said; "where did he 
say hb had left them ?"
"On his study-table; I had better go, my dear."
Mrs. Hume went, and Kate played with her food.
Presently the good lady of the house came back.
" It is most strange," she remarked; "where can
they be ? They are certainly not on his study-table."
"Oh, he must have taken them after all," said
Kate; " did you search anywhere else in the room ?"
," Yes, I looked in all the likely places. What is
to be done ?7 This is Tuesday; the Hydra sails on
Thursday morning; the only chance of selling the:
tickets is to-day. I will go and have another search." 
" I will go with you," said Kate. ' Two pairs of
eyes are better than one."
The two women went back to the study and
both searched and searched. Kate pretended -tq be 
intensely anxious.                  .

.-.4"         AN ADVENTURESS
When Kate got upstairs she was met by Nurse
Bryan on the threshold of the sick-room.
"I should like the doctor to be sent for," said the
nurse ; -" the patient's temperature is going up. This-
is a serious case.  Don't be frightened, madam, I
have nursed cases as bad, but if a messenger could
be sent for Dr. Thornton it would be a matter of
satisfaction to me."
Kate, her heart beating wildly and for the moment
losing complete sight of herself and her own danger,
flew downstairs. She rushed into her aunt's presence.
"Oh, Aunt Susannah," she said, "he is -vorse,
even nurse seems frightened. Oh, do please send for
Dr. Thornton immediately. If you have no mes-
senger I will run for him myself. Oh, do please,
please be quick."
"George shall go at once, my dear. Ring the
bell, Kate. Oh, my dear child, try to--"
" Try to exercise self-control, you mean. Oh, I am
all right, but it is his life-don't keep me, Aunt
Susannah."
She flew from the room, rushed upstairs, aid not-
withstanding a warning glance from the nurse ran up 
to the sick-bed. Her husband was sitting up, the
nurse had her arms round him, he was struggling
against her and was looking round him with wild eyes.
"Where's Kitty? come to me, Kitty, where are
you ? It isn't true, is it, Kitty ? "
"Oh, my darling, what isn't true?" said Kate. Her
voice trembled. Had Ralph secret suspicions of her,
and was he going to let out his innermost thoughts
in this awful delirium. But no, the sick man had no
suspicions of his wife; she was his own, his darling,
his white Kitty, the one woman without speck or flaw.



<pb n="285"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               285
"Is it true that you are consumptive " he said;
"it will kill me if you die. Stay with me, Kitty, stay
with me--what, you won't I then I will make you."
He struggled to get out of bed. Now Kate assisted
the nurse in forcing the sick man to lie down.
" It is I, Ralph, I," she said.
"You, who are you ?" he answered. Her words
arrested him, he looked up into her face. "You are
not my Kate, you are a devil. Go away, I want Kitty,
f/my own Kitty, not you."
"Oh, nurse, what am I to do ? " said the poor wife.
' "Nothing, dear, nothing; he does not know what
he is saying. Ah, thank God, here comes the doctor."
The firm step of the medical man was heard as
he crossed the floor.
" Come, come, what is this ?" he said, " I say,
·Henley, you must lie quiet, my man. Now then,
that is better."  His sharp terse voice seemed to
pierce through the delirium in which the poor patient
was wandering.
"Come," said the doctor, "ah, that is right"'
He laid his hand with a certain force on the patient's
forehead, took the wrist between his finger and-thumb
and felt the flying pulses.
" I will give him a sedative," he said to the nurse;
"go out of the room and bring in my bag. Mrs.
Henley, perhaps you had better not remain -ere:'
"You cannot send me away," said Kate. She
was crouching down near the foot of tVe bed, her
face.looked wild with agony.
- "Don't let him see you, then," said the doctor in
a low tone.
She slipped a little behind where a curtain hid her,
and yet where she could peep at her husband. Already

286          AN ADVENTURESS
the wild paroxysm was leaving him, his eyes were
closing, and that dreadful semi-slumber, which is worse
than no slumber at all, took possession of him. The
doctor, who had put a few drops of a certain medicine
into a glass, nowadministered the draught tothe patient.
"This will make him sleep," he said. "Nurse, I
want to speak to you."
The nurse stepped round to the doctor's other side.
Still holding his hand across the sick man's brow, the
doctor asked her one or two questions. Kate strained
her ears to listen. What were those two talking about;
those two who were nearly driving her mad just now,
who between them were holding her husband's life in
their hands, who were thrusting her outside; she who
had been his nearest, his dearest, his best beloved,
pushed away now by the doctor and nurse? Oh, it
was past enduring I
For the present she had forgotten all her own im-
minent and awful danger. She could think of nothing
but Ralph. If he died. after all nothing mattered, she
might go where she pleased, she might be arrested,
locked up, charged with her crime, doomed to penal
servitude, anything-anything might happen to her, 
and she would not care.
" Oh, it may be best for him to die," she thought
for one swift moment of agony, "then he would
always think of me as his white Kitty, white as snow."
" Mrs. Henley, can I speak to you for a moment ? "
said Dr. Thornton. The sick man was now sleeping,
the nurse resumed her place at his side. Thornton
and Kate went out on the landing.
" I carit conceal from you," said the physician,
" that your hsband is not only ill, but he is in danger."
" But, oh, it is not hopeless ? " said Kate.

AN ADVENTURESS               287
"In cases of this sort, fever cases, we always say,
where there is life there is hope," said the doctor, in
a reverent tone, "but I must acquaint you, Mrs.
Henley, with the fact, that unless we can bring the
fever down and very quickly, too, his strength will not
stand it. I mean immediately to telegraph to town,
to Dr. Bennett Shaw, the great fever specialist."
"Do so," said Kate ; how soon can he be here ?"
"I shall ask him to come the first possible moment.
I intend to remain in the house for a little, I need not
be in the sick-room, and yet I want to be within call.
Where would you like me to stay ?"
"'We have furnished a room here as a sitting-
roomf will you come in?" said Kate. She went before
the doctor who followed her.
"Now, try and rest yourself. Be assured that all
that can be done will be done," said the man of science,
looking kindly at the agitated face of the young wife.
Oh, don't think of me, I am nothing, worse than
nothing, only," said Kate impulsively, " don't take him
quite away from me."
"-What do you mean ?"
-I cannot explain, but you and that nurse-  "
" Nurse Bryan   -  She is one of the very best
nurses on my staff, a most admirable, kindly, excellent
woman."
"Oh I know, I know, but she nurses him, and you
try to cure him, and I am pushed aside, and it drives
me nearly wild." 
" My poor girl," said the doctor, trying to conceal
his own impatience at what he considered the weakness
of Kate's-words, ," in a case of this kind one must for-
get one's isif; the thing is to get your husband well.
Now, for instance, what would you have done in a

paroxysm like what has just occurred ? You would not
have had strength enough to keep him in bed, he
might have got to the window and jumped out. See
for yourself how far better it is in cases of severe
illness that the patient should be nursed by strangers."
"Itishorriblycruel, all the same," saidKate. Sheleft
the room. On the landing Marryat met her. Marryat
looked self-important and at the same time troubled.
Mrs. Henley," she said, " can I speak to you ? "
" I don't think you can, Marryat, I am too much
upset. If you have anything special to say I will- "
" It is," said Marryat, "very special; there is a
lady downstairs who wants to see you."
A lady? Whom?"
"I don't know her name, but she says that you saw
her a week ago in Mortimer Street.- She wants to see
you, and immediately."
"The false Dr. Agnes Stevenson," thought poor
Kate. "She has come for her money, the thousand
pounds I promised her before we left the country. Yes,
yes, dreadful as things are I must see her at any cost."
" Where is she, Marryat ? " asked Kate aloud.
t I have shown her into Mr. Hume's study; it
seems the only place for her to be in."
" Oh, I must see her, and quite by herself," said
Kate. "Go down and tell her so. Ask her to go out-
side; say I will meet her in the shrubbery; show her
the shrubbery, Marryat; be quick, be clever, rouse
yourself, don't allow any one to suspect; I will pay
you anything. I must see her quickly, you under-
stand, Marryat. I will meet her in the shrubbery.":
" Yes, madam, I think I can manage," said
Marryat in a grave voice. She slowly left the room.
Kate put on her hat and jacket, and ran downstairs.

CHAPTER XXIX
DR. THORNTON, who was leaving the house in his
brougham just as Kate dashed out by a side entrance,
was somewhat astonished to see Henley's wife running
Wilyi in the direction of the shrubbery.
"What is that excitable young woman up to now'?
he laid to himself; but being much absorbed in'
several anxious cases, he did not trouble himself to
pursue this train of thought any further. He knew
that Henley was about to have a severe tussle for life,
and he thought it extremely doubtful what the final
issues would be.
-  I hope Bennett Shaw. will be able to come
^;  this evening," he said to himself; "of course

Marryat slowly returning to the house. Marryat's
whole attitude was that of a woman who was watch-
ing. She stood quite still when she saw Kate; she
raised her hand and beckoned to her mistress.
I have taken the lady to the summer-house," she
said. " You will be safe there-no one will overhear."
Kate nodded, and running up a path which led to
the top of a little incline, soon found herself standing
before the rustic summer-house.
A lady, neatly dressed in black, was seated on
one of the rustic chairs. She had her veil down and
the veil was a somewhat thick one. She rose when
she saw Kate, came a step forward, and held out her
hand.
"It is well to be careful," she said. "How do
you do, Mrs. Henley ?"
"How do yqu do?" answered Kate. She did
not take the proffered hand-she stood panting by
the doorway.
" You want to speak to me," she said, then.
The little woman raised' her veil for a moment,
and favoured Kate with a piercing glance.
"Not having heard from you this morning, as I
fully expected," she said, "I called at the M6tropole.
I was there informed that you had come here. I
came down, thinking you would jaer have a personal
interview than a letter."
"Oh yes, of course, a personal interview is best,"
said Kate.
"Quite so, that was what I felt. When do you
go to Australia "
Kate was about to reply, when the woman darted
forward and laid her hand on her arm.
"Stay," she said, "it is not safe for us to talk



<pb n="291"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               291
here; you don't want your maid to know all about
this"
"My maid I- What do you mean?
"I mean that any one standing at the back of this
little summer-house might overhear some of our
words. We are safer in the open. Where can we
go where we can be quite undisturbed "
"Oh, thank you," said Kate, " but Marryat would
not be so mean. All the same, perhaps you are right.
Come this way." She held out her hand, took that
of Mrs. Johnson, and walked rapidly down the hill in
the direction of the outer edge of the plantation.
There they found themselves in a field-a sort of
paddock. Mary's brown pony was grazing at the
farther end; there was not another creature within
sight.
" We are safe here," said Kate.
"Safe," said the little woman; "perhaps so, but
in a case of this kind it is well to make doubly sure.
We will walk in the middle of the field."
" Then some one may see us," said Kate.
t Better to be seen than to be overheard, and why-
should you not walk with me "and talk to me-
what is there in it ? At the worst only the vaguest
suspicion would be aroused by such a fact, but to be
overheard just now  -"
"Then you think," said Kate, with a weary smile,
" that I do carry a very dangerous secret ?"
"I have ceased to think about a patent fact, but
: your secret is not my affair, except in as far as I can 
use it for my own purposes. I mean, however, to be
,. straight with you. You have done something wrong;
-what, I have not the slightest idea; but, if you keep
your part of the bargain I will keep mine."

"Of course," said Kate, "I never wanted to back
out of my bargain. You did me a good turn that
day last week. I am extremely grateful to you."
"We managed it well, did we not?" said the
false Dr. Stevenson with a sort of chuckle.
" Splendidly; you are very clever-it was won-
derful of you to think all this out."
"Ah, my dear, the only capital I possess is what
is stored up behind this forehead of mine. If I had
not acute and clever brains I should long have ceased
to exist in this world. There is no place in the world
nowadays for fools, Mrs. Henley; it is only the wises
ones who enact the part of the survival of the fittest."
Kate clenched her hands. 
"Let us to business," she said; "I am in great
trouble to-day."
" I am sorry to hear it." Mrs. Johnson did not
ask what the trouble was. She stood quiet for a
moment, then she said: "The day fixed for your
departure for Australia is Thursday morning, the fifth 
of this month, is it not ?" 
"Yes, but    "
"There are no buts in the matter, Mrs. Henley.
I have come for my money. You paid me two
hundred pounds last week, I have come for my
thousand pounds to-day,"
"I can give you a cheque for the amount."
" I should prefer the money in gold and notes."
"I cannot give you gold and notes, I do not
possess them. Won't you take a cheque ?"
" No, thank you, cheques may be traced. Can
you not come with me to the bank? If we catch the
very next train there is still time."
"I cannot, my husband is very ill-at death's door."



<pb n="293"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               293
"Your husband ill?  Then you are not going
away on Thursday ?"
" Yes-no, no-of course not. How could I go
when my husband is so ill ? " But Kate thought, with
a sudden pang of comfort, that she still possessed the
tickets which entitled her to two berths on board
the Hydras
"Everything has been postponed, everything is
changed," she said.
Then the greater reason why I should have my 
money, and not in a cheque, please. You must come
with me to the bank at once."
"It is impossible, Mrs. Johnson; you ask me what
I cannot do; my husband is terribly ill."
" Are you nursing him ? "
"No, we have got nurses, of course-professional
nurses-but I must be there."
"It would be better for you to come with me; I
cannot take a denial. The arrangement was that I
was to be paid that money on the third of October.
The day and hour have come. I want my money;
you must come with me, and at once."
" I cannot, I cannot."
"Then I have no alternative."
"But what ?"
'To tell Mr. Hume what I did last week."
"You-you dare not; you will get into trouble
yourself."
:    "That is my affair-I shall not be uneasy. Mr.
: Hume will pay me a still larger sum for the informa-
-tion I can give him. Or stay, I have been gathering
'much information; there is a young lady who lives
I      here who suspects you, Mrs. Henley.
"What do you mean ? How do you know ?"



<pb n="294"/>
294          AN ADVENTURESS
"Never mind how I know. Once a case has
been put into my hands it is my bounden duty to
learn all the side issues, to travel along the by-roads
which branch out to right, to left, in every direction.  ;
If my clients are true to me I never give them away,
but if they break their word, then I have no mercy.
I told you that at the beginning."
"You did. Do you really mean that I must go
to town with you now-now? But the bank will
be closed at four o'clock."
"It is not more than half-past two. A train 
leaves for town in ten minutes; we are not five 
minutes from the station, we shall get up to London
in three-quarters of an hour; a cab will take us to
the bank, we shall reach it at a quarter to four-time
enough to draw the thousand pounds. It can be'
done. I know it is hard on you, but as I said before
I have no mercy."
"Oh, God help me I this, indeed, will drive me
mad," said Kate. "Well, if I must I must, but I
shall have to go back to the house." 
"No, you have not an instant to lose. Have you 
gloves? Your hat is on and your jacket-you can
come as you are." 
" I have not even a pair of gloves."
" That is bad, but I have an odd pair in my bag,
perhaps they will fit you; yes, of course they will;
you have small hands for your height-put them on.
Come, there is not a moment to lose." 
Kate never knew afterwards how it was that Mrs.
Johnson got such complete control over her. Her
husband was in danger, perhaps he would die. Any-
how he was ill, very ill indeed, and there was this
woman dragging her away.



<pb n="295"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               295
They rushed along the dusty high-road. Kate
panted as she ran. Mrs. Johnson's quick firm foot-
steps kept pace with hers. They reached the station.
I have no money," said Kate, then.
"That does not matter, I will pay for both; you can
give me a little more from your bank to make up for it."
"Oh, what a cruel, cruel woman I Why did I
ever put myself into her power ?" thought poor Kate.
"I am sinking deeper and deeper. Why did I do
it? Was there ever a more miserable creature in
all the world than I am ? and Ralph-oh, if Ralph
really leaves me I shall kill.myself."
Mrs. Johnson took tickets for both-they tra-
velled third-class to town. Kate had no veil; she
pushed her hat well forward and sat with her eyes
glued to her lap. Mrs. Johnson provided herself
with a newspaper and read contentedly until they
reached Victoria. As soon as they got there she
jumped out excitedly.
Come," she said, the train kept excellent time
-it is only a little past half-past three; we shall do
* it splendidly." She held up her parasol to a hansom
driver. A moment later the pair were whirling through
the streets. Kate had given the direction of her bank.
They reached it.
They went in. It still wanted ten minutes to
four.  Kate had not personally visited her bank
before. She felt queer and strange. Her bewilder-
ment seemed to shine out of her eyes. A handsome-
looking clerk who was standing behind the glass
partition looked at her with some interest.
Mrs. Johnson remained quietly in the background;
fobm her appearance the man thought she was Kate's
maid. Kate asked for a cheque-book.



<pb n="296"/>
296          AN ADVENTURESS
t I want one for myself," she said. "You have
an account of mine here. My name is Kate Henley"'
The man immediately went away, made some
inquiries, came back, and presented Kate with a
cheque-book.
'Yes," he said, "we have your account, Mrs.
Henley."  He spoke in a respectful tone.  Kate
Henley, the great heiress, was not unknown to some
of the clerks in the bank.
" I want," said Kate, looking up now and speaking
desperately, "to draw a thousand pounds from my ac-
count. I suppose I can have the money immediately?"
" It is a somewhat large order," said the clerk in
a dubious tone. In reality it was nothing very special,
but for a young lady to come just before the closing
hour and ask for a thousand pounds in gold and
notes was sufficiently out of the common to make
him anxious to speak to one of the managers.
" I will let you know in a moment," he said. He
went away. Kate stood moody and silent by the  i'
counter-she was excited. The agony she had gone t]
through was leaving her, however.
It was now Mrs. Johnson's turn to feel her heart
palpitating, and every nerve in a high state of tension.
She had been calm enough up to the present, but at
this juncture she and Kate seemed to change placq. r
i" I wish they would be quick," she said; pulling
Kate's sleeve. "The time is flying. It is against the
rules to draw money from the bank after four o'clock
-it wants five minutes to four now. What is that
foolish clerk lingering about ?"
Kate made no answer. She was thinking of
the next train back to the Grange-how soon she
could catch it, how soon she could be by her husband's



<pb n="297"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               297
side again. The thousand pounds did not matter at
all to her. Presently a grave voice spoke in her ear.
She looked up-a grey-haired man of about sixty was
bending towards her.
"How do you do, Mrs. Henley ? " he said. " You
want a somewhat large sum. Will you take it in
gold or notes?"
"Partly gold, partly notes," whispered Mrs. John-
son in Kate's ear.
"I don't really very much care," answered Kate.
I suppose you had better give me part of it in gold."
The grey-haired man was looking her all over.
He observed the pallor of her face, and the heavy
lines under her eyes. He noticed her shaking hand,
her general look of misery. She was also dressed in
a somewhat slovenly way for so rich a lady. It
was a moment before he, replied, then he said
cheerfully-
!"You hadbettertake a hundredpoundsinsovereigns,
and the rest in notes. You could not take away more
gold conveniently--it would be too heavy to carry."
' As you please," answered Kate.
The required sum was made out, and given to
her in a little brown paper parcel, which the manager,
after counting the notes carefully over in her pre-
lence, took the precaution of sealing.
"This is a large sum for a young lady to carry,"
k he said. "Would you like one of my clerks to
- accompany you to the railway station ?"
' Oh no, there is not the slightest need," replied
Kate with a smile. She took the packet, and, as
though it were not of the slightest consequence,
slipped it into her pocket. She did not hear the
manager as he said good evening.



<pb n="298"/>
298          AN ADVENTURESS
As soon as she had left the bank, this man turned
to the clerk who had first drawn his attention to
Kate's case.
"There is something wrong here. You are sure
you have taken the number of all the notes ?" 
"Yes, sir, certainly."
"Well, of course, Mrs. Henley had a right to her
own money, but there is something in the wind which
I do not quite like. Keep the numbers, Hudson, and
now it is time to close."
The moment they got into the street Mrs. John-
son turned to Kate.
If you will let me have that brown paper parcel,"
she said, "I will say good-bye to you. You have
kept your contract, and I shall not trouble you again.
May I see you into a hansom ? "
" Here is your money," said Kate. "Good-bye."
Mrs. Johnson held out her hand. Kate gave her
the parcel. She whipped it into a little bag which
she held in her hand.
"Good-bye," she said, holding out her own hand.
Kate pretended not to see it.
" I will not trouble you to call a hansom for me,"
she said, "I see an omnibus passing which I think will
take me in the direction of Victoria. Good-bye."
Mrs. Johnson walked down the street.
" I have got it," she said to herself, "and I shall
take the precaution to leave London to-night. I didn't
care for that manager's look, and beyond doubt he
has taken the number of the notes, but I know how
to get rid of them, and when all is said and done-
I have come by the money honestly. It is young
Madam who will get into a. scrape-her secret won't
be hers much longer:'

CHAPTER XXX
MEANWHILE, Ethel Hume, having seen Mary com-
fortably established in Russell Square, was finding
her own way home. Ethel was getting quite in-
dependent in these days, and 'she enjoyed her freedom
immensely. She was not sorry to part with Mary.
She loved Mary very much, of course, but her sister's
attitude of late had been extremely puzzling. Mary
was exactly like a person suffering under a delusion,
and although Ethel never for a single moment be-
lieved her wild words and her apparently unfounded
suspicions, yet, nevertheless, she could not help own-
ing to an intense relief at her being away from home
just now.
"And just when darling Kate is in such terrible
trouble," thought the girl. "4 How fearfully she would
be in the way I I wonder how soon Ralph will take
a turn for the better. Oh, of course be won't die;
people don't die in these days when they are young
and strong and can have the best advice and the
best nursing. I shall tell Kate that, when I see
her. Poor dear I I wonder when they will start for
Australia now, and I wonder if father and mother will
allow me to accompany them. Dear, dear Kate, there
is no one like her in all the world; she is the most
beautiful, fascinating, charming girl I have ever met."
Ethel found her train all right, but just as she
was stepping into it she was startled by hearing a



<pb n="300"/>
300          AN ADVENTURESS
voice in her ears-a, familiar voice. She turned and
saw Kate running, panting, down the platform.
" Why, Kitty I" she exclaimed.
"Yes, it is me, Ethel. I know you are greatly
astonished. Oh, let me in. I thought this train had
gone. I am in a fever to be back again with Ralph."
Ethel held out her hand to Kate. The train was
just beginning to move out of the station. An angry
porter shouted out a remonstrance. The door was
slammed behind Kate, and the two girls found them-
selves alone in a first-class compartment. 
Kate flung herself, panting, on the cushions. She
could not speak at all for a. moment. Her face
was ghastly pale. Her hair was in disorder. She
scarcely looked pretty. She was certainly wildly
excited.
" But where have you been " asked the aston-
ished Ethel.
"Listen to me, Ethel." Kate was now recovering
her breath. Ethel bent forward.
"Oh, do close that window.  I cannot speak
with the rattle the train makes."
Ethel lifted up the window in question.
"Now, what is it, Kitty? You do look queer
and wild."
"I am glad I met you. We can go back to the
Grange together. I don't want any one to know that
I have been to town."
i" But is Ralph better ?"
" Better I He is worse, a great deal worse."
"Then have you been up to get a fresh doctor ?"
"I? No !"
Why did you go ?"
" I cannot tell you why, and you must not ask me,



<pb n="301"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               301
and don't tell any one you met me. When is Uncle
Robert likely to be back?"
"He is sure to take an early train, but he is not
in this one and there won't be another for an hour."
" That is all right, Ethel; we'll get out just before
we reach the avenue, and you can go' down in the
trap and I'll walk through the plantation, and you
won't tell any one that you met me; you'll promise,
won't you, dear Ethel ?"
"Of course I will promise, Kitty, but I cannot
understand it."
" I know that. There are a great many things
which you cannot understand just now. Oh, Ethel,
I am so miserable."
"Poor Kitty, poor darling I" said Ethel. She laid
her hand on her cousin's arm. " How hot you are I"
-she said. " I hope you are not getting Ralph's fever."
"-It would be a good thing if I did get it. I wish
I could. I wish typhoid fever was infectious."
" Kate, why do you talk in that wild way ?"
"If you were me you would talk just as wildly. 
I am persecuted and miserable. Mary's manner is
enough to' turn my life into a hell."
" She does not mean it, poor Mary," said Ethel;
" it must be as you think, Kate; her mind .cannot be
right."
"I dare say it is not, but that does not make things
more pleasant for me. She suspects me-she hates
me. It is awful of her, and now that Ralph is so ill."
' Oh, I was going to speak to you about that,"
said Ethel, cheering up at the mention of Ralph's
name. "I feel quite a firm conviction in my mind
that Ralph will recover. He is young and strong, and
strong young men are often frightfully ill for a little,

but they always get better. Yes, Ralph will recover,
and you will be happy, poor Kitty, and if you renew
your invitation perhaps we can go out to Australia in
a month or two and have that delightful time together.
Oh, I am so looking forward to it."
Kate heaved a heavy sigh; she was quite hopeless
at the present moment.
"There's one comfort," she said after a pause.
"Mary has taken herself off. I won't have her angry
suspicious eyes fixed on my face wherever I turn:'
"It is a very good thing for us all," answered
Ethel. " I am as much relieved as you are."
"And you fully believe in me, don't you, Ethel ? 
"Believe in you I" said Ethel with enthusiasm-
"there is no one like you. You don't know how I
love you"'
"You don't thinkthereis anything queer about me ?" 
Ethel looked slightly puzzled.
" It is, perhaps, that you are so charming," she
said then slowly, " and one .of your charms is the sort
of mystery which envelops you; but there is no one
like you, Kitty, and I love you with all my heart."
" Only you suspect me just a little ?" said Kate.
'" No, indeed, I don't."',
"You are greatly wondering why I have gone to
town on the day my husband is so ill ? "
" I won't let myself wonder," said Ethel stoutbg 
Kate now changed her seat and sat close to Ethl.
She slipped her hand inside Ethel's arm and presently
laid her tired head on her shoulder.
" You are one in a thousand," she said. " I love
you, Ethel, with all my heart."
Before the journey came to an end Kate, leaning
against Ethel, was sound asleep.

CHAPTER XXXI
IT was late in the afternoon when Kate re-entered the
house. Ethel-had already arrived, but according to
her promise to her cousin, had said nothing about
having met her. Ethel and her mother were talking
in the drawing-room when Kate slipped softly upstairs.
She turned in the direction of the west wing, which
had been given up absolutely to the requirements of
the sick man. Nurse Bryan was looking out for her.
"Where have you been, madam?" she said.
". Your husband has been extremely ill, and quite wild,
but this last hour he is a little calmer, and has asked
for you. Will you go and sit with him now? Oh,
please, not like that," continued the woman. " Take
off your. hat, and smooth your hair. You must
exercise self-control.. You can sit by the bedside,
if you will not talk; you can hold his hand and look
at him. He loves you very much, madam. He has
been distressed at your nof coming to him."
I will be in the room in a moment," said Kate.
S! ran into her bedroom, quickly smoothed back
h&bhair, changed her outdoor shoes for soft velvet
slippers, and entered the sick-room. She had plenty
of tact, and, now that she had entered the house with-
out any one specially observing her, felt a certain
sense of relief. It was a great comfort, too, to know
that Ralph had asked for her. Perhaps his illness
would be of short duration. Oh, the doctors were
303



<pb n="304"/>
304          AN ADVENTURESS
so often wrong. Perhaps he would be well enough
to go, not on board the Hydra, but on the next boat
which would leave in a week's time.
Kate calculated quickly.  Could she avert dis-
covery for another week ? Would -the precipice on 
which she was standing not crumble away for one 
week longer? She wondered- she doubted- she
knew the extreme, the absolute danger in which she
had placed herself. If only Ralph could be well in a
week. She sat down now, and turned her flushed
face and bright eyes upon him. He was very ill,
but he had lucid moments, and one of these had
come to him. He feebly stretched out his burning
hand and let it lie for a moment in hers.
" Little-little-darling Kitty," he said. The words
dropped from his lips. Kate was not little, but it was
one of his endearing names for her. Her eyes filled
with tears, a great wave of intense affection for the
man whom she had deceived and yet whom she wor-, '
shipped rushed over her.
"Oh, Ralph, get better, get better," she said. She
did not sob, but there was an intensity in her words.
She seemed to infuse strength into the sick man. 'He'
turned his head feebly.
" No talking please, Mrs. Henley," said the nurse,
who was seated by a distant window.
Kate ground her teeth, her lips formed an angry
charming pout. Ralph, ill as he was, gave a feeble
smile.
" Little rebel," he said, then he closed his eyes, and
a moment or two later was rambling off once more
in the world of delirium. Alas, and alas, he was not
better. Kate went up to the nurse.
" Why does. he breathe so quickly?" she said.



<pb n="305"/>
AN ADVENTURESS                30o 5
It seems as if there must. be a great weight on his
chest."
" He is very ill, very ill, madam," said the nurse.
She spoke sternly. She had felt great pity for Mrs.
Henley, but her extraordinary absence, absence for
hours while her hitsbaad's life hung in the.balance,
was too much for the nurse's sense of decorum.
"She does .ot 'ove him; she is so handsome and
wilful that doubtless she has got tired of him," thought
..tap od woman.     , Ihave no patiece with her, and
;.^AR' anice a gentleman as I ever had the nursing of."
iualy tlh       i nurse motioned Kate out of the room.
'.'  Your husband's 'quick breathing distrsses -you,"
she said; "he is suffering extremely. The case points
to the strongest blood-poisoning.  I doubt very much
-if it is typhoid. Anyhow it is a most alarming case'"
"Oh, why do you terrify me ?" said Kate. " Why
do you speak like that ? Is there no hope ? Oh, there
is Dr. Thornton; oh, I am glad to see him 1"
'Dr. Thornton'was coming upstairs. He was ac-
,c.mpanied by the great specialist, Dr. Bennett Shaw.
The nurse bustled about importantly. She Was much
i' eted i' her cases but she would not have been
bhilan if she had not given herself little airs on the
"gret event of a consultation.
"You must not be present, madam," she said;
"the doctors do not wish it. Do you mind staying
in your own bedroom or in this sitting-room until
they come out again ?"
"Don't attempt to order me," said Kate in the
haughtiest voice.
.  "Di' Thornton, I must speak. t9 you."
ii Dr. Thornton and the specialist both entered a
.  ittig-rQpw>o, accompanied by.Kate.

"May I introduce Mrs. Henley ? " said the doctor,
turning to the specialist.
Dr. Bennett Shaw bowed-he was taking Kate in
from head to foot.
"Highly sensitive, nervous, overwrought," was
his quick mental comment  " I hope she won't have
much to do in the sick-room. These sort of women
do no end of mischief in a case of this sort."
i" You are the doctor who has come to see my
husband. You are the great specialist who-who
saves people's lives at the last moment," said Kate.
" Under God, madam, I have sometimes effected
cures," said the doctor; " but come, my time is pre.
cious-I want to see the patient."
" One moment, first. You must save him, or if
there is no hope at all you must tell me the truth. I
will hear the truth-you have got to tell it to me."
"There is no reason why I should not tell the
truth to this lady, is there, Thornton?" said the
specialist.
' None whatever, if she wishes to hear it," replied
Dr. Thornton. 
"' I will wait here until you come out again; I
must know the truth," said Kate.. She turned and
stood with her face to the window. She was looking
out but she did not see anything. She heard the
steps of the doctors dying away in the corridor, she 
heard' them enter the sickroom and shut the door
behind them. Then there came what seemed like an
eternity to the waiting, distracted, anxious woman.
"Oh, of course Ralph would die, of course there
was not the slightest doubt that he would die, and
leave her. I cannot see him die," she said to herself,
"I cannot stand it. When he dies all will be up.

I shall be able to keep the truth to myself no longer .
oh, he must not, he must not die I and yet, and yet I
know he will die. Oh, I saw death on his face, and
the nurse thinks badly of him, and Dr. Thornton
looked very grave, and as to that other man-oh, has
he any feeling a a ll. Oh, I hate him. Why am I
left here so long in suspense ? I shall go mad, I shall
go mad. Inaill the wide world, was there ever such
a wretched, miserable woman as I am I"
:,  - , She fell on her knees; she dug her hands into
:      '   hair,i she pulled it out in handfuls. She struggled
;i     ietiher- feet-she was almost beside herself. Then
"there came a quiet voice in her ears, and Dr. Thorn-
ton stood before her         ' 
"Will you see Bennett Shaw now?" he asked.
- There'was something very quiet and very sorrowful
in his voice, and he avoided meeting her eyes.
-" Yes, I will see him. Why doesn't he come in-
what is he afraid of ?" said Kate.
The specialit entered; he shut the door behind

i.    " Oh, doctor, I know you think the very worst,
but do please tell me the truth," she gasped.
' I have something very painful to tell you,' said
Dr. Shaw. " Your husband is most dangerously ill'.

"Until the morning ? Must he die so soon? He
was quite well forty-eight hours ago."
"It is a quick case of the most aggravated blood

"Oh, say it and have done," said Kate. "You
mean there is no hope ?"
Not quite that, Mrs. Henley, but there is so little
hope that you must be prepared for the worst."
" I may stay with him-you will not send me
away from him ?"
"Nothing that you do can hurt him; he is past
all that. He has already sunk into a comatose con-
dion. Whether he wakes from that state is doubtful,
:  but we are trying a certain remedy, and Dr. Th6rnton 
Will sit up with the patient to-night."

CHAPTER XXXII
*.
KATE refused to go down to dinner. She refused to
see Ethel when she came up and humbly knocked at
her door.
"Let me in, please, Kitty; Kitty darling, do let
me in."
"No, no, you must go away, I cannot see any
one," replied Kate. And Ethel went downstairs again
disconsolate.
Then Mrs. Hume came and knocked at the door.
" Kate, I must see you; open your door at once."
Her voice was not exactly imperative, but it was
pleading. Kate had respect for her years and for
the motherhood -which was in her, and going to the
door unlocked it.
".Well," she said, holding her long arms to her
sides and staring full at her visitor. She was dressed
in black, her face was ghastly pale, her hair was in
disorder.
"Why are you dressed like that? Why do you
look like that?" said Mrs. Hume. "It is unlucky to
put on black, why did you do it?"
,    "Unlucky," said Kate with a wild laugh. "Yes,
I but not more unlucky than I am-than I. shall be.
. ....me in, Mrs. Hume, if you will."
" ;  Mrs. Hume I Why do you call me that ?"
'fAunt. Susannah I mean. Oh, my whole heart
is closed up. The man I love best in all the world is
leaving me-why was I ever born ?"



<pb n="310"/>
310          AN ADVENTURESS
"Poor child, poor child ! sit down, dear Kitty."
Mrs. Hume seated herself in a chair, but Kate did
not sit-she still stood bolt upright.
"It is no use your seeing me," she said, " and Ii
would rather you did not pity me until this thing is
over one way or the other. If he dies I believe I
shall lose my senses."
"Do you indeed love him so passionately, Kate ?"
"Love him ?" said Kate. "Love him ? In all
the world I only love him. I love him well enough
to sin for him. I love hiim well enough to lose all
that I care for on earth and in heaven for him. If
he dies I shall lose my senses."
"We must trust in God-shall we pray to God now ?
Shall we ask Him to spare that most precious life?"
" Pray I" said Kate, with a laugh. "Pray I no,
Mrs. Hume-Aunt Susannah I mean-I cannot pray."
"Your uncle wants to see you for a moment or
two,".said Mrs. Hume. She got up, she was weak and 
trembling. Kate's deiant attitude pained her inexpres- 
sibly. She did not know how to contend with her,
nor what to say. " Will you see your uncle, Kate "
"If he wishes. I am indifferent."
" I will send him up, dear. He has just one or two 
things to say to you; he will not keep you long:'
" I will leave the door unfocked," said Kate, " and
I hope he won't keep me long." 
"I will tell him that you cannot stand much.
Good-night, dear child, even though you cannot pray 
yourself, try and remember that I am praying most 
earnestly for you."
Kate did not even say "thank you."  Mrs. Hume
slowly left the room. A moment or two later Mr.
Hume atoeared.                     .

AN ADVENTURESS               311
"t My dear Katherine," he said, " you know how
I feel for you in this, but I will not trouble you with
words of mere sympathy at present. Even in the
most acute cases favourable symptoms take place,
and one never knows what may or may not occur.
I should recommend you to take a -good sleeping
draught and lie down. You look terribly excited."
"I . sleep when-whe-: Ralph may be dying 1"
said Kate. Her eyes we,  tidi in a fearful manner;
she shook her head.  ^ .
"I will not suggestt again, my dtar. There is
one thing, that in an acutel  of this kind the crisis
must come quickly. We must hope for the best."
Kate made no sign. After a time she said slowly-
"Aunt Susannah said you wished to say some-
thing."
" I do. It is most provoking about those tickets
-I cannot imagine where they are."
" Oh, I cannot discuss them now. My head reels,
I scarcely know what tickets you mean."
"My dear child, it is wrong to trouble you about
these things, but, Kate, I wish you would let me see
your bankbook."
My bank- book I" said Kate, starting back.
"Why?"
"Because it was the arrangement that I was to
overlook it monthly so that all your affairs may be
in absolute order. You have no head for business.
If you have it with you I will take it to the bank to
be made up."
"Just as you please," said Kate. She had absyr
lutely forgotten all about the thousand pounds sh,
had drawn that day.
"I am getting your affairs into order, Kate, and 



<pb n="312"/>
312         AN ADVENTURESS
must have a talk with you when this fearful crisis
is past, as I trust it will, happily. Ah, that is the
book; thank you, my dear."
Mr. Hume opened it. There might be the greatest
catastrophe in the house, but he never could lose his
lawyer-like instinct.
"It has not been made up for three or four
months," he said-- dreadful, dreadfull  My dear
girl, with property like yours this will never do.
Suppose you had the management of your own affairs
-where would you be ? " 
"Where, indeed ? " said Kate with a wan smile.
Suddenly the colour flushed in her cheeks; she
remembered all of a sudden the thousand pounds
which she had drawn that day.
" I know little or nothing about money," she said. 
1 In father's lifetime I had nothing whatever to do
with it. But what do you want the bank-book for ?"
" In order to ascertain what your balance now is.
Just before your marriage I put six thousand pounds
to your credit. Doubtless it is still there intact."
"You want to know how much money I have in
the bank? But surely that is my own affair-?"
"Quite so, my dear, quite so; you may have
spent the whole six thousand and it can scarcely
matter to me, but I wish to kluow how things stand.
But how roused you look I-I am glad to find you
interested in anything."
"I would rather you did not worry about my
money affairs at present," said Kate. "We can talk
over things when Ralph is out of danger."
"Time enough, Certainly."
"Then give me the bank-book." 
" No, now that I have it I will keep it."? 



<pb n="313"/>
AN' ADVENTURESS              313
Mr. Hume nodded to Kate, and before she could
say another word left the room. She stood for a
moment holding her head between her hands. She
was lost in perplexed and terrible thought. 
"If he findsout that yesterday I drew a thousand
pounds from -the bank he will certainly suspect some-
thing," she said to herself. "Oh, how the coils are
tightening round me; what shall I do ? I wonder if
I can keep my senses. Mother was right. My crime
has brought me no happiness. Oh, is there on God's
earth a more miserable woman ? "
She stood trying hard to think for a few moments;
a hand was laid on her shoulder, she turned round.
Marryat had come in with a little tray on which was a
cup of strong and delicious soup.
"You must drink this, my dear," she said in a
kindly motherly; way. The tone of the woman's
voice awoke a feeling in the.wretched girl's breast
which could not -be restrained. She held out her
hand for the soup.:
" Oh, give ii to me, Marryat," she said; "sit
down and feed me. Treat me as if I were a baby.
Marryat, I am so miserable."
Poor child, poor child I but we must hope for
the best."'
Marryat, do you really think he will die ?"
." Dear heart, how can I tell ? But they do say that
a magpie came three times to the window of his room
to-day, and that is a bad sign, as you know, and a
white pigeon flew into the room when we opened the
window wide-that's another bad sign, and- "
Marryat, if you say any more I shall scream,"
"' ve must hope for the best," said Marryat in a
grave voice, "but it's a very bad case. But there, I



<pb n="314"/>
. 314            AN ADVENTURESS
have heard of :as bad before and the patient has got
well. It don't seem as if everything ought to crush
you, Mrs. Henley, such love as you feel for your
husband. Perhaps God Almighty will be merciful."
"Do you think He will? Do you think God will
really spare him? Would it be any good if you,
Marryat, prayed for him ?"
"Could not you pray yourself, my dear young
lady ?"
"I cannot."
"Well, drink your soup."  Marryat was watching
her with curious eyes.
"She is desperate," she said to herself; "if I play
my cards well to-night she will tell me everything.
She shall, she must confide in me. I am sorry for
her, but the time has come when I must know all,
*   and then I will decide how best to act."
Kate drank the soup and was slightly refreshed.
"What a mess your hair is in I" said Marryat;
" you must let me brush it for you, and what in the
name of fortune have you put on that black dress for ?
It don't suit you a bit, Mrs Henley." 
"I like it," said Kate; "it is soft and it makes no
noise. It is the sort of dress that a poor woman
would wear, is it not, Marryat "
"Well, my dear, you are not a poor woman, so
why should you wear it ? You are one of the richest
and most spoiled young ladies I have ever come
across, but wear black to-night you shan't, and off
this must comelt"
·  "What shaltl wear ?" said the girl, submitting 0to
Marryat's ministrations as she would submit to.-o.
one else at that moment. 
"Here's a pretty blue dress, soft and clinginmj  t



<pb n="315"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               3I5
will make no noise, and will be a bit of brightness,
should your husband want to see you. Now we will
put it on, and I'll get you some hot water, and after
you have washed, and have got on this dress, you
will feel much refreshed."
So Marryat ministered to Kate. She took off the
ugly black dress and brushed the long, lovely hair,
put on the blue dress, and then made her mistress lie
on the aofL.
N.' ow, then, perhaps you can sleep," said the
woman, "but first of all, I will go and ask Nurse
.Bryan what the news is."
The news from the sick-room was not reassuring.
The two nurses did not go to bed that night, and Dr.
Thornton had already taken his place in the ante-
room.
"How is Mrs. Henley?" he asked, as Marryat
was tripping back to her mistress.
" Very bad indeed, sir; quite distracted."
" Ah, poor young lady! Is she likely to come to
see your master during the night ?"
"It is impossible for'me to say, sir, what whim
my mistress will take. She is a young lady with
curious impulses; I don't know whether she will, or
not."
"I wish you -could get her to bed, and to sleep."
'  It would be rather awful, sir, if she woke up
and heard that her husband was dead."
"Whether she wakes or not makes very little
'difference. I cannot conceal the truth from you.
:Mr. Henley is not likely to see the night out."
5t½u, E.arryat went back to Kate with a very grave
:.-You must get into bed, my dear," she said; i I

3I6          AN ADVENTURESS
shall not treat you, at a time like the present, as if
you were my mistress. You just want some one to
order you a bit, and you have got to obey me.
Whether you like it or not, you are in my power,
for I know too many things about you, but I ain't
going to be hard. I'll cling to you through thick
and thin, but get into bed you must."
How-how is he ?" said Kate.
"Well, there is no change at present. Every-
thing is being done that can be done, Dr. Thornton
is there, and both the nurses are sitting up. Now 
then, Mrs. Henley, you cannot keep your eyes open
another moment. I will undress you, and put you
to bed."
" As you please," said Kate.  It was true she
could not hlM out much longer. Marryat undressed
her and put her into bed.
" Now then, I will sit by you until you sleep.
Oh yes, you will drop off soon enough. You're fair
dead with fatigue."
Kate shook her head. Like many another; she 
thought that sleep would not visit her. In reality she
had dropped into profound slumber in less than five
minutes. When she awoke again, she had a curious4
puzzled sensation. She raised her head, then full con-
sciousness returned to her. Marryat was lying on the
sofa, sound asleep.  There was a night-light in a
corner of the room. Kate struck a match, and looked
at the hour. It was between three and four in the
morning. What a long, long sleep she had had I She
felt quite refreshed, and her brain cleared, but the
tortures of her mental state became so acute, that she
could not lie still another moment. She rose very
softly. She did not want to awaken Marryat, but she

must find out somehow how her husband was. She
put on a dressing-gown, and stole from the room.
There was a light in the passage. Kate crossed the
landing, and entered the ante-room which led into her
husband's bedroom, and softly stood on the threshold
of the sick-room itsodf. W   it a death-room ? Was
there a living man still feeBy struggling with death, or
had he already succumbed in the dire conflict ?
Kate approached the bedside, a hand was laid on
her arm, she did not scream 4ut she turned swiftly
round. Dr. Thornton waslooking at her.
"You must go away," he said. He led, her out
of the room.
t What is the matter ? " she asked, " is he worse ?"
"There is not the slightest hope, Mrs. Henley."
"No hope?" said Kate. The wools dropped
slowly, her lips seemed to freeze. She thought her
heart would stop beating, then suddenly there came
over her a strange coolness,'and a curious knowledge
of her own imminent danger. Instead of thinking
only of her husband at this crucial and awful moment
she thought first of herself.
" He will die ? " she said.
The doctor bowed his head.
tS "We have done all that man can do," he said,
"the crisis is very near."
"The crisis, you mean his death is very near ?"
"He may die at any moment."
"Is he still alive ?"
" Yes."
"I must see him while he lives. I never could
bear, to look at a dead person; I must see him while

"If you will promise to make no sound, not that it
greatly'matters, but still one must give every chance."·
"I will make no sound, I promise."
They re-entered the sick-room together, they stood
close by the bed.
" I cannot see his face," whispered poor Kate.
The doctor calmly lit a candle and brought it over
to the bedside. He let the light fall fullt opo  the
sunken features. Kate could scarcely recdfiIt"  her
own husband. There was an immense chaegil-iim.
"Would he-would he wake if I kissed      ce
again?" she asked.
"( No, no, he is past that," said the man~ . ence.
Kate bent forwards. Her lips touched tfctfmmy
forehead of the dying man. She kissed-him 4oitwice.t
"It is Kitty saying good-bye," she whispered to
the ear that could not hearken to her words, and then
she left the room. She went straight back to Marryat.
Marryat was sound asleep. Kate shook her forcibly.
"Get up, Marryat," she said, "get up, f want you."'
"What is it, Mrs. Henley? oh what is the matter?
'A is Mr. Henley worse ?"
"I have said good-bye to him, I shall never see
"   him again. I cannot be in the house when he is dead.
I am going, Marryat; will you come with me me
" Where?" asked the maid.
"Away, away from here. Come with me, Marryat;
we will go to Australia. Thursday has dawned, and
the Hydra sails to-day. I have got the tickets, I kept
them back on purpose; you and I will take the berths,
and we will go away over the waters. Come quickly,
Marryat."
Kate laughed in her intense feverish excitement.
Marryat paused.

"Shall I go ? " she said to herself. " Poor child,
she will soon be traced and found, but after all I must
get her secret from her. Yes, I will go away with
her, I will take her to London, to a place I know,
and then she Will confide in me fully."
" Yes, Mrs. Henley," she said aloud, ".I will come.
Sit down, my dear, do not exhaust yourself overmuch.
Try and keep calmi, we will slip away together."

CHAPTER XXXIII
MRS. HENLEY and Marryat stole softly from  the 
Grange under shadow of the darkness. Kate felt as
if she were fleeing from Death himself; she might 
even meet his grim form on the threshold-even now
he might be entering the house to carry her husband
away. She was possessed by a mad fear in which
all natural feeling was forgotten, or overcome. Her
terror was so great that she was doing unconsciously
the very worst thing for herself; she was drawing
down suspicion upon her own actions in a way she
ihad never done before; she was letting the reins loose,
sie was letting herself go.
Marryat, however, had no intention of allowing,
herself to go; she had all her wits about her; she
knew a house where she could take Kate, and as soon
as they reached London Marryat conveyed her mis-
tress in a cab to the house of a friend of hers in Great
Marlborough Street. This woman, a Mrs. Cunliffe, let
lodgings. She had known Marryat for a long time,
and a few hurried words which the maid spoke put
hae sufficiently into possession of facts to cause her
to bustle about and make herself agreeable.
"Poor young lady I" she said, " I quite under-
stand; there's no one occupying the drawing-room
floor now, Miss Marryat."
' Have a fire lighted," said Marryat in a deter-
mined voice: "the lady is very tired and will want
ago



<pb n="321"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               32I
some breakfast." She took Kate upstairs. Thedraw-
ing-room floor was well furnished in the true lodging-
house style. There were two rooms, one opening
with folding doors into the other. Marryat conducted
her mistress into the front drawing-room, sjiut the
folding doors, and then proceeded to take off Kate's
boots and to-warm her frozen feet.
"Now, my love, you shall have your tea; and
afterwards you will lie down and I will hold your
haods," said Marryat; " you must confide in me now,
my dear, I am all you have left. You have given up
everybody else, but your Mtrryat will be faithful to
you. Now, shut your weary eyes and go off into a
bit of a sleep."
Kate was so dazed that she was glad even to be
guided by Marryat. All her old spirit and defiance
had left her. She felt like a hunted thing torn by
hundreds of-futies.     .
" Is it to-day the Hydra sails ?' she asked, anmhee
raised herself on her elbow and fixed her eye 'on   '
Marryat's face. 
" At two o'clock," said Marryat--" between two
and three to-day the Hydra sails-at least so I am told."
"You and I will go in her, our berths are taken,"
said the girl.
Just as you please, dear madam. Now, here is
your tea.  Thank you, Mrs. Cunliffe, this is just
what we wanted."
Curious Mrs. Cunliffe had brought up the tea her-
self and stared full at Kate, who, notwithstanding her
sorrow, her disarranged locks, and her untidy dress,
still bgre traces of some of the most remarkable
beauty the good woman had ever seen.
: "Well,-to be sure, she's quite a picter," she ex-



<pb n="322"/>
322          AN ADVENTURESS
claimed, throwing up her hands and apostrophising -
Kate's recumbent figure.
Marryat motioned to her to leave the room.
"I have no notion of Cunliffe sharing in this
thing," she thought. "It will be me and my mistress
against the world from this out. Well, I believe we
can defy the world, that I do."
Accordingly, when her mistress had taken what
tea she could, and even had tried to swallow a spoonful
of some Brand's Essence which the landlady hap-
pened to have in the house, the maid sat down and
made a hearty breakfast herself. She drank a couple
of-cups of tea and ate some poached eggs and bacon.
This meal made Marryat feel quite refreshed. She
then went and faced her mistress. 
4"And now, my dear," she said, "the time has
come for full confidence."
"For what ? " said Kate. She was lying on the
sofa with.her eyes half closed, "for full what ?"
"Confidence, dearie-the reposing of that secret
which worrits and frets you almost past enduring, in
the breast of your faithful Marryat. Ah, my dear, 
there's no one will be truer to you than I'll be, but 
you must tell me all, that you must, my love:'
Kate gazed at her at first vacantly, then her eyes 
brightened-a gleam even of her old sunshiny, cheer-i
ful humour twinkled in the depths . her dark eyes. 
She sat up on her elbow.
"And you really thinkn.--" she began.
"I think, dear, that either you or Miss Mary
Hume is to be my mistress in the future, and- the
one who pays me best is to be chosen. I have got
the choice. Remember, I can tell thib   about you,
Mrs. Henley, which, joined to Miss Hme's suspicons- .  *



<pb n="323"/>
AN ADVENTURESS              323
will make uncertainty certainty. There is a secret
beyond doubt. You can confide in me or you need
not; it all rests with yorself."
"And suppoa. t do confide in you," said Kate;
"supposing I dqAihat will you expect ?"
" I will expex   my love, that you will provide for
me hanonfely0 out of that fortune which doubtless,
darling, 'ui have no right to possess."
" Now, what can you mean ?" said Kate, taken
I      f her guard by Marryat's words.  In truth, the
l 'i9oman had shot a bow at a venture.
"Ah," thought Marryat, "that went home.  I
was right so far. I think I will name a big sum--in
for a penny, in for a pound."
" Well, darling, if I can see you through this I'll
expect to be a rich woman. You don't object, do
you "
"I will make you comfortable, but I am too
distracted and wretched to think out any plans at
present," said Kate. " It is impossible that I should
relly confide in you, Marryat."
"WNonsese, my lOve, you don't stir from this
room until I know all I have but to telegraph to
Mr. Hume to the Grange and he will come here,
and I have but to telegraph to Miss Mary Hume in
Russell Square and she will come here, and it is only
to say what I have observed with my own eyes, that
funny little woman who came to see you yesterday,
and all the rest. There are a few things I have got
to say, and I will say them, love. You have but to
uhose, I will be faithful to you if you are faithful to
mne; but not otherwise."

"It means that I am to know everything, my
darling."
"I wish you would not call me your darling.
Why you treat me as if-as if we were in the same
walk of life."
"Which we very much are, surely, dear, only I
don't hold any disgraceful secret, and have done
nothing that I could be ashamed of. If you were
not ashamed of something you had done you would 
not act in the queer way you are now doing, and
with your poor husband, so to speak, on the brink of
the grave, if indeed he has not crossed the gulf; it
is certain sure that he can do nothing for you
now."
"Oh, my Ralph, my Ralph I" said the miserable
girl. "Oh, I have left you, left you when you were
so ill. Oh, Marryat, what must they think of me at
the Grange ? I think I will go back."
Too late now; you have got to tell," said Marryat.
She stood in front of Kate, her eyes grew large and
big. It seemed to the tired excited girl that Marryafs
whole frame developed and strengthened in power.
"Oh, what shall I do ? " she said with a little gasp.
"Just do what I tell you and all will be well,"
said Marryat. "Now, that's right, lie back and you'll
whisper it to me."
" But I cannot, I cannot. If you told again I-I
should be ruined."
"' I will never tell while you pay me enough," said
Marryat.
Kate hesitated. After all, should she tell? It '
would be a relief to impart that -secret to another,
and Marryat of all people under, the sun was the
least likely to betray her.:- Kate was sure to be a

better mistress to her, to pay her more than Mary
Hume would.
Mary Hume was all for justice being done. If
Marryat helped her to discover her secret she would
pay her something but not a great deal, not more
than she could possibly help. Kate lay and thought.
The words were almost trembling on her lips. Sud-
denly, however, a complete revulsion of feeling came
over her, she started suddenly to her feet.
" I cannot and will not tell you at present," she
said. " But I will do this. When we are safe on board
the Hydra, far away from England on our way to
Australia, then I will tell you, but not before. You
may do your worst, you may telegraph to my uncle
and Mary Hume, I can scarcely be more wretched
than I am, but I will not tell you that which troubles
me until we are safe on board and out at sea."
Marryat looked at her mistress for some time.
"And you'll faithfully promise to tell me then ?"
"Yes, I will faithfully promise."
' And you'll give me something to make it worth
my while to go with you ?"
, Oh, what do you mean ?"
"A hundred pounds will do," said Marryat, " a
hundred pounds in my pocket and all expenses paid,
and I to make my own special terms when I know
your secret."
"Very well."
" Then we had best go straight to the bank," said
Marryat, "that is, as soon as it opens. You'll want
to draw money to take away with you, my dear, and
you'll want me to Uelp you. I thought of your cheque-
book when you were in such a state yesterday, and I
have brought it with me. If you like I'll go straight



<pb n="326"/>
OK6           AN ADVENTURESS
to the bank and draw the money for you. How much
will you want?"
"Oh, I scarcely dare to draw very much, for I
took a big sum yesterday."
"But you will want at least a thousand pounds,"
say Marryat in a determined voice, "and for that
matter you might as well have two or three thousand,
if you are going to Australia. You will want your
money; don't you see that you will ? "
"I suppose I shall. Oh, I don't know what to
do. I suppose they would send it to me afterwards."
"I will manage it," said Marryat. "You just 
give me a cheque for three thousand pounds-that
will leave a fair balance, and then if the worst comes
to the worst you and I can enjoy ourselves in Aus-
tralia.  It strikes me, my pretty lady, that secret
of yours will get out whether you wish it or not
bifore long, and you and I may as well be away
with our three thousand pounds."
"Oh, I wish I might die, I wish my miserable life
might end," said poor Kate.
"It's no good your wishing, dear. As you made 
"   your bed so you must lie on it. Now then, just fill :
in a cheque for the money, and I'll go and fetch it
and come back to take you to Tilbury."

CHAPTER XXXIV
As Marryat spoke she approached the centre table and
opening a bag produced Kate's cheque-book. She
tore a cheque away from its counterfoil and brought
it to her mistress with pen, ink, and blotting-paper.
"Now then, dear," she said, " fill in. Why, poor
love, you are not fit for anything, I never saw any
one so washed out and worn:'
Kate indeed was almost past listening to Marryat.
All this talk about money, money, cheques, cheques,
seemed to go in at one ear and out at the other.
What was happening to her ? What was the matter ?
Where was she? Back again at Mentone with the
girl whom she loved, and who was dying-the girl
whose name she took, whose fortune she took, whose
personality she took ? Or was she at Mentone before
'se had ever heard of that girl, and her mother was
poor and in trouble, and the handsome, badly fed,
badly dressed girl scarcely knew what to do with her-
self ? Or was she in the first blush of her success
in London and Ralph by her side-he was telling
her how very much he loved her ? Or was she at his
house at Castellis and the first grey fears were be-
ginning to assail her, or was she by his death-bed
leaning over him, listening to his hurried breathing,
terrified at the thought that at any moment that
breathing would stop ? She uttered a sharp cry.  -
"What is it, Mrs. Henley, what is it?"
a37



<pb n="328"/>
...8        AN ADVENTURESS
"Nothing, nothing, only for God's sake tell me
what I am to do, and leave me alone."
" Write your name here, dear, and I won't trouble
you further."
Kate took up a pen and filled in the cheque,
writing her name, " Kate Henley," in large characters
at the foot.
Marryat took the cheque tenderly, blotted it with
skill, and slipped it into her own purse.  -
" Now, my dear," she said, "you will go to sleep. 
I will draw down the blinds.  Rest assured that
nothing can happen to you here. I will tell the lamni :
lady-that you are not going to see a soul, and I lil 
be back as soon as possible. There's not much time
to lose if we are to be on board the Hydra to-day at 
two o'clock."      .
Kate made no response. Already she was back
in that queer dream-world where things were cloudy
and unreal and phantom-like. She heard Marryat
bustling about the room,and was glad when she finally
departed, closing the door softly after her.
Meanwhile, Marryat in her own room took the       ;
signed cheque, looked at it with covetous eyes, and 
went off to the bank. She arrived there soon after it'
was opened; the place was not very full and the
clerks were sufficiently unemployed to stare at her.
She went up to one of them and gaed him to cash
the cheque.
"I want it in notes and gold," sie said-" not too
much gold, for it would be heavy to carry, and be as 
quick as you can, for I must hurryback to my mistress."
The cheque being for such a large sum-the man
went away and consultdd one of his chiefs. No diffi-
culty was made. Maryatfs storywas perfectly skit- ::.

forward, and the money was handed to her. She put 
it into a small bag clasped it tightly to her side, and was
about to leave the bank when she suddenly found her-
self face to face with no less a person than Mary Hume.
"Well, Marryaf?" said Miss Mary Hume. She
was entering the bank just as Marryat was going out.
"Yes, Mis I hope I find you well," said Marryat,
by no mean:cfisoncerted, although the colour had
come into her cheeks for a moment and then faded.
" You find me quite well," replied Mary. "Don't
waste time talking about my appearance. I want to
cash five pounds; come back with me white I am doing
my business, I have one or two questions to ask you." 
" Oh, Miss, you'll excuse me, but I really cannot
wait. I have got to go back to my mistress at once."
"It is impossible that Mrs. Henley can be in a
hurry for you just now. I will not let you go-I shall
make a fuss. Here, come back with me." Mary laid
her hand authoritatively on Marryat's arm.  She
drew her back into the bank.
.:  2 IIt did not take long to get her five pounds cashed.

. :" - You also have been drawing money," she said,
" and doubtless for a larger sum."
"A slightly :arger sum," replied Marryat in a
dubious, carefully modulated voice.
"You are still altogether on the side of Mrs.
Henley? "
" Of course I am on the side of that dear, wronged,
d d innocent lady."
:'t" And how is Mr. Henley-is he still alive?"
" When I left home he was very ill indeed," replied -
Marryat,   I won't tell her any more," thought the

'   330          AN ADVENTURESS
woman. " I have got three thousand pounds of Mrs.
Henley's, and it will be a long time before Miss Mary
Hume could supply me with an equal sum of money.
For the present I am altogether on the side of Mrs.
Henley-altogether on her side. I must get rid of
Miss Hume, and as quickly as possible."
" Well, Miss," she said, "what else have you to say ?"
"I am going in a hansom as far as Russell Square,"
said Mary. "After attending to one or two small
matters there I am going down to the Grange, as I
want to see Ethel and my father. You may as well
come back with me by the same train."
i" No, Miss, I could not possibly do that. I must
return to the Grange by the very next train."
" There won't be a train until half-past eleven, and
it is half-past ten now," said Mary. "You do no
good by not coming with me.' I insist upon your
doing so."
"And I insist upon having my own way, Miss. I
am not your servant and I won't be ordered by you.
There, Miss, that will do, I'm in a hurry, -I have 
different things to transact for my mistress."
Marryat suddenly slipped her hand from Mary's 
arm, and the next'moment had turned down a side
street and disappeared.
" Now what does this mean ? " thought the angry
girl. " She was drawing a large sum from the bank,
she had a packet in her hand, and she ceinly looked
confused when she saw me. She was here on Kate's
business. I wonder what I shall discover when I go 
back to the Grange. I wish I had not let her'go. |
Well, anyhow, I shall take the half-past eleven home; . :'
I told Aunt Maud to expect me back when she saw me. 
I am more certain than ever that we are on the eve  i



<pb n="331"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               331
of a terrible idfteent, and I cannot rest until I learn
myself the tidings at the Grange. It is very odd
Marryat being in London, and at so early an' hour
in the morning. :It seems like a sort of Providence
my meeting her." 
Accordingly, Mary, pleased at being able to act,
and act quickly, got into her hansom and drove straight
to Russell Square.
Well," said her aunt when she saw her, " have
you heard from the Grange yet "
"'No, and I am so anxious at not hearing that I
am going down there at once," said Marj* .
"I would not do that if I were you, dear, said
the good lady.    You will find yourself rather in
the way."
" In the way or not it is my home, Aunt Maud,
and I am going back just to see how things are," re-
plied Mary. " I may or may not return to dinner.
Don't wait meals for me. I can have a cup of tea
whenever I come in, I suppose ? "
" Certainly," was Mrs. Stirling's reply.
J;ary took another hansom and drove to the
raitayj station. She was just in time to catch
hertaLh, but there was no sign of Marryat at the
stabij
'*i  she hasnot taken this train. How queer it
all is I" thought'Mary. She sat back in her carriage.
She was not filled with sorrow with regard to Ralph,
although she had known him all her life. Every
facalty of her mind, every power within her, was ab-
sorbed in one thing. Was she or was she not on the
iew'of a discovery which would prove Kate Henley to
S '1-i: an adventuress-an impostor?  If so, she and
Ethel were rich beyond their wildest dreams. The



<pb n="332"/>
33           AN ADVENTURESS
thought of all the money that might be hers, that in
all probability was hers, filled Mary's soul with the
most curious, terrible, overweening sense of avarice.
She was an affectionate girl by nature, she could love
well and truly those who really happened to suit her
or took her fancy. At school she had been a good
girl, working industriously, striving to get to the head
of her class, but now everything was altered, all her
nature seemed turned upside down. She was in the
mood to be cruel, to be hard, to be unjust.
The train drew up at the wayside station nearest
to the Grange, and Mary got out. There was no cab
waiting and no carriage from the Grange, as she had
not announced her intended visit, but it did not take
her long to walk the two miles from the station, and
she arrived at the house just before lunch. Mrs. 
Hume was crossing the wide hall when she was sud--
denly startled by feeling Mary's hand on her arm.
She turned round in some perplexity. When she 
saw her daughter, and caught a glimpse of her face,
she started and changed colour.                  -
"What is it, Mary ? Oh, I beseech of you, don't
talk too loudly." 
! How is he ? "said Mary. " Is he still alive ? " 
" He is, and the strange thing is he is a little
better," said Mrs. Hume.
. "Why should not he be better ?"
"Oh, my dear, if you had been here last night
and this morning you would not ask that question. 
The doctor gave him up I he thought there was not
the ghost of a chance for him. All last night he sat 
up with him expecting him to breathe his last every  i I
moment, but between five and six o'clock the crisis  :  |
came. He fell asleep and slept for a couple of hours;  ' i

he is, of course, still in great danger, but certainly
slightly on the mend. If nothing adverse occurs,
nothing to worry him, he may revive."
"What should worry him? He has every care.
This whole house has been turned topsy-turvy for his
benefit," said Mary in a bitter tone.
" Mary, I cannot understand you. Don't you
even love our poor dear Ralph ?"
" Oh yes, I am fond enough of Ralph, but when
I see a man making such an arrant, absolute fool of
himself I cannot quite admire him," said Mary. " But
that is neither here nor there. He has every comfort.
Why do you speak in that despairing tone ?"
"I am in great trouble, and so is your uncle-
and so for that matter is the doctor. We do not
know what to think."
"What about?" asked Mary.
" It is Kate."
" Kate, what of her?" Mary grasped her mother's
arm so tightly that Mrs. Hume pulled herself away. 
"Don't, child, don't," she said. "Mary, you hurt
me."
" Oh, mother, you know I don't mean to do that,"
said Mary in a softer tone. " But come in here and 
tell me. Kate-what about her ?"
"Well, Ralph is asleep now, but he has been
asking for her. She ought to be present. The
slightest agitation just now may have a fatal effect.
We don't know where Kate is."
"You-don't-know-where-Kate-is ?" re-
peated Mary slowly, pausing between each word,
her dark eyes lit up with a fierce light. "You don't
know where Kate is-but surely she is heret"
"That's just it; she is not here. She must have

left here early this morning, but we know nothing
about her. She and Marryat have both gone."
"Gone I Oh, surely they will be back .any
moment. I thought Marryat was coming back by this
train with me. Perhaps she has already arrived."
I fear not, child, but I will ring and inquire." 
Mrs. Hume approached the bell, rang it, and 
when the servant appeared inquired if Marryat had
come back.
"No, ma'am," was the reply. "Neither Mrs.
Henley nor Marryat have yet returned."
"Then they will come by the next train," said ' 
Mary. " There is no use worrying about them."
" Yes, but there is, for they have evidently gone
away with some sort of design, and Ralph's chance
of life depends on his wife being rith him. He has
asked for her twice already, and only that he is so
overpowered by the effects of his illness, mischief

MARRYAT went straight back to Kate.
"I have got the money," she said. "I have got
it here; it is a small parcel to mean so much wealth,
is it not:!' And as Marryat spoke she laid the
neatly folded paper parcel on the table. 
Kate had been dozing. She had gone through
so much that, notwithstanding her present misery,
sleep had overpowered her. But she started up now .
with a wild light in her eyes.
"Yes," she said, "the money I What about it-" 
" Don't you remember, dear madam. Now rouse
yourself, poor dear; we can talk over things quietly
when we get on board."
" On board ? Where ? " asked Kate.
"Where, child? On board the Hydra, of course.
Are you dreaming   What is it, Mrs. Henley ?"
"I do not know, I feel confused," said Kate. "I I
- do not seem to remember anything. Where is Ralph ?
If we are going on board the Hyda Ralph ought to be
here. Where is he ?"
"But don't you know anything " said Marryat. 
She went straight up to the bewildered-looking girl and
taking her by her two shoulders shook her. " Can't
you remember ? Do pull yourself together."
"Yes, yes," said Kate. She passed her hand
across her eyes. "I am dazed," she said. "Things
are beginning to come back. I am running away;
that's it, is it not, Marryat ?"

" Yes, dear, that is just.it, but only say those words
to me."
" Yes, Marryat, only to you, I am running away."
' And I am going with you, dear, and we have
three thousand pounds in that little parcel. You had
best let me manage things for the present, that is until
we have steamed out of the Channel. Now then, dear,
now then, do rouse yourself. We will take a cab and 
go to Fenchurch Street, and take the train for Tilbury
at once. That will be our best course.' There is no
use in delaying, and mischief might follow."
"What mischief ? Is there any danger ? " asked
Kate, still in that vacant stunned sort of voice. 
"Well," answered Marryat briskly, trying to con-
trol her temper, for Kate's present mood exasperated
the poor woman almost beyond her endurance. " I
striks me there's a deal of mischief; there's Miss Mary
Hume watching and spying, and thinking, and. sus-
pecting, and I met her at the bank, my dear-at your
bank-and she wanted me to go back to the Grange
with her. What is it now, Mrs. Henley? How queer. 
you are-white as death one minute, red as a rose the  |
next. I declare, I declare, the trouble this affair is /
giving me, the palpitations, the uneasiness, make it
scarcely worth going on with. The game isn't worth 
the candle. Now then, dear, what is it ?"
/  ^   < "Only that I remember," said Kate. "Yes, we I

"That I do not know, love. I have not heard."

-he was going back to hit God. In one way, Marryat,
you know it is a relief. He will never reproach me
now, never, but in another way it is a horror beyond
all endurance, so I shall go, and you will come with
me. Yes, I will go at once."
"That is right, my dear, that is right. I bought
a bottle of brandy on my way back, a small bottle,
and you shall have a little mixed in water before you
i start."
" No, I could not touch it," said Kate. She turned
away shuddering. Marryat, however, insisted. She
made some weak brandy and water, and held it before
her mistress's lips.
"Now drink it up, dear. I know you h*. all
intoxicants, but the more reason you should h tve t
now. It will pull you together wonderfully."
"Hark I" said Kate, holding up her hand, "are-
not those bells tolling. Are the bells near the Grange-
tolling on account of my Ralph ?"
"Dear heart, how fanciful you arel as if you
could hear the bells of the Grange Church here I
Dear, dear heart, the sooner you are out of this the
better."
Kate drank off the brandy and water, and put down
the glass with a hand which trembled. The next
moment, however, the spirit had taken'effect, and she
walked across the room. Marryat followed her.
"You will put on your hat now, love. Here, let
p. arrange it for you. What is the good of being
maid, faithful, fond, devoted maid to a dear young lady,
if I cannot do what she wants ? I am going to wash
your face and hands, and you'll feel much more chirpy.
There's a bedroom here; we'll go in. Yes, and I'll
dress your hair over again; you don't know how

refreshed you'll be. Then, if we go to the Hydra, we'll
just be in time to take possession of that very pleasant
four-berth cabin before anybody comes looking for us:'
"Oh, could anybody come and look for us?  If
so_? ?"
" No, love, they could not; I have managed that;
not time enough, dear. Otherwise Miss Mary Hume
would have her finger in this pie as well as all the 
other pies where you are concerned. That's all right,
dear, now then."
Kate allowed herself to be led into the adjoining
room. She came out again in a quarter of an hour
considerably refreshed.  Her glossy beautiful hair
was well arranged, her hat was put on straight, her
veil was tied, she was drawing on a pair of new
gloves which Marryat had provided.
A moment later the two young women had left
the lodgings and were driving in a hansom to Fen.
church Street. When they got there they took the
next train to Tilbury, and about one o'clock that day
Kate and Marryat were on board the Hydra.
" She will sail in an hour ?" said Marryat, turning 
to one of the sailors who stood near.
"Yes," he answered, "sharp at two. Are you 4
expecting any friends on board ? "
" No and yes," said Marryat. " I will just stand
near the gangway and watch."
"And will that pretty young lady, your mistress,
like to watch, too ?" asked the Jack Tar, surveying
Marryat with a curious expression-half of wonder,
half of admiration.
"No, no, my pretty young lady is going to lie
down. She is not very well," said Marryat. She
had already conducted Kate to her cabin; Kate stood



<pb n="339"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               339
there with clasped hadds. She gazed out at the little
porthole window.  She could see the shore-she
could see the people hurrying towards the great liner.
She could hear voices, troubled voices, melancholy
voices, and business-like voices on deck. There was
the tramp of feet, there was the hurry which is always
incidental to the start of a steamer on one of its long
voyages. Kate felt apart from it all, and yet there
was a curious sense of relief.
"When we leave England the danger must be
past," she thought, "and I shall never, never see
Ralph's dead face. That is the thing that I cannot
bear-that is the last, last straw." Then she sank
down on the side of her berth. The cabin was a
very roomy one; only the two lower berths were
arranged for occupation, the upper berths not being
required. Kate gazed vacantly round her. A few
days ago she had thought that she and Ralph would
be here; now Ralph was gone from her for ever.
She wondered she felt it so little, and yet she knew
that it was breaking her heart, and that nothing else
really mattered. The knowledge of all that discovery
meant no longer troubled her.
Marryat came down once or twice to look at her
mistress.
"It's all going splendidly," she said. " We'll be
off in no time, and then, my dear, you can cast your
care from you like a mantle." 
Kate looked at her. 
}    "I hear those bells still," she said. "They haunt
me."
' "What bells, dear, what bells ?"
" "The church bells, they're tolling. Ralph was 
very young to die, was he not, Marryat ? "

" Oh, my love, it is most bitter sorrowful, but you
must keep up your courage for the present. There
are no bells, dear, it is all imagination. Now I must 
go back again to my watching, for there's no saying
what that Miss Mary Hume might do, but I do truly
think she has no time."
Kate scarcely responded. She rose restlessly.
Again her eyes sought the narrow view which she
alone could see from the porthole.
The stewardess.bustled in to know if she could
do anything for the new passenger. Marryat turned
round sharply.
" Thank you, Mrs. Seymour," she said-she had
already discovered the woman's name-" I am lady's-
'maid to this dear lady, and will look after her during
the voyage."
"Then my services won't be specially required,"
said Mrs. Seymour, "but if you do want anything,
madam     " she looked from Kate to Marryat and
from Marryat to Kate again-
"This lady's name is Mrs. Henley, and I am Miss
Marryat," replied the maid with a toss of her head.
" Now then, Mrs. Henley, I will leave you."
She turned once more to her post by the gangway. 4
The stewardess lingered for a moment.
"You don't look well, madam," she said to
Kate.
" It is the noise in my head," replied Kate. She
put up her hand to her forehead.
"Dear, dear, you are very poorly,". said Mrs.
Seymour, gazing at the lovely face with undisguised
admiration and a certain sense of pity.
"It's the bells," continued Kate, "they keep on
ringing, ringing, ringing."

"What bells, madam? There are no bells ringing
near here."
"Oh no, they are not these bells, they come from
a good way off, from my home; it is the bells that
ring because my husband is dead."
" Dear heart, queer' in the' head," thought Mrs.
Seymour. She said something soothing and presently
left Kate.
Sharp at two o'clock the Hydra weighed anchor
and steamed slowly down the river.

CHAPTER XXXVI
MARY determined not to return to her aunt, Mrs.
Stirling. She felt more assured than ever that things 
were cEa'g to a real crisis. She was very proud of
her discrimination. A fiendish sense of cruelty pos- 
sessed her. When Kate returned she would accuse
her openly. In the meantime, she must not desert
her post, she must watch.
The day passed away slowly. Kate did not come
back. Mary knew all about the trains. When pas-
sengers from any train might be expected to arrive
. she walked down the avenue, but no Kate returned.
Meanwhile the sick man was better. The doctor
and the nurse scarcely left him. Hour by hour the
heavy pall of awful illness began to be lifted. Hour 
by hour the chance of recovery became more assured.
He opened his eyes restlessly several times, and on
each of these occasions he asked for his wife.
Mary went upstairs and met Nurse Bryan.
" How is Mr. Henley ?" she asked, in her some-
what caiess off-hand tone.
"Oh, better," replied - the woman, "decidedly
better, but I do wish Mrs. Henley would return:'
" Has he been asking for her ?" said Mary.
"Asking for her I He never asks for any one else,  *:
but he is almost too weak to speak, poor dear; it's his
eyes that ask for her, his eyes keep looking at the door.
It's a pity that beautiful young lady is so cold-hearted 
as to leave him in a crisis of this kind."

"But is it bad for him her being away ?" asked
Mary.
"It is decidedly very bad."
"You think that it may imperil his life ?"
"Well, of course he is not out of danger yet,"
said Nurse Bryan, "nor anything like. We had no
hopes at ill last night, and we have some hopes now,
that's about the difference. Whether he pulls through
depends altogether on whether he does not get any
shock and whether he. has nothing to worry him.
.He is too weak yet to be seriously worried, but when
his strength returns Mrs. Henley ought to be here."
" Thank you," replied Mary. She turned away.
On the stairs she met Dr. Thornton.
"How is your patient ?" she said, stopping for a
moment as she was going downstairs.
"I have not seen him for the last hour," replied
the doctor; d he was doing better then, much better
than I dared to hope."
"Then you think he will get over this?"
"There is a possibility."
" Last night you had no hope," said Mary.
" I had no hope," replied Dr. Thornton, " but in
these fever cases," he added, " no physician ought to
say that. The old saying that while there is life there
is hope invariably applies to fever cases:."
"Then now you have hope ?"
"I have said so."
"I have just seen Nurse Bryan," continued Mary
after a pause. " She says Mr. Henley is fretting for
his wife."
"Has not Mrs. Henley come back yet ?" asked
Dr. Thornton, raising his brows; "it is very extra-
ordinary:'
E'^

"( It is extraordinary," said Mary, "that is exactly
what I think. You want her back, do you not?"
"She ought to be here," said Dr. Thornton.
i"You think we ought to try and find-her and
bring her back?"
"I do, undoubtedly."
"Will you say so, if necessary, to my mother
and father ?"
" I will certainly say so, blt I am going up to
see the patient now."
" As in all probability there is not a moment to
lose," continued Mary, " may I say it for you ?"
" If you will be so kind."
Mary ran downstairs. Her mother was in the
morning room. The relief from the terrible strain
of the day before had made the good lady more 
tired than usual. She was lying down.
"You will be knocked up, as well as everybody
else, on account of that wretched, miserable girl,"
said Mary, when she came into the room.
"Oh don't, Mary, don't abuse poor Kate now,"
said Ethel, who was seated near her mother.
" I don't want to listen to you, Ethel; you are a
perfect goose," exclaimed Mary. "Mother, it is my 
opinion-of course, I know exactly what you and
Ethel think of my opinion, but, nevertheless, I shall
state it. It is my opinion that Kate has gone, never
to return."
"You are talking absolute nonsense," said Mrs.
Hume. " Why should not Kate come back ?"
"She is afraid to come back; she feels that her
game is up. Now I have not the slighti idea of
allowing her to escape the consequences of her 
crime; she must return in order to face it. I have

got the doctor's orders that we are to send for her
immediately, as otherwise her husband cannot re-
cover. I mean to go and look for her."
"Where do you mean to go ?" said Mrs. Hume.
"Oh, Mary, Mary dear, -that chimera in your brain
gets worse and worse."
" Never mind about my brain at present," said
Mary, "when I bring Kate back you will cease to
think that I have got a chimera in my brain; you
will turn your attention to the real culprit, you will
not waste your pity on me. Meanwhile, I want to
go and look for Kate."
Where are you going to look for her ? "
"She will return of course by the next train,"
said Ethel. "I have been talking to Nurse' Bryan
and she says that Kate was in a very nervous over-
strained condition last night, and it is my opinion the
poor darling just went away because she could not
stand the terrible strain of seeing her husband die."
"Very wrong of her," interrupted Mrs. Hume,
"very wrong and selfish. I have a high opinion of
Kate. I do not believe my dear Kitty would do such
!  a hertless thing for a minute."
"Nevertheless, mother," said Mary,. your dear
Kitty, as you call herhas done it, for in the house she
is not. Marryat has also gone. I intend to followthem."
" Where? " said Mrs. Hume.
"To Plymouth."
"Plymouth, my dear child I What would take
Kate to Plymouth?"
"She goes on board the Hydra to Plymouth. She
'is on board the Hydra now, I feel certin of it. If I
take the next train to Plymouth I shall overtake the
boat. I shall go on board when the Hydra stops at

346          AN ADVENTURESS
Plymouth to-morrow, and face Kate. -I want father to
come with me. Anyhow, she must be brought back."
Just at that mdment Mr. Hume came into the room.
"Father," said Mary, turning to him, "can you
come to Plymouth with me immediately?"
"Why so ? " asked Hume. "What is the matter
with you, Mary ? I thought you were staying with
your Aunt Maud."
My place is here," said Mary, " or rather, my
place is at Plymouth. If we catch the night train we
shall get there early to-morrow morning before the
Hydra arrives. I want to go on board in order to
confront Kate Henley."
Mr. Hume asked for an explanation. Marygave
it in terse tones.
"You shall do nothing of the kind; you would
not be so mad. I forbid you to do it," he said.
" Kate will come back at any moment, of course she
will come back."
"Very well," said Mary, "if she returns by the 
last train, the seven o'clock this evening, well and 
good, but if she does not return, you and I will take
the night train to Plymouth. Either you and I, father,
or I by myself, for confront Kate I will."    i
"There can be nothing whatever in this,' said Mrs.
Hume.                               - 
"It is very odd," said Mr. Hume, "where can
those tickets have gone ? I certainly left them in the
study and they have completely vanished."
Mary gave a little laugh.
" Of course Kate had them," she said; "you are 
finely deceived in tbht girl, but your eyes will be 
opened yet." 
She went out of the room. Her parents'   n

Ethel's attitude of unbelief tried her almost beyond
endurance,
' It is a very painful part I have'got to play," she
said to herself, " but nevertheless I shall go on to the
bitter end. Thit adventuress shall be exposed, she
shall be seen in b.r true colours:'
Mary conbled her watch, and remembering that
another train was about due at the little station, once
more walked up.the avenue. She looked along the
dusty road. If she could see two figures, the figure
of Marryat and the figure of Kate coming back, she
would go to meet them. She would confront Kate
face to face, confront this impostor she w.dmand
soon, the sooner the better. Her heart was burning
with rage. She felt as she had never thought to feel
in the days of her happy and innocent girlhood.
." I am wicked over this," she said to herself, " but
wicked or not I am going on straight to the bitter end."
Her eyes travelled along the road-the figures of
two women resembling Kate and Xijarryat did not
appear, but a. man was coming  p  the road. He
was walking slowly, uncertainly*^He paused now
and then to look around him. -r!ently he drew up
outside the gates of the Grange and looked full at Mary.
The man was shabby in appearance, with a flushed
face and rough hair, but notwithstanding his dusty and
patched boots, his ill-fitting trousers, his general get-
up, there was something about him which showed that
long, long ago, in a dim far-away age, he must have
posed as a gentleman. Those days were over, but
the shadow of them still remained. 
He drew up in front of Mary. Mary said-
"Do you want anything? Have you lost your
way ? You seem to be a stranger in these parts."
-"..'

" All the same I have come here before," said the
man. " My name is Rogers. I have come to see a
young lady of the name of Marryat. I saw her here
once before-a nice young lady. I should be very
pleased to see her again. Can you tell me, Miss-- ?"  l
" Hume is my name," said Mary, " Miss-Hume."   l
"Can you tell me, Miss Hume, if Miss Marryat is
at the Grange?"
" Miss Marryat, as you are pleased to call her,"
said Mary, is maid to Mrs. Henley. She is not at
the Grange at present."
"And Mrs. Henley is not at the Grange ?" said
the man, raising his brows with a gesture of despair.
"Nor is Mrs. Henley at the Grange. Do you
want to see Miss Marryat very badly ?"
" Very badly indeed," said the man, and he closed
his hand and then opened it, and looked down at his
empty palm.
" What do you want to see her for ?"
The man raised his furtive eyes and fixed
them on Mary's face. Mary's heart began to beat l
hard.
"I want to see Miss Marryat," he said then, 
slowly, "because-well I have got no money. Mis.
Marryat can give me money."
Are you a relation of hers ?-"'
"No, Miss." 
"Then why do you expect that Miss Marryat, who
b only a poor woman-a servant-should give you
money ?"
"That is my secr4t,*aid the man. He laughed
and turned his face aside.'  '
Mary got more excitd thin ever.
"You may as well come in," she said, then. " If

you go down to the kitchen they will give you some-
thing to eat and drink."
" Miss, I am afraid; you keep dogs."
"Then I will walk with you," said Mary. " I will
take you as far asthe kitchen premises and ask the
cook to be king to you. You can sit in the servants'
hall until Miss Marryat returns."
"Oh, the.she is likely to come back ?"
"I do not know; I am quite in the dark. We
are expecting her and Mrs. Henley at any moment.
They may come or they may not. Will you come to
the house or will you go away ?"
The man looked again at Mary.
" I will come to the house, Miss, and I am very
much obliged to you," he said.
Mary opened the gate and he passed through.
She closed it again.
"We will take this short cut," she said, "across
the fields." The man followed her. She waited until
he came up to her side.
"You say you have been here before ?" she said.
Yes, Miss."
"And yet I do not remember your face."
" did not see you that time, Miss, but I remember
the date well." 
" How long ago was it ?"
" A good bit ago, Miss, in the spring of this year.
It was the day before Mrs. Henley's wedding."
"Did you come to see Mrs. Henley or Miss
Marryat?"
"It doesn't matter," said the man, "that's my
secret"
;   see," answered Mary. "Then you and Miss
Mmn   amd Mrs. Henley have a secret between you."

"'That's about it," said Rogers. He moistened
his lips with his tongue. He began to see daylight.
He looked attentively at Mary.
"Secrets are often of value," said Mary.  "I  i
presume yours is ?"
" It is of the greatest possible value," answered
the man.
" Indeed? Shall I guess what you want to see
Miss Marryat about ? "
" Just as you like, Miss. Of course I'm not bound
to tell you if your guess is correct."
" Come round this way, through the plantation,"
paid Mary. "We won't meet the dogs this way, and we
tan go in by the side entrance. You want to see Miss
Marryat because you expect her to give you money? "
4Ah, Miss, I hinted that a moment ago."
"She gives you money which she gets from Mrs. 
Henley," pursued Mary. "Mrs. Henley has a secret
which you know something about; and she pays you
not to reveal it; is not that so ? You are one of those
who levy blackmail; is not that so ?"
" Blackmail is an ugly word," said the man, flush-
ing deeply. " It does not sound very pretty from the
lips of a young lady like yourself, Miss Hume, and
you have no right to say that I levy blackmail. Miss
Marryat is a friend of mine."
"Don't talk nonsense," answered Mary. She "
suddenly turned and faced the man. " I presume from
your appearance that you want money ?"
" Ay," he said, "I want money as the penniless
want it. You don't know what that means."
"' I don't, but I can guess. Suppose I were to give
you money instead of Miss Marryat ? Suppose I paid
more for your secret than Miss Marryat does ?"

" In that case," said Rogers very briskly, "we can
do business."
"I understand; I shall not ask you much now,
but I want you to stay here. I will arrange with the
cook to give you some dirnier and some supper, and
I will give you the price'of your bed at the village inn.
I want you to remain here for the next couple of days
and when you have done what I wish, you shall
have-" Mary paused for a moment; she quickly
thought over her account at the bank. How much
had she to her credit ? " You shall have a hundred
pounds,' she said.briefly. "Do you follow me ? "
" I think so, Miss."
"Will you stay here, and when the time comes
will you be my friend instead of Miss Marryat's ?"
The man thought again. After all, Miss Marryat
had only given him doles-three pounds here, and
five pounds there. Once, indeed, he had extracted as
much as fifteen pounds from her-but a hundred
pounds, never I .Never even in moments of the keenest
danger to Kate Henley had he received as large a sum
of money as that, and, after all, he only knew a little
of Kate's secret, only a little.
" Done, Miss," he said, turning to Mary. " I will
do what you want for a hundred pounds, and I will
stay at the inn as long as you wish me to stay."

THERE was no sign of Kate by the train due at half- 
past eight, and when Mary had ascertained that tact
she went straight into her father's study. He was I,
seated there looking somewhat perplexed. He did : '-
not know what to make of the aspect of affairs. Why *
had Kate gone away ? Why was Mary so very
queer-and the sick man upstairs, would he recover
or would he die ?                  ' 
It was not very long since Mr. Hume had crept up
on tiptoe and entered the sick-room, aId toodclose to
thenan whom a few days before he had e en in the per-
fection of bealth and happiness. He was lying on his
bed now, looking more like a grey shadow than a liv-
log man. Occasionally faint words came from his lips; 
his delirium had left him; the nurse and the doctors
all thought that he might recover, that in all probability ..;,
he would recover, and yet Mr.. Hume as he looked- 
down at him felt that it was almost impossible, hat .
nothing so changed, so withered, could once again 
revive and bloom forth into youth and strength. The
only words which came from the sick man's lips were
"Kate I Kitty, little Kitty, darling Kitty  Where
is she? Where is my wife ?"
Those were the sounds he uttered from time to ' 
time,; he spoke of nothing else; he asked for no one
else.. Occasionally he gave a piteous glance towards 'J
the door, and then with a shuddering sigh would close  '
.. his eyes.

Dr. Thornton said to Mr. Hume as he was leaving
the room, u Mrs. Henley ought to be here. Where
can she have gone ?
And Hume had gone softly downstairs and said
to himself also that Mrs. Henley ought to be here.
He had a great admiration for his pretty niece. Where
was she ? Her h.sband was ill, at death's door, and
calling for her., Where had she gone ? Where was
Marryat also? Wiat did it all mean
. I e was eated thinking these thoughts, glad to be
;^   me for a few moments, much bewildered, much
i pzzled, when Mary swiftly opened the study door,
closed it behind her, and came in.
"Now, father," she said, if you don't mean to
act, I do:'.
"What do youwant to do, Mary?" repliedherfather.
"I want you to rouse yourself, to be a man-
oh, I don't mind what you think, I will speak out. I
want you to come with me to Plymouth by the twelve
o'clock train. We can easily get to Plymouth if we
take the next.train to town. We can pack what things
are pecessary in a. few moments. We shall reach
Plymouth at seve  n the morning. I have looked
pL.the time-abt and know exactly what I am saying,
and we shall be there two or three hours before the
arrival of the Ify."a
"But why should we be in Plymouth, and why
should we catch the Hydra ? My plae is here, Mary.
My dear child, what is the matter:?  Sit down, my
i.: .dear, and try to compose yourself." 
"Oh, folly, father," said Mary, tamping her foot
up' atiently, "when every moment is of importance; -
that adventuress is slipping out of our very grasp, and
O .you let her go."

354          AN ADVENTURESS
What adventuress, my dear "
"The woman you call your niece-Kate Henley.
She is Kate Henley, but she is not your niece;' she is
no relation to you, and I am prepared to prove it."
" I cannot listen to you when you get upon that
mad craze, Mary."
"That's just it; you call me mad,-but I have
excellent proof, only you must catch her first. What
became of those tickets you meant to return yester-
day ? Why were they not left on your table ? Who
took them ? Who would have taken any interest in
them but the one woman to whom they were all
important ? I tell you what it is, father, Kate is an
impostor, and I mean to prove it."
Mr. Hume shook his head sadly.
I .don't agree with you, Mary," he said, "nor
can I encourage you in this feeling. You ought to
fight against it, my dear child, you really ought."
Mary sat quite still, a despairing look came into
her eyes.
" It would do little or no good if I went alone," she
said, "but if you came you would bring her back.
Will you go by yourself ? Will you do thatf  That
.is all I ask. I will stay quietly here if you, fther, will
go to Plymouth to-night, and bring Kate *ienley
back."
"But I am going on a wild-goose chase; she is
not on board the Hydra."
" Go and find out. If she is not on board I will
cease to worry you any longer with regard to her;
but I know she'is, I have a firm conviction on that
point. In the meantime I will stay here and wait.
Her husband wants her-don't think of me-think
of him. If she is indeed on board .leaving the

AN ADVENTURESS               355
country, ought we nbt to fetch her back ? Is it right
that he should die pining for her ?"
" It is not right, Mary. To tell yfe the truth I
would give the world to find her 't the present
moment. I am extremely anxious about Henley, so 
is the doctor; there is nothing I would not do, Mary,
to get Kate back at this moment."
"Then take my advice, go yourself to Plymouth
and bring her back. When the sick man knows that
she is certainly returning he will have courage to wait
for 'her. Bring her back, bring her back l"
Mr. Hume looked anxiously at Maryfor a longtime.
' You certainly impel me by your earnestness,"
he said, "I can do nothing here. If I do this, if I
yield to your wishes, will you make me a promise on
your own account?"
" If I can, father, I will."
"My request is this, that if Kate is not on board ;
the Hydra you will cease to persecute her, you will 
return to your normal state of health, you will believe
tht she is, what in truth she is, your cousin who was
* Kate.Bouve." .
·<Bi'.   that I will try to do," said Mary, the
querest smile crossed her face-it was more like
a spasm than a smile.
" Then you will go " she said.
"On this condition I will go; of course it is a
wild-goose chase."
"Time will prove," replied the daughter. She
slowly left the room.
Mr. Hume thought for a moment, then he took
ot his watch, he looked at it and went upstairs again.
He met Dr. Thornton in the hastily prepared sitting--
room in the west wing.

"You think your patient will recover," he said.
"He is better; he has passed the crisis; I cannot
say the danger is past; the great danger now is the
state of anxiety he is kept in. He wants his wife; if
his wife would return he would get well."
" She may come back at any moment," said Mr.
Hume, " at the same time I cannot understand why
she went."
" I believe she went because she could not bear
to see him die," replied the doctor; "she was very
strange in her behaviour."
" Very strange; I cannot account for it; thank
God there are few women like her," replied Hume.
He'paused for a moment, then he said, "' It is possible,
just possible, that I may bring her back by this time
to-morrow night. Can you keep him alive until then ?"
" If I can give hint-any sort of hope I can keep
him alive," said the doctor.
. "Then I will go to a place where I think it pos-
sible my niece may be, and if I find her I will bring
her back," said Mr. Hume. He left the room, packed
a few things in a Gladstone bag, and sought his wife.
" Susannah," he said, "I am off to' Plymouth by thet
midnight train and must catch the next to tow  'Don't
mind about dinner, my dear, I cannot wait to dine."
" But you must have something before you go,
and why do you go at all, Robert " said his wife.
Then he told her in a few words something of his
strange interview with Mary.
" Keep her well in.view," he said, "poor child, I
go more on her aocount than anything else. She has
got a strange crae, she has indeed inherited her aunt's
madness:' 
" Oh, it is fearful, fearful 1" said the mothers.*



<pb n="357"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               357
" Well, she has promised to be reasonable if I do
not bring Kate back; I have little expectation of doing
so. If Kate returns during my absence let Thornton
know at once. Don't on any account allow her to
rush suddenly into the sick-room. And now good-
bye, my dear, I have not a moment to lose."
Mr. Hume kissed his wife and left the house. A
he was walking down the avenue carrying his Glad-
stone bag Ethel ran after him.
"What is the matter, father ? Where are you
going?"
" To Plymouth, my dear, by Mary's orders:'
Dear me, father," said Ethel, " Mary seems to
rule every one.
"She is possessed by a mania, child; be patient
with her," said the good man, heaving a heavy sigh
as he spoke. 
" There is such a queer man in the housekeeper's
room, father. I went in there just now and he bowed
to me and said that he was Mary's guest; he said his
name was Rogers; he is to sleep at the Inn. While I
was talking to him. Mary came in and turned me out of
the room. She said that he was one of her witnesses,
and that she was gradually getting everything in train
for a grand denouncement. What can she mean ?"
"Poor child," said Mr. Hume, " it is part of her
strange malady. We must humour her. But, Ethel
* dear, you must speak to your mother. Whoever that
strange person is he must not sleep in the house to-
night."
"Oh, he won't, father; he said he was going to
the Inn in the village."
' "Very well, only see that he does go," said Mr.
Hume. "And now I must really be off."

CHAPTER XXXVIII 
THE Hydra did not reach Plymouth until between eight
and nine on the following morning. Mr. Hume had;
arrived by train some hours previously, but supposing 
that there wat no special need to hurry, as he was
well aware that. the great 'liner would remain for
several hours, he went first to his hotel, ordered a good
breakfast, and having partaken of it lay down to sleep
until between ten and eleven o'clock.
Meanwhile things that he little guessed were hap-
-. pening on.board the Hydra. Half-an-hour before she
reached her destination, Kate Henley, who had been
r lying perfectly still in her berth all night, her face
turned away from Marryat, slowly opened her eyes
and rose. Marryat, worn out with much watching,
had dropped into a deep sleep. Kate glanced at the
sleeping woman: she herself was absolutely quiet and
collected. Just for a moment, however, a queer ex-
pression came into her eyes. She dressed swiftly,
putting on an old waterproof cloak and a black felt
hat. She tied a thick veil over her face, and then
softly took up a little bag which Marryat had laid on
the table at the foot of her berth. Kate opened the
bag. She removed from it the bundle of notes and
gold which Marryat had got from the bank the day" 
before. Opening this, she softly removed about two  t
hundred pounds' worth of money, slipped a few sove
reigns into her purse, and put the rest into a little bag,
sss 



<pb n="359"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               359
.whih she wore round her neck. She then returned
the remainder of the money to Marryat's bag.
·    . u They will make up to her, she sins for gold alone,"
thought the grL. ,She looked steadily, as the thought
came to her, at to sleeping woman, and then turning
left her state a.i',. She ran up the companion and
found herself o, deck... Some other passengers who
were to meet. frieds at Plymouth were at the same
time making their appearance, and just as Kate arrived
on the scene a tender was swiftly running up along-
side the Hydro. A weather-beaten sailor appeared, and
Kate asked him an eager question.
"Can I go ashore in that boat ?" she said, " I
want to do so for a little, I have some things to buy
that I forgot before I started. How long will the
Hydra remain in Plymouth ?"
"Until six o'clock this evening, ma'am," replied
the man.
Kate thanked him and hurried towards the tender;
some other passengers were also going ashore. No
qne specially remarked her in her quiet dress, and her
thick veil disguised her face. She took her seat, and
in ten minutes time had landed on one of the quays.
She then walked quickly in a direction where a vast
lot of shipping was lying at anchor.  As she got
rapidly over the ground she came face to face with a
sailor, looked full at him, and suddenly stopped.
"I am in great trouble," said Kate, "can you
help me ? I want help very badly; I can pay for
anything you are willing to do."
"The man looked her all over.  Even in the
midst of her trouble and in her plain dress she looked
dainty and graceful.
"I'll do anything in my power for you, Miss," he



<pb n="360"/>
360          AN ADVENTURESS
answered, and a look of sympathy filled his blue
eyes.
Kate hastily opened her purse.
"Here are a couple of sovereigns," she said; she
slipped the money into his palm as she spoke. it Now
this is what I want you to do. I am anxious to get
to France with as little delay as possible; I have
not a moment to lose. Do you happen to know of
any vessel going to France to-day-going at once, I
mean ?"
The sailor scratched his head in perplexity, and
looked along the line of shipping, then he glanced
again at Kate, and suddenly a sparkle of intelligence
came into his eyes.
"I don't know much about the vessels along here,
Miss, but doubtless some of them will be putting out
to sea; but I wonder, Miss, if--  "
"What?" asked Kate; she almost stamped her
foot in her eagerness.
" I belong to Mr. Johrison's yacht, Miss, the Sea
Fowl. I wonder if he would let me take you on
board. I might say, for instance, Miss, you was my
young woman; you wouldn't mind, would you ? We
are going straight to Cherbourg."
"Oh, I don't mind what you call me," replied
Kate; "do ask him, I won't trouble him in any way.
I'll make it .worth your while," she added.
" Very well, Miss, then I'll have a try. I have a
young woman of my own, and I can pass you off for
her as easy as possible. You won't betray me, Miss,
that's all I ask?"
"Of course not."
-The man and Kate walked quickly together; they
found themselves on a certain quay.  The sailor



<pb n="361"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               36x
pointed to a bench, told her to sit there and wait for
him, and went away. He returned in a quarter of
an hour; his eyes were now sparkling.
"It's all right, Miss; I said that you was my
sweetheart; you didn't mind."
"I mind nothing," answered Kate.
"Mr. Johnson says you can certainly come on
board, Miss, and that I may look after you during
the voyage. I said you were going to see your sick
mothi at Cherbourg. It's all right, it's as trim and
neat as ever it can be."
"Thank you," answered Kate, "you shall have
five pounds to give to your real sweetheart when you
land -me at Cherbourg."
"That's- very generous of you, Miss, and will
hurry on our wedding day. Now will you come this
minute? The Sea Fowl is to start in half-an-hour,
the wind being favourable."
Kate eagerly followed the sailor. In a short time
she. found herself on board the Sea Fowl, the man
secured a sheltered nook for her where she could
remain quite unnoticed, and in half-an-hour the
ga little yacht was under full white sail towards
Cherbourg.
There was a large party on board, and Kate, from
the retirement of her sheltered corner, could hear
their merry laughter floating on the breezes No one
molested her, no one noticed her. The sailor, James
Harris by name, came constantly to ask her if she
required anything.
I must be attentive to you, Miss, in case any
one should suspect," he said, and Kate faintly smiled
4 trogh her thick veil and told him that he was
treating her as a gentleman should.



<pb n="362"/>
362          AN ADVENTURESS
In the afternoon the yacht reached Cherbourg.
Kate landed, paid the good-natured sailor his money,
who thanked her heartily and said he wished he could
do something for her. Finally he added, " If I hadn't
a sweetheart of my own I'd like well to have you,
Miss; but there, I'm glad I've done you a service."
Kate held out her slim hand which he wrung, but
she had no words for him; indeed she had few words
for any one just then. Her whole condition can only
be described as that of a stunned person. She had
just sufficient presence of mind to inquire for the
necessary trains which would take her to the South
of France, and when she finally found herself in an
empty compartment she sat with her eyes closed, not
eating, not even sleeping, only enduring.
In process of timej at the end .of many dreary
housho-many she could never remember-Kate
found herself once more in the old familiar places.
There was not a stone of the old half-French, half-
Italian town which she did not remember with a sort
of passionate mingling of love and longing. She
walked rapidly through the streets of Mentone, and
at last entered the hotel which she had helped her
mother to start.
Mrs. Mildmay had made a very good thibg out of
her Hotel Pension. The winter .season would pre-
sently begin, and already the pension was filling with 
guests.
Kate entered the outer hall and inquired for Mrs.
Mildmay. She asked to be shown immediately into
her presence. The concierge hesitated, but presently
yielded to her entreaties, and took her into a small
parlour at the end of a long passage. Mrs. Mildmay
was sitting with her back to the door. She was



<pb n="363"/>
AN ADVENTURESS               363
busily engaged summing .up accounts. Kate watched
her for half a moment without speaking. She saw
very little change in her mother. Her slim figure
looked just as it always did. There was a half mourn-
ful, half piteous, shrug of the shoulders,, which the
widow had always been in the habit of indulging in.
She shrugged her shoulders now, then, seeming to
realise that there was another presence in the room,
turned her head. She saw Kate, and her face grew
white as death.
Child!" she said, "child, you have come back.
What is it?" Then she suddenly recovered herself.
"Oh, Mrs. Henley, ma'am, I am pleased to see you,"
she cried, and she let both her hands drop to her
sides, looking like one who has got her death-blow.
Kate ran quickly up to her.
"I have come back, mother; you need not speak
of me as any other but what I really am. It is all
up, everything is a dismal failure, and he is dead.
If you Fen hard you will hear the church bells;
they are toling for him; they ring in my ears all the
time. 1 have come back to you; I want you to hold
yoH  hlands tightly over my ears; I want you to shut
out the sound of the bells. I have come back to you,
to you."
Mrs. Mildmay stared at Kate for a moment without
speaking, then she flung her arms round her, pressed
her down into a chair, and clasped her tightly to her
bosom.
"Oh, my child," she said, "oh, thank God, thank
God I" She clasped the girl tighter and tighter to her,
and the slow tears filled her eyes and rolled down
her cheeks. " Oh, my child, oh, my darling I" she
kept repeating.



<pb n="364"/>
364          AN ADVENTURESS
Kate did not utter a sound. She enjoyed for a
full moment the joy of this close embrace; she
pressed her face against her fnother's bosom, but her
lips were shut as tightly as if they would never open
again.
"What is it, what is it?" began Mrs. Mildmay.
She was in raptures at first, but rapture was quickly
!4Allowed by anxiety. 
" Shut and lock the door first, mother," answered
poor Kate. She flung off her hat and pressed her
hands to her eyes.
" Don't you hear the bells, mother ?"
" No, no, my darling, but you look ill; you are
dreadfully ill; what is it, Kitty ? " she said.
" I am glad I look ill, mother, for I want so ter-
ribly to die; it is the only good thing that can
happen to me now. I am a failure, everything else
a failure, and he-he is dead. I never, never, when I
thought of all possible horrors, imagined that he could
die. I loved him, oh, how much, how much I 
loved him desperately, but God has punished me, and
mother, I have come back to you."
" And you are really Kate Mildmay once more ?"
said the elder woman.
"No, I am Kate Henley, but I was Kae Mildmay.
' Let Kate Bouverie lie in her grave; we will put a
fresh headstone up with her real name."
" But Kitty, Kitty," said the elder woman in alarm,
" they will punish you; the arm of the law will arrest
you; they will put you in prison I"
it I don't care," answered Kate, "where they put
me; for to-night at least I am safe, and I shall rest
in your dear arms, that is the only thing I want for
to-night. After all, you are my mother, and in time



<pb n="365"/>
AN 'ADVENTURESS             365
of great trial there is no one, no one like a mother.
I have been so starved, so hunted, so wretched, and
now it seems as if I were going to be rested. Oh,
mother, it was not worth while, it is never, never,
never worth while to do wrong, mother."
Mrs. Mildmay rose softly. She unpinned Kate's
hat and took off her travelling cloak, then she
went into the kitchen near by and presently re-
turned with hot water, and towels and soap, and
she washed the tired dusty face of the worn-out
girl, and brushed out her long, thick hair, and finally
made her lie down on the little sofa in the tiny sitting-
room.
"Nobody will guess that you are here," she
said. ",When you have got over this, if you still
wish to go on acting the part you have acted for so
long, you can do so, but to-night you can relieve
yourself by not acting at all, you can just be your
own self to-night."
"That is so nice, mother', answered Kate. She
looked at her mother with half-closed eyes. "How
hawe you got on, mother ?"
.'VjiW Very well indeed," answered Mrs. Mildmay; the
'"i   flourishes, I have put by money. I will tell
you all presently."
* "Yes, thank you, mother, I'd like to hear."
"Now I am going to get you a cup of tea."
"That would be nice," replied Kate. To each
remark of her mother's.during the rest of the evening
she always made the same answer, "That would be
nice." Everything seemed nice to her at that moment.
She had been tossing about so long, but at last she
had entered into the best haven of all, the haven of
her mothers faithful love.

Mrs. Mildmay made toast and. English tea, and
brought them to her daughter.
"Now you are to sleep," said the widow.
"I could sleep, oh, so soundly, mother, if those
bells would stop ringing."
"Let me hold your hand, and you won't listen to
the bells any more," said Mrs. Mildmay. 
"Yes, I must listen to them; I hear them in my
dreams; they have followed me all the way from the
Grange, near London. I thought when I left the Grange
that, of course, I should not hear them, but I heard
them in the London lodgings, and on board the ship.
Oh, that awful night on board the Hydra I and when
I was running away from Mary Hume, and from the
rest of the family, and from his dead body, mother,-
his dead body-I- heard those bells ringing. They
rung slowly, they rung out his life, they measured his
age-one-two-three-four-the years of his life,
mother, up to twenty-eight they rung, then they
stopped.  I heard them ringing out his age on
board the yacht that brought me to Cherbourg, and I
heard them in the many trains I took to come to
you, and I hear them now that I am with you.
Mother, do listen; can't you hear? They're so
distinct. He is dead-dead-and I don't care for
anything else."
"My poor child, my poor child, it is your mind
that is disturbed. Your nerves have given way. I
will give you a little bromide; that will quiet
you."
"Do, mother, but I don't think anything will
quiet me; only I will take whatever you give me. It
is nice to have you close to me again. Oh, mother,
mother, it was not worth while. All the time I have

had no pleasure, no happiness; I have been flying,
flying from  one danger to another, and I have
had no rest and no joy. It was the way of the
transgressor, and it was hard, bitter hard. But kiss
me, mother, kiss me once again."

CHAPTER XXXIX
ALL during that night Mrs. Mildmay sat up with
her daughter. She did not know what to make of
Kate's return, but she never thought that Kate
absolutely meant to give herself away. For the
present, therefore, it was her duty to hide her daughter.
She made up as comfortable a bed as she could on
the small sofa, and then lowering the light sat down 
by the tired girl.
Early in the morning Kate awoke. At first she
did not quite know where she was, then she saw her
mother's well-known figure; she stretched out her
hand and took her mother's.
"I have had a dream," she said, "a strange
dream; it has comforted me."
"What was it, darling ?" asked Mrs. Mildmay.
"God came to me. He told me that I must be
quiet and listen to His words. He said that I had
done very wrong and that now the time of chasten-
ing had come, but He said also that if I repented
there was forgiveness of sins. He seemed a long,
long way off, quite away up in the. clouds, and yet 
He was close; I saw His face; I didn't quite know

of His Son Jesus, but I saw one face, and it was all

' Yes, child, yes, that is true enough," answered
Mrs. Mildmay. "There is forgiveness of sins for
those who repent."

Yes, that is it," answered Kate, " I must repent ' .
-there is only one way."
"What do you mean, dearie ? Oh, go to sleep
now. Don't worry your poor head; go to sleep and
rest."
I- ..  "I can't rest until I come within a measurable
distance of the forgiveness of sins," answered Kate.
tI There is only one way to get it-by perfect and full
confession. Mother, I must confess everything."
Mrs. Mildmay turned pale when Kate said these
lwords. ,She had not been seriously alarmed the
night before; she had been disturbed but not really
frightened. Now she was terrified. She saw that
Kate was in earnest.
I:    Do you know what that will mean?" she said.
"You cannot understand what you are saying. If
you confess they-they will lock you up."
"As if that mattered," answered Kate. " You
mean that they will try me and send me to prison.
But ven in prison, with forgiveness of sins, I can rest,
and I canot rest outside prison without it."
" But they will put me in prison, too," continued
Mrs. bldmay, -, for I have been your-your con-
sfedera as they call it, and I have taken your money
-the money, I mean, that was never yours.. I took
it; you gave it to me, you know, tofurnishthis house,
and to live as I have done, They will put me in
prison also, Kate-your poor old mother. Wil you
consent to that ? And it  s your scheme, Kate, it
was your scheme. Must I go to prison now when I
am an old woman-now with my grey hairs?"
*'. Never mind, never mind," said Kate softly.
"We had better both go than stay outside without
fcrgivness of sins. Mother, if I am strong enough I

ill to go, you will go for me ?"
.    Good heavens, child, I I"
"You must go if I am too ill, and my head too,
queer. Oh, those bells, those bells, how they torture
me I But if I am ill you must go, and you must tell
them everything."
"1I daren't, I daren't," said Mrs. Mildmay.. She
wiung her hands together now; her face looked 
white and piteous.
'But, mother, you must. 'I know the path is
dark and dreary, but the end is peace and forgiveness.
Mother, you must do this for your only child. If I
am too ill to go, you must go."
Still Mrs. Mildmay hesitated. Kate kept watching
her,
"You will go ? " she said.
"l cannot make up my mind," said the poor
woman.
Kate kept on looking at her.
"Hark!" she said suddenly, " don't you hear the
bells ?"
" No, dear, no; go to sleep; go to sleep."
Sleep !" said Kate, "as if I could sleep. I don't
think I shall ever sleep again." Sheyraised her hand.

was a foreign doctor' and a good one. He had never
seen Kate before, and the mother did not think it
necessary to tell him her name. She simply said that
an English lady, who seemed in great trouble, had
come to the hotel on the previous evening, and was
taken ill the moment she arrived. The d6ctor pre-
scribed for her, and'said that he would'send in a
French nurse. Presently he left the room.

CHAPTER XL
WHEN Marryat awoke and found that her mistress
had really gone, her first anxiety was to examine the
little bag which was lying half open on the table of
her state-room. To the woman's great relief she 
discovered that the bulk of the money was still there. 
She immediately hid the bag in her cabin trunk, and
going upstairs began to look around for Kate. All
of a sudden she saw, coming across the gangway
from a small tender, the well-known figure of Mr.
Humt. In one instant Marryat had hidden herself.
She -went, without a moments hesitation, down 
amongst the steerage passengers. A woman came
and spoke to her. 
"What do you want ?" she said. " You belong 
to the first class; you have nothing to do down here'  -
' But will you let me stay near you for a bit,"
answered Marryat, "for the whole of to-day, until
we weigh anchor again ? I will give you two sove-
reigns if you'll let me."                       ' 
Two sovereigns were most valuable to this woman.
She did not hesitate for a moment. She took Marryat
in the direction of the large cabin, where all the steer-
age passengers slept, and even lent her a bonnet and 
shawl.                                             l
"For I expect you must be hiding from some-
body who is coming on board;" said the woman.
She looked sharply into the excited face of thelady's-

-maid as she spoke. "Well, he ain't likely to look
for you amongst the steerage passengers, and you
can wear my bonnet and shawl and look after my
baby Nancy, and then no one will suspect you."
"Thank you," answered Marryat. She adopted
the role provided for her' by the. steerage passenger
without an instants hesitation. She spent the long
day pretending'to nurse Nancy-a fractious baby of
sixteen months. From where she sat she could hear
the usual bustle on board-people coming and going,
t  eager oices of friends saying good-bye to friends.
* ^ At six in the evening the vessel weighed anchor
and steamed away. Then Marryat, paying the good
woman who had helped her to hide, returned to
her more comfortable. place amongst the first-ola
passengers. She was suddenly met by Captain
Staines, the skipper. He raised his brows in  s
ishment when he saw her.   .            r 
- "You are Miss Marryat, are you not?" he said
/ Marryat nodded.
·  'We have been looking for you all day; you
are MrsHenley's maid?"
Ad "slam, sir."
';.-i 'Wel, Mr. Hume, Mrs. Henleyis uncle, has been
to see her; be was in a dreadful .state -nc wanted to
find her at once, but she was not on-bard. Was
she with yo ?"
"No, sir; I was down with a fried -pf mine
amongst the steerage."  '   -
" Very odd, very odd," said the captain,. -where
-ag she be? you are quite certain she is not on
board ?"                      .
. I' think not, sir," replied Maryat demurely,
"but I'll go and have a look round..:

"Do so. Mr. Hume was in a terrible state, he '
wished to bring Mrs. Henley back at once to her
husband."
"What I is Mr. Henley alive?" asked Marryat,
thrown off her guard for a moment.
"Yes, and likely to live. Where can your mis-
tress be ? It was very careless of you to let the whole
day go by without endeavouring to find her. You'
must know mote about what she intended to do than
any one else."
"I know nothing, I assure you, sir.  When I
awoke this morning, Mrs. Henley was not in the
cabin. I thought she had gone ashore and would
be back at any moment. In the meantime I stayed
with my friend in the steerage. Perhaps,' continued
Marryat, after thinking for a moment, " Mrs. Henley  .
will come overland and meet us at Naples."
"Perhaps," answered the captain, "or perhaps,"
he added, with a look of relief, "she has gone back
already to her husband. Mr. Hume has been telling
me some of her story; it was strange of her to leave
home."
Marryat made no answer to that. The Captain
looked at her as if he expected her to say something.
She met his eyes for a moment, then remarked in a '
dubious voice-.- . 
"Did it not strike you, sir, that my mistress was
alittle queer in the head ?"
"I cannot say; I did not see enough of your

"You can land at Naples- if you like," answered
the captain, " not before." - e gave Marryat a glance
of no small disapproval, and turned to attend to his
other duties.

CHAPTER XLI :
THE sick man was getting slowly better. Day after
day he made progress, very slow progress, it is true,
but still undoubted progress towards recovery.
" If his wife were only with him he would get
well fast enough," said the doctor, "but this terrible
anxiety about her is weighing on his mind and rrd

Mary looked at her moer, opened her lips, tried
to speak, and then restrainedie l. No one would
listen to her now, no one would lieve her; the
general feeling about Kate was that she had taenher
own life in a fit of overweening anxiety.  ery one
mourned for Kate- as if she were' 'sready dead.
Impostor as Mary was certain she was she was loved
by all who knew her, whereas even her own people
had turned igainst Mary. Shut up by eve  one, the
girt at lst resolved to leave the Grange. She would
go back to her aunt in Russell Square. She had
never told Mrs. Stirling what she realy-suspeoted,
but in.that house she would not be watched, and
would be in consequence, more. at ease. She went
away, therefore, and as the days wore on and there
were no tidings whatever of the missing wife, and the

Rogers, who had spent the whole of his day
mooning about, smoking, sitting in the porch of the
Inn, and eating his meals, took a walk. As he did
so, he thought over the queer state of things. What
had become of Mrs. Henley? He knew far less of
her secret than she imagined he did. It is true that
on that memorable night-how long ago it seemed
now I-he had stolen softly up into the garden of the
villa Beau Sdjour, and had overheard Kate make use
of the following words;-
"Beyond that two thousand pounds which I am
giving you, I mean to wash my hands of you. You
can clear all your debts and take a good house and
start on your own account. Now are you satisfied ?
for if not- .-"
4 If not, what will happen?" Merriman as he there
cali himself, heard Mrs. Mildmay saying in a timid
^ You had better not ask me what will happen,"
answered the other voice, the young, strong, deter-
mined voice, "only, remember that I am desperate, I 
am resolved. Do you accept ? Are you satisfied ? " '
"Yes, yes," Mrs. Mildmay had replied, "I am
satisfied."
"That is right," replied Kate the heiress.
How. earnestly the listening man had longed that
he had been a little soonerion the sew . Onething
.at least he was certain of.  ite Bou*ie would not
giv Mrs. Mildmay two      dpounds for notogg.
He had discovered thalt re wos a secret. Often aid-

words he had overheard. Often and often he repeated
them to himsel,-, beynd this two thousand pounds

would speak in such a tone to a woman in Mrs. Mild-

the terror in the woman's voice as she had replied to 
the determined voice of the~girland after this she
suddenly became rich and paid back-th money she
had stolen from Madam Argot, and had quite got out
of his, Henry Merriman's,power. He hadmade great
capital on these words siwe he had overheard them,
but did he really know wvat they meant I? 
All this time he was valking along the dusty road. 
Twilight was deepening i'to night, Suddenlyhe saw
coming to meet him, waiting feebly and uncertainly,
the thin and almost shadowy figure of Mrs, Mildmay.
He could not mistake it He knew Mra. Mildnay
too well, he had seen her too often. Not a moth.
ago he had held a conversation with her at Mentor\.
She was well dressed and was the owner of a flourtah-

in response. Both were silent for a moment, then
Mrs. Mildmay said quietly-
"Can you tell me the way to a place called the
Grange ?"
Henry Merriman gave a long, significant whistle.
"' Well, this beats all I" he cried; " why, the Grange
is where Mr. Henley, the rich Mrs. Henley's uncle,
lives, the lady that was Kate Bouverie, you know. Now
may I ask what you want; what have you to do with
the people at the Grange ?"
That is my own affair," replied Mrs. Mildmay.
She was deadly tired and terribly frightened, but Kate
had insisted on her undertaking this journey. It was
a miserable journey, with awful confession at the end,

The girl came up to her.

it seemed to Ethel that there was a likeness there, 
likeness to somebody she knew, but she could no
tell who that somebody was.
" ! have come to see your father, Miss Hume
your father and your mother, on a matter of ver
great importance."
Indeed 1" said Etheli She did not seem excited
about this. The worn, sad-ooking widow was not a
person to eaite her curiosity in any way, but the
next words uttered by that same woman caused
Vkel'heartto beat with double its usual force, the
colour to ruhinto her cheeks, and her very hands
to trembe.' '
"I have come with news of a young lady, Mrs.
Henley, I have come to speak about her."

hands and dragged her into the hail.

She is not dead, is she ?"
"No, she is alive."
"Alive? then everything is all right. Oh, come at
once, at once."
Ethel dragged Mrs.   ildmay across the .hall.
She flung open thedfoor of the dining-room, where
her father and mother were still lingering over their
dessert. Mrs. Hume was lying in her usual easy-
chair; her face looked very worn and sad. Hume
was helping himself absently to another glass of wine.
On this scene btrst Ethel, her face afiame,, her
voice shking, dragging in a very shabby, pale, worn-
looking woman.
"FFather, mother, this woman has omae- se

"You are overcome," he said, "but take yo

"May I go and tell Ralph ?" said Ethel.
"No, no," said her father, "have patience for

Ethel stood behind her father's chair. 
Mrs. Mildmay drank her brandy and water. J
at that moment there came a rustling in the hall; qui
steps were heard; the door was burst open, and Ma
Hume came in.
The moment she saw her Mrs. Mildmay turn
whiter than ever. She had not felt any peculiar sen
sation when she saw Ethel, but Mary seemed to dis
turb her in the most unaccountable way.
"I have heard that you have come," she said
"I wonder what about. I was coming to spend
night at home' I have had po tidings for-some time
AXm. I very unwelcome, mother? am  I very un
welcome, father" ? 
If you choose to behave yourself, Mary, you. are
'always welcome," said her father in a constrained
voice. "And now, my poor woman," he said, turn-
ing to Mrs. Mildmayj !"will you tell us all you niow

Still Mrs. Mildmay was silent. It was so difficult
to begin. How much they loved Mrs. Henley, her
girl, her bonny, bonny, beautiful, J:i  eccentric
Kate 1 They all loved her; i  tfh^lt with the ex-
ception of the young lady lwho had come in lateiii.
Mrs. Mildmay was shrewd enough to guess that there l
was not much love for anybody in thaf girl's heart.
"Perhaps you would rather speak to ts. alone,"' 
said Mr. Hume, wondering at her'agitation,, and why.
the words did not come from her lips.

"Don't ask me any questions," said the young

At last they reached Mentone. Mrs. Mildmay
now came forward. She was still quite uncertain
what the Humes meant to do. She vaguely won-

KIte and herself when she returned to the place
where their great sin had been committed. She knew

much changed."                '               '

Mr. Goodwin.</p><p>Upon first hearing it, he was incapable of anything but blank staring, until it seemed as though his eyes must start from their sockets.</p><p>Then his passion, "not loud, but deep," found utterance only in emphatic thumps of his walking stick upon the ground.</p><p>Then, as the huge emotion worked upward, it broke out in grunts, groans and inarticulate exclamations.</p><p>Finally it burst forth as follows:</p><p>"Ugh! ugh! ugh! Fool! dolt! blockhead! brute that I've been! I wish somebody would punch my wooden head! I didn't think the demon himself could have deceived me so! Ugh! Nobody but the demon could have done it! And he is the demon! the very demon himself! He does not disguise, he transforms himself. Ugh! ugh! ugh! that I should have been such a donkey."</p><p>"Sir, compose yourself; we are all liable to suffer deception," said Mr. Goodwin.</p><p>"Sir," broke forth Old Hurricane, in fury, 'that wretch<pb n="6     Old Hurricane Storms."/>has ate at my table! has drunk wine with me! has slept in my bed! Ugh! ugh! ugh!"</p><p>"Believing him to be what he seemed, sir, you extended to him the rights of hospitality; you have nothing to blame yourself with!"</p><p>"Demmy, sir, I did more than that! I have coddled him up with neguses! I've papered him up with possets and put him to sleep in my own bed! Yes, sir! and more! Look there at Mrs. Condiment, sir, the way in which she worshiped that villain was a sight to behold," said Old Hurricane, jumping up and stamping around the tent in fury.</p><p>"Oh, Mr. Goodwin, sir, how could I help it when I thought he was such a precious saint?" whimpered the old lady.</p><p>"Yes, sir, when 'his reverence' would be tired with delivering a long-winded midday discourse, Mrs. Condiment, sir, would take him into her own tent, make him lie down on her own sacred cot, and set my niece to bathing his head with cologne and her maid to fanning him, while she herself prepared an iced sherry cobbler for his reverence. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Mrs. Condiment, mum," said Old Hurricane, suddenly stopping before the poor old woman, in anger and scorn.</p><p>"Indeed, I'm sure if I'd known it was Black Donald, I'd no more have suffered him inside my tent than I would have Satan."</p><p>"Demmy, mum, you had Satan there as well. Who but Satan could have tempted you all to disregard me, your lawful lord and master, as you, every one of you, did for that wretch's sake? Hang it, parson, I wasn't the master of my own house, nor the head of my own family. Precious Father Gray was. Black Donald was. Oh, you shall hear!" cried Old Hurricane, in a frenzy.</p><p>"Pray, sir, be patient," and do not blame the woman for being no wiser than you were yourself," said Mr. Goodwin.</p><p>"Tah! tah! tah! one act of folly is contingency to which any man may for once in his life be liable, but folly is a woman's normal condition. You shall hear, you shall hear. Hang it, sir, everybody had to give away to Father Gray, everything was for Father Gray. Precious Father<pb n="7     Old Hurricane Storms."/>Gray. Excellent Father Gray. Saintly Father Gray. It was Father Gray here and Father Gray there, and Father Gray everywhere and always. He ate with us all day and slept with us all night. The coolest cot in the dryest nook of the tent at night, the shadiest seat at the table by day, were always for his reverence, the nicest titbits of the choicest dishes, the middle slices of the fish, the breast of the young ducks, and the wings of the chickens, the mealiest potatoes, the juiciest tomatoes, the tenderest roasting ear, the most delicate custards and the freshest fruit always for his reverence. I had to put up with the necks of poultry, and the tails of fishes, watery potatoes, speckled apples, and scorched custards; and if I dared to touch anything better before his precious reverence had eaten and was filled, Mrs. Condiment, there, would look as sour as if she had bitten an unripe lemon, and Cap would tread on my gouty toes. Mrs. Condiment, mum, I don't know how you can look me in the face," said Old Hurricane, savagely--a very unnecessary reproach, since poor Mrs. Condiment had not ventured to look any one in the face since the discovery of the fraud of which she, as well as others, had been an innocent victim.</p><p>"Come, come, my dear major, there is no harm done to you or your family; therefore, take patience," said Mr. Goodwin.</p><p>"Demmy, sir; I beg your pardon, parson, I won't take patience. You don't know. Hang it, man, at last they got me to give up one-half of my own blessed bed to his precious reverence--the best half, which the fellow always took, right out of the middle, leaving me to sleep on both sides of him if I could. Think of it--me, Ira Warfield, sleeping between the sheets, night after night, with Black Donald! Ugh! ugh! ugh! Oh, for some Lethean draught, that I might drink and forget. Sir, I won't be patient! Patience would be a sin. Mrs. Condiment, mum, I desire that you will send in your account and supply yourself with a new situation. You and I cannot agree any longer. You'll be putting me to bed with Beelzebub next!" exclaimed Old Hurricane, beside himself with indignation.</p><p>Mrs. Condiment sighed, and wiped her eyes under her spectacles.</p><pb n="8     Old Hurricane Storms."/><p>The worthy minister, seriously alarmed, came to him, and said:</p><p>"My dear, dear major, do not be unjust--consider she is an old, faithful domestic, who has been in your service forty years--whom you could not live without. I say it under advisement--whom you could not live without!"</p><p>"Hang it, sir, not live with. Think of her helping to free the prisoners--actually taking Black Donald--precious Father Gray--into their cell, and leaving them together to hatch their--I beg your pardon--horrid plots!"</p><p>"But, sir, instead of punishing the innocent victim of his deception, let us be merciful and thank the Lord that, since those men were delivered from prison, they were freed without bloodshed; for, remember that neither the warden, nor any of his men, nor any one else, has been personally injured."</p><p>"Hang it, sir! I wish they had cut all our throats, to teach us more discretion," broke forth Old Hurricane.</p><p>"I am afraid that the lesson so taught would have come too late to be useful," smiled the pastor.</p><p>"Well, it hasn't come too late now. Mrs. Condiment, mum, mind what I tell you: as soon as we return to Hurricane Hall, send in your accounts and seek a new home. I am not going to suffer myself to be set at naught any longer," exclaimed Old Hurricane, bringing down his cane with an emphatic thump.</p><p>The sorely-troubled minister was again about to interfere, when, as the worm, if trodden upon, will turn, Mrs. Condiment herself spoke up, saying:</p><p>"Lor, Major Warfield, sir, there were others deceived besides me, and, as for myself, I never can think of the risk I've run without growing cold all over."</p><p>"Serves you right, mum, for your officiousness and obsequiousness, and toadying to--precious Mr. Gray! Serves you doubly right for famishing me at my own table."</p><p>"Uncle," said Capitola, "'Honor bright!' 'Fair play is a jewel.' If you and I, who have seen Black Donald before, failed to recognize that stalwart athlete in a seemingly old and sickly man, how could you expect Mrs. Condiment to do so, who never saw him but once in her life,<pb n="9     Old Hurricane Storms."/>and then was so much frightened that she instantlyfainted?""Pah pah pah Cap, hush! You, all of you disgustme, except Black Donald. I begin to respect him  Con-found me, if I don't take in all the offers I have madefor his apprehension; I'll nominate him to represent us inthe National Congress I For, of all the fools that ever 1have met in my life, the people of this county are thegreatestl and fools should at least be represented by oneclever man-and Black Donald is the very fellow I He isdecidedly the ablest man in this Congressional district."'Except yourself, dear uncle !" said Capitola."Except nobody, Miss Impudencel least of all me!The experience of the last week has convinced me that Iought to have a cap and bells awarded me by public accla-mation," said Old Hurricane, stamping about in fury.The good minister, finding that he could make no sortof impression upon the irate old man, soon took his leave,telling Mrs. Condiment that if he could be of any serviceto her in her trouble, she must be sure to let him know.At this, Capitola and Mrs. Condiment exchanged looks;and the old lady, thanking him for his kindness, saidthat if it should become necessary, she should gratefullyavail herself of it.That day the camp-meeting broke up.Major Warfield struck tents, and with his family andbaggage returned to Hurricane Hall.On their arrival, each member of the party went abouthis or her own particular business.Capitola hurried to her own room to take off her bon-net and shawl. Pitapat, before attending her young mis-tress, lingered below to astonish the housemaids with ac-counts of "Brack Dunnel, dress up like an ole parson, an''ceiving eberybody, even ole marsel"Mrs. Condiment went to her storeroom to inspect thecondition of her newly-put-up preserves and pickles, lestany of them should have "worked" during her absence.And Old Hurricane, attended by Wool, walked downto his kennels and his stables to look after the well-beingof his favorite hounds and horses. It was while goingthrough this interesting investigation that Major War-field was informed-principally by overhearing the gossip<pb n="10"/>1X,      Old Hurricane Storms.o; te grooms with Wool-of the appan      of a neinmnte of the Hidden House-a young girl, who, according to their description, must have been the very pearof beauty.Old Hurricane prfdked up his ears. Anything relatingto the Hidden House posessed immense interest for him.'to is she, John r' he inquired of the groom.ed I dumno, sir, only they say she's a bootifulyoung creture, fair as any lily, and dressed in deepntouffcg."flampbh humph humph I another victim I ten thous-and chances to one, another victim  Who told you this,JohW,'Wy, marse, you see Tom Griffith, the Rev.

And Davy he told Tom how one day last month his marse ordered the carriage,and went two or three days' journey up the country be-yant Staunton, where he staid a week and then camehome, fetching along with him in the carriage this lovelyyoung lady, who was dressed in the deepest mourningand wept all the way. They 'spects how she's an or-phan, and has lost all her friends, by the way she takeson.""Another victim I My life on it, another victim  Poorchild she had better be dead than in the power of thatatrocious villain and consummate hypocrite I" said OldHurricane, passing on to the examination of his favoritehorses, one of which, the swiftest in the stud, he foundgalled on the shoulders. Whereupon he flew into atowering passion, abusing his unfortunate groom by everyopprobrious epthet blind fury could suggest, orderinghim, as he valued whole bones, to vacate the stables in-stantly, and never dare to set foot on his premises again,as he valued his life, an order which the man meekly ac-cepted and immediately disobeyed, muttering to himself:"Htunph if we took ole marse at his word, there'dnever be a man or 'oman left on the 'state,"-knowingfull well that his tempestuous old master would probablyforet al about it as soon as he got comfortably seatedat  e scpper table of Hurricane Hall, toward which theold man now trotted off.<pb n="11"/>Old Hurricane Storms.             11Not a word did Major Warfield say at supper in re-gard to the new inmate of the Hidden House, for he hadparticular reasons for keeping Cap in ignorance of aneighbor, lest she should insist upon exchanging visitsand being "sociable."But it was destined that Capitola should not remain aday in ignorance of the interesting fact.That night, when she retired to her chamber, Pitapatlingered 'behind, but presently appeared at her young mis-tress' room door with a large waiter on her head, ladenwith meat, pastry, jelly and fruit, which she brought inand placed upon the workstand."Why, what on the face of earth do you mean bybringing all that load of victuals into my room to-night?Do you think I am an ostrich or cormorant, or that I amgoing to entertai a party of friends ?" asked Capitola, inastnishment, turning from the washstand where shestood bathing her face." 'Dead, I dunno, miss, whedder you'se an ostrizant ornotut I knows I don't 'tend for to be 'bused any more'bout wittels, arter findin' out how cross empty people canbe   Dere dey is!

I)Capitola, preferred the coolness and repose of indoorsBut that she should stay at home more than a week wasa moral and physical impossibility. So on Thursdayafternoon, when Major Warfield set out on horseback tovisit his mill, Capitola ordered her horse saddled andbrought up that she might take an afternoon's ride."Now, please, my dear child, don't go far," said Mrs.Condiment, "for, besides that your uncle does not ap-prove of your riding alone, you must hurry back to avoidthe storm.""Storm, Mrs. Condiment, why, bless your dear oldheart, there has not been a storm these four weeks I" saidCapitola, almost indignant that such an absurd objectionto a long ride should be raised."The more reason, my child, that we should have avery severe one when it does come, and I think it will beupon us before sunset; so I advise you to hurry home.""Why, Mrs. Condiment! there's not a cloud in thesky !""So much the worse, my dear. The blackest cloudthat ever gathered is not so ominous of mischief as thisdull, coppery sky and still atmosphere; and if forty years'observation of weather signs goes for anything, I tell youthat we are going to have the awfulest storm that evergathered in the heavens  Why, look out of that window the very birds and beasts know it, and instinctively seekshelter!

I'm not soluble in water-rain won'tmelt me away! I think, upon the whole, I rather preferbeing caught in the storm!" said Cap, perversely."Well, well, there's no need of that; you may ride asfar as the river's bank and back again in time to escape,<pb n="14"/>14    Cap's Visit to the Hidden House.if you choose," said Mrs. Condiment, who saw that her troublesome charge was bent upon the frolic.And Cap, seeing her horse approach, led by one of the  Xgrooms, ran upstairs, donned her riding-habit, hat andgloves, ran down again, sprang into her saddle and wasoff, galloping away toward the river before Mrs. Condi-ment could add another word of warning.She had been gone about an hour when the sky sud-denly darkened, the wind rose and the thunder rolled inprelude to the storm. Major Warfield came skurrying home from the mill,grasping his bridle with one hand, and holding his haton with the other. Meeting poor old Ezy in the shrubbery, he stormed out  .upon him with: "What are you lounging there for, you old idiot! you  iold sky-gazing lunatic ? Don't you see that we are going  ito have an awful blow? Begone with you, and see thatthe cattle are all under shelter. Off, I say, or- " Herode toward Bill Ezy, but the old man, exclaiming:"Yes, sir! yes, sirl in coorse, sir " ducked his head,and ran off in good time.Major Warfield quickened his horse's steps and rode tothe house, dismounted, and threw the reins to the stable-boy, exclaiming:"My beast is dripping with perspiration; rub hitadown well, you knave, or I'll impale you !"Striding into the hall, he threw down his riding whip,pulled off his gloves, and called:"Wool! Wool, you scoundrel! close4 every door andwindow in the house; call all the servants together in thediring-room; we're going to have one of the worst ternpests that ever raised."Wool flew to do his bidding."Mrs. Condiment, mum," said the old man, stridinginto the sitting-room-"Mrs. Condiment, mum, tell MissBlack to come down from her room until the storm isover; the upper chambers of this house are not safe in atem Wpt     l mum, why don't you go, or send Pita-pvat POL"Major Warfield, sir, I'm very sorry, but Miss Blackhas not come in yet," said Mrs. Condiment, who for the<pb n="15"/>Cap's Visit to the Hidden House.         15last half hour had suffered extreme anxiety upon accountof Capitola."Not come in yet I Demmy, mm! do you tell me shehas gone out?" cried Old Hurricae, in a voice of thun-der, gathering his brows into a dark frown, and strikinghis cane angrily upon the floor."Yes, sir; I am sorry to say she rode out about an hourago and has not returned," said Mrs. Condiment, sum-moning all her firmness to meet Old Hurricane's rousedwrath."Ma'aml you venture to stand there before my faceand tell me composedly that you permitted Miss Back togo off alone in the face of such a storm as this I" roaredOld Hurricane."Sir, I could not help it," said the old lady."Demmy, mum, you should have helped it. A womanof your age stand there and tell me that she could, notprevent a young creature like Capitola from going outalone in a storm I""Major Warfield, could you have done it?""Me?

You--He was interrupted by a blinding flash of lightning,followed immediately by an awful peal of thunder and asudden fall of rain.Old Hurricane sprang up as though he had been shotoff his chair, and trotted up and down the floor, ex-claiming:"And she I she out in all this storm! Mrs. Condiment,mum, you deserve to be ducked! Yes, mum, you do!Wool! Wool you diabolical villain !""Yes, mtarse, yes, sir; here I is !" exclaimed that officer,in trepidation, as he appeared in the doorway. "De win-dows and doors, sir, is all fastened close, and de maidsare all in the dining-rooms as you ordered, and-""Hang the maids, and the doors and windows, toolwho the demon cares about them? How dared you, youknave, permit your young mistress to ride, unattended, inthe faceof such a storm,toot  Why didn't you go withher, sir?"" 'Deed, marse--"Don't "deed marse' me, you atrocious villainl Sad-<pb n="16"/>s6    Cap's Visit to the Hidden House.dle a horse quickly, inquire which road your mistresstook, and follow and attend her home safely-afterwhich I intend to break every bone in your skin, sirrah ISo---"Again he was interrupted by a dazzling flash of light-ning, accompanied by a deafening roll of thunder, andfollowed by a flood of rain.Wool stood appalled at the prospect of tunming out insuch a storm, upon such a fruitless errand."Oh, you may stare, and roll up your eyes! but Imean it, you varlet! So be off with you !-go! I don'tcare if you should be drowned in the ain, or blown offthe horse, or struck by lightning. I hope you may be,you knave, and I shall be rid of one villain  Off, youvarlet, or--" Old Hurricane lifted a bronze statuetteto hurl at Wool's delinquent head, but that functionarydodged and tan out in time to escape a blow that mighthave put a period to his mortal career.But let no one suppose that honest Wool took the roadthat night. He simply ran downstairs and hid himselicomfortably in the lowest regions of the house, there totarry until the storms, social and atmospheric, should beover.Meanwhile the night deepened-the stomn raged with-out, and Old Hurricane raged within.The lightning flashed, blaze upon blaze, with blindingglare. The thunder broke, crash upon crash, with deaf-ening roar. The wind, gathering all its force, cannonadedthe old walls Ps though it would batter down the house.The rain fell in floods. In the midst of all, the Demon'sRun, swollen to a torrent, was heard like the voice of a"roaring lion, seeking whom he might devour."Old Hurricane strode up and down the floor, groaning,swearing, threatening, and at every fresh blast of thestorm without, breaking forth into fury.Mrs. Condiment sat crouched in a corner, praying fer-vently every time the lightning blazed into the room,longing to go and join the men and maids in the nextapartment, yet fearing to stir from her seat lest sheshould attract Old Hurricane's attention, and draw downupon herself the more terrible thunder and lightning ofhis wrath. But to escape Old Hurricane's violence was<pb n="17"/>Cap's Visit to the Hidden House.         17not in the power of mortal man or woman. Soon hervery stillness exasperated him, and he broke forth upooher with:"Mrs. Condiment, mum, I don't know how you canbear to sit there so quietly and listen to this storm, know-in that the poor child is exposed to it?"Major Warfield, would it do any good for me to jumpup and trot up and down the floor, and go on as you do,even supposing I had the strength?" inquired the meekold lady, thoroughly provoked at his injustice."I'd like to see you show a little more feeling. Youare a perfect barbarian. Oh, Cap, my darling, where areyou now? Heavens! what a blast was thatl enough toshake the house about our earsl I wish it would-blamed if I don't.""Oh, major, major, don't say such awful things normake such awful wishes," said the appalled old ady;"you don't know what you might bring down upon us.""No, nor care; if the old house should tumble in, itwould bury under its ruins a precious lot of good-for-nthing people, unfit to live.

She has surely goneinto some house to remain until the storm is over," saidMrs. Condiment, soothingly.This speech, so well intended, exasperated Old Hur-ricane more than all the rest. Stopping, and striking hiscane upon the floor, he roared forth:"Hang it, mum! hold your foolish old tonguel Youknow nothing about it. Capitola is exposed to moreserious dangers than the elements. Perils of all sortssurround her. She should never, rain or shine, go outalone.

So, as the hoursipassed on, the storm having spent all its fury, gradu-ally grumbled itself into silence. Old Hurricane also raged into a state of exhaustionso complete, that when the midnight hour struck hecould only drop into a chair and nurmur:"Twelve o'clock, and no news of her yetl"And then, unwillingly, he went to bed, attended byMrs. Condiment and Pitapat instead of Wool, who wassupposed to be out in search of Capitola, but who was, infact, fast asleep on the floor of a dry cellar.'Meanwiile, 'where did this midnight hour find Capi-tola?CHAPTER III.THE HIDDEN       HOLLOW.n eve   side the aspect was the same,An rined, desolate, forlorn and savage,No hand or foot within the precinct cameTo rectify or ravage!Here Echo never mocked the human tongue;Some weighty crime that Heaven could not pardon,A secret curse on that old Building hung And its deserted Gardenl  -HooD'S HAUNTED HousE. Cap was a bit of a Don Quixote.

To seek and gaze upon the sombreise, of whch, and of whose inmates, such terribleries had been told or hinted, had always been a secretire and purpose of Captola.And now the presence there of a beautiful girl nearown age was the one last item that tipped the bal-:e, making the temptation to ride thither outweigh;ry other consideration of duty, prudence and safety.id having once started on the adventure, Cap felt theraction drawing her toiward the frightful hollow of thedden House growing stronger with every step takentherward.She reached the banks of the "Demon's Run," andk the left-hand road down the stream until she reachedleft point of the Horseshoe Mountain, and then go-up around the point, she kept close under the backthe range until she had got immediately in the rearthe round bend of the "Horseshoe," behind Hurri-ie Hall.'Well," said Cap, as she drew rein here, and lookedat the lofty ascent of gray rocks that concealed Hur-ane Hall, "to have had to come such a circuit around: outside of the 'Horseshoe,' to find myself just at theck of our old house, and no further from home thansl There's as many doubles and twists in theseruntains as there are in a lawyer's discourse!

But I suppose this path thatleads down. into the valley may conduct me to the build-ing! Come along, Gyp  You needn't turn up your headand pull at the bit! You've got to gol I am bound thisnight to see the outside of the Hidden House, sad thewindow of the haunted chamber at the very least," saidCap, throwing her eyes up defiantly toward the darken-ing sky, and putting whip to her unwilling horse.A  the path wound down into the valley the woodswere found deeper, thicker and darker. It occupied allCap's faculties to push her way through the overhang-ing and interlacing branches of the trees."Good gracious," she said, as she used her keft armrather vigorously to push aside the obstruction to herpath, "one would think this were the enchanted forestcontaining the castle of the sleeping beauty, and I wasthe knight destined to deliver herl I'm sure it wouldn'thave been more difficult."Still deeper fell the path, thicker grew the forest anddarker the way."Gyp, I'm under the impression that we shall haveto turn back yet," said Cap dolefully, stopping in themidst of a thicket so dense that it completely blockadedher further progress in the same direction. Just as shecame to this very disagreeable conclusion she spied anopening on her left, from which a bridle path struck out.Wfit an exclamation of jo, she immediately turned herhorse's head and struck into it. This path was veryrocky, but in some degree clearer than the other, and shewet on quickly, singing to herself, until graduallyher voice began to belot in the sound of many rush-ing waters.'It must be the Devil's Punch Bowl I am approachAng," she said to herself, as she went on.he was right. The roaring of the waters grew deaf-4ning, and the path became so rugged with jagged madirregularly piled rocks, that Cap could scarcely keep hec<pb n="21"/>The Hidden Hollow.               21horse upon his feet in climbing over them. 'And sud-denly, when she least looked for it, the great naturalcuriosity-the Devil's Pouch Bowl-burst upon herview.It was an awful abyss, scooped out as it were fromthe very bowels of the earth, with its steep sides rentopen in dreadful chasms, and far down in its fearfuldepths a bubbling whirlpool of black waters.Urging her reluctant steed through a thicket ofstunted thorns and over a chaos of shattered rocks,Capitola approached as near as she safely could to thebrink of this awful pit. So absorbed was she in gazingupon this terrible phenomenon of natural scenery thatshe had not noticed in the thicket on her right a lowhut that, with its brown-green moldering colors, fell sonaturally in with the hue of the surrounding scenerya esly to escape observation. She did not even ob-. .r.  e i*at the sky was entirely overcast, and the thunderjv   in the distance. She was aroused fromreverie by a voice near her asking:Asl  tlt dares to come without a guide.w& Bowl?"*      A#I0 muwmrd, and came nearer screaming_*W t )OeU in her life, upon seeing the ap-_   d befodre her.

I am Capitola Black, from Hurricane Hall; butwho, in the name of all the fates and furies are you?"inquired Capitola; who, in getting over the shock, hadrecovered her courage."I am Harriet, the Seeress of Hidden Hollow I" repliedthe apparition, in a melodramatic manner that wouldnot have discredited the Queen of Tragedy herself.6You have heard of me?"<pb n="22"/>a2           The Hidden Hollow."Yes, but I always heard you called Old Hat theWitch," said Cap."The world is profane-give me your hand," said thebeldame, reaching out her own to take that of Capitola."Stopl is your hand clean? It looks very black.""Cleaner than yours will be when it is stained withblood, young maiden.""Tutl-if you insist on telling my fortune, tell me apleasant one, and I will pay you double," laughed Capi-tola."The fates are not to be mocked. Your destiny willbe that which the stars decree. To prove to you thatI know this, I tell you that you are not what youhave been.""You've hit it this time, old lady, for I was a babyonce, and now I am a yotng girl," said Cap, laughing."You will not continue to be that which you are now "pursued the hag, still attentively reading the lines ofher subject's hand."Right againl for if I live long enough, I shall be anold woman.""You bear a name that you will not bear long.""I think that quite a safe prophecy, as I haven't themost distant idea of being an old maid.""This little hand of yours--bhis dainty wonan's hand--will be-red with blood.""Now, do you know, I don't doubt that, either? Ibelieve it altogether probable that I shall have to cookmy husband's dinner and kill the chickens for his soup.""Girl, beware you deride the holy stars !-and alreadythey are adverse to youl" said the hag, with a threaten-ing glare.nHa-ha-hal I love the beautiful stars, but do notfear them. I fear only Him who made the stars!""Poor butterfly, listen and bewarel-you are destinedto imbrue that little hand in the life current of one wholoves you the most of all on earth. You are destinedto rise by the destruction of one who would shed hisheart's best blood for you," said the beldame, in an awfulvoice.Capitola's eyes flashed. She advanced her horse a<pb n="23"/>The Hidden Hollow.               123step or two nearer the witch, and raised her riding-whip,saying:"I protest if you were only a man, I should lay thislash over your wicked shoulders until my arms ached!How dare you?

Her thoughts ran on all the horrible traditionsconnected with the Hidden House and Hollow-the mur- der and robbery of the poor peddler; the mysterious as- ;sassination of Eugene Le Noir; the sudden disappearanceof his youthful widow; the strange sights and sounds re- ported to be heard and seen abc it the mansion; the spec- tral light at the upper gable window; the white form seenflitting through the chamber; the pale lady that in the .dead of night drew the curtains of a guest that once had slept there; and above all, Capitols thought of the beau-tiful, strnge girl, wo was an inmate of that sinful andactcrsed house. And while these thoughts absorbed hermind, suddenly in a turning of the path she came fullupon the gloomy building.<pb n="25"/>CHAPTER IV.THt HIDDEN       HOUSt.The very stains and fractures on the wall,Assuming features solemn and terrific,Hinted some tragedy of that old hallLocked up in hieroglyphiclProphetic hints that filled the soul with dread;But to one gloomy window pointing mostly,The while some secret inspiration said,That chamber is the ghostly        - -HOOD.The Hidden House was a large, irregular edifice, ofdark red sandstone, with its walls covered closely withthe clinging ivy that had been clipped away only from afew of the doors and windows, and its roof over-hadowed by the top branches of gigantic oaks and elmsthat ltered around and nearly concealed the building.it mtight have been a long-forsaken house for any sign?.:,_H    b habitation that was to be seen about it.

So gee up, Dobbin," said Capitola, and urg-ing her horse with one hand, and holding on her cap withthe other, she went on against wind and rain until shelreached the front of the old house.Not a creature was to be seen; every door and window was closely shut. Dismounting, Capitola led her horsetrunder the shelter of a thickly-leaved old oak tree, se-cured him, and then holding up her saturated skirt with"one hand, and holding on her cap with the other, shewent up some mouldering stone steps to an old stone :;portico, and seizing the heavy iron knocker of a great' lack oak double door, she knocked loudly enough to awaken, all the mountain echoes.She waited a few minutes for an answer, bat receivingnone, she knocked again more loudly than before.

The door was unlocked andangrily jerkd open by a short, squarely-formed, beetlebrowed stern-looking woman, clothed in a black stuffgown, and having a stiff muslin cap upon her head."Who are you? What do you want here?" harshlydemanded this woman, whom    Capitola instinctivelyrecognized as Dorky Knight, the morose housekeeper ofthe Hidden House."Who am I? What do I want? Old Nick fly awaywithyou; it's plain enough to be seen who I am and whatI wat. I am a young woman caught out in the storm,and I want shelter " said Capitola, indignantly.

Thenshe heard the hall door cautiously opened and shut. Andfinally she distinguished the sound of wheels rolling awayfrom the house.Unable longer to restrain herself, she rapped and beat  Xupon her own door, crying aloud for deliverance.Presently the bolt was withdrawn, the door jerked open and Dorcas Knight, with a face of horror, stood before  iher."What is the matter?

What has been done?  Oh,Heaven t oh, Heaven, have mercy on us  Some dreadfuldeed has been done in thiS house to-night !'There was no more sleep for Clara. She heard theclock strike every hour from one to six in the morning,when she arose and dressed herself and went from herroom, expecting to see upon the floor and walls, andupon the faces of the household, signs of some dreadfultragedy enacted upon the previous night.But all things were as usual-the same dark, gloomyand neglected magnificence about the rooms and passages,the same reserved, sullen and silent aspect about thepersons.Dorcas Knight presided, as usual, at the head of thebreakfast table, and Craven Le Noir at the foot. Clarasat in her accustomed seat at the side, midway betweenthem.Clara shuddered in taking her cup of coffee from thehand of Dorcas, and declined the wing of fowl thatCraven Le Noir would have put upon her plate.Not a word was said upon the subject of the mystery ofthe preceding night, until Craven Le Noir, without ven-turning to meet the eyes of the young girl, said:"You look very pale, Clara!""Miss Day was frightened by the cats last night" saidDorcas.Clara answered never a word.

But, no sooer had he spoken these words thanhe saw bow greatly he had injured his cause, and re-pented them. Going to Clara, and intercepting her asshe was about to leave the room, he gently took her hand,and, dropping his eyes to the floor with a look of humilityand penience, he said:"Clara, my sweet cousin, I know not how sufficiently toexpress my sorrow at having been hurried into harshnesstoward you-towad you whom I love more than my ownsoul, and whom it is the fondest wish of my heart to call-wifel I can only excuse myself for this, or any futureextravagaone of manner, by my excessive love for youand the jealousy that maddens my brain at the bare men-ti oof my rival.

He had an ugly way ofscowling and biting his nails when deeply brooding overany subject, and now he walked slowly up and down thefloor with his head upon his breast, his brows drawn overhis nose, and his four fingers between his teeth, gnawingaway like a wild beast, while he muttered:"She is not like the other one!

She is too acute to be de-ceived and too firm to be persuaded. We must not hesitate touse the only possible means by which we can coerce her intoeompliance. I shall follow this letter by the firtst ageoach;and, before the beginning of the next month, Clam Day shall byour wife. Your affectionate father,GABmi  LAs NaomC La Nont, EsO., Hidden House.When Craven Le Noir read this letter, his thin, whiteface and deep-set eyes lighted up with triumph   BatCraven Le Noir huzzaed before he was out of the woods.He had not calculated upon Capitola.The next day Colonel Le Noir came to the HiddenHome. He arrived late in the afternoon.After refreshing himself with a bath, a change of cloth ing and a light luncheon, he went to the library, wherehe eassd the reminder of the evening in a confidentialMonerence with his son. Their supper was ordered to beserved up to them there. And for that one evening Clamlad the comfort of taking her tea alone.The result of this conference was that the next mornsig, after breakfast, Colonel Le Noir arose and courte-ously handed her to a chair, and then, seating himself be-side her, said:"My dear Clara, the responsibilities of a guardian arealways very onerous, and his duties not always veryageeable, especially when his ward is the sole heiress ofa large property and the object of pursuit by fortune-hunter and manceuverers, male and female. When suchis 4be case, the duties and responsbilities of the guardianare augmented a hundredfold."'ir, this cannot be so in my case, since you are per-feacly aware that my destiny is-humanly speaking-akeady decided," replied Clara, with gentle firmness."As how, I pray you, fair ward?""You cannot possibly be at a loss to understand, sir.You have been already advised that I am betrothed toDr. Rocke, who will claim me as his wife upon the daythat I shall complete my twenty-first year."Mihs Clara Day, no more of that, I beseech y     Itis folly, perversity, frenl   But, thanks to the wid  o<pb n="53"/>Cap Frees the Captive. legislators, the law very properly invests the guardianwith great latitude of discretionary power over the per-son and property of his ward-to be used, of course, forthat ward's best interest. And thus, my dear Clara, it ismy duty, while holding this power over you, to exerciseit for preventing the possibility of your ever, either nowor at any future time, throwing yourself away upon amere adventurer. To do this, I must provide you with asuitable husband. My son, Mr. Craven Le Noir, haslong loved and wooed you. He is a young man of goodreputation and fair prospects. I entirely approve hissuit, and, as your guardian, I command you to receivehim for your destined husband.""Colonel Le Noir, this is no time 'for bated breath andwhispered humbleness.' I am but a simple girl of seven-teen, but I understand your purpose and that of your son*just as well as though I were an old man of the world You are the fortune-hunters and manceuverers! It is thefortune of the wealthy heiress and friendless orphan thatyou are in pursuit of  But that fortune, like my handand heart, is already promised to one I love; and to speakvery plainly to you, I would die ere I would disappointhim or wed your son " said Clara, with invincible firm-'Die, girl? There are worse things than death in theworld I" said Colonel Le Noir, with a threatening glare."I know it! and one of the worst things in the worldwould be a union with a man I could neither esteemnor even endure " exclaimed Clara.Colonel Le Noir saw that there was no use in furtherdisguise. Throwing off, then, the last restraint of goodbreeding, he said:"And there are still more terrible evils for a womanthan to be the wife of one she 'can neither esteem norendure I'"Clara shook her head in proud scorn."There are evils, to escape which, such a woman wouldgo down upon her bended knees to be made the wife ofsuch a man!"Clara's gentle eyes flashed with indignation."Infamous " she cried. "You slander all womanhoodin my person I"<pb n="54"/>54          Cap Frees the Captive. "The evils to which I allude are-comprised in-a life of dishonor 1" hised Le Noir, through his set teeth."This to my father's daughter?" exclaimed Clara,growing white as death at the insult."Aye, my girl! It is time we understood each other You are in my power, and I intend to coerce you to mywill I"These words, accompanied as they were by a look thatleft no doubt upon her mind that he would carry out hispurpose to any extremity, so appalled the maiden's soulthat she stood like one suddenly struck with catalepsy.The unscrupulous wretch then approached her andsaid:"I am going now to the county seat to take out a mar-riage license for you and my son. I shall have the car-riage at the door by six o'clock this evening, when Idesire that you will be ready to accompany us to church,where a clerical friend will be in attendance to performthe marriage ceremony  Clara Day, if you would saveyour honor, look to this I"All this time Clara had neither moved, nor spoken,nor breathed. She had stood, cold, white and still, as ifturned to stone."Let no vain hope of escape delude your mind. Thedoors will be kept locked; the servants are all warned notto suffer you to leave the house. Look to it, Clara, forthe rising of another sun shall see my purpose accom-plished'l"And with these words the atrocious wretch left theroom. His departure took off the dreadful spell that hadparalyzed Clara's life; her blood began to circulate again;bream came to her lungs and speech to her lips."Oh, Lord," she cried; "Oh, Lord, who delivered thechildren from the fiery furnace, deliver thy poor hand-maiden now from her terrible foes."While thus she prayed, she saw upon the writing-tablebefore her a small penknife. Her cheeks flushed and hereyes brightened as she seized it:"This! this!" she said, "this small instrument, is suffi-cient to save me!

Andshe had only time to rise and put back her damp, dishev-elled hair from her tear-stained face, before the doorJopened and Dorcas Knight appeared, and said:"Here is this young woman come again I"And rudely ushering in Capitola, she closed the doorand retreated."I declare, Miss Day," said Cap, laughing, "you havethe most accomplished, polite and agreeable servants herethat ever I met with I Think with what a courteous wel-come this woman received me-'Here you are again 1' shesaid. 'You'll come once too often for your good, andthat I ttll you.' I answered that every time I came itapeared to be once too often for her liking. She re-jomed: 'The colonel has come home, and he don't likecampany, so I advise you to make your call a short one.'I assured her that I should measure the length of myviit by the breadth of my will-    But, good angels,Clara what is the matter?

Thatproves that suicide is never right, let the Roman pagamhave said and done what they pleased. So no more ofthat. There are enough other ways of escape for you.""Ahl what are they? You would give me life byteachig me how to escape 1" said Clar, fervently."The first and most obvious means that suggests itselfto my mind," said Cap, "is to-run away.""Ahl that is impossible  The servants are warned;the doors are all locked; I am watched !""Then the next plan is equally obvious; consent to gowith them to the church, and, when you get there, de-ounce them, and claim the protection of the clergyman I' Ahl dear girl, that is still more impracticable. Theoficiating clergyman is their friend; and, even if I couldconsent to act a deceitful part, and should go to churchas if to marry Craven, and, upon getting there, denouncehim, instead of receiving the protection of the clergyman,I should be restored to the hands of my legal guardian,and be brought back to meet a fate worse than death,"said Clara, in a tone of despair.Capitola did not at once reply, but fell into deepthought which lasted many minutes. Then, speakingmore gravely than she had spoken before, she said:"There is but one plan of escape left! your only re-maining chance, and that full of danger.""Ohl why should I fear danger? What evil can be-fall me so great as that which now threatens me?" saidClar"This plan requires, on your part, great courage, self-control and presence of mind."<pb n="58"/>58          Cap Frees the Captive."Teach me, teach me, dear Capitola I I will be an aptpupil I""I have thought it all out, and will tell you my plan.,-It is now eleven o'clock in the forenoon, and the carriage,is to come for you at six in the evening, I believe?" ?""Yes ! yes 1""Then you have seven hours in which to save yourself4And this is my plan: First, Clara, you must changedclothes with me, giving me your suit of mourning and put-ting on my riding-habit and veil.

She went softly to the door and turnedthe key in the lock, to prevent any one from lookingthrough the keyhole, murmuring, as she did it:"I wasn't brought up among the detective policemenfor nothing.Then she began to take off her riding-habit. Quicklyshe dressed Clara, superintending all the details of herdisguise as carefully as though she were the costumer ofa new debutante. When Clara was dressed, she was sonearly of the same size and shape of Capitola that, frombehind, no one would have suspected her identity."There, Clara, tuck your light hair out of the way;pull your cap over your eyes; gather your veil downclose; draw up your figure; throw back your head; walkwith a little springy sway and swagger, as if you didn'tcare a damson for anybody, and-there! I declare, no-body could tell you from me 1" exclaimed Capitola, in de-liht, as she completed the disguise and the instructionse. Clara.Then Capitola dressed herself in Clara's deep mourn-ing robes. And then the two girls sat down to composethemselves for a few minutes, while Capitola gave newand particular directions for Clara's course and conduct,so as to insure, as far as human foresight could do it,<pb n="60"/>#0          Cap Frees the Captive./ the safe termination of her perilous adventure. By the :Ome they had ended their talk, the hall clock strucktwelve."There, it is full time you should be off. Be calm, betool, be firm, and God bless you, Clara. Dear girl, if Iwere only a young man, I would deliver you by thestrength of my own arm, without subjecting you to in-convenience or danger," said Cap, gallantly, as she ledClara to the chamber door, and carefully gathered herveil in close folds over her face, entirely to conceal it."Oh, may the Lord in Heaven bless and preserve andreward you, my brave, my noble, my heroic Capitolat"said Clara, fervently, with the tears rushing to her eyes.""Bosh l" said Cap.

I ad-vise you not to come back again."Clara threw up her head with a swagger, and went on,"Very well, you may scorn my words, but, if you knowwur own good, you'll ollow my advice," said DorcasKnight, harshly.Cara threw up her head and passed out.           .Before the door Wool was waiting with the horses.Keeping her face closely muffled, Clara went to Capitola's0ony. Wool came and helped her into the saddle, saying: "Yer does right, Miss Cap, to keep yer face kivered;it's awful windy, ain't it, though? I kin scarcely keepthe hat from blowing offen my head."With an impatient jerk, after the manner of Capitola,Clara signified that she did not wish to converse.

Riding towardher, he exclaimed:-"'Deed, Miss Cap, yer mus' 'scuse me for speakin'now. Whar de mischief is ye a-goin' to?"For all answer, Clara, feigning the temper of Capitolasuddenly wheeled her horse, elevated her riding whip,and galloped upon Wool in a threatening manner.Wool dodged and backed his horse with all possibleexpedition, exclaiming, in consternation:"Darl dar, Mis Cap, I won't go for to ax you anymore questions-no-not if yer rides straight to OldNick, or Black Donald ]"Whereupon, receiving this apology in good part, Claragain turned her horse s head and rode on her way.Wool followed, bemoaning the destiny that kept himbetween the two fierce fires of his old master's despotismoud his young mistress' caprice, and muttering:"I know ole marse and dis young gal am going to bethe death of me.

And she put the piece in his hand andtook her pfaoe in the coach, which immediately started.As for Wool   From the time that Clara had throwsaside her veil and began to speak to him, he had stoodsteng and staring-his consternation growing and goi<pb n="62"/>ta          Cap Frees the Captive.ngm-until it had seemed to have turned him into stone-from whiah stage of petrif    he did not recovr untilhe saw the   goa    roll  ily away, carrying off-whom?

Ee-heel I do not want toeat," sobbed Cap, in a low and smothered voice. Anyone would have thought she was drowned in tears. "Very well-just as you like," said the woman, harshly,as she went away."Well, I declare," laughed Cap, "I did that quite aawell as an actress could  But now what am I to do?'How long can I keep this up?

But, however, I supposeiese men are no more particular about my costume thaney are about their own conduct," said Cap.She had just drawn on her gloves when she heard the ootsteps of two men approaching.

The Sabine women didnot love the Roman youths the less that they were forci-bly made wives by the;n.""Ee-hee    Ee-hee I Ee-hee " sobbed Cap, entirelyconcealing her face in her white cambric handkerchiefunder her impenetrable veil."Come, come I We lose time," said the elder Le Noir."Draw her arm within yours, Craven, and lead her out."The young man did as he was directed, and led Capfrom the room. It was now quite dark-the long, drearypassage was only dimly lighted by a hanging-lamp, sothat with the care she took there was scarcely a possi-bility of Capitola's being discovered. They went on,Craven Le Noir whispering hypocritical apologies, andCAp replying only by sobs.·When they reached the outer door, they found a closecrriage dravm  up before the house.To this Craven Le Noir led Capitola, placed her withinand took the eat by her side. Colonel Le Noir placedhimself on the front seat opposite them, and the carriagewas driven rapidly off.An hour's ride brought tfe party to an obscure churchin the depths of the forest, which Capitola recognized bythe cross on its top to be a Roman Catholic chapel.Here the carriage drew up and the two Le Noirs gotout and assisted Capitola to slght.They then led her into the church, which was dimlyillumined by a pair of wax candles burning before thealtar. A priest in his sacerdotal robes was in attendance.A few country people were scattered thinly about amongthe pews, at their private devotions.Guarded by Craven Le Noir on the right, and ColokmeLe Noir on the left, Capitola was marhed up the aisdand laced before the altar.<pb n="66"/>66             Cap in Captivity.Goonel Le Noir th      wat ad spoe apar to     edtYig priut, myiag, in a tone of dissatisfaction:1" told yo, i, thaas our bride was an rphan, reeltly bereaved, and still in deep mourning, we wishedthe marriage ceranony to be strictly private, and yougave me to understand, sir, that at this hour the chapelwas   ost likely to be vacant  Yet here I find half-a-esore of people. How Is this '"Sir," replied the priest, "it i true that at this hourof the evening the chapel is most likely to be vacant, butit is not therefore certain to be so, nor did I promise asmuch. Our chapel is, as you know, open at all hours ofthe day and night, that all who please may come andpray.

And so she just abandonedberself to the spirit of frolic thit poseseed her, and an.ticipated with the keenest relish the denouemt of herekrage adventure."'Wel, what are we waiting for? Proceed, air, prceed," said Colonel Le Noir, as he took Cap by the sboldes and placed her on the left side of his son, while hehtnself stood behind ready to 'give the bride away'The ceremony immediately commencedThe prologue beginning, "Dearly beloved we are gathred together hee, etc., etc., wa read.The solemn exhortation to the contracting partes comnmening, I require and charge ye both, as she  all an-swer i the dreadful day of judgment when the secretsof all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of youfnow any int cause or impedin    why ye  ay not belawfully jomed together  etc., etc., folowed.Capitola listened to all this with the deepest attention,saying to hbodsf: 'Well, I declaro this getting married<pb n="67"/>Cap in Captivity.               67ts really awfully interesting.

We'll see that presently," saidCap, to herself.The priest then turning toward the bride, inquired:"Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband,"etc., etc., etc., "so long as ye both shall live?"To which the bride, throwing aside her veil, answered,firmly:"No I not if he were the last man and I the last womanon the face of the earth, and the human race were aboutto become extinct, and the angel Gabriel came down fromabove to ask it of me as a personal favor."The effect of this outburst, this revelation, this explo-kWvn may be imagined, but can never be adequately de-The priest dropped his book, and stood with liftedtbmds And open mouth and staring eyes, as though he hacraised a ghostThe two e    Noirs simultaneously sprang forward'astonishment, disappointment and rage contending intheir blanched faces!"Who are you, girl?" exclaimed Colonel Le Noir."Capitola Black, your honor's glory I" she replied, mak-ing a deep courtesy."What the foul fiend is the meaning of all this?" inthe same breath inquired the father and son.Cap put her thumb to the side of her nose and whirl-ng her four fingers, replied:'It means, your worships' excellencies, that-you--can't-come it I it's no go I This chicken won't fight.

It means that you two, precious fand son, would be a pair of knaves if you had senenough; but, failing in that, you are only a pair of foox."By this time the attention of the few persons in thechurch was aroused. They all arose to their feet to lookand listen, and some of them left their places and ap-proached the altar. And to these latter Capitola now.suddenly turned and said, aloud:"Good people, I am Capitola Black, the niece and wardof Major Ira Wrfield, of Hurricane Hall, whom yoall mow,and now I claim your protection while I shalltell you the meaning of my presence here.""Dont listen to her! she is a maniac " cried Colonel Le Noir. "Stop her mouth I" cried Craven, springing upon CapiW  !tola, and holding her tightly in the grasp of his right arm .:while he covered her lips and nostrils with his large left .'hand.Capitola struggled so fiercely to free herself that Cra- :ven had enough to do to ho! A her, and so was not awareof a ringing footstep comins ap the aisle, until a stunningblow dealt from a strong ,..n covered his face with blood, and stretched him out at Capitola's feet.Cap, flushed, breathless and confused, looked up, andwas caught to the bosom of Herbert Greyson, who, pale with concentrated rage, held her closely and inquired:"Capitola, what violence is this which has been domEyou? Explain, who is the aggressor?""Wai-wai-wait until I get my breath t-there thatiwas good.

Let us go and pursueour fugitive ward," whispered Colonel Le Noir to his'son."We might as well; for it is clear that all is over here,"replied Craven.And the two baffled villains turned to leave the place.But Herbert Greyson, speaking up, said:"Good people! prevent the escape of those men untilwe hear what this young lady has to say, that we mayjudg  whether to let them go or to take them before aT' r people flew to the doors and windows and securediwn, and then surrounded the two Le Noirs, who foundthemselves prisoners."Now, Capitola, tell us how it is that you are here?"said Herbert Greyson."Well, that elder man," said Cap, "is the guardian ofa young heiress, who was betrothed to a worthy youngman, one Dr. Traverse Rocke.""My friend," interrupted Herbert."Yes, Mr. Greyson, your friend. The engagement wasapproved by the young lady's father, who gave them hisdying blessing. Nevertheless, in the face of all this, thisguardian here, appointed by the Orphans' Court to takecharge of the heiress and her fortune, undertakes, for hisown ends, to compel the young lady to break her en-gagement and marry his own son. To drive her to thismeasure, he does not hesitate to use every species ofcruelty. This night he was to have forced her to thisaltar. But, in the interval to-day, I chanced to visit her<pb n="70"/>70             Cap in Captivity.                 1her of her distressing situation, and having no timehelp her in any better way, I just changed clothes wiher.

Well, you see, Capitola, Icame down in the stage to Tip-Top, which I reachedabout three o'clock. And there I found Wool, in thehands of the Philistines, suspected of being mad, fromthe manner in which he raved about losing sight of you.Well, of course, like a true knight, I delivered my lady'ssquire, comforted and reassured him, and made himmount his own horse and take charge of yours. After'which I mounted the beast that I had hired to convey meto Hurricane Hall, and we set off thither. I confess thatI was excessively anxious on your account, for I couldmake nothing whatever of Wool's wild story of your sup-posed metamorphosis. I thought it best to make a cir-cuit, and take the Hidden House in our course, to make"me inquiries there as to what had really happened. Id got a little bewildered between the dark night ande stange road, and, seeing the light in the church, Iad just ridden up to inquire my way, when, to my aston-ishment, I saw you within, before the altar, struggling inthe grasp of that ruffian.

Alas t she couldnot now expect to hear her boy's light and springing stepand cheerful voice as he hurried home at eventide fromhis daily work. Traverse was far away at St. Louis,undergoing the cares and trials of a friendless youngphysician trying to get into practice. Six months hadpassed since he took leave of her, and ther. was as yet nohope of his returning even to pay a visit.o Marah sat very still and sad, bending over herneedlework, without ever turning her head in the direc-tion of the door. True, he wrote to her every week. NoWednesday ever passed without bringing her a letterwritten in a strong, buoyant and encouraging strain.Still she missed Traverse very sadly. It was dreary torise up in the empty house every morning; dreary to sitdown to her solitary meals, and drearier still to go to bedin her lonely room without having received her boy'skiss and heard his cheerful good-night. And it was hercustom every night to read over Traverse's last letter be-iole retiring to bed.It was getting on toward ten o'clock when she foldedup her work and put it away, and drew her boy's latestepistle from her bosom to read. It ran as follows:ST. Lous, Dec. i, I84-.MY DIArTsr MOTaE :-I am very glad to hear that you con-tinue in good health, and that you do not work too hard, ormiss me too sadly.

Yes, certainly; here it is. There, vou. Imay go now."She recognized the voice, and with a cry of joy jerked 'the door open just as the carriage rolled away. And thenext instant Clara Day was in her arms."Oh, my darlingl my darling! my darling! Is thisreally you?  Really, really you, and no dream?" cried <pb n="75"/>An Unexpected Visitor.              75Marah Rocke, all in a flutter of excitement, as she strainedClara to her bosom,"Yes, it is I, sweet friend; come to stay with you along time, perhaps," said Clara, softly, returning her,caresses."Oh, my lamb my lamb I What a joyful surprise  Ido think I shall go crazy! Where did you come from,my pet? Who came with you? When did you start?Did Le Noir consent to your coming? And how did ithappen? But, dear child, how worn and weary you look.You must be very tired. Have you had supper? Oh,my darling, come and lie down on this soft lounge, whileI put away your things and get you some refreshment,"said Marah Rocke, in a delirium of joy, as she took offClara's hat and sacque and laid her down to rest on thelounge, which she wheeled up near the fire."Oh, my sweet, we have been so anxious about you-Traverse and myself. Traverse is still at St. Louis, love,getting on slowly. He has written to you every week,and so, indeed, have I, but we neither of us have so muchas one letter in reply. And yet neither of us ever doubtedyour true heart, my child. We knew that the lettersmust have been lost, miscarried or intercepted," saidMarah, as she busied herself putting on the teakettle."They must, indeed, since my experience in regard toletters exactly corresponds  '  yours.

It will amuse youto lie and read it while I am getting tea," said Marah,taking the paper from her bosom and handing it to Clara,and then placing the stand with the light near the headof her couch, that she might see to read it without rising.And while Clara, well pleased, perused and smiled overher lover's letter, Marah Rocke laid the cloth and spread<pb n="76"/>76          An  Unexpected Visitor.a delicate repast of tea, milk toast and poachedggw, of which she tenderly pressed her visitor to pa r e.And when Clara was somewhat refreshedy food and rest, she said:                   /"Now, dear mamma, you will wish to hear how it hap-pens that I am with you tonight.""Not unless you feel quite rested, dear girl.""I am rested sufficiently for the purpose; besides, I amanxious to tell you. And, oh, dear mamma! I couldjust now sit in your lap, and lay my head upon your kind, soft bosom, so willingly.""Come, then, Clar. Come, then, my darling," saidMarah, tenderly, holding out her arms."No, no, mamma, you are too little, it would be a sin,"said Clara, smiling; "but I will sit by you ana put myhand in yours, and rest my head against your shoulderwhile I tell you all about it."Come, then, my darling," said Marah Rocke.Clara took the offered seat, and when she was fixed toher liking, she commenced and related to her friend afull history of all that had occurred to her at the HiddenHouse, from the moment that she had first crossed itsthreshold to the hour in which, through the courage andaddress of Capitola, she was delivered from imminentperil."And now," said Clara, in conclusion, "I have comehither in order to get Dr. Williams to make one moreappeal for me to the Orphans' Court. And when it isproved what a traitor my guardian has been to his trust, Ihave no doubt that the judge will appoint some one else in his place, or at least see that my father's last wish inregard to my residence is carried into effect.""Heaven grant it, my childl Heaven grant it! Oh,those Le Noirs those Le Noirs  Were there ever in theworld before such ruthless villains and accomplishedhypocrites I" said Marah Rocke, clasping her hands inthe strength of her emotions.A long time yet they talked together, and then theyretired to bed, and still talked until they fell asleep ineach other's arms. The next morning the widow arose early, gazed a little'<pb n="77"/>wA    Unexpected Visi r             77while with delight upon the sleeping da "8ier of herheart, pressed a kiss upon her chlik  ' kiy as not todisturb her rest, and the, leaving  't in the deep,sweet sleep of wearied youth, she wen. downstairs to geta nice breakfast.Luckily a farmer's cart was just passing the road be-fore the cottage on its way to market.Marah took out her little purse from her pocket, hailedthe driver, and expended half her little store in purchas-ing two young chickens, some eggs and some driedpeaches, saying to herself:"Dear Clara always had a good appetite, and healthyyoung human nature must live substantially, in spite ofall its little heartaches.".While Marah was preparing the chicken for the grid-iron, the door at the foot of the stairs opened, and Claracame in, looking, after her night's rest, as fresh as arosebud."Whatl up with the sun, my darlingl" said Marah,going to meet her."Yes, mamma.

Why, mamma? Why should I not taste oftoil and care as well as others a thousand times better thanmyself? Why should not I work as well as you andTraverse, mamma? I stand upon the broad platform ofhuman rights, and I say I have just as good a right towork as others," said Clara, with a pretty assumption ofobstinacy, as she placed the plate of toast upon the board."Doubtless, dear Clara, you may play at work just asmuch as you please; but Heaven forbid you should everhave to work at work I" replied Mrs. Rocke, as she placedthe coffeepot and the dish of broiled chicken on the table."Why, mamma? I do not think that is a good prayerat all. That is a wicked, proud prayer, Mrs. MarahRocke. Why shouldn't your daughter really toil as wellas other people's daughters, I'd like to be informed ?" saidClara, mockingly, as they both took their seats at thetable."I think, dear Clara, that you must have contractedsome of your eccentric little friend Capitola's ways, fromputting on her habit. I never before saw you in suchgay spirits," said Mrs. Rocke, as she poured out theooffee."Oh, mamma, it is but the glad rebound of the freedbird. I am so glad to have escaped from that dark prisonof the Hidden House, and to be here with you   Buttell me, mamma, is my old home occupied?""No, my dear; no tenant has been found for it. Theproperty is in the hands of an agent to let; but the houseremains quite vacant and deserted."<pb n="79"/>An Unexpected Visitor.             79'-Why is that?" asked Clara."Why, my love, for the strangest reason. The foolishcountry people say that since the doctor's death the placehas been haunted.""Haunted !""Yes, my dear, so the foolish people say, and they getwiser ones to believe them.""What exactly do they say? I hope-I hope they donot trifle with my dear father's honored name andmemory ?""Oh, no, my darling-no; but they say that, althoughthe house is quite empty and deserted by the living,strange sights and sounds are heard and seen by passers-by at night. Lights appear at the upper windows fromwhich pale faces look out.""How very strange!" said Clara."Yes, my dear, and these stories have gained suchcredence that no one can be found to take the house.""So much the better, dear mamma, for if the newjudge of the Orphans' Court should give a decision in ourfavor, as he must, when he hears the evidence, old andnew, you and I can move right into it, and need not thenenter the shirt-making line of business.""Heaven grant it, my dear. But now, Clara, my love,we must lost no time in seeing Dr. Williams, lest yourguardian should pursue you here and give you freshtrouble."Clara assented to this, and they immediately arose fromthe table, cleared away the service, put the room in order,and went upstairs to put ou their bonnets-Mrs. Rockelending Clara her own best bonnet and shawl. Whenthey were quite ready, they locked up the house and setout for the town.It was a bright, frosty, invigorating winter's morning,and the two friends walked rapidly until they reachedDr. Williams' house.The kind old man was at home, and was much sur-prised and pleased to see his visitors. He invited theminto his parlor, and when he had heard their story, hesaid:"This is a much more serious affair than the other.We must employ counsel. Witnesses must be brought<pb n="80"/>so          An Unexpected Visitor.from the neighborhood of the Hidden House. You areaware that the late judge of the Orphans' Court has beenappointed to a high office under the government at Washington. The man that has his place is a person ofsound integrity, who will do his duty. It remains onlyfor us to prove the justice of our cause to his satisfaction,and all will be well.""Oh, I trust in Heaven that it will be!" said Marah,fervently."You two must stay in my house until the affair is de-cided. You might possibly -be safe from real injury; butyou could not be free from molestation in your unpro-tected condition at the cottage," said Dr. Williams. Clara warmly expressed her thanks."You had better go home now and pack up what youwish to bring, and put out the fire, and close up the house,and come here immediately."In the meantime I will see your dear father's solicitor,and be ready with my report by the time you get back,"said Dr. Williams, promptly, taking his hat to go.Mrs. Rocke and Clara set out for the cottage, whichthey soon reached.Throwing off her bonnet and shawl, Clara said:"Now, mamma, the very first thing I shall do will beto write to Traverse, so that we can send the letter byto-day's mail, and set his mind at rest. I shall simplytell him that our mutual letters have failed to reach theirdestination, but that I am now on a visit to you, and that,while I remain here nothing can Interrupt our correspondsCence. I shall not speak of the coming suit, until we shalltsee how it will end."Mrs. Rocke approved this plan, and placed writingmaterials on the table. And, while the matron employedherself in closing up the rooms, packing what was needfulto take with them to the doctor's, and putting out thefire, Clara wrote and sealed her letter. They then put ontheir bonnets, locked up the house, and set out. Theycalled at the post office just in time to mail their letter, and they reached the doctor's house just as he himself iwalked up to the door, accompanied by the lawyer. The latter greeted the daughter of his old client and let ^..<pb n="81"/>Cap Spoils for a Fight.             81In the doctor's study the whole subject of Clara's flight,and its occasion, was talked over, and the lawyer agreedto commence proceedings immediately.CHAPTER XLCAP SPOILS FOR A FIGHT.'Tis hardly in a body's power,To keep at times frae being sour,To see how things are sharediHow best o' chiels are whiles m want,While coofs and countless thousands rat,And ken na how to wear't.        -B-w.eaving Clara Day and Marah Rocke in a home ofafety, plenty and kindness, in the old doctor's houe, wemust run down to Hurricane Hall, to see what mischiefCap has been getting into since we left her. In truth,none. Cap had had such a surfeit of adventures that shewas fin to la by and rest upon her laurels  Besides,tere seemed, just now, nothing to do-no tyrants totke down, no robbers to capture, no distressed damselsto deliver, and Cap was again in danger of "spoiling foraigh"    And then Herbert Greyson was at the Hall-eretGreyson who, she vowed, always did make afs Nancy of herl And so Cap had to content herselffor a week with quiet mornings of needlework at herworkstand, with Herbert to read to or talk to her; soberafternoon rides, attended by Herbert and Old Hurricane;and humdrum evenings at the chessboard, with the sameHerbert, while Major Warfield dozed in a great "sleepyhollow of an armchair.One afternoon, when they were out riding through thewoods beyond the Demon's Run, a sheriffs officer rodeup, and, bowing to the party, presented a suspicious-look-ing document to Capitola, and a similar one to HerbertGreyson. And, while Old Hurricane stared his eyes halfout, the parties most interested opened the papers,which they found to be rather pressing invitations to bepresent at a certain solemnity at Staunton. In a word<pb n="82"/>82          Cap Spoils for a Fightthey were subpoenad to give testimony in the case of  'Williams vs. Le Noir.                             'd"Here's a diabolical dilemma " said Old Hurricane to himself, as soon as he learned the purport of these docu-ments; "here I shall have to bring Cap into court, face  'to face with that demon, to bear witness against him.Suppose, losing one ward, he should lay claim to another IAhl but he can't without foully criminating himself.Well, well, we shall see l"While Old Hurricane was cogitating, Cap was exult-ing."Oh, won't I tell all I knowl Yes, and more, tool"she exclaimed, in triumph."'More too !' Oh I hoity-toity I never say 'more too!' "said Herbert, laughing."I will, for I'll tell all I suspect 1" said Cap, gallopingon ahead, in her eagerness to get home and pack up forher journey.The next day, Old Hurricane, Herbert Greyson, Capi-tola, Pitapat and Wool went by stage to Staunton. Theyput up at the Planters' and Farmers' Hotel, whence Her-bert Greyson and Capitola soon sallied forth to see Claraand Mrs. Rocke. They soon found the doctor's house,and were ushered into the parlor, in the presence of theirfriends.The meeting between Capitola and Clara and betweenMrs. Rocke and Herbert was very cordial. And then Herbert introduced Capitola to Mrs. Rocke, and Cappresented Herbert to Clara. And they all entered intoconversation upon the subject of the coming lawsuit, andthe circumstances that led to it. And Clara and Capitolarelated to each other all that had happened to each aftertheir exchanging clothes and parting. And, when theyhad laughed over their mutual adventures and misadven-tures, Herbert and Capitola took leave and returned to their hotel.Herbert Greyson was the most serious of the wholefamily. Upon reaching the hotel, he went to his ownroom, and fell into deep reflection. And this was the  Xcourse of his thoughts:"Ira Warfield and Marah Rocke are here in the same Itown, brourht hither upon the same errand, to-morror  |<pb n="83"/>Cap Spoils tor a Fight             8)to meet in the same courtroom I And yet neither of themsuspects the presence of the other. Mrs. Rocke does notknow that in Capitola's uncle she will behold Major War-field I He does not foresee that in Clara's matronly friendhe will behold Marah Rocke. And Le Noir, the cause ofall their misery, will be present also. What will be theeffect of this unexpected meeting? Ought I not to warnone or the other? Let me think. Nol for, were I towarn Major Warfield, he would absent himself. ShouldI drop a hint to Marah, she would shrink from the meet-ing. No, I will leave it all to Providence; perhaps hersweet, pale face and soft, appealing eyes, so full of con-stancy and truth, may touch that stern old heart. Heavengrant it may l" concluded Herbert Greyson.The next day the suit came on.At an early hour Dr. Williams appeared, having incharge Clara Day, who was attended by her friend, Mrs.Rocke. They were accommodated with seats immedi-ately in front of the judge.Very soon afterward Major Warfield, Herbert Greysonand Capitola entered, and took their places on the wit-nesses' bench, at the right side of the courtroom.Herbert watched Old Hurricane, whose eyes wereepembound to the bench where sat .- . Rocke and Clara.Both were dressed in deep mour.  a, with their veilsdown and their faces toward the judge. But Herbertdreaded every instant that Marah Rocke should turn herhead and meet that fixed, wistful look of Old Hurricane.And he wondered what strange instinct it could be thatriveted the old man's regards to that unrecognizedwoman.At last, to Herbert's great uneasiness, Major Warfieldturned and commenced questioning him."Who is that woman in mourning?""Hem-m-that one with the flaxen curls under hesbonnet is Miss Day.""I don't mean the girl; I mean the woman sitting byher?"'"That is--hem--em l-that is Dr. Williams sit.ting---"Dld Hurricane turned abruptly around, and favored hisnephew with a severe, scrutinizing gaze, demanding;<pb n="84"/>84          Cap Spoils for a Fight "Herbert, have you been drinking so early in the morn-ing? Demmy, sir! this is not the season for mint julepsbefore breakfast! Is that great, stout, round-bodied, red-faced old Dr. Williams a little woman? I see him, sit-ting on the right of Miss Day. I don't refer to him. Ireferred to that still, quiet little woman sitting on herleft, who has never stirred hand or foot since she satdown there. Who is she?""That woman?-oh !-she?-yes-ah, let me see-sheis a-Miss Day's companion I" faltered Herbert."To the demon with you! who does not see that? Butwho is she? What is her name?" abruptly demanded OldHurricane."Her name is a-a-did you ever see her before, sir?""I don't know. That is what I am trying to remem-ber. But, sir, will you answer my question?""You seem very much interested in her.""You seem very much determined not to let me knowwho she is ! Hang it, sirl will you, or will you not, tellme that woman's name?""Certainly," said Herbert; "her name is--"  He wasabout to say Marah Rocke, but moral indignation over-powered him, and he paused."Well, well, her name is what?" impatiently demandedOld Hurricane."Mrs. Warfieldl" answered Herbert, doggedly.And just at that unfortunate moment Marah turnedher pale face and beseeching eyes around and met thefull gaze of her husband In an instant her face, blanched to marble, and her headsank upon the railing before her bench. Old Hurricanewas too dark to grow pale, but his bronzed cheek turnedas gray as his hair, which fairly lifted itself on his head.Grasping his walking-stick with both hands, he totteredto his feet, and muttering:"Ill murder you for this, Herbert I" he strode out ofthe courtroom.Marah's head rested for about a minute on the railingbefore her, and when she lifted it again, her face was as calm and patient as before.This little incident had passed without attracting atten-tion from any one except Capitola, who, sitting on He<pb n="85"/>Cap Spoils for a Fight             85other side of Herbert Greyson, had heard the little pas.sage of words between him and her uncle, and had seenthe latter start up and go out, and who now, turning toher companion, inquired:"What is the meaning of all this, Herbert?""It means-Satan I And now attend to what is goingon. Mr. Sauter has stated the case, and now Stringfel-low, the attorney for the other side, is just telling thejudge that he stands there in the place of his client, Lieu-tenant-Colonel Le Noir, who, being ordered to join Gen-eral Taylor in Mexico, is upon the eve of setting out andcannot be here in person.""And is that true? Won't he be here?""T+ seems not. I think he is ashamed to appear afterX. a has happened, and just takes advantage of a fairexcuse to absent himself.""And is he really going to Mexico?""Oh, yes. I saw it officially announced in this omrn-ing's papers. And, by-the-by, I am very much afraidhe is to take command of our regiment, and be my su-perior officer I""Oh, Herbert, I hope and pray not  I think there iswickedness enough packed up in that man's body to sinka squadron or lose an army I""Well, Cap, such things will happen. Attention!There's Sauter, ready to call his witnesses." And, intruth, the next moment Capitola Black was called to thestand.Cap took her place, and gave her evidence con amore,and with such vim and such expressions of indignationthat Stringfellow reminded her she was there to givetestimony, and not to plead the cause.Cap rejoined that she was perfectly willing to do both IAnd so she continued not only to tell the facts, but toexpress her opinions as to the motives of Le Noir, andgive her judgment as to what should be the decision ofthe court.Stringfellow, the attorney for Colonel Le Noir, evi-;dently thought that in this rash, reckless, spirited witnesshe had a fine subject for sarcastic cross-examination.But he reckoned "without his host." He did not knowCap. He, too, "caught a Tartar." And, before the cross<pb n="86"/>86          Cap Spoils for a Fight examination was concluded, Capitola's apt and cuttingreplies had overwhelmed him with ridicule and confusion,and done more for the cause of her friend than all herpartisans put together.Other witnesses were called to corroborate the testi-mony of Capitola, and still others were examined to provethe last expressed wishes of the late Wiliam Day in re-gard to the disposal of his daughter's person during theperiod of her minority. There was no effective rebutting evidence, and, aftersome hard arguing by the attorneys on both sides, thecase was closed, and the judge deferred his decision untilthe third day thereafter.The parties then left the court, and returned to theirseveral lodgings.Old Hurricane gave no one a civil word that day.Wool was an atrocious villain, an incendiary scoundrel,a cutthroat, and a black demon. Cap was a beggar, avagabond, and a vixen. Herbert Grayson was anotherbeggar, -besides being a knave, a fop, and an impudent .puppy. The inn-keeper was a swindler, the waitersthieves, the whole world was going to ruin, where it welldeserved to go, and all mankind to the demon-as hehoped and trusted they would And all this tornado of passion and invective arose just because he had unexpectedly met in the courtroomthe patient face and beseeching eyes of a woman, married :and forsaken, loved and lost, long agolWas it strange that Herbert, who had so resented his treatment of Marah Rocke, should bear all his fury, in-justice and abuse of himself and others with such com- passionate forbearance? But he not only forebore to  Iresent his own affronts, but also besought Capitola tohave patience with the old man's temper, and apologizedto the host, by saying that Major Warfield had been very severely tried that day, and, when calmer, would be thefirst to regret the violence of his own words.Marah Rocke returned, with Clara, to the old doctor's ihouse. She was more patient, silent and quiet than be :j'fore. Her face was a little paler, her eyes softer, and hertones lower-that was the only visible effect of the morn-ing's unexpected recontre. <pb n="87"/>Cap Spoils for a Fight             87The next day but one all the parties concerned assem-bled at the courthouse to hear the decision of the judge.It was given, as had been anticipated, in the favor ofCTara Day, who was permitted, in accordance with herfather's approved wishes, to reside in her patrimonialhome, under the care of Mrs. Marah Rocke. Colonel LeNoir was to remain trustee of the property, with direc-tions from the court immediately to pay the legacies leftby the late Dr. Day to Marah Rocke and Traverse Rocke,and also to pay to Clara Day, in quarterly instalments,from the revenue of her property, an annual sum ofmoney, sufficient for her support.This decision filled the hearts of Clara and her friendswith joy. Forgetting time and place, she threw herselfinto the arms of Marah Rocke and wept with delight.All concerned in the trial then sought their lodgings.Clara and Mrs. Rocke returned to the cottage to makepreparations for removing to Willow Heights.Dr. Williams went to the agent of the property, torequire him to give up the keys, which he did withouthesitation.Old Hurricane and his party packed up, to be readyfor the stage to take them to Tip-Top the next day.But that night a series of mysterious events were saidto have taken place at the deserted house at WillowHeights that filled the whole community with supersti-tious wonder. It was reported by numbers of gardenersand farmers who passed that road on their way to earlymarket that a perfect witches' Sabbath had been held inthat empty house all night; that lights had appeared flit-ting from room to room; that strange, weird faces hadlooked out from the windows, and wild screams hadpierced the air!The next day, when this report reached the ears ofClara, and she was asked by Dr. Williams whether shewould not be afraid to live there, she laughed gayly, andbade him try her.Cap, who had come over to take leave of Clara, joinedher in her merriment, and declared that she, for her part,doted on ghosts, and that, after Herbert Greyson's de-parture, she should come and visit Clara and help herto entertain the spectres.<pb n="88"/>88                Black Donald.Clara replied that she should hold her to her promise.AMd so the friends kissed and separated.That same day saw several removals.Clara and Mrs. Rocke took up their abode at WillowHeights, and seized an hour, even of that busy time, towrite to Traverse and apprise him of their good fortune.Old Hurricane and his party set out for their home,where they arrived before nightfall.And the next day but one Herbert Greyson took leaveof his friends and departed to join his company on theirroad to glry.CHAPTER XII.BLACK DONALD.Feared, shunned, belied, ere youth had lost her force,He hated me too much to feel remorse,And thought the vice of wrath a sacred call,To pay the injuries of some on alLThere was a laughing devil in his sneer,That caused emotions both of rage and fear;And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,Hope, withering, fled, and mercy sighed farewell !-Bvaow.Herbert Greyson had been correct in his conjectureconcerning the cause of Colonel Le Noir's conduct inabsenting himself from the trial, or appearing there onlyin the person of his attorney. A proud, vain, conceitedman, full of Joseph Surfaceisms, he could better haveborne to be arraigned upon the charge of murder than toface the accusation of baseness that was about to beproved upon him. Being reasonably certain as to whatwas likely to be the decision of the Orphans' Court, hewas not disappointed in hearing that judgment had beenrendered in favor of his ward and her friends. His onegreat disappointment had been upon discovering the flight':of Clara. For, when he had ascertained that she hadfled, he knew that all was lost-and lost through Capi-tola-the hated girl for whose destruction he had now  "another and a stronger motive-revenge. In this mood of mind, three days before his departure<pb n="89"/>Black Donald.                 89To join his regiment, he sought the retreat of the outlaw.He chose an early hour of the evening, as that in whichhe should be most likely to find Black Donald.It was about tight o'clock when he wrapped his largecloak around his all figure, pulled his hat low over hissinister brows, and set out to walk alone to the secretcavern in the side o0 the Demon's Punch Bowl.The night was dark and the path dangerous; but hisdirections had been cageful, so that when he reached thebrink of that awful abyss, he knew precisely where tobegin his descent with the least danger of being precipi-tated to the bottom.And, by taking a strong hold upon the stunted sap-lings of pine and cedar that grew down through the cleftsof the ravine, and placing his feet firmly upon the pointsof projecting rocks, he contrived to descend the inside ofthat horrible abysm, which, from the top, seemed fraughtwith certain death to any one daring enough to make theattempt.When about half-way down the precipice, he reachedthe clump of cedar bushes growing in the deep cleft, andconcealing the hole that formed the entrance to thecavern.Here he paused, and, looking through the entranceinto a dark and apparently fathomless cavern, he gavethe peculiar signal whistle, which was immediately an-swered from within by the well-known voice of the out-law chief, saying:"All right, my colonel. Give us your hand. Be care-ful now; the floor of this cavern is several feet below theopening."Le Noir extended his hand into the darkness within,and soon felt it grasped by that of Black Donald, who,muttering, "Slowly, slowly, my colonel " succeeded inguiding him down the utter darkness of the subterra-nean descent, until they stood upon the firm bottom ofthe cavern.They were still in the midst of a blackness that mightbe felt, except that, from a small opening in the side ofthe rock, a light gleamed. Toward this second openingBlack Donald conducted his patron, and, stooping andpassing before him, led him into an inner cavern, well<pb n="90"/>90               Black Donald lighted and rudely fitted up. Upon a large natural plat. form of rock, occupying the center of the space, were Isome dozen bottles of brandy or whisky 'several loaves of bread and some dried venison. Wound this rude'table, seated upon fragments of rock, tugged thither for ^the purpose, were some eight or ten men of the band, invarious stages of intoxication. Along the walls were piles of bearskins, some of which served as couches for six ;or seven men, who had thrown themselves down upon them, in a state of exhaustion or drunken stupor."Come, boys, we have not a boundless choice of apart- ments here, and I want to talk to my colonel. Suppose you take your liquor and bread and meat into the outercavern, and give us the use of this for an hour," said ,the outlaw.The men sullenly obeyed, and began to gather up theviands. Demon Dick seized one of the lights to go after them."Put down the glim. Satan singe your skin for you!Do you want to bring a hue and cry upon us? Don't youknow a light in the outer cavern can be seen from the outside?" roared Black Donald.Dick sulkily set down the candle, and followed hiscomrades."What are you glummering about? Confound you!You can see to eat and drink well enough, and find yourway to your mouth in the dark, you brutel" thunderedthe captain.But, as there was no answer to this, and the men hadretreated and left their chief with his visitor alone, BlackDonald turned to Colonel Le Noir, and said: "Well, my patron, what great matter is it that hascaused you to leave the company of fair Clara Day for our grim society?""Ah, then it appears you are not aware that Clara Dayhas fled from us! has made a successful appeal to the Orphans' Court, and been taken out of our hands?" an- grily replied Colonel Le Noir."Whe-ew    My colonel, I think I could have managed .that matter better.

These volunteers were nowbeing daily drilled at their quarters in the city, and wereonly waiting the arival of the vessel to be enrolled in theregiment.One morning, a few days after the ship reached harbor,Herbert Greyson went on shore to the military ren-dezvous to see the new recruits exercised. While hestood within the inclosure, watching their evolutions,under the orders of an officer, his attention became con-centrated upon the form of a young man of the rank andfile who was marching in a line with many others having their backs turned toward him. That form and gaitseemed familiar-under the circumstances in which he :saw them again-painfully familiar. And yet he could not identify the man. While he gazed, the recruits, at the. 'word of command, suddenly wheeled and faced about. And Herbert could scarcely repress an exclamation ofastonishment and regret.That young man in the dress of a private soldier was Clara Day's betrothed, the widow's only son, Traverse' Rocke I While Herbert continued to gaze in surprise andgrief, the young recruit raised his eyes, recognized hisfriend, flushed up to his very temples, and cast his eyesdown again. The rapid evolutions soon wheeled themaround, and the next order sent them into their quarters.Herbert's time was also up, and he returned to his'duty.The next day Herbert went to the quarters of the newrecruits, and sought out his young friend, whom he foundloitering about the grounds. Again Traverse blushed :deeply as the young lieutenant approached.

Many a privatein the ranks has risen to be a general officer," replied\Herbert, encouragingly.Traverse laughed good-humoredly, saying:"It does not look much like that in my case. Thisdress," he said, looking down at his coarse, ill-fittinguniform, cowhide shoes, etc.-"this dress, this drilling,these close quarters, coarse food and mixed company, isenough to tke the military ardor out of any one."Traverse, you talk like a dandy, which is not at allyour character.

In aninstant he was sorry for having spoken thus, for Traverse,with all his soul in his eyes, asked, eagerly:"Why-why, Herbert?

Then you may be able to giveme news of Clara and my dear mother 1" exclaimed Trav-erse, eagerly."Yes, I am-pleasant news," said Herbert, hesitatingin a manner in which no one ever hesitated before incommunicating good tidings."Thank Heaven I oh, thank Heaven!

Show me the fullmeasure of the happiness I have so recklessly squanderedaway," exclaimed Traverse, desperately."I will sit beside you and tell you everything you wishto know, on condition that you stop berating yourself ina manner that fills me with idignation," replied Herbert,as they went to a distant part of the dusty inclosure andtook their seats upon a rude bench."Oh, Herbert, bear with me; I could dash my wild,impatient head against a stone wall l""That would not be likely to clear or strengthen yourbrains," said Herbert, who, thereupon, commenced andod Traverse the whole history of the persecution of<pb n="100"/>loo                  Glory!Clara Day at the Hidden House; the interception of heyletters; the attempt made to force her into a marriagewith Craven Le Noir; her deliverance from her enemielby the address and courage of Capitola; her flight to.Staunton and refuge with Mrs. Rocke; her appeal to thecourt and finally her success and her settlement underthe charge of her matronly friend at Willow Heights.Traverse had not listened patiently to this account. Heheard it with many bursts of irrepressible indignation and many involuntary starts of wild passion. Toward thelast he sprang up and down, chafing like an angry lion in ..his cage."And this man," he exclaimed, as Herbert concluded,-"this demon-this beast-is now commanding officerlthe colonel of our regiment!""Yes," replied Herbert, 'but as s',*h you must not callhim names; military rules are desr- '-; and this man'who knows your person, and knows you to be the be.;,trothed of Clara Day, whose hand and fortune he covets'for his son, will leave no power, with which his corn-mand invests him, untried, to ruin and destroy youlTraverse, I say these things to you, that being 'fore-"warned' you may be 'forearmed.'

This scheme was to procure his free dblo<pb n="101"/>Gloryl vcharge before they should set sail for the Rio Grande.He had many influential friends among the officers ofhis regiment, and he was resolved to tell them as muchas was delicate, proper and useful for them to know ofthe young recruit's private history in order to get theirco-operation.Herbert spent every hour of this day and the next,when off duty, in this service of his friend. He found hisbrother officers easily interested, sympathetic and propi-tious. They united their efforts with his own to procurethe discharge of the young recruit; but in vain I the powerof Colonel Le Noir was opposed to their influence, andthe application was peremptorily refused.Herbert Greyson did not sit down quietly under thisdisappointment, but wrote an application, embodying allthe facts of the case to the Secretary of War, got it signedby all the officers of the regiment, and dispatched it bythe first mail.Simultaneously he took another important step for theinterest of his friend. Without hinting any particularmotive, he had begged Traverse to let him have his photo-graph taken, and the latter, with a laugh, at the lover-like proposal, had consented. When the likeness wasfinished, Herbert sent it by express to Major Warfield,accompanied by a letter describing the excellent characterand unfortunate condition of Traverse, praying the Ma-jor's interest in his behalf, and concluded by saying:"You cannot look upon the accompanying photographof my friend and any longer disclaim your own expressimage in your son."How this affected the action of Old Hurricane will beseen hereafter.Traverse, knowing nothing of the efforts that had beenand were still being made for his discharge, sufferedneither disappointment for failure of the first, nor anxietyfor the issue of the last.He wrote to his mother and Clara, congratulating themon their good fortune, telling them that he, in commonwith many young men of St. Louis, had volunteered forthe Mexican War; that he was then at New Orleans, enroute for the Rio Grande, and that they would be pleasedto know that their mutual friend, Herbert Greyson, was<pb n="102"/>102                   Glorylan officer in the same regiment of which he himself waspresent a private, but with strong hopes of soon winnhis epaulettes.

It was colder than the coldest.He had not loved Clara; though, for the sake of hermoney, he had courted her so assiduously. Indeed, forthe doctor's orphan girl, he had from the first conceiveda strong antil athy. His evil spirit had shrunk from herpure soul with the loathing a fiend might feel for an an-gel. He had found it repugnant and difficult, almost tothe extent of impossibility, for him to pursue the court-ship to which he was only reconcilea by a sense of dutyto-his pocket.It was reserved for his meeting with Capitola, at thealtar of the Forest Chapel to fire his clammy heart, stag-nant blood and sated senses, with the very first passionthat he had ever known. Her image, as she stood thereat the altar with flashing eyes and flaming cheeks andscathing tongue, defying him, was ever before his mind'seye. There was something about that girl so spirited, sopiquant and original, that she impressed even his apa-thetic nature as no other woman had ever been able to<pb n="104"/>o14       Cap Captivates a Craven. do. But what, most of all, attracted him to Capitola,her diableriel He longed to catch that little savagehis bosom and have her at his mercy. The aversionhad exhibited toward him only stimulated his passion.Craven Le Noir, among his other graces, was gitwith inordinate vanity. He did not in the least degrdespair of overcoming all Capitola's dislike to his person and inspiring her with a passion equal to his own. He knew well that he dared not present himselfHurricane Hall, but he resolved to waylay her in herides, and there to press his suit. To this he was urgby another motive almost as strong as love-namely,avarice.He had gathered thus much from his father, that Capiltola Black was supposed to be Capitola Le Noir, the rightful heiress of all that vast property in land, houses, irand coal mines, foundries and furnaces, railway shares,etc., and bank notes, from which his father drew thyprincely revenue that supported them both in their lavishfextravagance of living.As the heiress, or rather the rightful owner of all thisvast fortune, Capitola was a much greater "catch" thagpoor Clara, with her modest estate, had been. And Mr',Craven Le Noir was quite willing to turn the tables onhis father by running off with the great heiress, and stepfrom his irksome position of dependent upon ColondLe Noir's often ungracious bounty to that of the husbandof the heiress and the master of the property. Added teithat was another favorable circumstance, namely, wherebe had had a strong personal antipathy to Clara, he had adstrong an attraction to Capitola, which would make hiscourse of courtship all the pleasanter.In one word, he resolved to woo, win and elope with%`or forcibly abduct, Capitola Le Noir, marry her, and'then turn upon his father and claim the fortune in right'of his wife. The absence of Colonel Le Noir in Mexic'ffavored his projects, as he could not fear interruption.Meanwhile, our little madcap remained quite uncosscious of the honors designed her. She had cried evr-day of the first week of Herbert's absence; every alteday of the second; twice in the third; once in the fournot at all in the fifth, and the sixth week she was qui<pb n="105"/>ap Captivates a Craven.           soherself again,  full of fun and frolic and as ready forany mischief oreviltry that might turn up.She resumed h   rides, no longer followed by Wool,whom Old Hurricae, partly upon account of his misad-venture in having had the misfortune inadvertently "tolose sight of" his mistress upon that memorable occasionof the metamorphosis of 'ap into Clara, and partly be-cause in the distant absence of Le Noir, Old Hurricanedid not consider his favorite ; danger.He little knew that a subtle and unscrupulous agent hadbeen left sworn to her destruction, and that another in-dividual, almost equally dangerous, had registered a se-cret vow to run off with her.Neither did poor Cap, when, rejoicing to be free fromthe dogging attendance of Wool, imagine the perils towhich she was exposed, nor is it even likely that if shehad, she would have cared for them in any other mannerthan as promising piquant adventures. From childhoodshe had been inured to danger, and had never sufferedharm; therefore, Cap, like the Chevalier Bayard, was"without fear and without reproach."Craven Le Noir proceeded cautiously with his plans,knowing that there was time enough, and that all mightbe lost by haste. He did not wish to alarm Capitola.The first time he took occasion to meet her in her rideshe merely bowed deeply, even to the flaps of his saddle,and with a melancholy smile passed on."Miserable wretch, he is a mean fellow to want tomarry a girl against her will, no matter how much hemight have been in love with her; and I am very glad Ibalked him  StillL he looks so ill and unhappy that-Ican't help pitying him!" said Cap, looking compassion-ately at his white cheeks and languishing eyes, and littleknowing that the illness was the effect of dissipation, andthat the melancholy was assumed for the occasion.A few days after this, Cap again met Craven Le Noir,who again, with a deep bow and sad smile, passed her."Poor fellow  he richly deserves to suffer, and I hopeit may make him better, for I am right down sorry forhim; it must be so dreadful to lose one we love! but itwas too base in him to let his father try to compel her tohave himl Suppose, now, Herbert Greyson was to take<pb n="106"/>zo6       Cap Captivates a Cravena fancy to another girl, would Ilt undego to himput a pistol to his head, and say: 'Cais fond of you varlet! and demmy, sir! you sg  marry noneher, or receive an ounce of lead in your stupid brNo, I'd scorn it!

However, he still determined to be cautiousand not ruin his prospects by precipitate action, but t"hasten slowly."So the next time he met Capitola he raised his eyeswith one deep, sad, appealing gaze to hers, and then bow-ing profoundly, passed on."Poor man I" said Cap to herself, "he bears no malitoward me for depriving him of his sweetheart, that'certain. And badly as he behaved, I suppose it was for love; for I don t know how any one could live in thsame house with Clara and not be in love with her.

I can do nothing to relieve him.'I'm  sure if I could, I would. 'But the way oftransgressors is hard,' Mr. Le Noir, and he who sins usuffer" "For about three weeks their seemingly accidental meet-Qings continued in this silent manner, so slowly did Cravensmake his advances. Then, feeling more confidence, hmade a considerably long step forward.One day, when he guessed that Capitola would beinstead of meeting her as heretofore, he put himself <pb n="107"/>.

Miss Black, will you permit me now to as-sure you of my profound repentance of that act, and toimplore your pardon.""Oh, I have nothing against you, Mr. Le Noir. It wasnot I whom you were intending to marry against my will IAnd as for what you said and did to me, ha-ha  I hadprovoked it, you know, and I also afterward paid it inkind! It was a fair fight, in which I was victor; andvictors should never be vindictive " said Cap, laughing,for though knowing him to have been violent and unjust,she did not suspect him of being treacherous and deceit-ful, or imagine the -base designs concealed beneath hisplausible manner. Her brave, honest nature could under-stand a brute and a despot, but not a traitor."Then like frank enemies who have fought their fightout, yet bear no malice toward each other, we may shakehands and be friends, I hopel" said Craven, replying inthe same spirit in which she had spoken."Well, I don't know about that, Mr. Le Noir  Friend-ship is a very sacred thing, and it's name should not belightly taken on our tongues. I hope you will excuse meif I decline your proffer," said Cap, who had a well ofdeep, true, earnest feeling beneath her effervescentsurface."What! you will not even grant a repentant man yourfriendship, Miss Black?" asked Craven, with a sorrow-ful smile."I wish you well, Mr. Le Noir. I wish you a good andtherefore a happy life; but I cannot give you friendshipfor that means a great deal."<pb n="108"/>to8       Cap Captivates a Craven.       //"Oh, I see how it is! You cannot give yor frienship where you cannot give your esteem.  it not so"Yes," said Capitola, "that is it; yet I wish you so.well that I wish you might grow worthy of higher esteemwthan mine.""You are thinking of my-yes, I will not shrink from,characterizing that conduct as it deserves-my unpardon.;-able violence toward Clara. Miss Black, I have mournedthat sin from the day that I was hurried into it until this. .I have bewailed it from the very bottom of my heart,"'hsaid Craven, earnestly fixing his eyes with an expressionof perfect truthfulness upon those of Capitola."I am glad to hear you say so," said Cap.      ;"Miss Black, please to hear this in palliation-I will not presume to say in defense-of my conduct; I was 'driven to frenzy by a passion of contending love and jeal-&sousy, as violent and maddening as it was unreal andtransient  But that delusive passion has subdued, and.:among the unmerited mercies for which I have to be,thankful is that, in my frantic pursuit of Clara Day, I was'inot cursed with success. For all the violence into'which that frenzy drove me I have deeply repented. I'can never forgive myself, but-cannot you forgive me?""Mr. Le Noir, I have nothing for which to forgive'you. I am glad that you have repented toward Clara,and I wish you well, and that is really all that I can say.'""I have deserved this, and I accept it," said Craven, 'in a tone so mournful that Capitola, in spite of all her.'instincts, could not choose but pity him.He rode on, with his pale face, downcast eyes and melancholy expression, until they reached a point at theback of Hurricane Hall where their paths diverged.Here Craven, lifting his hat and bowing profoundly, ..isaid, in a sad tone:"Good-evening, Miss Black."And, turning his horse's head, took the path leading down into the Hidden Hollow."Poor young fellow I He must be very unhappy down ;'in that miserable place; but I can't help itl I wish hewould go to Mexico with the rest," said Cap, as she pur-. sued her way homeward.Not to excite her suspicion, Craven Le Noir avoided.<pb n="109"/>Cap Captivates a Craven.           109meeting Capitola for a few days, and then threw himselfin her road, and, as before, allowed her to overtake him.Very subtilely he entered into conversation with her,and guarding every word and look, took care to interest,without alarming her. He said no more of friendship,but a great deal of regret for wasted years and wastedtalents in the past, and good resolutions for the future.And Cap listened good-humoredly. Capitola being ofa brave, hard, firm nature, had not the sensitive percep-tions, fine intuitions and true insight into character thatdistinuished the more refined nature of Clara Day-orat least, she had not these delicate faculties in the sameperfection. Thus her undefined suspicions of Craven'ssincerity were overborne by a sort of noble benevolencewhich determined her to think the best of him which cir-cumstances would permit.Craven, on his part, having had more experience, wasmuch wiser in the pursuit of his object; he had alsothead.vantage of being in earnest; his passion for Capitola wassincere, and not, as it had been in the case of Clara, simu-lated; he believed, therefore, that when the time shouldbe ripe for the declaration of his love, he would have amuch better prospect of success, especially as Capitola, inher ignorance of her own great fortune, must consider hisproposal the very climax of disinterestedness.After three more weeks of riding and conversing withCapitola, he had, in his own estimation, advanced so farin her good opinion as to make it perfectly safe to risk adeclaration. And this he determined to do upon the veryfirst opportunity.Chance favored him.One afternoon Capitola, riding through the pleasantwoods skirting the back of the mountain range thatsheltered Hurricane Hall, got a fall, for which she wasafterward inclined well to cuff Wool.It happened in this way: She had come to a steep risein the road, and urged her pony into a hard gallop, in-tending, as she said to herself, to "storm the height,"when suddenly, under the violent strain, the girth, ill-fastened, flew apart, and Miss Cap was on the ground,buried under the fallen saddle.With many a blessing upon the carelessness of the<pb n="110"/>10o       Cap Captivates a Craven.grooms, Cap picked herself up, put the saddle on thehorse and was engaged in drawing under the girth whenCraven Le Noir rode up, sprang from his horse, and withanxiety depicted on his countenance, ran to the spot, in-quiring:"What is the matter? No serious accident, I hope andtrust, Miss Black?""No; those wretches in uncle's stable did not halfbuckle the girth, and as I was going in a hard gallop up the steep, it flew apart and gave me a tumble, that's all" isaid Cap, desisting a moment from her occupation to takebreath."You were not hurt?" inquired Craven, with deep in-terest in his tone. "Oh, no! there was no harm done, except to my ridingskirt, which has been torn and muddled by the fall," saidCap, laughing, and resuming her efforts to tighten thegirth."Pray permit me," said Craven, gently taking the endof the strap from her hand; "this is no work for a lady,and is, besides, beyond your strength."Capitola thanking him, withdrew to the side of the roadand seating herself upon the trunk of a fallen tree, beganto brush the dirt from her habit.Craven adjusted and secured the saddle with greatcare, patted and soothed the pony, and then approachingCapitola in the most deferential manner, stood before herand said: "Miss Black, you will pardon me, I hope, if I tell youthat the per I had imagined you to be in, has so agitatedmymind as to make it imossible for me longer to with-hold a declaration of my sentiments"-here his voice that had trembled throughout this disclosure, now really andutterly failed him.Capitoa looked up with surprise and interest; she had never in her life before heard an explicit declaration of love from  anybody. She and Herbert somehow hadalways understood each other very well, without ever aword of technical love-making passing between them; soCapitoa did not exactly know what was coming next Craven recovered his voice; and, encouraged by the ifavorable manner in which she appeared to listen to hia, '<pb n="111"/>Cap Captivates a Craven             IIactually threw himself at her feet and seizing one of herhands, with much ardor and earnestness and much moreeloquence than any one would have credited him with,poured forth the history of his passion and his hopes."Well, I declare I" said Cap, when he had finished hisspeech and was waiting in breathless impatience for heranswer; "this is what is called a declaration of love and aproposal for marriage, is it? It is downright sentimental,I suppose, if I had only the sense to appreciate it! It isas good as a play! Pity it is lost upon me " "Cruel girl I how you mock me!" cried Craven, risingfrom his knees and sitting beside her."No, I don't! I'm in solemn earnestl I say it is firstrate! Do it again! I like it!""Sarcastic and merciless one, you glory in the pain yougive! But if you wish again to hear me say I love you,I will say it a dozen-yes, a hundred times over if youwill only admit that you could love me a little in return I""Don't! that would be too tiresome! Two or threetimes is quite enough! Besides, what earthly good couldmy saying 'I love you,' do?""I might persuade you to become the wife of one whowill adore you to the last hour of his life 1""Meaning you I""Meaning me, the most devoted of your admirers l""That isn't saying much, since I haven't got any butyou !""Thank fortune for it! Then I am to understand,charming Capitola, that at least your hand and your af-fections are free," said Craven, joyfully."Well, now, I don't know about that. Really, I can'tpositively say I But it stikes me, if I were to get marriedto anybody else, there's somebody would feel queerish 1""No doubt there are many whose secret hopes wouldbe blasted, for so charming a girl could not have passedthrough this world without having won many hearts, whowould keenly feel the loss of hope, in her marriage I Butwhat if they do, my enchanting Capitola? You are notresponsible for any one having formed such hopes I""Fudge !" said Cap. "I'm no belle never was nevercan be! have neither wealth, beauty nor coquetry enoughto make me one! I've no lovers or admirers to break<pb n="112"/>12       Cap Captivates a Craven.their hearts about me, one way or another; but thaneone honest fellow-hem! never mind; I feel as if Ilonged to somebody else; that's all. I am very obliged to you, Mr. Le Noir, for your preference, aeven for the beautiful way in which you have expreit, but-I belong to somebody else.""Miss Black," said Craven, somewhat abashed but ndiscouraged, "I think I understood you I I presume that;you refer to the young man who was your gallant chamt-pion in the Forest Chapel.""The one that made your nose bleed I" said the in-'corrigible Cap."Well, Miss Black, from your words it appears that thisis by no means an acknowledged, but only an understood engagement, which cannot be binding upon either partyl.Now a young lady of your acknowledged good sense-- -tl"I never had any more good sense than I have hadadmirers," interrupted Cap.Craven smiled."I would not hear your enemy say that," he repliedithen resuming his argument, he said:"You will really understand, Miss Black, that the vagueengagement of which you speak, where there is wantfortune on both sides, is no more prudent than it is binding. On the contrary, the position which it is my pridto offer you, is considered an enviable one, even apafrom the devoted love that goes with it. You are awarthat I am the sole heir of the Hidden House estate, which,with all its dependencies, is considered the largest prietary, as my wife would be the most important lady the country."Cap's lip curled a little; looking askance at him, sheanswered:"I really am very much obliged to you, Mr. Le Noir,for the distinguished honor that you designed for me. Ishould highly appreciate the magnanimity of a yogentleman, the heir of the wealthiest estate in the nborhood, who deigns to propose marriage to the litlbeggar that I acknowledge myself to be. I regret to iobliged to refuse such dignities, but-I belong *l<another l" said Capitola, rising and advancing toward horse.<pb n="113"/>Cap Captivates a Craven.           t11Craven would not risk his success by pushing his suitfarther at this sitting.Very respectfully lending his assistance to put Capitolainto her saddle, he said he hoped at some future, andmore propitious time, to resume the subject. And then,with a deep bow, he left her, mounted his horse and rodean his way.He did not believe that Capitola was more than half inearnest, or that any girl in Capitola's circumstances woulddo such a mad thing as to refuse the position he offeredher.He did not throw himself in her way often enough toexcite her suspicion that their meetings were precon-terted on his part, and even when he did overtake her,r suffer her to overtake him, he avoided giving her of-nse by pressing his suit until another good opportunityJlould offer. This was not long in coming.One afternoon he overtook her and rode by her sidefor a short distance, when finding her in unusually goodspirits and temper, he again renewed his declaratio oflove and offer of marriage.Cap turned around in her saddle and looked at himwith astonishment for a full minute before she exclaimed:"Why, Mr. Le Noir, I gave you an answer more thana week ago. Didn't I tell you 'No'? What on earth doyou mean by repeating the question ?""I mean, bewitching Capitola, not to let such a treas-ure slip out of my grasp, if I can help it?""I never was in your grasp, that I know of I" said Cap,whipping up her horse, and leaving him far behind.Days passed before Craven thought it prudent again torenew and press his suit. He did so upon a fine Sep-tember morning, when he overtook her riding along thebanks of the river. He joined her, and, in the most dep-recating manner, besought her to listen to him once more.Then he commenced, in a strain of the most impassioned,eloquence, and urged his love and his proposal.Capitola stopped her horse, wheeled around and facedhim, looking him full in the eyes, while she said:"Upon my word, Mr. Le Noir, you remind me of ananecdote told of young Sheridan. When his father ad-viaed him to take a wife and settle, he replied by asking<pb n="114"/>114       Cap Captivates a Craven.whose wife he should take l Will nobody serve yourpurpose but somebody else's sweetheart? I have told youthat I belong to a brave young soldier who is fighting hiscoutry's battles in a foreign land, while you are lazinghere at home, trying to undermine him! I am ashamedof you, sir! and ashamed of myself for talking with youso many times  Never do you presume to accost me onthe highway, or anywhere else, again  Craven by name,and craven by nature, you have once already felt theweight of Herbert's arm. Do not provoke its second de-scent upon you! You are warned!" And with that,Capitola, with her lips curled, her eyes flashing, and hercheeks burning, put whip to her pony and gallopedaway.Craven Le NW's thin, white face grew perfectly lividwith passion."I will have her yet  I have sworn it, and, by fairmeans or by foul, I will have her yet !" he exclaimed, ashe relaxed his hold upon his bridle and let his horse goon slowly, while he sat with his brows gathered over histhin, white nose, his long chin buried in his neckcloth,and his nails between his teeth, gnawing like a wildbeast, as was his custom when deeply cogitating.Presently he conceived a plan so diabolical that nonebut Satan himself could have inspired it  This was totake advantage of his acquaintance and casual meetingswith Capitola, so to malign her character as to make itunlikely that any honest man would ever risk his honorby taking her to wife; and he resolved, if possible, toeffect this in such a manner-namely, by jests, innuen-does and sneers, that it should never be directly tracedto a positive assertion on his part. And, in the meantime,he determined so to govern himself in his deportmenttoward Capitola as to arouse no suspicion, give no of-fanse, and, if possible, win back her confidence.It is true that even Craven Le Noir, base as he was,shrank from the idea of smirching the reputation of thewoman of whom he wished to make a wife; but, then, hesaid to himself that In that remote neighborhood thescandal would be of little consequence to him, who, as soon as he should be married, would claim the estate of the Hidden Home in right of his wife, put it in charg <pb n="115"/>Cap's Rage.                  11of an overseer, and then, with his bride, start for Paris,the paradise of the epicurean, where he designed to fixtheir principal residence.Craven Le Noir was so pleased with his plan that heimmediately set about putting it in execution. Our nextchapter will show how he succeeded.CHAPTER XV.CAP'S RAcIs he not approvtd to the height of a villain, who bath slan-dered, scorned, dishonored thy inswoman  Oh that I were aman for his sake, or had a friend who would be one for minel-SBAESPFAZ.Autumn brought the usual city visitors to HurricaneHall to spend the sporting season and shoot over MajorWarfield's grounds. Old Hurricane was in his glory,giving dinners and projecting hunts.Capitola also enjoyed herself rarely, enacting withmuch satisfaction to herself and guests her new r6le ofhostess, and not infrequently joining her uncle and hisfriends in their field sports.Among the guests, there were two who deserve particu-lar attention, not only because they had been for manyyears annual visitors of Hurricane Hall, but more espe-cially because there had grown up between them and ourlittle madcap heroine a strongr .rutuol confidence andfriendship. Yet no three personrm p   uossibly be moreunlike than Capitola and the two oosins of her soul, asshe called these two friends. They were both distant rel-atives of Major Warfield, and, in his right of this rela-tionship, invariably addressed Capitola as "Cousin Cap."John Stone, the elder of the two, was a very tall, stout,squarely-built young man, with a broad, good-humoredface, fair skin, blue eyes, and light hair. In temperamenthe was rather phlegmatic, quiet and lazy. In  hanracterhe was honest, prudent and good-tempered. In circum-stances he was a safe banker, with a notable wife and twohealthy children. The one thing that was able to excitehis quiet nerves was the dase, of which he was as fond<pb n="116"/>no               Cap's Rage.                   'as he could possibly be of any amusement. The one son who agreeably stirred his rather still spirits was omlittle Cap, and that was the secret of his friendship foher.Edwin Percy, the other, was a young West Indian, taand delicately formed, with a clear olive complexionlanguishing, dark-hazel eyes, and dark, bright-chestnuthair and beard. In temperament he was ardent as hialclime. In character, indolent, careless and self-indul-'gent. In condition he was the bachelor heir of a sugarplantation of a thousand acres. He loved not the chase,nor any other amusement requiring exertion. He doted;upon swansdown sofas with springs, French plays, cigars,and chocolate. He came to the country to find reposegood air, and an appetite. He was the victim of constitutional ennui that yielded to nothing but the exhilaration of Capitola's company; that was the mystery of hilove for her, and doubtless the young Creole would havproposed for Cap had he not thought it too much troublto get married, and dreaded the bustle of a bridal Certainly Edwin Percy was as opposite in character to JohStone as they both were to Capitol, yet great was threlative attraction among the three. Cap impartialldivided her kind offices as hostess between them.John Stone joined Old Hurricane in many a hard day'shunt, and Capitola was often of the party.Edwin Percy spent many hours on the luxurioulounge in the parlor, where Cap was careful to placestand with chocolate, cigars, wax matches and his favorjite books.One day Cap had had what she called "a row with thgovernor," that is to say, a slight misunderstanding witMajor Warfield; a very uncommon occurrence, as threader knows, in which that temperate old gentlehad so freely bestowed upon his niece the names o"beggar, foundling, brat, vagabond and vagran thCapitola, in just indignation, refused to join the birdinparty, and, taking her game-bag, powder-flask, shot-hoand fowling-piece, and, calling her favorite pointwalked off, as she termed it, "to shoot herself." Bif Capitola's by no means sweet temper had been <pb n="117"/>Cap's Rage.                117that morning, it was destined to be still more severelytested before the day was over.Her second provocation came in this way: John Stone,another deserter of the birding party, had that day be-taken himself to Tip-Top upon some private business ofhis own. He dined at the Antlers in company with somesporting gentlemen of the neighborhood, and, when theconversation naturally turned upon field sports, Mr. JohnStone spoke of the fine shooting that was to be hadaround Hurricane Hall, when one of the gentlemen,looking straight across the table to Mr. Stone, said:"Ahem l-that pretty little huntress of Hurricane Hall-that niece, or ward, or mysterious daughter of OldHurricane, who engages with so much enthusiasm inyour field-sports over there, is a girl of very free and easymanners, I understandl-a Diana in nothing but her loveof the chase!""Sirl it is a base calumnyl and the man who endorsesit is a shameless slandererl There is my card! I may befound at my present residence, Hurricane Halll" saidJohn Stone, throwing his pasteboard across the table,and rising to leave it."Nay, nay," said the stranger, laughing and pushingthe card away. "I do not endorse it," said the youngman. And then upon Mr. Stone's demanding the authorof the calumny, he gave the name of Mr. Craven LeNoir, who, he said, had "talked in his cups" at a dinnerparty recently given by one of his friends."I pronounce-publicly, in the presence of an thesewitnesses, as I shall presently to Craven Le Noir him-self-that he is a shameless miscreant who has baselyslandered a noble girl! You, sir have declined to in-dorse those words; henceforth decline to repeat themlFor after this I shall call to a severe account any manwho ventures, by word, gesture, or glance, to hint thisslander, or in any other way deal lightly with the honor-able name and fame of the lady in question. Gentlemen,I am to be found at Hurricane Hall, and I have thehonor of wishing you a more improving subject of con-versation, and-a very good afternoon," said John Stone,bowing and leaving the room.He immediately called for his horse and rode home.<pb n="118"/>18                Cap's Rage.In crossing the thicket of woods between the river andthe rising ground in front of Hurricane Hall, he over-took Capitola, who, as we have said, had been out alonewith her gun and dog, and was now returning homewith her game-bag well laden.Now, as John Stone looked at Capitola, with her reck-less, free and joyous air, he thought she was just thesort of a girl, unconsciously, to get herself and friendsinto trouble. And he thought it best to give her a hintto put an abrupt period to her acquaintance, if she hadeven the slightest, with the heir apparent of the HiddenHouse.While still hesitating how to begin the conversation,he came up with the young girl, dismounted, and, leadinghis horse, walked by her side, asking carelessly:"What have you bagged, Cap?""Some partridges. Oh, you should have been out witme and Sweetlips! we've had such sport! But, anyhow,you shall enjoy your share of the spoils! Come home,and you shall have some of these partridges broiled forsupper, with currant sauce-a dish of my own invention,for uncle's sake, you knowl he's such a gourmand!""Thank you, yes; I am on my way home now. Hem-mCapitola, I counsel you to cut the acquaintance of ou.neighbor, Craven Le Noir."'I have already done so; but-what in the world is thematter that you should advise me thus?" inquired Capitola, fixing her eyes steadily upon the face of John Stoneiwho avoided her gaze, as he answered:"The man is not a proper associate for a younwoman.""I know that, and have cut him  accordingly; butCousin John, there is some reason for your words, thayou have not expressed; and, as they concern me, now, Iisist upon knowing what they are.""Tut! it is nothing," said the other, evasively."John Stone, I know betterl and the more you ldown and whip your boot, the surer I am that there  isomething I ought to know, and I will know I""Well, you termagantl have your way t-he hasspeaking lightly of you-that's all! nobody minds himhis tongue is no scandal." <pb n="119"/>Cap's Rage.                 119"John Stone, what has he said?" asked Capitola, draw-ing her breath hardly between her closed teeth.'Oh, now, why should you ask? It is nothing; it isnot proper that I should tell you," replied that gentleman,in embarrassment." 'It is nothing,' and yet 'it is not proper that youshould tell me!' How do you make that out? JohnStone I leave off lashing the harmless bushes and listen tome! I have to live in the same neighborhood with thisman, after you have gone away, and I insist upon know-ing the whole length and breadth of his baseness andlmalignity, that I may know how to judge and punishhim!" said Gapitola, with such grimness of resolution,that Mr. Stone, provoked at her perversity, answered:"Well, you willful girl, listen !" And commencing, hemercilessly told her all that had passed at the table.To have seen our Cap, then  Face, neck and bosomwere flushed with the crimson tide of indignation!"You are sure of what you tell me, Cousin John?""The man vouches for it.""He shall bite the dust!""What ?""The slanderer shall bite the dust!"Without more ado, down was thrown gun, gamebag,powder-flask and shot-horn, and bounding from point topoint over all the intervening space, Capitola rushed intoHurricane Hall, and without an instant's delay ranstraight into the parlor, where her epicurean friend, theyoung Creole, lay slumbering upon the lounge.With her face now livid with concentrated rage, andher eyes glittering with that suppressed light peculiar tointense passion, she stood before him and said:"Edwin, Craven Le Noir has defamed your cousin get up and challenge him!""What did you say, Cap?" said Mr. Percy, slightlyyawning."Must I repeat it?

In an instant she was down in theyard, where her groom was holding her horse ready, incase she wished to take her usual ride."Where is Mr. John Stone?" she asked."Down at the kennels, miss," answered the boy.She jumped into her saddle, put whip to her horse, andflew over to the mansion-house and the kennels.She pulled up before the door of the main building,sprang from her saddle, threw the bridle to a man inattendance, and rushed into the house and into the pres-ence of Mr. John Stone, who was busy in prescribing foran indisposed pointer.He looked up in astonishment, exclaiming:"Hello all the witches here's Capl Why, where onearth did you shoot from ?

You look asif you were in a state of spontaneous combustion, andcouldn't stand it another minute.""And I can'tl and I won'tl John Stone, you mustcall that man out!""What man, Cap-what the deuce do you mean ?""You know well enough I you do this to provoke me I mean the man of whom you cautioned me this after-noon! the wretch who slandered me, the niece of yourhost!""Whe-ew l""Will you do it?""Where's Percy?""On the lounge, with an ice in one hand and a nov Iin the other!

And, sosaying, she flung herself out of the building and into hersaddle, put whip to her horse, and galloped away home.Now, Mr. Stone had privately resolved to thrashCraven Le Noir; but he did not deem it expedient to takeCap into his confidence. As Capitola reached the horse-block, her own groom came to take the bridle."Jem," she said, as she jumped from her saddle, "putGyp up, and then come to my room; I have a messageto send by you."And then, with burning cheeks and flashing eyes, shewent to her own sanctum, and, after taking off her habit,did the most astounding thing that ever a woman of thenineteenth, or any former century, attempted-she wrotea challenge to Craven Le Noir-charging him with false-hood, in having maligned her honor; demanding fromhim "the satisfaction of a gentleman," and requestinghim, as the challenged party, to name the time, place andweapons with which he would meet her.By the time she had written, sealed and directed thiswarlike defiance, her young groom made his appearance."Jem," she asked, "do you know the way to the Hid-den House?""Yes, miss, sure.""Then take this note thither, ask for Mr. Le Noir, putit into his hands, and say that you are directed to wait ananswer. And, listen, you need not mention to any one inthis house where you are going; nor, when you return,where you have been; but bring the answer you may getdirectly to this room, where you will find me.""Yes, miss," said the boy, who was off like a flyingMercury.Capitola threw herself into her chair, to spend the slowhours until the boy's return as well as her fierce impa-tience and forced inaction would permit.At tea-time she was summoned, but excused herselffrom going belc.. upon a plea of indisposition."Which is perfectly true," she said to herself, "since Iam utterly indisposed to go.

Why did her eyes contract and glitter like stiletos?

Here a graveand unexpected obstacle mei her; she had always beenaccustomed to kneel and offer up to Heaven her eveningstribute of praise and thanksgiving for the mercies of theday, and prayers for protection and blessing through thenight.Now she knelt, as usual, but thanksgiving and prayerseemed frozen on her lips. How could she praise or praywith such'a purpose as she had in her heart?For the first time, Capitola doubted the perfect right-eousness of that purpose which was of a character toarrest her prayers upon her lips.With a start of impatience and a heavy sigh, she sprangup and hurried into bed.She did not sleep, but lay, tossing from side to side, infeverish excitement, the whole night-having, in fact, aterrible battle between her own fierce passions and herbewly-awakened conscience.Nevertheless, she arose by daybreak in the morning,dressed herself, went and unlocked her drawer, took outthe pistols, carefully loaded them, and laid them downfor service.Then she went downstairs, where the servants wereonly just beginning to stir, and sent for her groom, Jem,whom she ordered to saddle her pony, and also get ahorse for himself, to attend her in a morning ride.After which she returned upstairs, put on her riding-habit, and buckled around her waist a morocco belt, intowhth she stuck two revolvers. She then threw around<pb n="126"/>126       Capitola Caps the Climax.her shoulders a short circular cape, that concealed 4weapons, and put on her hat and gloves, and went belShe found her little groom already at the door with horses.

She knew, from the early hour of the day, that could not possibly be ahead of her, and she rode slowly, to give him an opportunity to overtake her.Probably Craven Le Noir was later that morning thusual, for Capitola had reached the entrance of the viage before she heard the sound of his horse's feet apreaching behind her.She did not wish that their rencontre should be inStreets of the village, so she instantly wheeled her and galloped back to meet him.As both were riding at full speed, they soon met.She first drew rein, and, standing in his way, accosthim with:"Mr. Le Noirl""Your most obedient, Miss Black," he said, withdeep bow."I happen to be without father or brother to prme from affront, sir, and my uncle is an invalid veterwhom I will not trouble.

He has been taken to the Antlers, where helies in articulus mortis, and we wish him to be confrontedwith Miss Capitola Black, the young woman here pres-ent, that he may identify her, whom he accuses of havingfired six charges into him, before his death. She needn'tdeny it, because he is ready to swear to herl" said Mr.Merry, who constituted himself spokesman."She accuses herself," said the magistrate, in dismay."Then, sir, had she not better be taken at once to thepresence of Mr. Le Noir, who may not have many min-utes to live?""Yes, come along," said Cap. "I only gave myself upto wait for this; and as he is already at hand, let's goand have it all over, for I have been riding about in thisfrosty morning air for three hours, and I have got agood appetite, and I want to go home to breakfast.""I am afraid, young woman, you will scarcely gethome to breakfast this morning," said Mr. Merry."We'll see to that presently," answered Cap, com-posedly, as they all left the office, and crossed the streetto the Antlers.They were conducted by the landlord to a chamber oF<pb n="130"/>130       Capitola Caps the Climax.the first floor, where upon a bed lay stretched, without breath or motion, the form of Craven LeHis face was still covered with blood, that the bysbad scrupulously refused to wash off until theof the magistrate.

Then turning to the landlord, he said:"Sir, it would be charity in you to put a messenger onhorseback and send him to Hurricane Hall for MajorWarfield, who will have to enter into a recognizance forMiss Black's appearance at court.""Stop," said Cap, "don't be too certain of thatl 'Bealways sure you're right-then go ahead!'

Then turning toward thegroup around the bed, she said: "You have heard Mr. Le Noir's 'last dying speecihand confession,' as he supposed it to be, and you knowUthe maddening provocations that inflamed my t   lemer/against him. Last night, after having received his m i-suiting answer to my challenge, there was evil in mpheart, I do assure you  I possessed myself of my uncle srevolvers, and resolved to waylay him this morning, and .force him to give me satisfaction, or, if he refused-well,no matter!

The ;next morning I drew the charges of the revolvers, and re- loaded them with poor powder and dried peas. Every- 'thing else has happened just as he has told you. He hasreceived no harm, except in being ter.ibly frightened, andin having his beauty spoiled --and as for that, didn't I offer him one of the pistols, and expose my own face tosimilar damage?-for I'd scorn to take advantage of anyone 1" said Cap, laughing.Craven Le Noir had now raised himself up in a sittingpsure, and was looking around with an expression of countenance which was a strange blending of relief atthis unexpected respite from the grave and intense morti-fication at finding himself in the ridiculous position in which the address of Capitola and his own weak nerve, dcowardice and credulity had placed him.Cap went up to him and said, in a consoling voice:"Come   Thank Heaven that you are not going to diethis bout. I'm glad you repented and told the ftra ; 'and I hope you may live long enough to offer Heaven a<~<pb n="133"/>Capitola Caps the Climax.            3truer repentance than that which is the mere effect offright. For I tell you plainly that if it had not been forthe grace of the Lord acting upon my heart last night,your soul might have been in hades now."Craven Le Noir shut his eyes, groaned, and fell backoverpowered by the reflection."Now, please your worship, may I go home?" askedCap, demurely popping down a mock courtesy to the mag-istrate."Yes-go! go! got gol" said that officer, with an ex-pression as though he considered our Cap an individualof the animal kingdom, whom neither Buffon nor anyother natural philosopher had ever classified, and who, asa creature of unknown habits, might sometimes be dan-gerous.Cap immediately availed herself of the permission, andwent out to look for her servant and horses.But Jem, the first moment he had found himself un-watched, had put out as fast as he could fly to HurricaneHall, to inform Major Warfield of what had occurred.And Capitola, after losing a great deal of time in look-ing for him, mounted her horse and was just about tostart, when who should ride up in hot haste but Old Hur-ricane, attended by Wool."Stop there I" he shouted, as he saw Cap,She obeyed, and he sprung from his horse with theagility of youth, and helped her to descend from hers.Then, drawing her arm within his own, he led herinto the parlor, and putting an unusual restraint uponhimself, he ordered her to tell him all about the affair.Cap sat down and gave him the whole history frombeginning to end.Old Hurricane could not sit still to hear. He strodeup and down the room, striking his stick upon the floor,and uttering inarticulate sounds of rage and defiance.When Cap had finished her story he suddenly stoppedbefore her, brought down the point of his stick with aresounding thump upon the floor, and exclaimed:"Demmy, you New York newsboy, will you never be awoman?

Andthat the house was, besides, full of visitors from thecity, who had come down to spend the sporting season,and that they were hunting all day and carousing allnight, from one week's end to another.On hearing this, Black Donald quickly comprehended<pb n="136"/>136     Black Donald's Last Attempt that it was no time to attempt the abduction of the mwith the least probability of success.

And he determined to take advantage of the cir-cumstances to consummate his wicked purpose.In its then defenceless condition, he could easily havemustered his force and carried off his prize without im-mediate personal risk. But, as we have said before, heeschewed violence, as being likely to provoke after effectsof a too fatal character.He resolved rather at once to risk his own personalsafety in the quieter plan of abduction which he hadformed.He determined that, as soon as it should be dark, hewould watch his opportunity to enter the house, steal toCap's chamber, secret himself in a closet, and, when allshould be quiet, "in the dead waste and middle of thenight," he would come out, master her, stop her mouth,and carry her off.When it became quite dark, he approached the house,and hid himself under the steps beneath the back doorleading from the hall into the garden, to watch his op-portunity of entering. He soon found that his enterpriserequired great patience, as well as courage. He had towait more than two hours before he heard the door un-locked and opened.He then peered out from his hiding-place, and saw OldHurricane taking his way out toward the garden.Now was his time to slip unperceived into the house.He stealthily came out of this hiding-place, crept up theportico stairs to the back door, noiselessly turned theat, entered, and closed it behind him. He had just<pb n="138"/>138     Black Donald's Last Attempt        / "time to open a side door on his right hand, and conhimself in a wood closet under the stairs, when he hthe footsteps of Old Hurricane returning, The old man came in, and Black Donald laughedhimself to hear with what caution he locked, bolted asbarred the doors to keep out housebreakers I"Ah, old fellow I you are fastening the stable after horse has been stolen " said Black Donald to himself.As soon as Old Hurricane had passed by the closetwhich the outlaw was concealed, and had gone into tlparlor, Black Donald determined to risk the ascent intCapitola's chamber. From the description given by hmen, who had once succeeded in finding their wathither, he knew very well where to go.Noiselessly, therefore, he left his place of concealmentand crept out to reconnoitre the hall, which he foudeserted.Old Hurricane's shawl, hat and walking-stick wereposited in one comer. In case of being met on the wayhe put the hat on his head, wrapped the shawl around shoulders, and took the stick in his hand.His forethought proved to be serviceable. He wethrough the hall and up the first flight of stairs, withointerruption; but, on going along the hall of the seconstory, he met Mrs. Condiment, coming out oi Old Hurrcane's room."Your slippers are on the hearth, your gown is at fire, and the water is boiling to make your punch, MajoiWarfield," said the old lady, in passing."Umph, umph, umph," grunted Black Dotald, in rei.ply.The housekeeper then bade him good-night, sayinthat she was going at once to her room."Umph I" assented   Black Donald. And so theyf?parted, and this peril was passed.Black Donald went up the second flight of stairs an4 then down a back passage and a narrow staircase at;along a corridor and through several untenanted roomaand into another passage, and, finally, through a sidedoor leading into Capitola's chamber.Here he looked around for a safe hiding-place-. ewas a high bedstead, curtained; two deep windows, abrc<pb n="139"/>Black Donald's Last Attempt.         19curtained; wo closets, a dressing-bureau, workstand,washstand aid two armchairs. The forethought of littlePitapat had cased her to kindle a fire on the hearth andplace a waiter of refreshments on the workstand, so asto make all comfortable before she had left with theother negroes to go to the banjo breakdown.Among the edibles, Pitapat had been careful to leavea small bottle of brandy, a pitcher of cream, a few eggsand some spice, saying to herself, "Long as it wasChristmas time, Miss Catterpillar might want a sup ofegg-nog quite to herself, jes' as much as ole marse didhis whisky punch," and never fancying that her youngmistress would require a more delicate lunch than herold master.Black Donald laughed as he saw this outlay, and, re-marking that the young occupant of the chamber musthave an appetite of her own, he put the neck of thebrandy bottle to his lips, and took what he called a"hearty swig."Then, vowing that Old Hurricane knew what goodliquor was, he replaced the bottle, and looked around tofind the best place for his concealment.He soon determined to hide himself behind the thickfolds of the window curtain nearest the door, so that,immediately after the entrance of Capitola, he could glideto the door, lock it, withdraw the key, and have the girlat once in his power.He took a second "swig" at the brandy bottle, and thenwent into his place of concealment to await events.That same hour Capitola was her uncle's partner in aprolonged game of chess. It was near eleven o'clock be-fore Cap, heartily tired of the battle, permitted herself tobe beaten in order to get to bed.With a satisfied chuckle, Old Hurricane arose from hisseat, lighted'two bedchamber lamps, gave one to Capi-tola, took the other himself, and started off for his room,followed by Cap as far as the head of the first flight ofstairs, where she bade him good-night.She waited until she saw him enter his room, heardhim lock his door on the inside, and throw himself downheavily into his armchair, and then she went on hexown way.i <pb n="140"/>140     The Awful Peril of Capitola      . She hurried up the second flight of stairs//and the narrow passage, empty rooms, steep steps, and halls, until she reached the door of her owh dormitoShe turned the latch and entered the room.The first thing that met her sight was the waiteprovisions upon the stand.

You are a cucumber. That'swhat you are, a cucumber.""A pickled one?" asked Cap."Yes! and as pickled cucumbers are good to give onean appetite, I think I shall fall to and eat.""Do so," said Cap, "for Heaven forbid that I shouldfail in hospitality.""Why, really, this looks as though you 'had expecteda visitor-doesn't it?" asked Black Donald, helping him-self to a huge slice of ham, and stretching his feet outtoward the fire."Well, yes, rather; though, to say the truth, it was notyour reverence I expected," said Cap."Ahl somebody else's reverence, eh?

Dropping herhead on one side, she glanced upward, from the cornerof her eye, with an expression of "infinite" humor, mis-chief and roguery, saying:"Lor! didn't you know why I did that?""Because you wanted me captured, I suppose.""No, indeed, but, because-"Well, what?""Because-I wanted you to carry me offS""Well, I declare, I never thought of thatl" said theoutlaw, dropping his bread and cheese, and staring at theyoung girl."Well, you might have thought of it thenl I wastired of hum-drum life, and I wanted to see adventuresl"said Cap.Mack Donald looked at the mad girl from head tofoot, and then said, coolly:"Miss Black, I am afraid you are not good.""Yes, I am-before folks I" said Cap."And so you really wished me to carry you off?""I should think sol Didn't I stick to you until youdropped me?""Certainly; and now, if you really like meas well asyou say you do, come give re a kiss.""I won'tl" said Cap, "until you have done your sup-per and washed your face.

There were two little white bowls sitting, onewithin the other, upon the table. Cap took them apartand set them side by side, and began to break the eggs,letting the white slip into one bowl and dropping theyellow into the other.Black Donald sat down in his shirt sleeves, took oneof the bowls from Capitola, and began to whisk up thewhites with all his might and main.Capitola beat up the yellows, gradually mixing the,sugar with it. In    -'urse of her work she com-plained that the heat .,' Le fire scorched her face, andshe drew her chair farther toward the corner of thechimney, and pulled the stand after her."Ohl you are trying to get away from me," said Black ,Donald, hitching his own chair in the same direction,close to the stand, so that he sat immediately in front ofthe fireplace.Cap smiled, and went on beating her eggs and sugar-together. Then she stirred in the brandy and pouredin the milk, and took the bowl from Black Donald, andilaid on the foam. Finally, she filled a goblet with the.rich compound, and handed it to her uncanny guest.Black Donald untied his neckcloth, threw it upon thefloor, and sipped his egg-nog, all the while looking over,the top of the glass at Capitola.               ,"Miss Black," he said, "it must be past twelveso'clock." "I suppose so," said Cap."Then it must be long past your usual hour of retiring.""Of course it is," said Cap. "Then, what are you waiting for?"   .1"For my company to go home," replied Cap.     i"Meaning me.?" "Meaning you.""Oh, don't mind me, my dear." "Very well,* said Cap.

But why don'tyou proceed?""Proceed-with what?""With what you are thinking of, my darling.""I don't understand you.""Why don't you offer to go downstairs and bring upsome lemons ?""Oh, I'll go in a moment," said Cap, "if you wish.""Ha-ha--ha-ha-ha!

I will call you simply Donald, and entreatyou to hear me for a few minutes.""Talk on, then, but talk fast, and leave my mother:alone.

Hithertoyou have robbed mail-coaches and broken into rich men'shouses.

And even women,while deploring your crimes, have admired your cour-age."':I thank 'em kindly for it. Women always like menwith a spice of the devil in them," laughed the outlaw."No, they do not," said Capitola, gravely; "they likemen of strength, courage and spirit-but those qualitiesdo not come from the Evil One, but from the Lord, whois the giver of all good. Your Creator, Donald, gave youthe strength, courage, and spirit that all men and womenso much admire; but He did not give you these greatpowers that you might use them in the service of hisenemy, the devil.""I declare there is really something in that-I neverthought of that before.""Nor ever thought, perhaps, that however misguidedyou may have been, there is really something great andgood in yourself that might be used for the good of manand the glory of God," said Capitola, solemnly."Ha-ha-hal Oh, you    flatterer  Come-have youdone? I tell you it is after one o'clock, and I am tired todeath.""Donald, in all your former acts of lawlessness yourantagonists were strong men, and as you boldly riskedyour life in your depredations, your acts, though bad,were not base. But now your antagonist is a feeble girl,who has been unfortunate from her very birth-to destroyher would be an act of baseness to which you never yetdescended.""Bosh   Who talks of destruction?

Her heart beat violently, herhead throbbed, her voice was broken as she said:"Man, I will give you one more chance. Oh, man,pity yourself as I pity you, and consent to leave me.""Ha-ha-ha!

An uncontrollable horror prevented her fromturning, lest she should see the yawning mystery inthe middle of the floor, or hear some awful sound fromits unknown depths. The very shadows on the wallsthrown up wildly by the expiring firelight were objectsof grotesque terror. Never, never, in her whole youth ofstrange vicissitudes, had the nerves of this bravw girlbeen so tremendously shaken and prostrated.It was late in the morning when, at last, nature suc-cumbed, and she sank into a deep sleep. She had notslept long, when she was aroused from a profound stateof insensibility by a loud, impatient knocking at her door.She started up wildly, and gazed around her. For aminute she could not remember what were the circum-stances under which she had lain down, or what was thatvague feeling of horror and alarm that possessed her.Then the yawning trapdoor, the remnants of the supper,<pb n="152"/>152          The Next Morning.and Black Donald's cot, hat and boots upon the floor,drove in upon her reeling brain the memory of the nightof terror.The knocking continued, more loudly and impatiently,accompanied by the voice of Mrs. Condiment, crying:"Miss Capitolal Miss Capitolal Why, what can bethe matter with her? Miss Capitolal""Ebh what? yesl" answered Capitola, pressing herhands to her feverish forehead, and putting back her dis-heveled hair."Why, how soundly you sleep, my dearl I've beencalling and rapping here for a quarter of an hour! Goodgracious, child, what made you oversleep yourself so?""I-did not get to bed till very late," said Capitola,confusedly."Well, well, my dear, make haste now; your uncle isnone of the patientest, and he has been waiting break-fast for some timel Come, open the door, and I will helpyou to dress, so that you may be ready sooner."Capitola rose from the side of the bed, where she hadbeen sitting, and went cautiously around that gaping trap-door to her chamber door, when she missed the key, andsuddenly remembered that it had been in Black Donald'spocket when he fell. A shudder thrilled her frame atthe thought of that horrible fall."Well, well, Miss Capitola, why don't you open thedoor?" cried the old lady, impatiently."Mrs. Condiment, I have lost the key-dropped it downthe trapdoor. 'Please ask uncle to send for some one to.take the lock off-and don't wait breakfast for me.""Well, I do think that was very careless, my dear; but'11 go at once," said the old lady, moving away.She had not been gone more than ten minutes, whenOld Hurricane was heard, coming blustering along thehall, and calling:"What now, you imp of Satan? What mischief haveyou been at now? Opening the trapdoor, you mischiev-ous monkey   I wish from the bottom of my soul youhad fallen into it, and I should have got rid of one trial Losing your key, you careless baggage! I've a greatmind to leave you locked up there forever" "Thus scolding, Old Hurricane reached the spot, and<pb n="153"/>The Next Morning.               15began to ply screw-drivers and chisels, until at length thestrong lock yielded, and he opened the door.There a vision met his eyes that arrested his stepsupon the very threshold; the remains of a bacchanaliansupper; a mat's coat and hat and boots upon the floor;in the midst of the room, the great, square, black opening;and beyond it, standing upon the hearth, the form ofCapitola, with disordered dress, disheveled hair, and wildaspect."Oh, uncle, see what I have been obliged to dol" sheexclaimed, extending both her arms down toward theopening, with a look of blended horror and inspiration,such as might have sat upon the countenance of somesacrificial priestess of the olden time."What-what-what I" cried the old man, nearly dumbwith amazement."Black Donald was in my room last night; he stole'from his concealment, and locked the door on the inside,and withdrew the key, thus locking me in with himself,and-   " she ceased, and struck both hands to her face,shuddering from head to foot."Go on, girl 1" thundered Old Hurricane, in an agonyof anxiety."I escaped harmless  Oh, I did, sir, but at what afearful price I""Explain I explain 1" cried Old Hurricane, in breathlessagitation."I drew him to sit upon the chair on the rug, and- "again she shuddered from head to foot-"and I sprungthe trap, and precipitated him to-oh, Heaven of Heavrens I where?-I know not ""But you-you were unharmed?""Yes, yes ""Oh, Cap! Oh, my dear Cap! Thank Heaven forthat !""But, uncle, where-oh, where did he go?" inquiredCapitola, almost wildly."Who the demon cares? To perdition, I hope andtrust, with all my heart and soul !" cried Old Hurricane,with emphasis, as he approached and looked down theopening.<pb n="154"/>154          The Next Moming "Uncle, what is below there?" asked Capla, anx-iously pointing down the abyss.        J"An old cellar, as I have told you long ag Band BlackDonald, as you have just told me. Hello, t ere! are youkilled, as you deserve to be, you atrocious vilain ?" roaredOld Hurricanestooping down into the opening.A feeble, disant moan answered him."Oh, Heavenl he is livingl he is livingl I have notkilled him 1" cried Capitola, clasping her hands."Why, I do believe you are glad of it I" exclaimed OldHurricane, in astonishment."Oh, yes, yes, yes I for it was a fearful thought that Ihad been compelled to take a sacred life to send an im-mortal soul, unprepared, to its account l""Well, his neck isn't broken, it appears, or he couldn'tgroan; but I hope and trust that every other bone in hisbody isl Mrs. Condiment, muml I'll trouble you to puton your bonnet and walk over to Ezy's, and tell him tocome here directly! I must send for the constable," saidOld Hurricane, going to the door and speaking to hishousekeeper, who, with an appalled countenance, hadbeen a silent spectator of all that had passed..As soon as the old woman had gone to do her errand,he turned again, and, stooping down the hole, exclaimed:"I say, you scoundrel down there  What do you thinkof yourself now? Are you much hurt, you knave? Isevery one of your bones broken, as they deserve to be, youvillain? Answer me, you varletl"A low, deep moan was the only response."If that means 'Yes,' I'm glad to hear it, you wretch.You'll go to the camp-meeting with us again, won't you,you knave  You'll preach against evil passions and pro-fane swearing, looking straight at me all the time, untilyou bring the eyes of the whole congregation upon me,as a sinner above all sinners, you scoundrel  You'll turnme out of my own bed and away from my own board,won't you, you villain?

The poor man is badly hurt, may be dying, foraught you know, and you stand over him ond berate him,when he cannot even answer you!""Umph, umph, umph; demmy, you're-umph, well,he is fallen, fallen pretty badly, eh? and, if he should.come around after this, the next fall he gets will be liketo break his neck, eh ?-I say, you gentleman below there-Mr. Black Donald-precious Father Gray-you'll keepquiet, won't you, while we go and get our breakfast?Do, now! Come, Cap, come down and pour out mycoffee, and by the time we get through, old Ezy will behere."Capitola complied, and they left the room together.The overseer came in while they were at breakfast,and, with his hair standing on end, listened to the ac-count of the capture of the outlaw by our heroine."And now, saddle Fleetfoot and ride for your life toTip-Top, and bring a pair of constables," were the lastorders of Old Hurricane.While Mr. Ezy was gone on his errand, Major War-field, Capitola and Mrs. Condiment remained belowstairs.It was several hours before the messenger returnedwith the constables, and with several neighbors whominterest and curiosity had instigated to join the party.As soon as they arrived, a long ladder was procuredand carried up into Capitola's chamber, and let downthrough the trapdoor. Fortunately, it was long enough,for, when the foot of the ladder found the floor of thecellar, the head rested securely against the edge of theopening.                                          tIn a moment the two constables began singly to de-scend, the foremost one carrying a lighted candle in hishand.The remaining members of the party, consisting ofMajor Warfield, Capitola, Mrs. Condiment, and somehalf dozen neighbors, remained gathered around the open<pb n="156"/>156          The Next Morning.trapdoor, waiting, watching and listening for whg'next happen. Presently one of the constables called out: "Major Warfield, sir "                     '"Well " replied Old Hurricane."He's a-breathing still, sir; but seems badly hurt,may be a-dying, seeing as he's unsensible and unstable. What shall we do along of him?""Bring him up  Let's have a look at the fellow, atratel" exclaimed Old Hurricane, peremptorily."Just so, sir! but some of the gem'men up the:have to come down on the ladder and give a lift.

Never think of me; I shall neoccupy this room again; its associations are too fullhorrors. There, uncle, make them at once lay him uthe bed.""I think the young lady is right, unless we mean tothe fellow die," said one of the neighbors. "Very well  I have particular reasons of my own wishing that the man's life should be spared untilcan be brought to trial and induced to give up his acplices," said Old Hurricane. Then, turning to his he said:"Come along, Capitola.

When hehad examined the patient, he pronounced him utterly unfitto be removed, as, besides other serious contusions andbruises, his legs were broken, and several of his ribs frac-tured.In a word, it was several weeks before the stron  con-stitution of the outlaw prevailed over his many injuries,and he was pronounced well enough to be taken beforea magistrate and committed to prison to await his trial.Alas! his life, it was said, was forfeit by a hundredcrimes, and there could be no doubt as to his fate. Hemaintained a self-possessed, good-humored and laugh-ingly defiant manner, and, when asked to give up his ac-complices, he answered, gayly:"That treachery was a legal virtue, which outlawscould not be expected to know anything about"Capitola was everywhere lauded for her brave part inthe capture of the famous desperado. But Cap was toosincerely sorry for Black Donald to care for the applause.CHAPTER XX.A FATAL HATRED.Oh, heaven and all its hosts, he shall not die!By Satan and his fiends, he shall not live This is no transient flash of fugitive passion,-His death hath been by life for years of misery,Which, eke, I had tot lived,-Upon that thought, and not on food, I fed;Upon that thought, and not on sleep, I rested;I came to do the deed that must be done,-Nor thou, nor the sheltering angels could prevent me.-MATURmN.The United States army, under General Scott, investedthe city of Mexico.A succession of splendid victories had marked every<pb n="158"/>158             A Fatal Hatred.stage of their advance from the seacoast to theVera Cruz had fallen; Cerro Gordo had been stormepassed; Xalpa taken; the glorious triumph of Churubhad been achieved.

The penalty is death," said Herbert,dryly."Yes, sir-martial law is rather severe.""Who charges him?" asked Herbert, curtly."The colonel of our regiment, sir," replied the man,scarcely able to conceal his triumph."An accusation from a high quarter. Is his chargesupported by other testimony?""Beg your pardon, major, but is that necessary?""You have answered my question by asking anotherone, sir. I will trouble you for a direct reply," said Her-bert, with dignity."Then, major, I must reply-Yes.""What testimony? I would know the circumstances?""Well, sir, I will tell you all about it," said the officer,with ill-concealed triumph. "Private Traverse Rockehad the early morning watch-  ""After his return from the night ride to Acapulco?""Yes, sir. Well, Colonel Le Noir and myself, in goingour rounds this morning, just before sunrise, came fullupon the young fellow, fast asleep on his post.

They grounded arms on the of their superior officer."Is Private Traverse Rocke confined within there?'iinquired. s"Yes, sir." "I must pass in to see him.""I beg your pardon, sir; but our orders are strict,even to admit an officer without a written order fromcolonel," said the sentinel."Where is the colonel ?""In his tent, sir."Herbert immediately went on to the fine marqueepied by Colonel Le Noir.The sentinel on duty there at once admitted him,he passed on into the presence of the colonel.He saluted his superior officer with cold, militaryquette, and said:"I have come, sir, to ask of you an order to be admito see Private Traverse Rocke, confined under the of sleeping on his post.""I regret to say, Major Greyson, that it cannot done," replied Le Noir, with ironical politeness.'"Will you have the kindness to inform me, sir,what pretext my reasonable request is refused?

He knew that many months had elapsed since theyoung soldier had heard from his friends at home-infact, Traverse never received a letter unless it happenedto come under cover to Herbert Greyson. And well theyboth knew the reason."How very fortunate," said Herbert, as he rode on,"that I happened to be at the general's quarters to receivethese letters just when I did; for if they had been sent toColonel Le Noir's quarters, or to Captain Z.'s, poor Trav-erse would never have heard of them. However, I shallnot distract Traverse's attention by showing him theseletters until he has told me the full history of his arrest,for I wish him to give me a cool account of the wholething, so that I may know if I can possibly serve him.Ah, it is very unlikely that any power of mine will beable to save him if, indeed and in truth, he did sleepupon his post," ruminated Herbert, as he rode up to thetent where the prisoner was confined.<pb n="166"/>166             A Fatal Hatred.Another pair of sentinels were on duty in place cf who had refused him admittance.He alighted from his horse, was challenged, showed order, and passed into the tent.There a sight met him that caused the tears to rushhis eyes-for the bravest is always the tenderest heartThrown down on a mat, at the back of the tent,Traverse Rocke, pale, haggard and sunken in the deep sleep of utter exhaustion.

He could nothelp it!"I told you that they had resolved upon my death,Herbert. I told you that I should be pushed into ashameful grave I""Oh, no, ro, the Lord forbid I but tell me all about it,Traverse, that I may understand and know how to pro-ceed," said Herbert, in a broken voice."Well, I need not tell you how I have been insulted, op-pressed and persecuted by those two men, for you knowthat already.'"Yes, yes I""It really soon became apparent to me that they wereresolved, if possible, to exasperate me to desert, to retort,or to commit some other fatal act of insubordination, orviolence. Yet, for the sake of my dear mother and ofClara, I did violence only to my own natural manhood,and bore it all with the servility of a slave.""With the submission of a saint, dear Traverse; andin doing so you followed the divine precept and exampleof Our Saviour, who, when accused, railed upon and buf-feted, 'opened not his mouth.' And in His forbearance,dear Traverse, there was as much of Godlike dignityas there was of saintly patience. Great respect is as oftenmanifested in forbearance as in resentment," said Her-bert, soothingly."But you see it availed me nothing; here I am undera charge to which I plead guilty, and the penalty of whichis-death I" replied Traverse, in despair."Tell me 'how it was, Traversel Your persecutionsand your patience I know before; but what are the cir-cumstances fhat led to your present position. That yourmisfortune is the result of a concerted plan, on the partof Le Noir and his tool, I partly see; but I wish yoil to<pb n="168"/>168             A Fatal Hatred.          i put me in possession of all the facts, that I may what manner I may be able to assist you." "Ah, Herbert, I thank you, most faithful of fbut I doubt whether you can assist me in any other ner than in being kind to my poor mother and myClara when I am gone-for ah, old playmate I the abe too surely proved upon me, and the penalty is cand it is death I" said the poor boy, deeply sighing.Herbert groaned, and said:"But tell me at least the history of the four daysceding your arrest.""I will.

On Thursday night I was seatattendance upon the officer who carried dispatches to eral Quitman. On Friday morning I was set onbetween the hours of four and eight !""Oh, Heaven I what an infamous abuse of military thority " exclaimed Herbert, indignantly."Herbert, in my life I have sometimes sufferedhunger, cold and pain, and have some idea of what ing, freezing and torture may be; but among all the.i ^<pb n="169"/>A Fatal Hatred.               169to which flesh is heir, I doubt if there is one so trying tothe nerves azi brain of man as enforced and long con-tinued vigilance, when all his failing nature sinks for wantof sleep. Insanity and death must soon be the result.""Humph! go on! tell me about the manner of theirfinding you," said Herbert, scarcely able to repress hisindignation."Well, when after-let me see-eighty-four-ninety-ninety-six hours of incessant watching, riding and walk-ing, I was set on guard to keep the morning watch be-tween four o'clock and eight, 'my whole head was sick,and my whole heart faint;' my frame was sinking; mysoul could scarcely hold my body upright. In additionto this physical suffering was the mental anguish of feel-ing that these men had resolved upon my death, andthinking of my dear mother and Clara, whose heartswould be broken by my fall. Oh! the thought of themat this moment quite unmans mel I must not reflect Well, I endeavored with all the faculties of my mind andbody to keep awake. I kept steadily pacing to and fro,though I could scarcely drag one limb after the other; oreven stand upright; sleep would arrest me while in mo-tion, and I would drop my musket, and wake up in apanic, with the impression of some awful, overhangingruin appalling my soul. Herbert, will you think me amiserably weak wretch if I tell you that that night was anight of mental and physical horror. Brain and nervesseemed in a state of disorganization; thought and emotionwere chaos; the relations of soul and body broken up. Ihad but one strong, clear idea, namely, that I must keepawake at all costs, or bring shameful death upon myselfand disgrace upon my family. And even in the verymidst of thinking this I would fall asleep 1""No power within yourself could have prevented it;indeed you had to drop into sleep or death I""I pinched myself, I cut my flesh, I burned my skin,but all in vain! Nothing could withstand the over-whelming power of sleep that finally conquered me aboutfive o'clock this morning.

On his right and left, at the sides of thtable, were arranged the other members, according ttheir rank.At a small table, near the right hand of the presidestood the judge advocate, or prosecutor on behalfthe United States.At the door stood a sentinel on guard, and near hitwo or three orderly sergeants, in attendance upon tofficers.The judge advocate opened the court by calling ovethe names of the members, beginning with the presdent, and ending with the youngest officer present, anrecording them as they responded.This preliminary settled, orders were despatched tbring the prisoner, prosecutor and witnesses into courAnd in a few minutes entered Colonel Le Noir, Ctain Zuten, Lieutenant Adams, and Sergeant BakeThey were accommodated with seats near the left hof the president.Lastly, the prisoner was brought in, guarded,placed standing at the foot of the table.Traverse looked pale, from the severe effects of excsive fatigue and anxiety; but he deported himselffirmness and dignity, bowed respectfully to the court, i<pb n="173"/>The Court-martial.             17Jthen drew his stately form up to its fullest height, andstood awaiting the proceedings.The judge advocate, at the order of the president,commenced and read the warrant for holding the court.He then read over the names of the members, com-mencing, as before, with the president, and descendingthrough the gradations of rank to the youngest officer,and demanded of the prisoner whether he had any causeof challenge, or took any exception to any member pres-ent, and, if so, to declare it, as was his privilege.Traverse lifted his noble head and keen eyes, andlooked slowly around, in turn, upon each officer of thecourt-martial.They might all be said to be strangers to him, since heknew them only by sight-all except his old acquaint-ance, Herbert Greyson, who sat first at the left hand ofthe president, and who returned his look of scrutiny witha gaze full of encouragement."I find no cause of challenge, and take no exceptionto ary among the officers composing this court," an-swered Traverse, again bowing, with such sweetness anddignity in tone and gesture that the officers, in surprise,looked-first at the prisoner, and then at each other.No one could doubt that the accused, in the humblegarb of a private soldier, was, nevertheless, a man ofeducation and refinement-a true man, both in birth andbreeding.As no challenge was made, the judge advocate pro-ceeded to administer to each of the members of the courtthe oath prescribed by the Articles of War, to the intentthat they should try "the matter before them, betweenthe prisoner and the United States, according to the evi-dence, without fear, favor, or affection."This oath was taken by each member holding up hisright hand, and repeating the words after the officer.The court then -being regularly constituted, and everypreliminary form observed, the judge advocate aroseand directed the prisoner to listen to the charge broughtagainst him, and preferred by the colonel of his regi-ment, Gabriel Le Noir.Traverse raised his head, and fixed his eagle eyes uponthe prosecutor, who stood beside the judge advocate;<pb n="174"/>174           The Court-martial. while the latter, in an audible voice, read the accharging the prisoner with willful neglect of duty in he, the said Traverse Rocke, on the night of the firstSeptember, being placed upon guard at the northwestoutpost of the infantry quarters at Tacubaya, did asleep upon his post, thereby endangering the safetthe quarters and violating the Forty-sixth Article ofTo which charge the prisoner, in a firm voice, rep"Not guilty of willful neglect of duty, thoughsleeping upon my post."The judge advocate then cautioned all witnesseswithdraw from the court, and come only as they wcalled. They withdrew, and he then arranged some liminaries of the examination, and called in CaZuten, of the - th regiment oi infantry.This witness was a short, coarse-featured, red-haiperson, without intellect enough to enable him to conthe malignity of his nature. He testified that on Thursday, the first of SeptebTraverse Rocke, private in his company, was orderedguard at the northwestern outpost of the quarters tween the hours of four and eight a. m.; that about o'clock on the same morning, he, Joseph Zuten, in makihis usual rounds, and being accompanied on that occasby Colonel Gabriel Le Noir, Lieutenant Adams and geant Baker, did surprise Private Traverse Rocke aslon his post, leaning against the sentry-box, with his mket at his feet.This witness was cross-examined by the judge advcate-who, it is known, combines in his own personoffice of prosecutor on the part of the United States counsel for the prisoner-or, rather, if he be honest,acts as impartial inquirer and arbiter between the two.As no new facts were gained by the cross-examinatithe judge advocate proceeded to call the next witnolonel Le Noir.Here, then, was a gentleman of most prepossessiexterior, as well as of most irreproachable reputation In brief, his testimony corroborated that of the ing witness as to the finding of the prisoner asleep onpost, at the time and place specified. In honor of <pb n="175"/>The Court-martial.              175high social and military standing, this witness was notcross-examined.The next called was Lieutenant Adams, who corrob-orated the evidence of former witnesses. The last per-son examined was Sergeant Baker, whose testimony cor-responded exactly to that of all who had gone before him.The judge advocate then briefly summed up the caseon the part of the United States, first, by reading theForty-sixth Article of War, to wit, that:"Any sentinel who shall be found sleeping on his post,or shall leave it before he shall be regularly relieved, shall,suffer death," etc., etc., etc.And, secondly, by reading the recorded evidence, tothe effect that, "Traverse Rocke had been found by,competent witnessess sleeping on his post."And concluded by saying:"Gentlemen, officers of the court-martial, here is thelaw, and here is the fact, both proven, and it remains forthe court to find a verdict in accordance with both."The prisoner was then put upon his defense.Traverse Rocke drew himself up and said that-thetruth, like the blessed sun, must, on its shining forth, dis-pel all clouds of error; that, trusting in the power of truth,he should briefly relate the history of the preceding sevendays. And then he commenced and narrated the factswith which the reader is already acquainted.Traverse was interrupted several times in the course ofhis narrative by the president, General W., a severe mar-tinet, who reminded him that an attempt to criminatehis superior officers would injure his cause before thecourt.Traverse, bowing, as in duty bound, to the president atevery fresh interruption, nevertheless proceeded straighton with his narrative to its conclusion.The defense being closed, the judge advocate arose, as;was his privilege, to have the last word. He stated that,if the prisoner had been oppressed or aggrieved by hissuperior officer, his remedy lay in the Thirty-fifth Articleof War, providing that any soldier who shall feel himselfwronged by his captain, shall complain thereof to thecolonel of his regiment.To this the prisoner begged to reply that he had con-<pb n="176"/>176               The Verdict.sidered the colonel of his regiment his personal eand, as such, could have little hope of the issue, evhe had had opportunity afforded him, of appealing to ^.authority.The judge-advocate expressed his belief that this plaint was vexatious and groundless.And here the evidence was closed, and the prosecuprisoner and witnesses dismissed, and the court adjounto meet again to deliberate with closed doors.It was a period of awful suspense with Traverse R iThe prospect seemed dark for him.The fact of the offense, and the law affixing the penof death to that offense, was established, and, asjudge-advocate truly said, nothing remained but for court to find their verdict in accordance with both.Extenuating circumstances there were, certainly; extenuating circumstances were seldom  admittedcourts-martial, the law and practice of which were sevto the extent of cruelty.Another circumstance against him was the fact thatdid not require an unanimous vote to render a legal vdict; but that, if a majority of two-thirds should voteconviction, the fate of the prisoner would be sealTraverse had but one friend in the court, and what cohis single voice do against so many?

Here isthe fact of the offense proved, and here is the law uponthat offense clearly defined. Nothing seems to remainfor us to do but to bring in a verdict in accordance withthe law and the fact."Several of the older officers and sterner disciplinariansagreed with the president, who now said:"I move that the vote be immediately taken upon thisquestion."To this also the elder officers assented. And the judgeadvocate was preparing to take the ballot, when one ofthe youngest members arose and said:"Mr. president and gentlemen, there are mitigating cir-cumstances attending this offense, which, in my opinion,should be duly weighed before making up our ballot.""Lieutenant Lovel, when your hair has grown white inthe service of your country, as mine has, and when yourskin is mottled with the scars of a score of well-fought<pb n="178"/>178               The Verdict fields, you will find your soft theories corrected by iexperience, and you will know that in the case of atinel sleeping upon his post there can be no mitigatcircumstances; that nothing can palliate such flagrantdangerous neglect, involving the safety of the wharmy; a crime that martial law and custom has very nessarily made punishable by death," said the presidesternly.The young lieutenant sat down abashed, under the inpression that he had betrayed himself into some actgross impropriety. This was his first appearance incharacter of juror and judge; he was literally "unactomed to public speaking," and did not hazard a reply. "Has any other gentleman any views to advance befwe proceed to a general ballot?" inquired the president. 'Several of the officers whispered together, and thsome one replied that there seemed to be no reason whthe vote should not be immediately taken.Herbert Greyson remained perfectly silent. Why hdid not speak then, in reply to this adjuration-why, indeed, he had not spoken before, in support of LieutenaLovel's views in favor of his friend, I do not know tothis day; though I mean to ask him the first time I havithe opportunity. Perhaps he was inclined to dramatieffects; but whatever might have been the motive, hcontinued silent, offering no obstacle to the immediattaking of the vote.The judge-advocate then called the court to order forthe taking of the ballot, and proceeded to question themembers in turn, commencing with the youngest."How say you, Lieutenant Lovel, is the prisoner onirial guilty or not guilty of the offense laid to hisicharge?""Guilty," responded the young officer, as his eyes filledwith tears of pity for the other young life against whichhe had felt obliged to record his vote."If that is the opinion of one who seems friendly tohim, what will be the votes of the other ster judges?"said Herbert Greyson, to himself, in dismay."What say you, Lieutenant Jones-is the prisone<pb n="179"/>The Verdict                  179guilty or not guilty?" said the judge-advocate, proceed-ing with the ballot"Guilty I""Lieutenant Cragin?""Guilty I""Lieutenant Evans?""Guilty I""Lieutenant Goffe?""Guilty I""Lieutenant Hesse?""Guilty !""Captain Kingsley?" "Guilty I""Captain McConkey?""Guiltv I"'qCaptain Lucas?""Guilty I""Captain O'Donnelly?""Guilty I""Captain Rozencrantz?""Guilty 1""Major Greyson?""Not guilty" IEvery officer sprang to his feet and gazed in astonish-ment, consternation and indignant inquiry upon the ren-derer of this unprecedented vote.The president was the first to speak, breaking out with:"Sirl Major Greyson! your vote, sir, in direct defi-ance of the fact and the law upon it, is unprecedented,sir, in the whole history of courts-martial I""I record it as uttered, nevertheless," replied Herbert."And your oath, sir! What becomes of your oath asa judge of this court I""I regard my oath in my vote ""What, sir," inquired Captain McConkey, "do youmean to say that you have rendered that vote in accord-ance with the facts elicited in evidence, as by your oathyou were bound to do'?"Yes.""How, sir? Do you mean to say that the prisoner didnot sleep on his post?""Certainly I do not; on the contrary, I grant that he<pb n="180"/>18o               The Verdict.did sleep upon his post, and yet I maintain that inso he was not guilty " I"Major Greyson plays with us 1" said the president."By no means, sir    I never was in more soleearnest than at present I Your honor, the president, gentlemen judges of the court, as I am not counselthe prisoner, nor civil officer, nor lawyer, of whose intference courts-martial are proverbially jealous, I beg will permit me to say a few words in support, or at lI will say, in explanation of the vote which you hacharacterized as an opinion in opposition to fact and lawiand unprecedented in the whole history of courtsmartial.""Yes, it isl it is!" said General W., shifting  easiin his seat."You heard the defense of the prisoner," continuHerbert; "you heard the narrative of his wrongs and suf-ferings, to the truth of which his very aspect bore testimony. I will not here express a judgment as to the mon.tives that prompted his superior officers, I will merelyadvert to the facts themselves, in order to prove that thprisoner, under the circumstances, could not, with hiehuman power, have done otherwise than he did.""Sir, if the prisoner considered himself wronged by his'captain, which is very doubtful, he could have appealedito the colonel of his regiment I""Sir, the Articles of War accord him that privilege But is it ever taken advantage of? Is there a case onrecord where a private soldier ventures to make a dan-',gerous enemy of his immediate superior by complainingof his captain to his colonel. Nor in this case would ithave been of the least use, inasmuch as this soldier had well-founded reasons for believing the colonel of his regi-ment his personal enemy, and the captain as the instru-ment of this enmity.""And you, Major Greyson, do you coincide in the opin-ion of the prisoner? Do you think that there could havebeen anything in common between the colonel of the regi-ment and the poor private in the ranks, to explain sucl an equalizing sentiment as enmity?" inquired CaptainO'neth elly.1l answer, distinctly, yes, sir  In the first place, this<pb n="181"/>The Verdict                  18tpoor private is a gentleman of birth and education, theheir of one of the most important estates in Virginia, andthe betrothed of one of the most lovely girls in the world.In both these capacities he has stood in the way of ColonelLe Noir, standing between him and the estate on the onehand, and between him and the young lady on the other.He has disappointed Le Noir both in love and ambition.And he has thereby made an enemy of the man who has,besides, the nearest interest in his destruction. Gentle-men, what I say now, in the absence of Colonel Le Noir,I am prepared to repeat in his presence, and maintain, atthe proper time and place.""But how came this young gentleman of birth and ex-pectations to be found in the ranks?" inquired CaptainRosencrantz."How come we to have headstrong sons of wealthy par-ents, fast young men of fortune, and runaway studentsfrom the universities and colleges of the United Statesin our ranks ? In a burst of boyish impatience, the youngman enlisted. Destiny gave him as the colonel of hisregiment his mortal enemy. Colonel Le Noir found inCaptain Zuten a ready instrument for his malignity. And,between them both, they have done all that could possiblybe effected to defeat the good fortune and insure the de-struction of Traverse Rocke. And I repeat, gentlemen,that what I feel constrained to affirm here in the absenceof those officers, I shall assuredly reassert and maintainin their presence, upon the proper occasion. In fact, Ishall bring formal charges against Colonel Le Noir andCaptain Zuten, of conduct unworthy of officers and gen-tlemen I""But it seems to me that this is not directly to the pointat issue," said Captain Kingsley."On the contrary, sir, it is the point, the whole point,and only point, as you shall presently see by attendingto the facts that I shall recall to your memory. Youand all present must then see that there was a deliberatepurpose to effect the ruin of this young man.

At length he spoke:"This second packet, Greyson, contains a-well, I maas well call it a narrative. I confide it to your care upthese conditions: that it shall not be opened' until aftmy death and funeral; and that, when it has served ipurpose of restitution, it may be, as far as possible, forgotten.

I thank you for acceping it; and I believe that I may safely promise that yowill find the contents of the smaller packet of great importance and advantage to yourself and those dear tyou." Herbert bowed in silence."That is all. Good-by.

Come immediately to<pb n="187"/>The End of the War.               187rooms, for I have a very important communication tomake to you, which I shrewdly suspect to contain yourintercepted correspondence for the last two years," saidHerbert.Traverse started and gazed upon his friend in amaze-ment, and was about to express his astonishment, whenHerbert, seeing others approach, drew the arm of hisfriend within his own, and they hurried silently ontoward Major Greyson's quarters.They had scarcely got in, and closed the door, andstricken a light, before Traverse exclaimed, impatiently:'"Give it mel" and almost snatched the parcel fromHerbert's hands."Whist don't be impatient. I dare say it is all stalenews I" said Herbert, as he yielded up the prize.They sat down together, on each side a little stand sup-porting a light.Herbert watched with sympathetic interest while Tra-verse tore open the envelope and examined its contents.They were, as Herbert had anticipated, letters from themother and the betrothed of Traverse-letters that hadarrived and been intercepted, from time to time, for thepreceding two years.There were blanks, also, directed in a hand strange toTraverse, but familiar to Herbert as that of Old Hurri-cane; and those blanks inclosed drafts upon a NewOrleans bank, payable to the order of Traverse Rocke.Traverse pushed all these latter aside with scarcely aglance and not a word of inquiry, and began eagerly toexamine the long-desired, long-withheld letters from thedear ones at home.His cheek flamed to see that every seal was broken andthe fresh aroma of every heart-breathed word inhaled byothers before they reached himself I"Look here, Herbert, look here!

Well, I suspect that those checkswere sent by some relative of yours or your mother's, whojust begins to remember that he has been neglectingyou !""Herbert, do you know   this?" inquired Traverse,anxiously."No, I do not know it; I only suspect this to be thecase," said Herbert, evasively. "But what is that whichyou are forgetting?""Oh, this-yes, I had forgotten it. Let us see what itis," said Traverse, examining a paper that had restedunobserved upon the stand."This is an order for my discharge, signed by theSecretary of War, and dated-hal hal hal-two yearsago! Here I have been serving two years illegally, andif I had been convicted of neglect of duty in sleeping onmy post, I should have been shot unlawfully, as that man,when he prosecuted me, knew perfectly welll" exclaimedTraverse."That man, as I said before, lies upon his deathbed!Remember nothing against him!

So, to-morrowmorning, please Providence, I shall present this orderto General Butler, and apply for my discharge.""And you will set out immediately for home?"The face of Traverse suddenly changed.*" should like to do so.

I must not go homeuntil I can do so with honor.""And can you not do so now?

'NorIwill I present myself at home until, by the blessing ofthe Lord, I have done what I set out to do, and establishmyself in a good practice. And so, by the help ofHeaven, I hope within one week to be on my way to NewOrleans to try my fortune in that city.""To New Orleans! And a new, malignant fever, ofsome horrible, unknown type, raging there " exclaimedHerbert. "So much the more need of a physician.! Herbert, I:..am not the least uneasy on the subject of infection. 1Ihave a theory for its annihilation.""I never saw a clever young professional man without.ia theory," laughed Herbert.The drum was now heard beating the tattoo, and the;friends separated with hearts full of revived hope.The next morning Traverse presented the order of thesecretary to the commander-in-chief, and received hisdischarge.And then, after writing long, loving and hopeful lettersto his mother and betrothed, and entreating the former totry to find out who was the secret benefactor who hadisent him such timely aid, Traverse took leave of his;friends, and set out for the Southern Queen of Cities,!ionce more to seek his fortune.Meantime, the United States Army continued to ocI.eupy the City of Mexico, through the whole of the au-8tumn and the winter.General Butler, who temporarily succeeded the illusetriotls Scott in the chief command, very wisely arrangedithe terms of an armistice with the enemy, that was wtended to last two months from the beginning of Februdary; but which happily lasted until the conclusion of ttreaty of peace between the two countries.Colonel Le Noir had not been destined soon to die; hiwound-an inward canker from a copper bullet, thatt]<pb n="191"/>The End of the War.               191surgeon had at length succeeded in extracting-took theform of a chronic fester disease. Since the night uponwhich he had been so extremely ill, as to be supposeddying, and yet had rallied, the doctors felt no apprehen-sions of his speedy death, though they gave no hopes ofhis final recovery.Under these circumstances, there were hours in whichLe Noir bitterly regretted his precipitation in permittingthose important documents to go out of his own hands.And he frequently sent for Herbert Greyson, in private,to require reassurances that he would not open the packetconfided to him before the occurrence of the eventspecified.And Herbert always soothed the sufferer by reiteratinghis promise that so long as Colonel Le Noir should sur-vive, the seal of that packet should not be broken.Beyond the suspicion that the parcel contained an im-portant confession, Herbert Greyson was entirely ignorantof its contents.But the life of Gabriel Le Noir was prolonged beyondall human calculus of probabilities.He was spared to experience a more effectual repent-ance than that spurious one into which he had beenfrightened by the seeming rapid approach of death. Andafter seven months of lingering illness and gradual de-cline, during the latter portions of which he was con-forted by the society of his only son, who had come at hissummons to visit him, in May, I848, Gabriel Le Noir ex-pired, a sincere penitent, reconciled to God and man.And soon afterward, in the month of May, the treatyof peace having been ratified by the Mexican Congress atQueretaro, the American army evacuated the city andterritory of Mexico.And our brave soldiers, their "brows crowned withvictorious wreaths," set out upon their return to hbonand friends.G<pb n="192"/>CHAPTER XXIV.THE FORTUNATE BATE.Heaven has to all allotted, soon or late,Some lucky revolution of their fate;Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill(For human good depends on human will)Our fortune rolls as from a smooth descent,And from the first impression takes its bent.Now, now she meets you with a glorious prize,And spreads her locks before her as she flies.-DRYOEDMeanwhile, what had our young adventurer been in all these months between September and June?Traverse, with his two hundred dollars, had setfor New Orleans about the first of October.By the time he had paid his traveling expensesfitted himself out with a respectable suit of profesblack, and a few necessary books, his little capitaldiminished three-quarters.So that when he found himself settled in his newin a highly respectable quarter of the city, he hadfifty dollars and a few dimes left.A portion of this sum was expended in a cheap bedstead, a closed washstand and a spirit lamp coboiler, for Traverse determined to lodge in his officeboard himself, "which will have this additional adage," said the cheerful fellow to himself; "for besaving me from debt, it will keep me always on handcalls."The fever, though it was October, had scarcely abindeed, on the contrary, it seemed to have revivedincreased in virulency in consequence of the premreturn of many people who had fled on its first apance, and who in coming back too soon to the infatmosphere, were less able to withstand contagion those who remained.That Traverse escaped the plague was owing, not.much to his favorite "theory" as to his vigorous stitution, pure blood and regular habits of tempeacleanliness and cheerful activity of mind and body.<pb n="193"/>The Fortunate Bath.             193Just then the demand was greater than the supply ofmedical service. Traverse found plenty to do. And hispleasant, young face and hopeful and confident mannerswon him great favor in sick rooms, where, whether itwere to be ascribed to his "theory," his "practice," or tothe happy influence of his personal presence, or to allthese together, with the blessing of the Lord upon them,it is certain that he was very successful in raising thesick. It is true that he did not earn five dollars in asmany days; for his practice, like that of almost everyyoung professional man, was among the indigent.But what of that? What if he were not running up heavy accounts against wealthy patrons? He was "giv-ing to the poor"-not money, for himself was as poor asany of them-but his time, labor and professional skill;he "was giving to the poor," he was "lending to theLord," and he "liked the security." And the most suc-cessful speculator that ever made' a fortune on 'Change,never, never invested time, labor or money to a sureradvantage.And this I would say for the encouragement of allyoung persons in similar circumstances-do not be im-patient if the "returns" are a little while delayed, forthey are so sure and so rich that they are quite worthwaiting for, nor will the waiting be long. Give yourservices cheerfully, also, for "the Lord loveth a cheerfulgiver."Traverse managed to keep out of debt; he regularlypaid his office rent and his laundress' bill; he daily pur-chased his mutton chop or pound of beefsteak, and broiledit himself; he made his coffee; swept and dusted hisoffice, put up his sofa bed, blacked his boots, and, ohlmiracle of independence, he mended his own gloves andsewed on his own shirt buttons-for you may depend thatthe widow's son knew how to do all these things; nor wasthere a bit of hardship in his having so to wait upon him-self, though if his mother and Clara, in their well-pro-vided and comfortable home at Willow Heights, had onlyknown how destitute the young man was of female aidand comfort, how they would have cried:"No one but himself to mend his poor, dear glov  IOh--oh, boo-hoo-oo "<pb n="194"/>t94           The Fortunate Bath.Traverse never alluded to his straitened circbut boasted of the comfort of his quarters and the of his practice, and declared that his income alreadyceeded his outlay; which was perfectly true, since heresolved to live within it, whatever it might be.As the fever began to subside, Traverse's practicelined, and about the middle of November his "occupwas gone."We said that his office was in the most respectablecality .n the city; it was, in fact, on the ground floor:a first-class hotel.It happened that one night, near the close of winTraverse lay awake on his sofa bedstead, turning ohis mind how he should contrive to make both ends at the conclusion of the present term, and feeling as despondency as it was possible for his buoyant and trusting soul to be, when there came a loud ringing atoffice bell.This reminded him of the stirring days and nightsithe preceding autumn. He started up at once to asthe summons."Who's there?""Is Dr. Rocke in?""Yes; What's wanted?""A gentleman, sir, in the house here, sir, taken vbad; wants the doctor directly; room number 555.""Very well, I will be with the gentleman immediateanswered Traverse, plunging his head into a basinicold water and drying it hastily.In five minutes Traverse was in the office of the inquiring for a waiter to show him up to 555.One was ordered to attend him, who led the wayseveral flights of stairs, and around divers galleries, he opened a door and ushered the doctor immedinto the sick room.There was a little, old, dried-up Frenchman in anightcap, extended on a bed in the middle of the and covered with a white counterpane that clung cto his rigid form as to a corpse.And there was a little, old, dried-up Frenchwoma brown merino gown and a high-crowned muslin <pb n="195"/>The Fortunate Bath.             195who hopped and chattered about the bed like a fright-ened magpie."Ou, monsieur le docteurl" she screamed, jumpingat Traverse in a way to make him start back; "ou, mon-sieur le docteurl I am vera happy you to see I Voilomon frere'l Behold my brother! He is ill-he is veryill! He is dead-he is vera deadl""I hope not," said Traverse, approaching the bed."Voilal Behold! Mon Dieu, he is vera still! He isvera cold  He is vera dead! What can you, mon frere,my brother to save?""Be composed, madam, if you please, and allow me toexamine my patient," said Traverse, taking the wrist ofthe sick man."Ma foil I know not what you speak 'compose.'What can you my brother to save?""Much, I hope, madam; but you must leave me toexamine my patient and not interrupt me," said Traverse,passing his hand over the naked chest of the sick man."Mon Dieu! I know not 'exam' and 'interrup,' andI know not what can you mon frere to save I""If you don't hush parley-vooing, the doctor can'tnothink, mum," said the waiter, in a respectful tone.Traverse found his patient in a bad condition-in astupor, if not in a state of positive insensibility. Thesurface of his body was cold as ice, and apparently with-out the least vitality. If he was not, as his sister hadexpressed it, "very dead," he was certainly "next to it."By close questioning, and by putting his questions invarious forms, the doctor learned from the chatteringlittle magpie of a Frenchwoman that the patient hadbeen ill for nine days; that he had been under the careof Monsieur le Docteur Cartiere; that there had beega consultation of physicians; that they had prescribed forhim and given him over; that le Docteur Cartiere stillattended him, but was at this instant in attendance asaccoucheur to a lady in extreme danger, whom he couldnot leave; but Docteur Cartiere had directed them, inhis unavoidable absence, to call in the skillful, the tal-ented, the soon-to-be illustrious young Docteur Rocke,whn was also near at hand.The heart of Traverse thrilled with joy. The Lard<pb n="196"/>196          The Fortunate Bath.had remembered him. His best skill spent upon thepoor and needy who could make him no return, butwhose lives he had succeeded in saving, had reached theears of the celebrated Dr. Cartiere, who had, with theunobtrusive magnanimity of real genius, quietly recom-mended him to his own patrons.Oh, well, he would do his very best, not only to ad-'vance his own professional interests, and to please hismother and Clara, 'but also to do 'honor to the magnani-'mous Dr. Cartiere's recommendation.Here, too, was an opportunity of putting in practicehis favorite theory; but first of all it was -,1ecessary to beinformed of the preceding mode of treatment and itsresults.So he farther questioned the little, restless magpie,and, by ingeniously-framed inquiries, succeeded in gain-ing from her the necessary knowledge of his patient'santecedents. He examined all the medicines that hadbeen used, and informed himself of their effects uponthe disease. But the most serious difficulty of allseemed to be the impossibility of raising vital actionupon the cold, dead skin.The chattering little woman informed him that thepatient had been covered with blisters that would notpull," that would not "decliniate," that would not-whatyou call it-"drawl"Traverse could easily believe this, for not only theskin, but the very flesh of the old Frenchman seemedbloodless and lifeless.Now for his theory! What would kill a healthy manwith a perfect circulation, might save the life of thisdying one, whose whole surface, inch deep, seemed al-ready dead."Put him in a bath of mustard water, as hot as youcan bear your own hand in, and continue to raise thetemperature slowly, watching the effect, for about fiveminutes. I will go down and prepare a cordial draught to be taken the moment he gets back to bed," said Dr. iRocke, who immediately left the room. 'His directions were all but too well obeyed. The bathing tub was quickly brought into the chamber and filled with water, as hot as the nurse could bear her <pb n="197"/>Ine tonunate     satm.          197hand m. Then hie invalid was hastily invested in aslight bathing-gown and lifted by two servants and laidin the hot bath."Now, bring quickly, water boiling," said the little,old woman, imperatively. And when a large copperkettleful was forthcoming, she took it and began to poura stream of hissing, bubbling water in at the foot of thebath.The skin of the torpid patient had been redding for afew seconds, so as to prove that its sensibility was re-turning, and now when the stream from the kettle beganto mix with the already very hot bath, and the patient,with the agility of youth and health, skipped out of thetub and into his bed, kicking vigorously, and exclaim-ing:"Brigandsl assassinsl you have scalded my legs todeath!""Glory be to the Lordl He is saved!" cried one ofthe waiters, a devout Irishman."Ceill he speaksl he moves! he livesl mon frerer'cried the little Frenchwoman, going to him."Ah, murderers! banditsl You've scalded me todeath!

I did not tell you to parboilyour patient " exclaimed Traverse, speaking to the oldwoman. Traverse was shocked to find how perilouslyhis orders had been executed."Eh bien monsieur he lives I he does well Voila monfrere"f exclaimed the little old woman.It was true! The accidental "boiling bath," as it mightalmost be called, had effected what perhaps no othermeans in the world could-a restored circulation.<pb n="198"/>198          The Fortunate Bath.The disease was broken up and the convalescence the patient was rapid. And as Traverse kept his osecret concerning the accidental high temperature of tbath, which every one considered a fearful and a succesful experiment, the fame of Dr. Rocke spread overwhole city and country.He would soon have made a fortune in New Orleanhad not the hand of destiny beckoned him elsewhere.

G. LEWIIt was at the close of a beautiful day in early springthat Traverse Rocke, accompanying the old doctor andthe old sister, reached the grove on the borders of thebeautiful lake upon the banks of which was situated the"Calm Retreat."A large, low, white building, surrounded with piazzasand shaded by fragrant and flowering southern trees, itlooked like the luxurious country seat of some wealthymerchant or planter, rather than a prison for the insane.Dr. St. Jean conducted his young assistant into abroad and cool hall, on each side of which doors openedinto spacious rooms, occupied by the proprietor and hishousehold. The cells of the patients, as it appeared, wereupstairs. The country doctor and the matron who hadbeen in charge during the absence of the proprietor andhis sister, now came forward to welcome the party, andreport the state of the institution and its inmates.All were as usual, the country doctor said, except"mademoiselle.""And what of her, how is mademoiselle? A patientmost interesting, Dr. Rocke?' said the old Frenchman,alternately questioning his substitute and addressingTraverse."She has stopped her violent ravings, and seems tome to be sinking into a state of stupid despair," repliedthe substitute.<pb n="200"/>soo        The Mysterious Maniac "A patient most interesting, my young friendl Atory most pathetic; you shall hear of it some time. 'Bcome into the parlor. And you, Angele, my sister, rand order coffee," said the old Frenchman, leading way into a pleasant apartment on the right of the furnished with straw matting upon the floor, and bbosettees and dhairs around the walls. 'Here coffee was presently served to the travelers, wlsoon after retired for the night.Traverse's room was a large, pleasant apartment at thend of a wide, long hall, on each side of which were tdoors opening into the cells of the patients. Fatigued by his journey, Traverse slept sound!through the night; but early in the morning he rudely awakened by the sounds of maniac voices frothe cells. Some were crying, some laughing aloud, somgroaning and howling, and some holding forth in fanciexhortations.He dressed himself quickly and left his room, to wadown the length of the long hall and observe the cells each side. The doors were at regular intervals, and eacdoor had in its centre a small opening to enable the prietor to look in upon the patients.As these were all women, and some of them delicatand refined even in their insanity, Traverse felt shockeat this necessary, if it were necessary, exposure of thesanctuary.The cells were in fact small .bedrooms, that, with theiwhitewashed walls, and white curtained beds and windows, looked excessively neat, clean and cool, -but also, i'must be confessed, very bare, dreary and cheerless. "Even a looking-glass would be a great benefit those poor girls, for I remember that even Clara, in herviolent grief, and mother in her lifelong sorrow, nevneglected their looking-glass and personal appearance,'said Traverse to himself, as he passed down the hall, anresolved that this little indulgence should be affothe patients.And except those first involuntary glances, helously avoided looking in through the gratings upthose helpless women who had po means of seduithemselves.<pb n="201"/>The Mysterious Maniac.            21But as he turned to go down the stairs, his eyes wentfull into an opposite cell, and fell upon a vision of beautyand sorrow that immediately riveted his gaze.It was a small and graceful female figure, clothed in'deep -black, seated by the window, with her elbow rest-ing upon the sill and her chin supported on 'her hand.Her eyes were cast down until her eyelashes lay like inkylines upon her snow-white cheek. Her face, of classicregularity and marble whiteness, bore a ghastly contrastto the long eyelashes, arched eyebrows and silken ring-lets, black as midnight. She might have been a statue4or a picture, so motionless she sat.Conscious of the wrong of gazing upon this solitarywoman, Traverse forced his looks away and passed ondownstairs, where 'he again met the old doctor and Mad-emoiselle Angele at breakfast.After breakfast, Dr. St. Jean invited his young assist-ant to accompany him on a round of visits to thepatients, and they went immediately up to the hall, atthe end of which Traverse -had slept.'These are our incurables, but they are not violent;incurables never are. Poor mademoiselle! she has justbeen conveyed to this ward," said the doctor, openingthe door of the first cell on the right at the head of thestairs, and admitting Traverse at once into the presenceof the beautiful, black-haired, snow-faced woman whohad so much interested' him."This is my friend, Dr. Rocke, mademoiselle; doctor,this is my friend, Mademoiselle Mont de St. Pierrel"Traverse bowed profoundly, and the lady arose, curt-sied and resumed her seat, saying coldly:"I have told you, monsieur, never to address me asmademoiselle; you persist in doing so; and I shall nevernotice the insult again."'Ten thousand pardons, madamel but if madame willalways look so young! so beautiful can I ever rememberthat she is a widow'?Trhe classic lip of the woman curled in scorn, and shedisdained a reply."I take an appeal to Monsieur Le Docteur-Is notmadane young and beautiful?" asked the Frenchman,<pb n="202"/>202        The Mysterious Maniac.turning to Traverse, while the splendid black eyes ofstranger passed from one to the other.Traverse caught the glance of the lady and bogravely. It was the most delicate and proper reply.She smiled almost as gravely, and with a much kindexpression than any she had bestowed upon the Frenman."And how has madame fared during my absence long? The servants--have they been respectful? hathey been observant? have they been obedient to the wiof madame? Madame has but to speakf" said the dtor, bowing politely."Why should I speak when every word I utter ybelieve, or affect to believe, to be the ravings of a maniacI will speak no more," said the lady, turning away superb dark eyes and looking out of the window."Ah, madame will not so punish her friend, her svant, her slave" A gesture of fierce impatience and disgust was the reply deigned by the lady."Come away; she is angry and may become daiously excited," said the old doctor, leading the way the cell."Did you tell me this lady is one of the incurablesinquired Traverse, when they had left her apartment."Bah! yes, poor girl, vera incurable, as my sistwould say.""Yet, she appears to me to be perfectly sane, as wellexceedingly beautiful and interesting.""Ah, bahl my excellent; my admirable; my inexenced young friend, that is all you know of lunatiWith more or less violence of assertion, they every insist upon their sanity; just as criminals protest thinnocence!

She has been mad eighteen years 1""Is it possible !" exclaimed Traverse, incredulously,"She lost her reason at the age of sixteen, and she isnow thirty-four-you can calculate.""It is amazing and very sorrowful. How beautiful sheis!""Yes; her beauty was a fatal gift. It is a sad story.Ah, it is a sad story I You shall hear of it when we getthrough.""I can connect no idea of woman's frailty with thatrefined and intellectual face," said Traverse, coldly."Ah, bah I you are young! You know not the world IYou, my innocent, my excellent, my pious young friend I"said the old doctor, as they crossed the hall to go intothe next wing of the building, in which were situated themen's wards.Traverse found nothing that particularly interestedhim in this department, and when they had concludedtheir round of visits, and were seated together in theold doctor's study, Traverse asked him for the story ofhis beautiful patient.The doctor shrugged his shoulders."It is a story miserable, as I told you before. A gen-tleman, illustrious, from Virginia, an officer high in thearmy, and distinguished in the war, he brought thiswoman to me nearly three years ago. He informed methat-eh bien! I had better tell you the story in myown manner. This young lady, Mademoiselle Mont deSt. Pierre, is of a family noble and distinguished-a rela-tive of this officer, illustrious and brave.

That is the reason why she insistson being called madame instead of mademoiselle, and we indulge her when we think of it." "But all this is very singular.""Ah, bahl who can account for a lunatic's fancies?)She is the maddest of the whole lot!

G. LEwxs.There is some advantage in having imagination, sincethat visionary faculty opens the mental eyes to facts thatmore practical and duller intellects could never see.Traverse was young and romantic, and deeply inter-ested in the doctor's beautiful patient. He, therefore,did not yield his full credulity to the tale told by the"relative illustrious" to the old doctor, as to the historyand cause of the lady's madness, or even take it forgranted that she was mad. He thought if quite possiblethat the distinguished officer's story might be a wickedfabrication, to conceal a crime, and that the lady's "crazyfancy" might be the pure truth.And Traverse had heard to what heinous uses privatemadhouses were sometimes put by some unscrupulousmen, who wished to get certain women out of their way,yet who shrank from bloodshed.And he thought it not impossible that this "gentle-man so noble, so compassionate and tender," might bejust such a man, and this "fallen angel" such a victim,And he determined to watch and observe. And hefurther resolved to treat the interesting patient with allthe studious delicacy and respect due to a refined andaccomplished woman in the full possession of her facul-ties. If she were really mad, this demeanor would nothurt her; and if she were not mad, it was the onlyproper conduct to be observed toward her, as any othermust be equally cruel and offensive.

Am not I and the 'queen' inmates of thisame ward of incurables, in the same lunatic asylum  .'""Yes, but not with equal justice of cause. The 'queei:'is a hopelessly deranged, but happy lunatic. Youmadam, are a lady who has retained the full possessioiof your faculties amid circumstances and surrounding;that must have overwhelmed the reason of a weakermind." The lady looked at him in wonder and almost in joy. ."Ah, it was not the strength of my mind; it wasstrength of the Almighty upon whom my mind stayed for time and for eternity, that has saved myson in all these nmany yearsl But how did you that I was not mad?

I can readilybelieve that he did. Dr. St. Jean is not a very bad man;but he is a charlatan and a dullard; he received the storyof my reported insanity as he received me, as an advan-tage to his institution; and he never gave himself theunprofitable trouble to investigate the circumstances. Itold him the truth about myself as calmly as I now speakto you; but somebody else had told him that this truthwas the fiction of a deranged imagination, and he foundit more convenient and profitable to believe somebodyelse!

You see that Iready for you," she said, holding out her hand."You are looking very well this morning?" said Traverse, smiling."Yes, hope is a fine tonic, Dr. Rocke."She was seated by the same window at which Traverhad first seen her, and she now beckoned the young doctto come and take a seat near her."My story is almost as melodramatic as a moder rOmance, Dr. Rocke," she said.Traverse bowed gravely and waited."My father was a French patriot, who suffered deain the cause of liberty, when I, his only child, wasfourteen years of age. My mother, broken-hearted by loss, followed him within a few months. I was left orphan and penniless, for our estate was confiscated." .<pb n="211"/>End of the Lady's Story.           211'Ah, your sorrows came early and heavily indeed," saidTraverse."Yes; well, a former servant of my father, held anhumble situation of porter, on the ground floor of a house,the several floors of which were let out to different lodg-ers. This poor man and his wife gave me a temporaryhome with themselves. Among the lodgers of the housethere was a young Virginian gentleman of fortune, travel-ing for pleasure and improvement, whose name was Mr.Eugene Le Noir.""Le Noir I" cried Traverse, with a violent start."Yes I what is the matter?""It is a familiar Virginian name, madam, that is all;pray go on.""Mr. Le Noir was as good and kind as he was wise andcultivated. He used to stop to gossip with old Cliquotevery time he stopped at the porter's room to take or toleave his key. There he heard of the poor little orphan ofthe guillotine, who had no friend in the world but herfather's old servant. He pitied me, and after many con-sultations with Father and Mother Cliquot, he assumedthe position of guardian to me, and placed me at one ofthe best schools in Paris. He lingered in the city andcame to see me very often; but always saw me in thepresence of madam, the directress. I clung to him withthe affection for a father or an elder brother, and I knewhe loved me with the tender, protecting affection that hewould have given a younger sister, had he possessed one.Ah!

I was wild with grief, not onlyupon his account but upon my own, at the prospect oflosing him, my only friend! I was but a child, and aFrench child to boot.

I am sure I did not hear a word untilhe spoke. Putting me out of his arms, he said:"'I must go, my child; duty calls me.'"'Then take me with you-take your poor little onewith you, and do not pull her out of your warm, goodheart, or she will wither and die like a poor flower tornup by the roots!" I cried, between my sobs and tears."He drew me back to his bosom and whispered:"'There is but one way in which I can take you withme, my child. Will you be my wife, little Capitolie?''Capitolal"' cried Traverse, with another great start."Yes; why? what is the matter now?""Why, it is such an odd name, that is all. Pray, pro-ceed, madam.""We were married the same day, and sailed the thirdmorning thereafter from Havre for the United States,where we arrived, alas! only to find the noble gentleman,my Eugene's father, laid in his grave. After Mr. LeNoir's natural grief was over, we settled down peaceablyto our country life at the Hidden House-"'The Hidden Housel"' again exclaimed TraverseRocke."Yes; that is another odd name, isn't it? Well, I wasvery happy.

I cannot talk of this!" cried the widow,breaking down, overwhelmed with the rush of terriblerecollections.Traverse poured out a glass of water, and handed it toher.She drank it, made an effort at self-control, and re-sumed:'Thus, scarcely sixteen years of age, I was a widow,<pb n="213"/>End of the Lady's Story.          213helpless, penniless, and entirely dependent upon mybrother-in-law, Colonel Gabriel Le Noir; for *by theterms of their father's will, if Eugene died without issue,the whole property descended to his younger brother,Gabriel. To speak the truth, Colonel Le Noir was ex-ceedingly kind to me after my awful bereavement, untila circumstance was discovered that changed all our rela-tions. It was two months after my husband's death, thatI discovered, with mingled emotions of joy and sorrow,that Heaven had certainly destined me to become amother. I kept my cherished secret to myself as longas it was possible, but it could not indeed be long con-cealed from the household. I believe that my brother-in-law was the first to suspect it. He called me into hisstudy one day and I obeyed like a child. And there herudely questioned me upon the subject of my sacredmother-mystery. He learned the truth more from mysilence than from my replies, for I could not answer him.""The brute! the miserable hound!" ejaculated Trav-erse."Oh, Dr. Rocke, I could not tell you the avalanche ofabuse, insult, and invective that he hurled upon my de-fenseless head. He accused me of more crimes than Ihad ever heard talked of. He told me that my conditionwas an impossible one unless I had been false to thememory of his brother; that I had dishonored his name,disgraced -his house, and -brought myself to shame; that Ishould leave the roof, leave the neighborhood, and dieas I deserved to die, in a ditch! I made no reply. I wascrushed into silence under the weight of his reproaches.""The caitiff! the poltroon! Ah, poor stranger, whydid you not leave the house at once and throw yourselfupon the protection of the minister of your parish, orsome other kind neighbor?""Alas, I was a child, a widow, and a foreigner, all inone. I did not know your land, or your laws, or yourpeople. I was not hopeful or confident; I had sufferedso cruelly, and I was overwhelmed by his abuse.""But did you not know, dear lady, that all his rage wasaroused only by the fact that the birth of your childwould disinherit him?""Ah, no. I was not aware, at that time, that Gabriel<pb n="214"/>214        End of the Lady's Story.Le Noir was a villain. I thought his anger honest,though unjust; and I was as ignorant as a child-I had'no mother nor matronly friend to instruct me. I knewthat I had'{broken no command of God or man-that Ihad been a faithful wife, but when Gabriel Le Noin.accused me with such bitter earnestness, I feared that some strange departure from the usual course of nature had occurred for my destruction. And I was over-whelmed by mortification, terror, and despair.""Ah, the villain!" exclaimed Traverse, between histeeth."He told me at last, that, to save the memory of hisidead brother he would hide my dishonor; and -he ordered,me to seclude myself from the sight of all persons. I-obeyed him like a slave, grateful even for the shelter ofihis roof.""A roof that was your own, as he very well knew..And he knew also, the caitiff, that if the circumstancebecame known, the whole State would have protectedyou in your rights, and ejected him like a cur.""Nay, even in that case no harm should have reachehim on my account. He was my husband's brother.""And worst enemy. But proceed, dear lady.""Well, I secluded myself as he commanded. For foumonths I never left the attic to which he had ordereme to retreat. At the end of that time I became thmother of twins-a boy and a girl. The 'boy only openehis eyes on this world to close them again directly. T hgirl was living and healthy. The old nurse who attendeme had an honest and compassionate face; I persuadeher to secrete and save the living child, and to presethe dead babe to Colonel Le Noir as the only one; fthe suspicions that had never been awakened for myswere alarmed for my child. I instinctively felt that hwould have destroyed it.""The mother's instinct is like inspiration,"Traverse."It may be so! Well, the old woman pitied medid as I desired. She took the dead child to ColonelNoir, who carried it off, and afterward buried it asole heir of his elder brother. The old woman off my living child and my wedding ring, concealed <pb n="215"/>End of the Lady's Story.          215her ample shawl. Anxiety for the fate of my childcaused me to do what nothing else on earth would havetempted me to do-to creep about the halls and passageson tiptoe and under cover of the night, and' listen atkeyholes," said the lady, blushing deeply at the recol-lection."You-you were perfectly right, Mrs. Le Noirl In aden of robbers, where your life and honor were always atstake, you could not have done otherwise!" exclaimedTraverse, warmly."I learned by this means that my poor old nurse hadpaid with her liberty for her kindness to me. She hadbeen abducted and forced from her native country, to-gether with a child found in her possession, which they,evidently suspected, and I knew, to be mine. Oh,Heaven the agony then of thinking of what might beher unfortunate fate-worse than death, perhaps! I feltthat I had only succeeded in saving her life-doubtfulgood !"Here Mrs. Le Noir paused in thought for a few mo-ments, and then resumed."It is the memory of a long, dreary and hopeless im-prisonment, my recollection of my residence in thathouse! In the same manner in which I gained all myinformation, I learned that it was reported in the neigh-borhood that I had gone mad with grief for the loss ofmy husband and that I was an inmate of a madhouse inthe North! It was altogether false! I never left theHidden House in all those years until about two yearsago. My life there was dreary beyond all conception.I was forbidden to go out or to appear at a window! Ihad the whole attic, containing some eight or ten rooms,to rove over, but I was forbidden to descend. An ill-looking woman, called Dorcas Knight, between whomand the elder Le Noir there seemed to have been somesinful bond, was engaged ostensibly as my attendant, butreally as my jailer. Nevertheless, when the sense ofconfinement grew intolerable I sometimes eluded hervigilance and wandered about the house at night.""Thence no doubt," said Traverse, "giving rise to thereport that the house was haunted!"Mrs. Le Noir smiled, saying:<pb n="216"/>2r6        End of the Lady's Story."I believe the Le Noirs secretly encouraged that re-port. I'll tell you why. They gave me a chamber lampenclosed in an intense blue shade, that cast a strange,unearthly light around. Their ostensible reason was toinsure my safety from fire. Their real reason was thatthis light might be seen from without in what was re-puted to be an uninhabited portion of the house, andgive color to its bad reputation among the ignorant ofbeing haunted.""So much for the origin of one authenticated ghoststory," said Traverse."Yes; and there was still more circumstantial evidenceto support this ghostly reputation of the house. As theyears passed I had, even in my confined state, gatheredknowledge in one way and another-picking up straybooks and hearing stray conversation; and so, in theend I learned how gross a deception and how great awrong had been practiced upon me. I was not wise orcunning. I betrayed constantly to my attendant myknowledge of these things, in consequence of which myodnfinement became still more restricted.""Yes, they were afraid of you, and fear is always themother of cruelty," said Traverse."Well, from the time that I became enlightened as tomy real position, all my faculties were upon the alert tofind means of escaping and making my condition knownto the authorities. One night they had a guest, ColonelEgler, of the army. Old Dorcas had her hands full, andforgot her prisoner. My door was left unlocked. So,long after Colonel Eglen had retired to rest, and whenall the household were buried in repose, I left my atticand crept down to the chamber of the guest, with noother purpose than to make known my wrongs and ap.peal to his compassion. I entered his chamber, ap-proached his bed to speak to him, when this hero of ahundred fields started up in a panic, and at the sightof the pale woman who drew his curtains in the deadof night, 'he shrieked, violently rang his bell, and faintedprone away.""Hal ha! hal He could brave an army, or marchlinto a cannon's mouth, easier than meet a supposed<pb n="217"/>End of the Lady's Story.          217denizen of another worldl Well, Dr. Johnson believedin ghosts," laughed Traverse."It remained for me to retreat as fast as possible tomy room to avoid the Le Noirs, who were hurrying withheadlong speed to the guest chamber. They knew, ofcourse, that I was the ghost, although they affected totreat their visitor's story as a dream. After that myconfinement was so strict that for years I had no oppor-tunity of leaving my attic. At last the strict espionagewas relaxed. Sometimes my door would be left un-locked. Upon one such occasion, in creeping about inthe dark, I learned, by overhearing a conversation be-tween Le Noir and his housekeeper, that my long-lostdaughter, Capitola, had been found, and was living atHurricane Halll This was enough to comfort me foryears. About three years ago, the surveillance over mewas so modified that I was left to roam about the upperrooms of the house at will, until I learned that they hada new inmate, young Clara Day, a ward of Le Noir.Oh, how I longed to warn that child to flyl But I couldnot. Alas again I was restricted to my own room, lestI should be seen by her. But again, upon one occasion,old Dorcas forgot to lock my door at night. I stoleforth from my room and learned that a young girl,caught out in the storm, was to stay all night at theHidden House. Young girls were not plentiful in thatneighborhood, I knew. Besides, some secret instincttold me that this was my daughter. I knew that shewould sleep in the chamber under mine, because thatwas the only habitable guest-room in the whole house.In the dead of night I left my room and went below andentered the chamber of the young girl. I went first tothe toilet table to see if among her little girlish orna-ments I could find any clew to her identity. I found itin a plain gold ring--the same that I had intrusted tothe old nurse. Some strange impulse caused me to slipthe ring upon my finger. Then I went to the bed andthrew aside the curtains to gaze upon the sleeper. Mygirl! my own girll With what strange sensations I firstlooked upon her facel Her eyes were open and fixedupon mine in a panic of terror.

Late the next,.morning we reached an uninhabited country-house,i;where I was again imprisoned, in charge of an old dumbiwoman whom Le Noir called Mrs. Raven. This I after-;ward understood to be Willow Heights, the property of.the orphan heiress, Clara Day. And here, also, for the:term of my stay, the presence of an unknown inmate gotjthe house the reputation of being haunted. The old|dumb woman was a shade kinder to me than Dorcas.Knight had been; but I did not stay in her charge very,,long. One night the Le Noirs came in hot haste. Theyoung heiress had been delivered from their charge ba decree of the Orphans' Court, and they had to giveup her house. I was drugged and hurried away. Somnarcotic sedative must have been insinuated into mfood, for I was in a state of semi-insensibility and milddelirium during the whole course of a long journeyby land and sea, which passed to me like a dream, an+;at the end of which I found myself here.

And when I found that was a prisoner in a lunatic asylum, far, far away frolthe neighborhood where, at least, I had once known, I gave way to the wilder grief that further confirmed the story of my madness. I have been here twyezrs, occasionally giving way to outbursts of wild de !spair, that the doctor calls frenzy. I was sinking itan apathy when one day I opened the little Bible thai<pb n="219"/>End of the Lady's Story.           219Say upon the table of my cell.

It saved me-itsaved me from madness, it saved me from despair!There is a time for the second birth of every soul; thattime had come for me. From that hour, this book hasbeen my constant companion and comfort. I havelearned from its pages how little it matters how or wherethis fleeting, mortal life is passed, so that it answersits purpose of preparing the soul for another. I havelearned patience with sinners, foregiveness of enemies,and confidence in God. In a word, I trust I have learnedthe way of salvation, and in that have learned every-thing. Your coming, and your words, young friend,have stirred within my heart the desire to be free, tomingle again on equal terms with my fellow-beings, and,above all, to find and to embrace my child. But notwildly anxious am I even for these earthly blessings.These, as well as all things else, I desire to leave to theLord, praying that His wfll may be mine! Young friend,my story is told.""'Madam," said Traverse, after a thoughtful pause,"our fates have been more nearly connected than youcould have imagined. Those Le Noirs have been myenemies, as they are yours. That young orphan heiress,who appealed from their cruelty to the Orphans' Court,is my own betrothed. Willow Heights is her patri-mony, and is now her quiet home, where she lives withmy mother, and where in their name I invite you tocome. And take this comfort also-your enemy nolonger lives. Months ago I left him ill with a mortalwound; this morning the papers announce his death.There remains, therefore, but little for me to do but totake legal measures to free you from this place, andrestore you to your home. Within an hour I shall setout for New Orleans, for the purpose of taking t.einitiatory steps.

' PROS PECTS BRIGHTEN.             /Thus far our fortune keeps an onward course, And we are graced with wreaths of victory. -SHAKESPEARE.Leaving Mrs. Le Noir, Traverse went down to theistable, saddled the horse that had been allotted to his use,'and set off for a long day's journey to New Orleans,where late at night he arrived, and put up at the St.Charles.He slept deeply from fatigue until late the next morn-ing, when he was awakened by the sound of drumstrumpets and fifes, and by general rejoicing.He arose and looked from his windows to ascertain cause, and saw the square full of people in a state of thehighest excitement, watching for a military processiocoming up the street. It was the United States troops, under their gallcommanders, who had landed from the steamboats th4morning and were now marching from the quay up their quarters at the St. Charles. As they advanced, Traverse, eagerly upon the 1recognized his own regiment, and presently saw MaiGreyson himself.Traverse withdrew from the window, hurriedlypleted his toilet, and hastened downstairs, where he sofound himself face to face with Herbert, who, warmlgrasping his hand, exclaimed:"You here, old friend? Why, I thought you were dowin East Feliciana, with your interesting patient "  :"It is for the interest of that 'interesting patient'I am here, Herbert! Did I tell you she was one of tvictims of that demon, Le Noir?""No; but I know it from another source. I as much, or more, of her, perhaps, than you do." "Ahl" exclaimed Traverse, in surprise."Yes; I know, for instance, that she is Capitomother, the long lost widow of Eugene Le Noir, the di<pb n="221"/>Prospects Brighten.            221tress of the Hidden House, and the ghost who drew folks'curtains there at night.""Then you do know something about her, but how didyou arrive at the knowledge i""By the 'last dying speech and confession' of GabrielLe Noir, confided to me, to be used in restitution after hisdecease  But, come, there is the second bell I Our messare going in to breakfast; join us and afterward you andI will retire and compare notes," said Herbert, taking thearm of his friend, as they followed the moving crowd intothe breakfast parlor.After the morning meal was concluded the friendswithdrew together to the chamber occupied by TraverseRocke, where they sat down for mutual explanations.Herbert first related to Traverse all that had occurredfrom the time that the latter left the City of Mexico, in-cluding the arrival of Craven Le Noir at the dying bed ofhis father, the subsequent death and funeral of Colonel LeNoir, and the late emigration. of Craven, who, to avoidthe shame of the approaching revelation, joined a partyof explorers bound for the recently-discovered goldmines of California."The civilized world is then rid of two villians at once,"said the uncompromising Traverse.Herbert took from his pocket the confession of ColonelLe Noir, which he said he was now at liberty to use as hethought proper for the ends of justice; that certainparts of the disclosure intimately concerned TraverseRocke, to whom he should, therefore, read the whole.The confession may be briefly summed up as follows:The first item was, that he had sought to win the affec-tions of Marah Rocke, the supposed wife of Major IraWarfield; he had sedulously waylaid and followed herwith his suit during the whole summer; she had con.stantly repulsed and avoided him; he, listening to his ownevil passions, had bribed her maid to admit him in the darkto Marah's cabin, upon a certain night when her husbandwas to be absent; that the unexpected return of MajorWarfield, who had tracked him to the house, had pre-vented the success of his evil purpose, but had not savedthe reputation of the innocent wife, whose infuriated hus-band would not believe her ignorant of the presence of<pb n="222"/>222           Prospects Brighten.the villain in her house; that he, Gabriel Le Noir,hatred as well as in shame, had forborne until Dnowlmake the explanation, which he hoped might now, latelife as it was, bring the long-severed pair together,establish Marah Rocke and her son in their legalsocial rights.The second item in the black list of crime was the deatof his elder brother, whom he declared he had not itended to kill. He said that, having contracted largewhich he was unable to pay, he had returned secretly fhis distant quarters to demand the money frombrother, who had often helped him; that, meeting hbrother in the woods, he made this request.

Herbert, it ap-palls me to think of it !"Then, after deep thought, he added:"This, then, was the secret of my dear mother's longunhappiness! She was Major Warfield's forsaken wife.Herbert, I feel as though I never, never could forgivemy fatherl""Traverse, if Major Warfield had willfully and wan-tonly forsaken your mother, I should say that your re-semtment was natural and right!

Your parents were both victims of a cruelconspiracy, and he suffered as much in his way as shedid in hers," said Herbert."I always thought, somehow, that my dear mother wasa forsaken wife.

And this discussionkept up until long after they retired, and until sleep ovetook them.The next morning Traverse conducted his friend doto the breakfast parlor, to introduce him to Dr. St. Jewho, as soon as he perceived his young medical ant, sprang forward, exclaiming:"Grand Heaven!

And to prove the truth of his words,Traverse desired Herbert to read from the confession theportion relating to this fraud, and to show the doctor thesignature of the principal and the witness.To have seen the old French doctor then I I rejoice ina Frenchman, for the frank abandon with which he giveshimself up to his emotions.

I read good news upon yowsmiling face, my friend  Tell it!

And in half an hour afterthe whole party took leave of Dr. Pierre St. Jean his "institution incomparable," and set forth onjourney to New Orleans, whence in two days afterthey sailed for the North. And now, dear reader, tyou and me take the fast boat, and get home before  !to see our little Cap, and find out what adventures shlnow engaged in, and how she is getting on. <pb n="227"/>CHAPTER XXIX.CAPITOLA A CAPITALIST.Plumed victoryIs truly painted with a cheerful look,Equally distant from proud insolenceAnd sad detection.-MASSINGc.How glad I am to get back to my little Cap; for Iknow very well, reader, just as well as if you had told me, that you have been grumbling this good while for thewant of Cap. But I could not help it, for, to tell thetruth, I was pining after her myself, which was the rea-son that I could not do 'half justice to the scenes of theMexican War.Well, now let us see what Cap has been doing-whatoppressors she has punished-what victims she has de-livered-in a word, what new heroic adventures she hasachieved.Well, the trial of Donald Bayne, alias Black Donald,was over. Cap, of course, had been compelled to ap-pear against him. During the whole course of the trialthe courtroom was crowded with a curious multitude,"from far and near," eager to get sight of the notoriousoutlaw.Black Donald, through the whole ordeal, deportedhimself with a gallant and joyous dignity, that wouldhave better become a triumph than a trial.He was indicted upon several distinct counts, the mostserious of which-the murder of the solitary widow andher daughter in the forest cabin, and the assassination ofEugene Le Noir in the woods near the Hidden House-were sustained only by circumstantial evidence. Butthe aggregate weight of all these, together with his verybad reputation, was sufficient to convict him, and BlackDonald was sentenced to death.This dreadful doom, most solemnly pronounced bythe judge, was received by the prisoner with a loudlaugh, and the words:"You're out o' your reckoning now, cap'trl I neverwas a saint, the Lord knows, but my hands are free from<pb n="228"/>2a8         Capitola a Capitalistblood-guiltiness!

And before OldHurricane could prevent her, Capitola had jumped over.two or three intervening seats and climbed up to the sideof the dock, and reached up her hand to the prisoner,saying:"God help you Donald Bayne, in your great trouble,and I will do all can to help you in this world. I willgo to the governor myself, and tell him I know younever did any murder.'"Remove the prisoner," said the judge, peremptorily.The constables approached and led away Black Don-ald.Old Hurricane rushed upon Cap, seized ter, and,shaking her fiercely, exclaimed, under his breath:"You-you-you-you New York hurraw boy youfoundling! you vagabond you vagrantl you bratl youbeggar I will you never be a lady I to go and Shake handswith that ruffian I""Sure, uncle, that's nothing now; I have slhaken handswith you often enough !""Demmy, you-you-you New York trash, what doyou mean by that?""Of course I mean, uncle, that you are as rough a ruf-fian as ever Donald Bayne was '"Demmy, I'll murder you 1""Don't uncle; they have an uncivilized way here ofhanging murderers," said Cap, shaking herself free ofOld Hurricane's grasp, and hastening out of the court-room to mount her horse and ride home.One night after tea, Capitola and her uncle occupiedtheir usual seats by the little bright wood fire, that thechilly evening and the keen mountain air made agree-able, even in May.<pb n="229"/>Capitola a Capitalist.          2Old Hurricane was smoking his pipe and reading hispaper.Cap was sitting with her slender fingers around herthroat, which she, with a shudder, occasionally com-pressed."Well, that demon Black Donald will be hanged thetwenty-sixth of July," said Old Hurricane, exultingly,"and we shall get rd of one villain, Cap.""I pity Black Donald, and I can't bear to think of hisbeing hanged! It quite breaks my heart to think thatI was compelled to -bring him to such a fate I""Oh, that reminds me! The reward offered for theapprehension of Black Donald, to which you were en-titled, Cap, was paid over to me for you. I placed it toyour account in the Agricultural Bank.""I don't want itl I won't touch it! The price ofblood. It would burn my fingers I" said Cap."Oh, very well. A thousand dollars won't go a beg-ging," said Old Hurricane."Uncle, it breaks my heart to think of Black Donald'sexecutionl It just does! It must be dreadful, thishanging. I have put my fingers around my throat andsqueezed it, to know how it feels, and it is awful. Evena little squeeze makes my head feel as if it would burst,and I have to let go. Oh, it is horrible to think of 1""Well, Cap, it wasn't intended to be as pleasant astickling, you know. I wish it was twenty times worse!It would serve him right, the villain! I wish it was law-ful to break him on the wheel-I do!""Uncle, that is very wicked in you! I declare I won'thave it! I'1 write a petition to the governor to com-mute his sentence, and carry it all around the countrymyself !""You wouldn't get a soul to sign it to save your life,much less his.""Ill go to the governor myself, and beg him to par-don Donald Bayne!""Ha! ha! ha the governor would not do it to save allour lives; and if he were to do such an outrageous thing,he might whistle for his re-election!""I declare, Donald Bayne shall not be hung-and so,there!" said Cap, passionately.<pb n="230"/>230          Capitola a Capitalist. "Whe-ewl You'll deliver him by the strength of your :arm, my little Donna Quixota." "I'll save him in one way or another, now mind I tell you! He sinned more against me than against anybody  ielse, and so I have the best right of anybody in the world to forgive him, and I do forgive him! And he shan't be hung I I say it " ""You say itl ha! hal hal Who are you, to turn asidethe law?""I, Capitola Black, say that Donald Bayne, not having 'deserved to be hung, shall not be hung! And in one ;way or another, I'll keep my word."And Cap did her best to keep it. The next morning she mounted Gyp and rode up to Tip-Top, where she em- ployed the village lawyer to draw up a petition to the '.governor for the commutation of Donald Bayne's sen-tence. And then she rode all over the country to try;to get signatures to the document. But all in vainl. .People of every age and condition too thoroughly feared,,i,and hated the famous outlaw, and too earnestly wished^'to be entirely and forever rid of him, to sign any petitionsfor a commutation of 'his sentence. If a petition for hisinstant execution had been carried around, it would havestood a much better chance of success.Cap spent many days in her fruitless enterprise, but last gave it up-but by no means in despair, for -- "I'll save his life, yet! by one means or another! I},can't change clothes with him as I did with Clara, he'9  1too big; but one way, or other, I'll save him," said Cap&ito herself. She said it to no one else, for the more diffi..cult the enterprise, the more determined she was to suceceed, and the more secretive she grew as to her measures1t'In the meantime the outlaw, double-ironed, was con-i:fined in the condemned cell, the strongest portion of the' county jail. All persons were strictly prohibited fion"visiting him, except certain of the clergy.They did all they could to bring the outlaw to a sensedof his condition, to prepare him to meet his fate and to)induce him to make a confession and give up the retrce4aof his band. And Donald listened to them with respect, acknowl1-<pb n="231"/>Capitola a Capitalist.          23)edged himself a great sinner, and knelt with them whenthey knelt to pray for him.But he denied that he was guilty of the murders forwhich he had been doomed to die, and he utterly refusedto give up his old companions, replying to the ministersin something like these words:"Poor wretches! they are no more fit to die than Iam, and a condemned cell, with the thought of the scaf-fold before him, are not exactly the most favorable cir-cumstances under which a man might experience sincererepentance, my masters."And so, while the convict listened with docility to allthat the ministers had to say, he steadily persisted inasserting his own innocence of the crimes for which hewas condemned, and in his refusal to deliver up his com-panions.Meantime, Capitola, at Hurricane Hall, was doing allshe could to discover or invent means to save the life ofBlack Donald. But still she said no more about it, evento Old Hurricane.One evening, while Cap was sitting by the fire with herthoughts busy with this subject, her uncle came in,saying:"Cap, I have got some curiosities to show youl""What are they?" said Cap, languidly."A set of burglar's tools, supposed to belong to somemember of Black Donald's band! One of my negroesfound them in the woods in the neighborhood of theDevil's Punch Bowl. I wrote to the sheriff concerningthem, and he requested me to take care of them untilhe should have occasion to call for them. Look, did youever see such things?" said Old Hurricane, setting downa canvas bag upon the table, and turning out from it allsorts of strange-looking instruments-tiny saws, files,punches, screws, picks, etc., etc., etc.Cap looked at them with the most curious interest,while Old Hurricane explained their supposed uses."It must have been an instrument of this sort, Cap.that that blamed demon, Donald, gave to the imprisonedmen to file their fetters off withl" he said, showing athin file of tempered steel.<pb n="232"/>2)2          Capitola a Capitalist."That," said Cap, "hand it here; let me see itl" and she examined it with the deepest interest."I wonder what they force locks with?' she inquired."Why, this, and this, and thisl" said Old Hurricane, producing a burglar's pick, saw and chisel.Cap took them and scrutinized them so attentively that :Old Hurricane burst out into a loud laugh, exclaiming: "You'll dream of housebreakers to-night, Capl" and taking the tools he put them all back in the little canvas bag, and put the -bag up on a high shelf of the parlor..closet.The next morning, while Cap was arranging flowers'on the parlor mantelpiece, Old Hurricane burst in uponher with his hands full of letters and newspapers, and his heart full of exultation. Throwing up his hat and cutting .an alarming caper for a man of his age, he exclaimed:"Hurrah, Cap! Hurrah! Peace is at last proclaimedand our victorious troops are on their way home! it'sall in the newspapersl and here are letters from Herbert dated from New Orleansl Here are letters for you, andhere are some for me. I have not opened them yet;Hurrah, Cap! Hurrah!""Hurrah, unclel Hurrah!" cried Cap, tossing up heWdowers and rushing into his arms. "Don't squeeze me into an apoplexy, you little bear," :said Old Hurricane, turning purple in the face from thelsavage hug of Cap's joyful arms. "Come along and sit down with me, at this table, and let us see what the let.lters have brought us."They took their seats opposite each other, at a small table, and Old Hurricane threw the whole mail betweea' them, and began to pick out the letters. "That's for you, Cap. This is for me," ie said, pitch-..ing out two in the handwriting of Herbert Greyson.Cap opened hers, and commenced reading. It was, i iifact, Herbert's first downright, practical proposal of mar.-".riage, in which he begged that their union might take place as soon as he should' return, and that as he hwritten to his uncle by the same mail, upon another subaject, which he did not wish to mix up with his own mriage, she would, upon a proper opportunity, let 6e!uncle know of their plans.':. 4<pb n="233"/>Capitola a Capitalist.           23}T3pon my word, he takes my consent very coolly as amatter of course, and even forces upon me the disagree-able duty of asking myself of my own uncle. Whoeverheard of such proceedings! If he were not coming homefrom the wars, I declare I should get angry; but I won'tget upon my dignity with Herbert-dear, darling, sweetHerbert-if it were anybody else, shouldn't they know thedifference between their liege lady and Tom Trotter?However, as it's Herbert, here goes. Now, I supposethe best way to ask myself of uncle, for Herbert, will bejust to hand him over this letter. The dear knows it isn'tso over and above affectionate that I should hesitate.Uncle," said Cap, pulling Old Hurricane's coat-sleeve."Don't bother me, Cap," exclaimed Major Warfield,who sat there holding a large, closely-written documentin his hand, while his great round eyes strained from theirsockets, as they passed along the lines with devouringinterest."Well, I do declare  I do believe he has received aproposal of marriage himself," cried Cap, shooting muchhearer the truth than she knew.Old Hurricane did not hear her. Starting up with thedocument in his hand, he rushed from the room, and wentand shut himself up in his own study."I vow, some widow has offered to marry him," saidCap, to herself.Old Hurricane did not come to dinner, nor to supper.But after supper, when Capitola's wonder was at its cli-max, and while she was sitting by the little wood fire thatthe chilly evening required, Old Hurricane came in, look-ing very unlike himself, in an humble, confused, depre-cating, yet happy manner, like one who had at once amortifying confession to make, and a happy secret to tell."Cap," he said, trying to repress a smile, and growingpurple in the face."Oh, yes; you've come to tell me, I suppose, thatyou're going to put a step-aunt-in-law over my head, onlyyou don't know how to announce it," answered Capitola,little knowing how closely she had come to the truth;when to her unbound astonishment, Old Hurricane an-swered:"Yes, my dear, that's just itl"<pb n="234"/>234          Capitola a Capitalist."Whtl My eyes!

She laughed until thtears man down her cheeks. She wiped her eyes anlooked at Old Hurricane, and every time she saw his cofused and happy face, she burst into a fresh paroxysthat seemed to threaten her life or her reason."Who is the happy-   . Oh, I can't speak! Oh, I''kilt entirely!'" she cried, breaking off in the midst oher question, and falling into fresh convulsions."It's no new love, Cap. It's my old wifel" said 01Hurricane, wiping his face.This brought Capitola up with a jerk. She sat boltupright, gazing at him with her eyes fixed as if in death"Cap," said Old Hurricane, growing more and morconfused, "I've been a married man more years than I likto think of I Cap, I've-I've a wife and grown-up sonWhat do you sit there staring at me for, you little demonWhy don't you say something to encourage me, you littlwretch?""Go on," said Cap, without removing her eyes."Cap, I was-a jealous-passionate-demmyl Confession isn't in my line  A diabolical villian made me believe that my poor little wife wasn't good !""There!

She was glad; she was angry with him;she was sorry for him; she was divided between diversimpulses to hug and kiss him, to cry over him, and toseize him and give him a good shaking. And betweenthetm she did nothing at al.Old Hurricane was again the first to speak."What was that you wished to say to me, Cap, when Iran away from you this morning?""Why, uncle, that Herbert wants to follow your ex-ample, and-and-and--" Cap blushed and brokedown."I thought as much. Getting married at his age, a4boy of twenty-five," said the veteran, in contempt."Taking a wife at your age, uncle, an infant of sixty-six.""Bother, Cap! Let me see the fellow's letter to you."Cap handed it to him, and the old man read it."If I were to object, you'd get married all the same.Demmy I you're both of age. Do as you please.""Thank you, sir," said Cap, demurely."And now, Cap, one thing is to be noticed. Herbertsays, both in your letter and in mine, that they were tostart to return the day after these letters were posted.These letters have been delayed in the mail. Conse-quently we may expect our hero here every day. But,Cap, my dear, you must receive them. For to-morrowmorning, please the Lord, I shall set out for Stauntonand Willow Heights, and go and kneel down at the feetof my wife, and ask her pardon on my knees."Cap was no longer divided between the wish to pullOld Hurricane's gray beard and to cry over him. Shethrew iherself at once into his arms and exclaimed:"Oh, uncle! God bless youl God bless you! Godbless you  It has come very late in life, but may yoube happy with her through all the ages of eternity."Old Hurricane was deeply moved by the sympathy ofhis little madcap, and pressed her to his bosom, saying:"Cap, my dear, if you had not set your heart uponHerbert, I would marry you to my son Traverse, andyou two should inherit all that I have in the world. Butnever mind, Cap, you have an inheritance of your own.<pb n="236"/>^6    ~  Capitola a Capitalist.Cap, Cap, my dear, did it ever occur to you that yu might have had a father and mother?" "Yes, often!

What do you think of that,!now, what do you think of that, you beggar ?" cried Old" :Hurricane. A shriek pierced the air, and Capitola, starting up, stood before Old Hurricane, crying in an impassioned :voice:"Uncle uncle I don't mock me I don't overwhelm me! II do not care for wealth or power; but tell me of the parents who, possessing both, cast off their unfortunate child-a girl, too -to meet the sufferings and perils of jsuch a life as mine had been, if I had not met you 1" "Cap, my dear, hushl Your parents were no more tblame for their seeming abandonment of you than Ito blame for the desertion of my poor wife.

Sit dow my dear, and I will read the copy of his whole confesion, and afterward, in addition, tell you all I know upthe subject."Capitola resumed her seat, and Major Warfield reathe confession of Gabriel Le Noir, and afterward conDtinued the subject by relating the events of that memor;able Hallow Eve when he was called out in a snowstorm>to take the dying deposition of the nurse who had been'{abducted with the infant Capitola.And at the end of his narrative, Cap knew as much of;her own history as the reader has known all along. "And I have a motherl And I shall even see soon! You told me she was coming home with theparty, did you not, uncle ?" said Capitola. "Yes, my child.

And now,my dear Cap, I must bid you good-night and go to bed,for I intend to rise to-morrow morning long before day-light, to ride to Tip-Top to meet the Staunton stage,"said the old man, kissing Capitola.Just as he was about to leave the room, he was ar-rested by a loud ringing and knocking at the door.,Wool was heard running along the front hall to answerthe summons."Cap, I shouldn't wonder much if that was our party.I wish it may be, for I should like to welcome them be-fore I leave home to fetch my wife," said Old Hurricane,in a voice of agitation.And while they were still eagerly listening, the doorwas thrown open by Wool, who announced:"Marse Herbert, which I mean to say, Major HerbertGreyson," and Herbert entered and was grasped by thetwo hands of Old Hurricane, who exclaimed:"A'h, Herbert, my ladl I have got your letters. It isall right, Herbert, or going to be so. You shall marryCap when you like. And I am going to-morrow morn-ing to throw myself at the feet of my wife.""No need of your going so far, dear sir, no need. Letme speak to my own dear girl a moment, and then Ishall have something to say to you," said Herbert, leav-ing the old man in suspense, and going to salute Capi-tola, who returned his fervent embrace by an honest,downright frank kiss, that made no secret of itself."Capitolal My uncle has told you all?""Every single bit, so don't lose time by telling it allover again! Is my mother with you?""Yes, and I will bring her in, in one moment; butfirst I must bring in some one else," said Herbert, kiss-ing the hand of-Capitola and turning to Old Hurricane,to whom he said:"You need not travel far to find Marah. We tookStaunton in on our way, and brought her and Clara along.Traverse," he said, going to the door, "bring in yourmother."And the next instant, Traverse entered with the wifeof Major Warfield upon his arm.<pb n="238"/>a28          Light at the Eventide.Old Hurricane started forward to meet her, exclaim-ing in a broken voice:"Marah, my dear Marah, God may forgive me, but canyou--can you ever do so?" and he would have sunk ather feet, but that she prevented, by meeting him andsilently placing both her hands in his. And so quietlyMarah's forgiveness was expressed, and the reconcilia-tion sealed.Meanwhile Herbert went out and brought in Mrs. LeNoir and Clara. Mrs. Le Noir with a Frenchwoman'simpetuosity, hurried to her daughter, and clasped her toher heart.Cap gave one hurried glance at the beautiful, palewoman that claimed from her a daughter's love, andthen, returning the caress, she said:"Oh, mammal Oh, mmmana! If I were only a boyinstead of a girl, I would thrash that Le Noir within aninch of his life! But I forgot-he is gone to his ac-count !"Old -Hurricane was at this moment shaking hands withhis son, Traverse, who presently took occasion to leadup and introduce his betrothed wife, Clara Day, to herdestined father-in-law.Major Warfield received her with all a soldier's gallan-try, a gentleman's courtesy and a father's tenderness.He next shook hands with his old acquaintance, Mrs.Le Noir.And then supper was ordered, and the evening waspassed in general and comparative reminiscences andcheerful conversation.CHAPTER XXX.LIGHT AT THE EVENTIDE.They shall be blessed exceedingly; their storeGrow daily, weekly more and more, And peace so multiply around,Their very hearth seems holy ground. -MARY Hownr.The marriage of Capitola and Herbert, and that ofClara and of Traverse, was fixed to take place upon the  :first of August, which was the twenty-first birthday of <pb n="239"/>Light at the Eventide.           239the doctor's daughter, and also the twenty-fifth anniver-sary of the wedding of Ira Warfield and Marah Rocke.German husbands and wives have a beautiful customof keeping the twenty-fifth anniversary of their marriageby a festival which they call the "silver wedding." Andthus Major Warfield and Marah resolved to keep thisfirst of August, and farther to honor the occasion byuniting the hands of their young people.There was but one cloud upon the happiness of Capi-tola; this was the approaching execution of BlackDonald.No one else seemed to care about the matter, until acircumstance occurred which painfully aroused their in-terest.This was the fact that the governor, through thesolicitation of certain ministers of the gospel, who repre-sented the condemned as utterly unprepared to meet hisfate, had respited him until the first of August, at whichtime he wished the prisoner to be made to understandthat his sentence would certainly, without further delay,be carried into effect.This carried a sort of consternation into the heart ofevery member of the Hurricane Hall household.The idea of Black Donald being hung in their imme-diate neighborhood upon their wedding day was appal-ling!Yet there was no help for it, unless their weddingwas postponed to another occasion than that upon whichOld Hurricane had set his heart. 'No one knew whatto do.Cap fretted herself almost sick. She had cudgeledher brains to no purpose. She had not been able tothink of any plan by which she could deliver BlackDonald. Meantime the last days of July were rapidlypassing away.Black Donald, in the condemned cell, maintained hisfirmness, resolutely asserting his innocence of any capitalcrime, and persistently refusing to give up his band. Asa last motive of confession, the paper written by GabrielLe Noir upon his deathbed was shown him. He laugheda loud, crackling laugh, and said that was all true, butthat he, for his part, never had intended to harm a hair<pb n="240"/>240         Light at the Eventide.of Capitola's head; that he had taken a fancy to the girlwhen he had first seen her, and had only wanted tocarry her off and force her into a marriage with himself;that he had pretended to consent to her death only forthe purpose of saving her life.When Cap heard this she burst into tears, and said shebelieved it was truelThe night before the wedding of Gapitola and Her-bert, and Clara and Traverse, and of the execution ofBlack Donald, came.At Hurricane Hall, the two prospective bridegroomswere busy with Old Hurricane over some papers thathad to be prepared in the library.The two intended brides were engaged, under thedirection of Mrs. Warfield, in her dressing-room, con-suiting over certain proprieties of the approaching festival But Capitola could give only half attention tothe discussion. Her thoughts were with the poor con-denned man who was to die the next day.And suddenly she flew out of the room, summoned hergroom, mounted her horse, and rode away.In his condemned cell Black Donald was bitterlyrealizing how unprepared lie was to die, and how utterlyimpossible it was for him to prepare in the short hoursleft. He tried to pray, but could form no other petitionthan that he might be allowed, if possible, a little longerto fit himself to meet his Creator. From his cell hecould hear the striking of the great clock in the prisonhall. And as every hour struck, it seemed "a nail drivenin his coffin."At eight o'clock that night the warden sat in his littleoffice, consulting the sheriff about some details of theapproaching execution. While they were still in dis-cussion, a turnkey opened the door, saying:"A lady to see the warden."And Capitola stood before them!"Miss Black!" exclaimed both sheriff and warden, ris-ing in surprise, gazing upon our heroine, and addressingher by the name under which they had first known her."Yes, gentlemen, it is I. The truth is, I cannot restto-night without saying a few words of comfort to thepoor man who is to die to-morrow. So I came hither,<pb n="241"/>Light at the Eventide.           241attended by my groom, to know if I may see him for afew minutes.""Miss Black, here is the sheriff. It is just as hepleases. My orders were so strict that had you come tome alone I should have been obliged to refuse you.""Mr. Keepe, you will not refuse me," said Capitola,turning to the sheriff."Miss Black, my rule is to admit no one but the offi-cers of the prison and the ministers of the gospel to seethe condemnedl This we -have been obliged to observeas a measure of safety. This convict, as you are aware,is a man of consummate cunning, so that it is really won-derful he has not found means to make his escape, closelyas he has been -watched and strongly as he has beenguarded."Ah, but, Mr. Keepe, his cunning was no match formine, you know!" said Capitola, smiling."Haa-ha-l so it was notl You took him very cleverly!very cleverly, indeed! In fact, if it had not been foryoul I doubt if ever we should have captured BlackDorald at all  The authorities are entirely indebted toyou for the capture of this notorious outlaw. And reallythat being the aose, I do think it would be straining apoint to refuse you admittance to see 'himl So, MissBlack, you have my authority for visiting the condemnedman in his cell and giving 'him all the comfort you can.I would attend you thither myself, but I have got to r-^to see the captain of a militia company to be on the sceneof action to-morrow," said the sheriff, who soon aftertook leave of the warden and departed.Tlhe warden then called a turnkey and ordered him toattend Miss Black to the condemned cell.         iaThe young turnkey took up a lamp and a great keyjand walked before, leading the way downstairs to a cellin the interior of the basement, occupied by BlackDonald.He unlocked the door, admitted Capitola, and thenwalked off to the extremity of the lobby, as he was ac-customed to do when he let in the preachers.Capitola thanked Heaven for this chance, for had henot done so she would have had to invent some excuseof getting rid of him.<pb n="242"/>242         Light at the Eventide.She entered the cell. It was very dimly lighted fromthe great lamp that hung in the lobby, nearly oppositethe cell door.By its light she saw Black Donald, not only doublyironed, but confined by a chain and staple to the wall.He was very pale and haggard from long imprisonmentand great anxiety.Cap's heart bled for the poor banned and blighted out-law, who had not a friend in the world to speak a kindword to him in his trouble.He also recognized her, and rising and coming to meether as far as the length of the chain would permit, heheld out his hand and said:"I am very glad you have come, little one; it is verykind of you to come and see a poor fellow in his extrem-ityl You are the first female that has been in my cellsince my imprisonment. Think of that, child  I wantedto see you, too; I wanted to say to you, yourself, again,that I never was guilty of murder, and that I only seemedto consent to your death to save your life! Do you be-lieve this? On the word of a dying man, it is truth!""I do believe you, Donald Bayne," said Capitola, in abroken voice."I hear that you have come into your estate! I amglad of it. And they tell me that you are going to bemarried to-morrow! Well! God bless you, little onel""Oh, Donald Bayne!

Heaven knows whether I amdoing right-for I do not. I know many people wouldblame me very much, but I hope that He who forgavethe thief upon the cross and the sinful woman at Hisfeet, will not condemn me for following His own com-passionate example. For, Donald, as I was the personwhom you injured most of all others, so I consider thatI of all others have the best right to pardon you and setyou free. Oh, Donald! use well the life I am about to give you, else I shall be chargeable with every futuresin you commit!""In the name of mercy do not -hold out a false hope.I had nerved myself to die.""But you were not prepared to meet your Maker.

You have broughtme no revolver 1"Capitola turned pale."Donald, I could easily have brought you a revolver;but I would not, even to save you from to-morrow'sdeath. No, Donald! no! I give you the means of freeingyourself, if you can do it, as you may, without blood-shed. But, Donald, though your life is not justly for-feited, your liberty is, and so I cannot give you the meansof taking any one's life for the sake of saving your own."<pb n="244"/>Q44      fjight at the Eventide.I "You are right," said the outlaw.'"Listen, further, Donald.

Oh I Lord grant that Black Donald may.get clear off td-night, for he isn't fit to die " said Cap toherself as she urried out of the prison.Her young groom was waiting for her, and shemounted her lbrse and rode until they got to the oldhaunted churcU at the end of the village, when, drawingrein, she said:"Jem, I am  very tired. I will wait here, and youmust just ride back to the village, to Mr. Cassell's liverystable, and get a gig, and put your horse into it, and comeback here to drive me home, for I cannot ride."Jem, who never questioned his imperious little mis-tress' orders, rode off at once to do her bidding.Cap immediately dismounted from her pony, and ledIhu gnder the deep shadows of the elm tree, where she<pb n="245"/>Light at the Eventide.          245fastened him. Then taking his face between her hands,and looking him in the eyes, she said:"Gyp, my son, you and I have had many a frolic to-gether, but we've got to part now  It almost breaks myheart, Gyp, but it is to save a fellow creature's life, and itcan't be helped I He'll treat you well, for my sake, dearGyt. Gypl he'll part with his life sooner than sell you!Good-by, dear, dear Gyp !"Gyp took all these caresses in very nonchalant manner,only snorting and pawing in reply.resently the boy came back, bringing the gig. CGponce more hugged Gyp about the neck, pressed her cheekagainst his mane, and with a whispered "Good-by, dearGyp," sprang into the gig, and ordered the boy to drivehome."An' leab the pony, miss?""Oh, yes, for the present; everybody knows Gyp; noone will steal him. I have left him length of line enoughto move around a little and eat grass, drink frbm thebrook, or lie down. You can come after him early to-morrow morning."The little groom thought this a queer arrangement, buthe was not in the habit of criticising his young mistress'actions.Capitola got home to a late supper, and to the anxiousinquiries of her friends she replied that she had been tothe prison to take leave of Black Donald, and begged thatthey would not pursue so painful a subject.And, in respect to Cap's sympathies, they changed theConversation.That night the remnant of Black Donald's band wereassembled in their first old haunt, the Old Road Inn.IThey had met for a twofold purpose-to bury their oldmatron, Mother Raven, who, since the death of her patronand the apprehension of her captain, had returned to theinn to die--nd to bewail the fate of their leader, whoseexecution was expected to come off the next day.The men laid the poor old woman in her woodlandgrave, and assembled in the kitchen to keep a death watchin sympathy with their "unfortunate" captain. Theygathered around the table, and foaming mugs of ale werefreely quaffed, for "sorrow's dry, they said.

But donst think Ireproach you, ladsl Well I know that you could do   <nothing on earth to save me I No one on earth could havehelped me except the one who really freed me-Capitola !"

Nbw listen, lads, for I must talk fastl I have already lost agreat deal too much time. I went first to the cave inthe Punch Bowl, and, not finding you there, came here ata venture, where I am happy to meet you for the lasttime-for to-night we disband forever."" Twa our intention, captain," said Hal, in a melan-cialy voice.Black Donald then threw himself into a seat at thehead of the table, poured out a mug of ale, and invitedhis band to pledge him.

As for me, I shall have to quit the countryaltogether, and it will take nearly 'half this sum to en-able me to do it. Now I shall have not a minute more togive you! So once more pledge your captain, andaway I"The men filled their mugs, rose to their feet, andpledged their leader in a parting toast and then:"Good luck to you all l" exclaimed Black Donald,waving his hat thrice above his head with a valedictoryhurrah. And the next moment -he was gone!That night, if any watchman had been on guard nearthe stables of Hurricane Hall, he might have seen a tallman mounted upon Capitola's pony, ride up in hot haste,dismount and pick the stable lock, take Gyp by thebridle and lead him in, and presently return leading outFleetfoot, Old Hurricane's racer, upon which hemounted and rode away.The next morning, while Capitola was dressing, hergroom rapped at the door, and, in great dismay, beggedthat he might speak to Miss Cap one minute."Well, what is it, Jem?" said Capitola."Oh, Miss Cap, you'll kill mel I done 'been got uplong afore day and gone to Tip-Top arter Gyp; butsomebody done been stole him away afore I got there !""Thank Heaven!" cried Capitola, to little Jem's un-speakable amazement. For to Capitola the absence ofher horse meant just the escape of Black Donald The next minute Cap sighed and said:"Poor Gypl I shall never see you again!"'That was all she knew of the future!That morning while they were all at breakfast, a<pb n="248"/>248         Light at the Eventide.groom from the stable came in, with a little canvas bagin his hand, which he laid, with a bow, before his master.Major Warfield took it up; it was full of gold, andupon one side was written, in red chalk:Three hundred dollars, to pay for Fleetfoot. Black Donald,Reformed Robber.While Old Hurricane was reading this inscription, thegroom said that Fleetfoot was missing from his stall, andthat Miss Cap's pony, that was supposed to -have beenstolen, was found in his place, with this bag of gold tiedaround his neck."It is Black Donald! he has escaped 1" cried Old Hurtricane, about to fling himself into a rage, when his furi.ous eyes encountered the gentle gaze of Marahb, that felllike oil on the waves of his rising passion."Let him go!

"Equally,"of course, the bridegrooms were handsome and elegant,proud and happy.To this old-fashioned wedding succeeded a round ofdinners and evening parties given by the wedding guests.And when all these old-time customs had been observedfor the satisfaction of old friends, the bridal party wentupon the new-fashioned tour, for their own delight. Theyspent a year in traveling over the Eastern Continent, andthen returned home to settle upon their patrimonialestates.Major Warfield and Marah lived at Hurricane Hall<pb n="249"/>Light at the Eventi e.            249and, as his 'heart is satisfied and at rest, his temper isgradually improving.

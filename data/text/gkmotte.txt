MONSIEUR MOTTE.
<p>IT was near mid-day in June. A dazzling stream of vertical sun-rays fell into the quadrangular courtyard of the Institute St. Denis, and filled it to suffocation with light and heat. The flowers which grew in little beds, dotting the gray-flagged surface, bowed their heads under their leaves for shelter.</p>
<p>A thin strip of shadow, stretching from the side of the schoolhouse, began to creep over the garden, slowly following the sun in its progress past the obtruding walls of neighboring buildings, until he should disappear behind a certain square steeple far off in the distance; then the shade would entirely cover the yard; then the stars would be coming out, languid and pale; and then the fragrance of oleander
<pb n="12     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
and jasmine, travelling from yard to yard, would burden the air, soothing the senses in order to seduce the imagination.</p>
<p>Along the narrow shaded strip, quite filling it up, moved a class of girls in Indian file, their elbows scraping against the rugged bricks of the wall as they held their books up to the openings of their sun-bonnets. A murmur of rapidly articulated words, like the murmur of boiling water in a closed kettle, came from the leaves of their books, while from their hidden lips dropped disjointed fragments of "l'Histoire de France."</p>
<p>The foundation, as well as key-stone, of St. Denisian education, it was but natural that the examination in "l'Histoire de France, par D. L&#x00E9;vi Alvares, p&#x00E8;re," should fill the last days of the scholastic term; and as a prize in that exercise set the brightest crown upon the head of the victor, it was not strange that it should be conducted with such rigidity and impartiality as to demoralize panic-stricken contestants whose sex usually warranted justice in leaving one eye at least unbound.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, a trust in luck is
<pb n="13     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
the most reliable source of comfort. If experience proved anything, if the study of the history of France itself made one point clear, it was the dependence of great events on trifles, the unfailing interposition of the <hi rend="italic">inattendu</hi>, and, consequently, the utter futility of preparation. The graduating class of 1874 turned their pages with clammy fingers, and repeated mechanically, with unwearied tongues, any passage upon which Fate should direct their eyes; none dared be slighted with impunity, the most insignificant being perhaps the very one to trip them up; the most familiar, the traitor to play them false. A laggard church clock in the neighborhood gave them each eleven separate, distinct shocks. It warned them that two minutes and a half had already been consumed on the road from one class-room to the other, and reminded them of Monsieur Mignot's diabolical temper.</p>
<p>A little girl, also in a large sun-bonnet, with a placard marked "<hi rend="italic">Passe-Partout</hi>" around her neck, turned an angle of the building suddenly and threw the nervous ranks into dire confusion; the books went down, the bonnets up.</p>
<pb n="14     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Seigneur! qu'est-ce que c'est?"</hi></p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma ch&#x00E8;re!</hi> how you frightened me!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mon Dieu!</hi> I thought it was Monsieur Mignot!"</p>
<p>"I am trembling all over!"</p>
<p>"I can hardly stand up!"</p>
<p>"Just feel how my heart beats!"</p>
<p>"You had better hurry up, <hi rend="italic">mes enfants</hi>," replied the little one, in the patronizing tone of personal disinterestedness; "it is past eleven."</p>
<p>"But we don't know one word," they groaned in unison,--"not one single word."</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! you are frightened, that's all; you always say that." She gave one of them a good-natured push in the direction of the door about which they were standing in distressful hesitation.</p>
<p>"I tell you, old Mignot is in a horrible temper. <hi rend="italic">Il a fait les quatre cents coups</hi> in our class; threw his inkstand at Stephanie Morel's head."</p>
<p>The door, with startling coincidence, was violently pulled open at these words, and a gray-haired, spectacled old gentleman thrust out an irate face in quest of his dilatory class. Thrown by the catastrophe into a state of complete nes-
<pb n="15     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
cience of all things historical, from Clovis to Napoleon, the young ladies jerked off their sun-bonnets and entered the room, while the little girl escaped at full speed. A drowsy, quiet, peaceful half-hour followed in the yard,--a surprising silence for the centre of a busy city, considering the close proximity of two hundred school-girls. It was a mocking contrast to the scene of doubt, hesitation, and excitement on the other side of the closed door,--a contrast advantageous to the uneducated happiness of the insects and flowers.</p>
<p>A door-bell rang; not the bell of the pretty little gate which admitted visitors to the rose-hedged, violet-bordered walk leading to Madame's <hi rend="italic">antichambre</hi>, but the bell of the capacious <hi rend="italic">porte-coch&#x00E8;re which was reserved for the exits and entrances of scholars and domestics. After a carefully measured pause, the ring was repeated, then again, and again. The rusty organ of intercommunication squeaked and creaked plaintively after each disturbance as if forced from a sick-bed to do painful and useless service. A gaunt, red-haired woman finally came out in obedience to the summons, with an elaboration
<pb n="16     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
of slowness which the shuffling sabots clearly betrayed to the outsider, as evidenced by a last superfluous, unnecessarily energetic pull of the bell-knob.</p>
<p>She carefully unrolled her sleeves as she sauntered along, and stood until she loosened the cord which reefed her dress to an unconventional height. Then she opened the grille and looked out.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ah, je le savais bien</hi>," she muttered, with strong Gascon accent.</p>
<p>There was a diminutive door cut into the large gate. It looked, with its coat of fresh paint, like a barnacle on the weather-beaten exterior. Opening with the facility of greased hinges, it was an unavoidable compromise between the heavy cypress timber and iron fastenings, prescribed by the worldly, or heavenly, experience of St. Denis as the proper protection of a young ladies' boarding-school, and the almost incessant going and coming which secluded femininity and excluded shops made necessary.</p>
<p>"But I can't get in there!" said a woman outside.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Tant pis</hi>." And the little door was closed.</p>
<pb n="17     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"But I must come in with my basket."</p>
<p>A shrug of the shoulders was the only reply through the <hi </p>r<p>end="italic">grille.</hi></p>
<p>"It is Mamzelle Marie's toilet for the exhibition."</p>
<p>The little gate was again held open.</p>
<p>"Don't you see I can't get in there?"</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"&#x00C7;a m'est l&#x00E9;al."</p>
</p>A snort of exasperation was heard on the outside, and a suppressed "<hi rend="italic">C'est un pen fort!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Will you open the big gate for me so that I can bring in Mamzelle Marie's dress?"</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>"Well, then, I shall ring at Madame's bell."</p>
<p>The white woman did not lack judgment. She was maintaining her own in a quarrel begun years ago; a quarrel involving complex questions of the privileges of order and the distinctions of race; a quarrel in which hostilities were continued, year by year, with no interruptions of courtesy or mitigation by truce. This occasion was one of the perquisites of Jeanne's position of <hi rend="italic">femme de m&#x00E9;nage</hi>,--slight compensation enough when compared to the indignities put upon her as a white woman, and the humilia-
<pb n="18     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
tions as a sensitive one by "<hi rend="italic">cette n&#x00E9;gresse Marcelite</hi>." But the duration of triumph must be carefully measured. Marc&#x00E9;lite's ultimatum, if·carried out, would quickly reverse their relative positions by a bonus to Marcelite in the shape of a reprimand to Jeanne. She allowed her foe, however, to carry her basket in the hot sun as far as the next bell, and even waited until she put her hand on it before the iron bar fell and the massive structure was allowed to swing open.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ristocrate!</hi>" she muttered, without looking at either woman or basket.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Canaille!</hi>" whispered the other, with her head thrown back and her nose in the air.</p>
<p>Glancing at the line of shade in the yard to see how near it was to twelve o'clock, for want of other accommodation Marc&#x00E9;lite went into an open arbor, put her basket on the floor, and wiped her face with a colored foulard handkerchief. "<hi rend="italic">Fait chaud mo dit toi</hi>," she said aloud in creole, her language for self-communion. She pulled her skirts out on each side, and sat down with a force that threatened the stability of the bench; then, careless of creeping and crawling
<pb n="19     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
possibilities, leaned her head back against the vine-covered wall. The green leaves formed a harmonious frame for the dark-brown face, red and yellow <hi rend="italic">tignon</hi>, and the large gold ear-rings hanging beneath two glossy <hi rend="italic">coques</hi> of black wool. Her features were regular and handsome according to the African type, with a strong, sensuous expression, subdued but not obliterated. Her soft black eyes showed in their voluptuous depths intelligence and strength and protecting tenderness. Her stiff purple calico dress settled in defining folds about her portly limbs. A white kerchief was pinned over her untrammelled bosom; her large, full, supple waist was encircled by the strings of her apron, which were tied in a careful bow at her side.</p>
<p>Besides the large basket, she carried on her arm a small covered one, which, if opened, would reveal her calling to be that of hairdressing. She was the hairdresser of the school, and as such, the general <hi rend="italic">charg&#x00E9;e d'affaires, confidente</hi>, messenger, and adviser of teachers and scholars. Her discretion was proven beyond suspicion. Her judgment, or rather her intuition, was bold, quick, and effective. In truth, Marc&#x00E9;lite was as indis-
<pb n="20     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
pensable as a lightning-rod to the boarding-school, conducted as it was under the austere discipline of the old regime. Her smooth, round hands and taper fingers had been polished by constant friction with silken locks; her familiar, polite, gentle, servile manners were those contracted during a courtly life of dependent intimacy with superiors. It was said that her basket carried other articles besides combs, brushes, and cosmetics, and that her fingers had been found preferable to the post-office for the delivery of certain implicative missives written in the prose or verse of irresistible emotion. Even without her basket, any one, from her hands, gait, and language, would recognize a hairdresser of the elite, while in New Orleans, in the <hi rend="italic">Quartier Cr&#x00E9;ole</hi>, there was hardly a man, woman, or child who did not call her by name: Marc&#x00E9;lite Gaulois.</p>
<p>She lifted a palmetto fan, bound and tied to her waist with black ribbon, and holding it up between her and observation, betook herself in quiet and privacy to slumber,--a nap of delicious relaxation, so gentle that the bite of a mosquito, the crawling of an ant, an incipient
<pb n="21     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
snore, startled it; but so tenacious that the uplifted hand and dropping head resettled themselves without breaking its delicate filaments. A little, thin, rusty-voiced bell had now one of its three important daily announcements to make,--Recreation Time. From all over the city came corroborative evidence of the fact, by chronometers, some a little ahead and some a little behind meridian. This want of unanimity proclaimed the notorious and distressing difference of two minutes and a half between Church and State,--a difference in which the smallest watch in the school could not avoid participation.</p>
<p>It was the same little girl with the "<hi rend="italic">Passe-Partout</hi>" who published the truce to study. The rope of the bell and she were both too short, so she had to stand on tiptoe and jerk it in little quick jumps. The operation involved a terrible disproportion between labor invested and net profit, for which nothing but the gladsome nature of her mission, and the honorary distinction implied in it, could have compensated her. A moment of stillness, during which both the rope and the little girl quieted them-
<pb n="22     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
selves, and then, a shower of little girls fell into the yard;--all of them little girls, but not all of them  children, and as much. alike as drops of different colored water.</p>
<p>They were all dressed ii calico dresses made in the same way, with very full, short skirts, and very full, short waists, fastened, matron-fashion, in front. They all wore very tight, glossy, fresh, black French kid boots, with tassels or bows hanging from the top. With big sun-bonnets, or heavily veiled hats on their heads, thick gloves on their hands, and hand-kerchiefs around their necks, they were walking buttresses against the ardent sun. They held their lunch baskets like bouquets, and their heads as if they wore crowns. They carried on conversations in sweet, low voices, with interrupting embraces and apostrophic tendernesses:--</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ch&#x00E8;re!</hi>"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ch&#x00E8;rie!</hi>"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ange!</hi>"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">M'amie!</hi>"</p>
<p>They had a grace of ease, the gift of generations; a self-composure and polish, dating from
<pb n="23     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
the cradle. Of course they did not romp, but promenaded arm in arm, measuring their steps with dainty particularity; moving the whole body with rhythmic regularity, displaying and acquiring at the same time a sinuosity of motion. Their hair hung in plaits so far below their waists that it threatened to grow into a measuring-tape for their whole length.</p>
<p>The angular Jeanne appeared, holding a waiter at arm's-length over her head. She had no need to cluck or chirp; the sound of her sabots was enough to call around her in an instant an eager brood of hungry boarders, jumping and snatching for their portion of lunch. There was the usual moment of obstruction over the point of etiquette whether they should take their own piece of bread and butter or receive it from Jeanne. The same useless sacrifice of a test slice was made, and the obstinate servant had to give in with the same consolatory satisfaction of having been again true to her fixed principle to make herself as disagreeable as possible under any circumstances that the day might bring forth. There is great field for choice, even in slices of bread and butter. The
<pb n="24     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
ends, or knots of the loaves, split longitudinally, offer much more appetizing combinations of crust and crumb than the round inside slices. Knots, however, were the prerogative of the big girls; inside slices the grievance of the little ones. To-day, "<hi rend="italic">comme toujours</hi>," as they said, with a shrug, the primary classes had to take what was left them. But their appetite was so good, they ate their homely fare with so much gusto, that the day scholars looked on enviously and despised their own epicurean baskets, which failed to elicit such expectations and never afforded them similar gratification.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">&#x00C0;A la fin des fins!</hi> The door which concealed the terrible struggle going on with the history of France was opened. All rushed forward for news, with eager sympathy. It was a dejected little army that filed out after so protracted a combat, with traces of tears in their eyes and all over their flushed cheeks. Tired and nervous, not one would confess to a ray of hope. Certainty of defeat had succeeded to certainty of failure. The history of France, with its disastrous appliances of chronology, dynasties, conquests, and revolutions, had gained, ac-
<pb n="25     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
cording to them, a complete and unquestioned victory.</p>
<p>"Marie Modeste, look at Marc&#x00E9;lite," said one of the girls, hailing the diversion.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi> was coming out of the garden-house with her basket. One of the graduating class rushed forward to meet her, and both together disappeared in the direction of the dormitory stairway. "It is her toilette for the exhibition," was whispered, and curious eyes followed the basket invested with such preternatural importance. "They say <hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi> is going to give her a superb one."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Grand Concert Musicale et Distribution de Prix</hi> was to take place the next evening. All parents and friends had, for two weeks, been invited to "assist" by their presence. This annual f&#x00EA;te was pre-eminently <hi rend="italic">the</hi> f&#x00EA;te of St. Denis. It was the goal of the scholastic course, the beginning of vacation, and the set term to the young ladies' aspirations if not ambition. A fair share of books, laurel crowns, in green and gold paper, and a possible real gold medal was with them the end if not the aim of study from the opening of the school
<pb n="26     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
in September. Personally they could not imagine any state or condition in life when knowledge of French history would be a comfort or cosmography an assistance; but prizes were so many concrete virtues which lasted fresh into grandmotherhood. <hi rend="italic">Noblesse oblige</hi>, that the glory of maternal achievements be not dimmed in these very walls where their mothers, little creoles like themselves, strove for laurel crowns culled from the same imperishable tree in Rue Royale.</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite followed Marie through the dormitory, down the little aisle, between the rows of beds with their veils of mosquito netting, until they came to the farthest corner; which, when one turned one's back to the rest of the chamber, had all the seclusion and "sociability" of a private apartment. The furniture, however, did not include chairs, so Marie seated herself on the side of the bed, and, taking off her bonnet, awaited Marc&#x00E9;lite's pleasure to initiate her into the delightful mysteries of the basket.</p>
<p>She wondered where Marc&#x00E9;lite had picked up the artistic expedient of heightening the
<pb n="27     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
effect by playing on the feelings of the spectator; and she wondered if carrying that basket up the stairs had really tired those strong shoulders and make her so dreadfully hot; and if it were really necessary that each one of those thousand pins should be quilted into the front of that white kerchief; and if Marc&#x00E9;lite had made a vow not to open her mouth until she got out the last pin; and if--</p>
<p>She was naturally nervous and impatient, and twisted and turned ceaselessly on the bed during the ordeal of assumed procrastination. Her black eyes were oversized for her face, oversized and overweighted with expression; and most of the time, as to-day, they were accompanied by half-moon shadows which stretched half-way down her cheek. Over her forehead and temples the hieroglyphic tracery of blue veins might be seen, until it became obscured under the masses of black hair whose heavy plaits burdened the delicate head and strained the slender neck. The exterior of a girl of seventeen! That frail mortal encasement which precocious inner life threatens to rend and destroy. The appealing languor, the
<pb n="28     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
uncomplaining lassitude, the pathetic apathy, the transparent covering through which is seen the growth of the woman in the body of the child.</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite saw upon the bed the impatient figure of a petulant girl, wild for the sight of her first <hi rend="italic">toilette de bal</hi>. There lay on the bed, in reality, a proud, reserved, eager, passionate spirit, looking past toilettes, past graduating, past studies and examinations; looking from the prow of an insignificant vessel into the broad prospect, so near, so touching near, reserved for her, and all girls of seventeen,--that unique realm called "Woman's Kingom."</p>
<p>Romances and poetry had been kept from her like wine and spices. But the flowers bloomed, and music had chords, and moon-light rays, and were the bars of the school never so strong, and the rules never so rigid, they could not prevent her heart from going out toward the rays, nor from listening to the music, nor from inhaling the breath of the flowers. And what they said is what they always say to the girl of seventeen. It is the love-time of life, when the heart first puts
<pb n="29     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
forth its flowers; and what boarding-school can frustrate spring? Her mouth, like her eyes, was encircled with a shadow, faint, almost imperceptible, as was the timid suggestion of nascent passion which it gave to the thin, sad lips.</p>
<p>She was four years old when she came to this school; so Marc&#x00E9;lite told her, for she could not remember. Now she was seventeen. She looked at the strong, full maturity of Marc&#x00E9;lite. Would she, Marie, ever be like that? Had Marc&#x00E9;lite ever been like her? At seventeen, did she ever feel this way? This--oh, this longing! Could Marc&#x00E9;lite put her finger on the day, as Marie could, when this emotion broke into her heart, that thought into her brain? Did Marc&#x00E9;lite know the origin of blushes, the cause of tremors? Did Marc&#x00E9;lite ever pray to die to be relieved from vague apprehensions, and then pray to live in the faith of some great unknown but instinctive prophecy?</p>
<p>She forbore to ask. If Marc&#x00E9;lite had had a mother!--But did girls even ask their mothers these things? But she had no mother! Good,
<pb n="30     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
devoted, loyal as she was, Marc&#x00E9;lite was not a mother--not her mother. She had stopped at the boundary where the mother ceases to be a physical and becomes a psychical necessity. The child still clung to Marc&#x00E9;lite, but the young woman was motherless. She had an uncle, however, who might become a father.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">L&#x00E0;!</hi>" Marc&#x00E9;lite had exhausted her last devisable subterfuge, and made known her readiness to begin the show.</p>
<p>"L&#x00E0;! mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;! l&#x00E0;, ma mignonne!</hi> what do you think of that?" She turned it around by the belt; it seemed all covered over with bubbles of muslin and frostings of lace.</p>
<p>"Just look at that! Ah ha! I thought you would be astonished! You see that lace? <hi rend="italic">&#x00C7;a c'est du vrai</hi>, no doubt about that,--real Valenciennes. You think I don't know real lace, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mousseline des Indes?</hi> You ask Madame Treize--you know what she said? 'Well, Marc&#x00E9;lite, that is the prettiest pattern of lace and the finest piece of muslin I almost ever saw.' Madame Treize told me that herself; and it's true, for I know it myself."</p>
<pb n="31     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Madame Treize, Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<p>Madame Treize was the <hi rend="italic">ou ne pent plus</hi> of New Orleans for fashion and extravagance.</p>
<p>"Yes, Madame Treize. Who do you think was going to make your dress, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi> Madame <hi rend="italic">N'importe-qui?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite, it must have cost so much!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Eh bien</hi>, it's all paid for. What have you got to do with that? All you have got to do is to put it on and wear it. Oh, <hi rend="italic">mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;! ma petite ch&#x00E9;rie!</hi>"--what tones of love her rich voice could carry,--"if it had cost thousands and thousands of dollars it would not be too fine for you, nor too pretty."</p>
<p>"But, Marc&#x00E9;lite, I will be ashamed to wear it; it is too beautiful."</p>
<p>But the eyes sparkled joyfully, and the lips trembled with delightful anticipations.</p>
<p>"Here's the body! You see those bows? That was my taste. I said to myself, ' She must have blue ribbon bows on the shoulder,' and I went back and made Madame Treize put them on. Oh, I know Madame Treize; and Madame Treize, she knows me!"</p>
<p>"And the shoes, Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<pb n="32     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>Hands and voice fell with utter disgust.</p>
<p>"Now you see, Mamzelle, you always do that. Question, question, question, all the time. Why did n't you wait? Now you have spoiled it all,--all the surprise!"</p>
<p>"Pardon, Marcelite, I did not mean; but I was afraid you had forgotten--"</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;!</hi> when did Marc&#x00E9;lite ever forget anything you wanted?"</p>
<p>Marie blushed with shame at a self-accusation of ingratitude.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma bonne</hi> Marc&#x00E9;lite! I am so impatient, I cannot help it."</p>
<p>A bundle of shoes was silently placed in her lap. "White satin boots! Mar-c&#x00E9;-lite! White satin boots for me? Oh, I can't believe it! And I expected black leather!--how shall I ever thank my uncle for them; and all this? How can I ever do it?"</p>
<p>The radiant expression faded away from the nurse's face at these words.</p>
<p>"Oh, but I know it was your idea, Marc&#x00E9;lite! My good, kind, dear Marc&#x00E9;lite! I know it was all your idea. He never could have thought of all these beautiful things,--a man!"</p>
<pb n="33     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>She put her arms around the <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi>'s neck and laid her head on the broad, soft shoulder, as she used to do when she was a little, little girl.</p>
<p>"Ah, Marc&#x00E9;lite, my uncle can never be as kind to me as you are. He gives me the money, but you--"</p>
<p>She felt the hands patting her back and the lips pressed against her hair; but she could not see the desperate, passion caressing eyes, "savoring" her like the lips of an eager dog.</p>
<p>"Let us try them on," said Marc&#x00E9;lite.</p>
<p>She knelt on the floor and stripped off one shoe and stocking. When the white foot on its fragile ankle lay in her dark palm, her passion broke out afresh. She kissed it over and over again; she nestled it in her bosom; she talked baby-talk to it in creole; she pulled on the fine stocking as if every wrinkle were an offence, and slackness an unpardonable crime. How they both labored over the boot,--straining, pulling, smoothing the satin, coaxing, urging, drawing the foot! What patience on both sides! What precaution that the glossy white should meet with no defilement! Finally the button-holes
<pb n="34     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
were caught over the buttons, and to all intents and purposes a beautiful, symmetrical, solidified satin foot lay before them.</p>
<p>"Too tight?"</p>
<p>It might have been a question, but it sounded more like the laying of a doubt.</p>
<p>"Too tight! just look!"</p>
<p>The little toes made a vigorous demonstration of contempt and denial.</p>
<p>"I can change them if they are."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to wear sabots like Jeanne?"</p>
<p>"They will stretch, anyhow."</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite preferred yielding to her own rather than to another's conviction, even when they both were identical.</p>
<p>The boots were taken off, rolled in tissue-paper, and put away in the <hi rend="italic">armoire</hi>, which was now opened to its fullest extent to receive the dress.</p>
<p>Marie leaned against the pillow of the bed and clasped her hands over her head. She listened dreamily and contentedly to her praises thrown off by Marc&#x00E9;lite's fluent tongue. What would the reality be, if the foretaste were so sweet?</p>
<p>"I wonder what he will say, Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<pb n="35     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Qui &#x00E7;a?"</hi></p>
<p>"My uncle. Do you think he will be pleased?"</p>
<p>"What makes you so foolish, <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;?</hi>"</p>
<p>"But that's not foolish, Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>"Hum!"</p>
<p>"Say, Marc&#x00E9;lite, do you think he will be satisfied?"</p>
<p>"Satisfied with what?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you know, Marc&#x00E9;lite,--satisfied with me."</p>
<p>The head was thrust too far into the <hi rend="italic">armoire</hi> for an immediate answer.</p>
<p>"How can I tell, Mamzelle?"</p>
<p>"Mamzelle! Mamzelle! Madame Marc&#x00E9;lite!"</p>
<p>"Well then, <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>."</p>
<p>"Anyway, he will come to the concert--<hi rend="italic">Hein</hi>, Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<p>"What is it, Zozo?"</p>
<p>"My uncle; he is coming to the concert, isn't he?"</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite shrugged her shoulders; her mouth was filled with pins.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma bonne!</hi> do not be so mean; tell me if he is coming, and what he said."</p>
<p>"Poor gentleman! he is so old."</p>
<pb n="36     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Did he tell you that?"</p>
<p>Marie laughed; this was a standing joke between them.</p>
<p>"But, my child, what do you want him to say? You bother me so with your questions, I don't know what I am doing."</p>
<p>"But, Marc&#x00E9;lite, it is only natural for me to want him to come to the concert and see me in my pretty dress that he gave me."</p>
<p>"Well, when one is old and sick--"</p>
<p>"Sick! ah, you did not tell me that."</p>
<p>"But I tell it to you all the time!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Marc&#x00E9;lite!"</p>
<p>There is no better subject on which to exercise crude eloquence than the delinquencies of laundresses. A heinous infraction had been committed against the integrity of one of Marie's garments, and Marc&#x00E9;lite threatened to consume the rest of the day in expressions of disgust and indignation.</p>
<p>"So he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> coming to the concert?" the girl demanded, excitedly.</p>
<p>"Ah! there's the bell; you had better run quick before they send for you."</p>
<p>"No, I am excused until time to practise my
<pb n="37     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
duet. Marc&#x00E9;lite,"--the voice lost its excited tone and became pleading, humble, and timid,--"Marc&#x00E9;lite, do you think my uncle will like me?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mon Dieu!</hi> yes, yes, yes."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais ne t'impatiente pas, ma bonne</hi>, I can't help thinking about it. He has never seen me--since I was a baby, I mean--and I don't recollect him at all, at all. Oh, Marc&#x00E9;lite! I have tried so often, so often to recall him, and my <hi rend="italic">maman</hi>"--she spoke it as shyly as an infant does the name of God in its first prayer. "If I could only go just one little point farther back, just that little bit"--she measured off a demicentimetre on her finger--"but impossible. Maybe it will all come back to me when I see him, and the house, and the furniture. Perhaps if I had been allowed to see it only once or twice, I might be able to remember something. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> hard, Marc&#x00E9;lite, it is very hard not even to be able to recollect a mother. To-morrow evening!"--she gave a long, long sigh,--"only to-morrow evening more!"</p>
<p>The depravity of the washerwoman must have got beyond even Marc&#x00E9;lite's powers of
<pb n="38     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
description, for she had stopped talking, but held her head inside the shelf.</p>
<p>"One reason I want him to come to the concert is to take me home with him. In the first place, Madame would n't let me go unless he came for me; and--and I want the girls to see him; they have teased me so much about him. I believe, Marc&#x00E9;lite, that if my graduating were put off one day longer, or if my uncle did not come for me to-morrow evening, I would die. How foolish! Just think of all these years I have been here, summer after summer, the only boarder left during vacation! I didn't seem to mind it then, but now it's all different; everything has become so different this last year."</p>
<p>The tears had been gathering in her eyes for some time, and she had been smearing them with her finger off the side of her face to escape Marc&#x00E9;lite's notice; but now they came too fast for that, so she was forced to turn over and hide her face flat in the pillow.</p>
<p>"Crying, <hi rend="italic">mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9; What is the matter with you--oh, oh!--you do not feel well! something you do not like about your toilette, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi></p>
<pb n="39     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
Tell Marc&#x00E9;lite, <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E9;rie</hi>; tell your <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi>. There! there!"</p>
<p>Sobs were added to tears, until she seemed in conflict with a tornado of grief. She pressed her head tighter and tighter against the pillow to stifle the noise, but her narrow, high shoulders shook convulsively, and her feet twisted and turned, one over the other, in uncontrollable agitation. Marc&#x00E9;lite stood by her side, a look of keen torture on her emotional face. If the child had only been larger, or stronger! if she did not writhe so helplessly before her! if she had fought less bravely against the rending sobs! Ah! and if the shrouded form of a dead mother had not intervened with outstretched arms and reproachful eyes fixed upon Marc&#x00E9;lite. She could hold out no longer, but fell on her knees by the bed, and clasped her arms around the little one to hold her quiet. With her face on the pillow, and her lips close to the red, burning ear, she whispered the soothing tendernesses of a material heart. There was a balsam which never failed: a story she had often told, but which repetition had only made more difficult, more hesitating; to-day the
<pb n="40     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
words fell like lead,--about the father Marie had never seen, the mother she had never known, the home-shelter of her baby years, beyond even her imagination, and the guardian uncle, the question of whose coming to the concert had so excited her.</p>
<p>"Is Marie Modeste here?" asked a little voice through a far-off door.</p>
<p>Marie started. "Yes." Her voice was rough, weak, and trembling.</p>
<p>"They want you for the '<hi rend="italic">Cheval de Bronze</hi>.'"</p>
<p>She sat up and let the nurse smooth her hair and bathe her face, keeping her lips tightly shut over the ebbing sobs.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Marc&#x00E9;lite. Thank you for everything--for my beautiful dress, and my shoes; and thank my uncle too, and try and persuade him to come to-morrow evening, won't you, Marc&#x00E9;lite? Do not tell him about my crying, though. Oh, I want to go home so much, and to see him! You know if you want you can get him to come. Won't you promise me, <hi rend="italic">ma bonne?</hi>"</p>
<p>"You know I would kill myself for you, <hi rend="italic">mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>."</p>
<pb n="41     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>The good little Paula was waiting outside the door. Uncontrollable tears are too common in a girls' school to attract attention. They were crises which, though not to be explained, even the smallest girl understood intuitively, and for which were tacitly employed convenient conventional excuses.</p>
<p>"The <hi rend="italic">concours</hi> was very difficult, <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E8;re?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Yes, very difficult."</p>
<p>"And Monsieur Mignot is so trying. I think he gets more <hi rend="italic">exigeant</hi> every day."</p>
<p>And they kissed each other sympathetically on the stairway.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Grand Dieu Seigneur!</hi>" groaned Marc&#x00E9;lite, when Marie had left the room, holding her head with both hands. "What am I going to do now! I believe I am turning fool!"</p>
<p>Life was changing from a brilliant path in white muslin dresses to a hideous dilemma; and for once she did not know what to do. A travail seemed going on in her brain; her natural strength and audacity had completely oozed away from her. She began a vehement monologue in creole, reiterating assertions and explanations, stopping short always at one point.</p>
<pb n="42     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"My God! I never thought of that."</p>
<p>She looked towards the ceiling with violent reproaches to the <hi rend="italic">bon Dieu, doux J&#x00E9;sus, and Sainte-Vierge</hi>. Why had they left her alone to manage this? They knew she was a "nigger, nigger, nigger" (trying to humiliate and insult herself). Why hadn't they done .something? Why could n't they do something now? And all she had done for them, and that ungrateful patron saint, the recipient of so much attention, so many favors! She never had asked them anything for herself, thank God! Marc&#x00E9;lite could always manage her own affairs without the assistance of any one. But her <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;, for whom she had distinctly prayed and burned candles, and confessed and communed, and worked, and toiled, and kept straight! She clasped her flesh in her sharp, long nails, and the pain did her good. She could have dashed her head against the wall. She would gladly have stripped her shoulders to the lash, if--if it would do any good. She would kill herself, for the matter of that, but what would that prevent or remedy? The church was not far off, perhaps a miracle! But what miracle can avert the
<pb n="43     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
inevitable? She shoved her empty basket under the bed and went out upon the covered gallery that spanned the garden and led to Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re's bedchamber.</p>
<p>The quadrangle lay half overspread now by shadow. The gay <hi rend="italic">insouciante</hi> flowers moved gently in an incipient breeze, the umbrella top of the little summer-house warded the rays from the benches beneath, and kept them cool and pleasant. Her own face was not more familiar, more matter-of-fact to Marc&#x00E9;lite, and yet she saw in the yard things she had never remarked before. There was a different expression to it all. Flowers, summer-house, even the gray flags, depressed her and made her sad; as if they, or she, were going to die soon. She caught the balustrade in her hand, but it was not vertigo. What was it, then, that made her feel so unnatural and everything so portentous? This morning, life was so comfortable and small, everything just under her hand. She was mistress of every day, and night was the truce, if not the end of all trouble. But to-day had united itself to past and future in such a way that night was but a transparent veil that separated but could not
<pb n="44     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
isolate them one from the other. Time was in revolt against her; her own powers betrayed her; flight was impossible, resistance useless, death, even, futile.</p>
<p>What was the matter with her head, anyhow? She must be <hi rend="italic">voudoued</hi>. If she could only feel as she did this morning! The slatternly Jeanne shuffled underneath on her way to the bell, an augur of ill-omen. She would go and see Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re.</p>
<p>Madame (as she was commonly called) sat at her secr&#x00E9;taire writing. Her pen, fine pointed as a cambric needle, scratched under her fingers as if it worked on steel instead of paper. She was very busy, transferring the names from a list before her into the gilt-edged prize-books piled up in glowing heaps all around her. A strict observer would have noticed many inaccuracies which would have invalidated any claim to correctness on the part of her copy. There were not only liberties taken with the prize itself, but entire names were involved in transactions which the original list by no means warranted. These inaccuracies always occurred after consultation of another list kept in Madame's little drawer,
<pb n="45     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
--a list whose columns carried decimals instead of good and bad marks for lessons. A single ray of light, filtered through various intermedial shades and curtains, had been man&#x0153;uvred so as to fall on the small desk at a safe distance from Madame's sensitive complexion. At difficult calculations, she would screw up her eyes and peer at both lists brought into the focus of illumination, then would sink back into obscurity for advisory reflection.
There are so many calculations to be made, so many fine distinctions drawn, in a distribution of prizes! No one but a schoolmistress knows the mental effort requisite for the working out of an equation which sets good and bad scholars against good and bad pay. Why could not the rich girls study more, or the poor less? Oh, the simple beauty of strict, injudicious impartiality! Cursed be the inventor or originator of these annual rehearsals, where every one was rewarded except the rewarder!
On occasions like these any interruption is a deliverance; Madame heard with glad alacrity a knock at the door.
"<hi rend="italic">Ah! c'est toi</hi>, Marc&#x00E9;lite!"
<pb n="46     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite represented another matter of yearly consideration, another question of paramount importance, a suspensive judgment, involving, however, Madame alone. With the assistance of the hairdresser, many years ago (the date is not essential, and women are sensitive about such things), the principal of the Institut St. Denis had engaged in one of those struggles against Time to which pretty unmarried women seem pledged during a certain period, the fighting age, of their lives. It was purely a defensive struggle on her part, and consisted in a protest against that uglifying process by which women are coaxed into resignation to old age and death. So far, she had maintained her own perfectly; and Time, for all the progress he had made in the sweet, delicate face of Eug&#x00E9;nie Lareveill&#x00E8;re, might just as well have been tied for ten years past to one of the four posts of the bedstead. The musical concert and distribution of prizes and its consequent indispensable new toilette furnished an excellent date for an annual review and consultation, when old measures were discussed, new ones adopted, and the next campaign planned. Madame, however, did not feel
<pb n="47     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
this year the same buoyant courage, the same irrepressible audacity as heretofore. In fact, there was a vague suspicion in her breast, hitherto unacknowledged, that in spite of facial evidence she herself, <hi rend="italic">dans son int&#x00E9;rieur</hi>, was beginning to grow the least, little, tiny bit old. She felt like capitulating with the enemy, and had almost made up her mind to surrender--her hair. "<hi rend="italic">L'incertitude est le pire des maux, jusqu'au moment o&#x00F9; la r&#x00E9;alit&#x00E9; nous fait regretter l'incertitude</hi>." Should the conditions be proven too hard for mortal beauty, she could at least revolt again. Thank heaven! over there in Paris worked devoted emissaries for women, and the last word had not yet been said by the artists of hair-dyes and cosmetics.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Eh, bien, qu'en dis-tu</hi>, Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<p>The artistically arranged head, with its curls and puffs and frisettes clustered like brown silken flowers above the fair skin, was directly in the line of Marc&#x00E9;lite's vision. Who would have suspected that these were but transplanted exotics from the hot head of foreign youth? that under their adorning luxuriance lay, fastened by inflexible hairpins, the legitimate but deposed
<pb n="48     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
possessors of this crown? But they were old, gray, almost white, and Madame was suggesting for them a temporary and empirical resurrection. That head which daily for years she had moulded according to her comprehension of fashion; that inert little ball for which Marc&#x00E9;lite, in her superb physical strength, had almost felt a contempt,--she looked at it now, and, like the flowers in the garden, it was changed to her, was pregnant with subtle, portentous meaning. She was beginning faintly to suspect the truth. All this buzzing, whirling, thought, fear, calculation, retrospection, and prevision, which had come into her great, big, strong head only an hour ago, had been going on in this little, fragile, delicate handful of skull for years, ever since it was born. She saw it now, she knew it,--the difference between Madame's head and hers, between a consciousness limited by eternity and one limited by a nightly sleep, between an intelligence looking into immortality and one looking into the eyes of a confessor.</p>
<p>The room would have been quite dark but for that one useful ray which, after enlightening the path of distributive justice for Madame, fell
<pb n="49     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
on and was absorbed by a picture opposite. Out of the obscurity arose one by one the features of the bedchamber,--the supreme model of bedchambers in the opinion of the impressionable loyalists of St. Denis; a bedchamber, the luxury of which could never be surpassed, the mysterious solemnity never equalled; a bedchamber, in fact, created to satisfy the majestic coquettishness of the autocratic superior of an aristocratic school for girls.</p>
<p>Indistinct, undefined, vague fragments of color struggled up through the floor of sombre carpet. The windows, made to exclude the light, were draped with mantles of lace and silk hanging from gigantic, massive, convoluted gilt cornices. The grand four-posted mahogany bedstead, with its rigging of mosquito-netting and cords and tassels, looked like some huge vessel that by accident had lodged in this small harbor. So stupendous, so immeasurable, so gloomily, grandly, majestically imposing, this dark, crimson-housed bedstead looked in the small, dimly-lighted room, that little girls sent on occasional messages to Madame felt a tremor of awe at the sight of it, and understood instinctively, without
<pb n="50     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
need of explanation or elucidation, that here, indeed, was one of those <hi rend="italic">lits de justice</hi> which caused such dismay in the pages of their French history. The bureau with its laces and ribbons, its cushions, essence-bottles, jewel-cases, <hi rend="italic">vide-poches</hi>, and little galleried &#x00E9;tag&#x00E8;res full of gay reflections for the mirror underneath, was as coquettish, as volatile, as petulant an article of furniture as was ever condemned to bedchamber companionship with a <hi rend="italic">lit de justice</hi>.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">prie-dieu</hi> in front of the altar granted the occupant an encouraging view into all the visible appliances for stimulating faith in the things not seen. The willing heart, as by an ascending scale, rose insensibly from the humanity to the divinity of sacrifice and suffering: reliquaries, triply consecrated beads, palms, and crucifixes, pictures of sainted martyrs and martyresses (who contradicted the fallacious coincidence of homeliness and virtue), statuettes, prayer-books, pendent flasks of holy water, and an ecclesiastical flask of still holier liquid, impregnated with miraculous promises. A taper, in a red globe, burned with subdued effulgence below it all. Ghastly white and black bead wreaths, hanging
<pb n="51     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
under faded miniatures, set the bounds of mural consecration, and kept Madame mournfully reminded of her deceased husband and mother.</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite stood, like a threatening idol, in the centre of the room, her eyes glaring through the gloom with fierce doggedness. Her feet were planted firmly apart, her hands doubled up on her high, round, massive hips. The cords of her short, thick neck stood out, and her broad, flexible nostrils rose and fell with passion. Her untamed African blood was in rebellion against the religion and civilization whose symbols were all about her in that dim and stately chamber,--a civilization which had tampered with her brain, had enervated her will, and had duped her with false assurances of her own capability.</p>
<p>She felt a crushing desire to tear down, split, destroy, to surround herself with ruins, to annihilate the miserable little weak devices of intelligence, and reassert the proud supremacy of brute force. She longed to humiliate that meek Virgin Mother; and if the form on the crucifix had been alive she would have gloated over his blood and agony. She thirsted to get her thin,
<pb n="52     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
taper, steel-like fingers but once more on that pretty, shapely, glossy head.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Pauvre petite chatte!</hi> I shall miss her very much; you know, Marc&#x00E9;lite, it seems only a year or two since you brought her here a little baby, and now she is a young lady of seventeen. Thirteen years ago! What a <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E9;tive</hi> little thing she was! You were as much of a scholar here then as she; you had to stay with her so much. You have been a faithful nurse to her, <hi rend="italic">ma bonne femme</hi>. A mother could not have been more devoted, and very few would have done all you have for that child. Ah! that's a thing money can never pay for,--love. I hope Marie will always remember what you have been to her, and repay it with affection. But she will; she is a good girl,--a good, good girl, <hi rend="italic">pauvre petite!</hi> It is Monsieur Motte, though, who should give you a handsome present, something really valuable. I would like to know what he would have done for a <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi> for his niece without you. You remember that summer when she had the fever? Eh, well, she would have died but for you; I shall never forget her sad little face and her big black
<pb n="53     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
eyes. You know, her mother must see all that;
I can never believe, Marc&#x00E9;lite, that a mother cannot come back, sometimes, to see her children, particularly a little girl--"</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite listened with head averted. Her hands had fallen from her hips, her mouth slowly relaxed, and the lips opened moist and red. As if drawn by strains of music, she came nearer and nearer Madame's chair.</p>
<p>"She was always such a quiet little thing, <hi rend="italic">ma foi!</hi>" Madame's reminiscence was an endless chain. "I used to forget her entirely; but now she is going away, I know I shall miss her, yes, very much. I hope the world will be kind to her. She will be handsome, too, some day, when she does not have to study so hard, and can enjoy the diversions of society a little. By the time she is twenty you will see she will be <hi rend="italic">une belle femme</hi>. Ah, Monsieur Motte, you will be satisfied, <hi rend="italic">allez!</hi>"</p>
<p>The little pen commenced scratching away again, and this time registered the deed of prize of French history to <hi rend="italic">l'&#x00E9;l&#x00E8;ve</hi>, Marie Modeste Motte.</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite, with wistful eyes, listened for some
<pb n="54     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
more of the soft, sweet tones. She made the movement of swallowing two or three times to get the swelling and stiffness out of her throat.</p>
<p>"Mamzelle Marie, too, she will be sorry to leave Madame." Her voice was thick and unsteady.</p>
<p>"Oh no, girls are always glad to quit school. Very naturally, too. When one is young, one does not like to stay indoors and study, when there is so much outside,--dancing, music, beaux." A sigh interrupted Madame. "It is all past for me now, but I can recollect how I felt when I was seventeen. Apropos, Marc&#x00E9;lite, did you give my invitation to Monsieur Motte?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Madame."</p>
<p>The answer came after an interval of hesitation. At one moment Marc&#x00E9;lite's eyes flashed as if she would brave all results and refuse to respond.</p>
<p>"And what did he say?"</p>
<p>"He--he sent his compliments to Madame."</p>
<p>Madame looked around to see what the good-natured <hi rend="italic">coiffeuse</hi> meant by such sullen tones. "Yes; but did he say he would come to
<pb n="55     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
the concert? I wanted particularly to know that."</p>
<p>"He is so old, Madame."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">L&#x00E0;, l&#x00E0;, the same old excuse! I am so tired of it."</p>
<p>"But when one is old, Madame."</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! I do not believe he is too old for his own pleasure. I know men; old age is a very convenient excuse at times."</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite appeared to have no reply at the end of her ready tongue.</p>
<p>"But this time he must come, <hi rend="italic">par exemple!</hi> even if he is so old. I think he might subject himself to some little inconvenience and trouble to see his niece graduate. He has not put himself out much about her for twelve or thirteen years."</p>
<p>"God knows! Madame."</p>
<p>"God knows? <hi rend="italic">Mais</hi>, Marc&#x00E9;lite, how silly you talk! Don't you see that Monsieur Motte must come to-morrow night, at least to take Marie home? God does know, and so should he."</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite spoke as if galvanized by an inspiration. "Perhaps he wants Miss Marie to stay another year, Madame; you see, she is so
<pb n="56     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
young, and--and--there is so much to learn, <hi rend="italic">enfin</hi>."</p>
<p>"He wants that, does he? he wants that! Ah, <hi rend="italic">l'&#x00E9;go&#x00EF;ste!</hi> That is like a man; oh, I know them, like <hi rend="italic">a b c</hi>. No, if Marie is not too young to graduate, she is not too young to leave school; and besides, if she had not learned everything, how could she graduate? There is an end to learning, <hi rend="italic">enfin</hi>. You tell Monsieur Motte that. But no, <hi rend="italic">tiens</hi>, it is better I shall write it."</p>
<p>She seized some note-paper and put her message in writing with the customary epistolary embellishment of phrase at the expense of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p>"I hope he will be kind to her, and look out for a good <hi rend="italic">parti</hi> for her. Of course she will have a dot,--his only relative. Did you not tell me she was his only relative, Marc&#x00E9;lite? He has absolutely no one else besides her?"</p>
<p>"No, Madame."</p>
<p>"Well, then, she will get it all when he dies, unless"--with a shrug--"I do not know; one is never sure about men."</p>
<p>Madame bethought herself of the time, and looked at her watch just as Marc&#x00E9;lite, by a sud-
<pb n="57     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
den resolution, made a desperate movement towards her.</p>
<p>"Nearly three o'clock! I must go and make my <hi rend="italic">tour. Au revoir, ma bonne</hi>. Be sure and give Monsieur Motte my note, and come early to-morrow morning; and do not forget to think about what I told you, you know." She tapped her head significantly and left the room. On the short passage to the <hi rend="italic">Salle des Classes</hi> she put off her natural manner, and assumed the conventional disguise supposed to be more fitting her high position. When the door opened and the little girls started up to drop their courtesies, and their "<hi rend="italic">Je vous salue, Madame</hi>," her stately tread and severe mien could hardly have been distinguished from those of her predecessor, the aristocratic old <hi rend="italic">refug&#x00E9;e from the Island of St. Domingo.</p>
<p>After dinner, when the shadow had entirely enveloped the yard, and the fragrance of the oleander and jasmine had fastened itself on the air, the girls were allowed their evening recreation. Relieved from the more or less restraining presence of the day scholars, the boarders promenaded in the cordial intimacy of
<pb n="58     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
home life. The laughter of the children in the street, the music of the organs (there seemed to be one at each corner), the gay jingle of the ice-cream cart came over the wall to them. To-morrow there would be no wall between them and the world,--the great, gay, big world of New Orleans. The thought was too exhilarating for their fresh blood; they danced to the music and laughed to the laughter outside, they kissed their hands to invisible friends, and made <hi rend="italic">r&#x00E9;v&#x00E9;rences</hi> and complimentary speeches to the crescent moon up in the blue sky. The future would soon be here now! only to-morrow evening,--the future, which held for them a <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;but</hi> in society, a box at the opera, beautiful toilettes, balls, dancing, music. No more study, routine, examinations, scoldings, punishments, and bread-and-butter lunches. The very idea of it was intoxicating, and each girl felt guilty of a maudlin effusion of sentiment and nonsense to her best friend. A "best friend" is an institution in every girls' school. Every class-book when opened would direct you to a certain page on which was to be found the name of "<hi rend="italic">celle que j'aime</hi>," or "<hi rend="italic">celle que j'adore</hi>," or "<hi rend="italic">mon amie</hi>
<pb n="59     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E9;rie</hi>," or "<hi rend="italic">ma toute devou&#x00E9;e</hi>." The only source of scandal that flourished in their secluded circle was the formation or disrupting of these ties through the intermeddling officiousness of "<hi rend="italic">rapporteuses</hi>" and "<hi rend="italic">mauvaises langues." But the approaching dissolution of all ties drew them together, each one to each one's best friend, and, as usual, the vows exchanged became more fervent and passionate just before breaking. Marc&#x00E9;lite was outside, leaning against the wall. Close over her head hung the pink oleanders through their green leaves, and on their strong perfume was wafted the merry voices of the boarders. How glad, how happy they were! She could hear her <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9; above the others, and, strange to say, her laughter made her sadder even than her tears to-day. She lifted up her black, passionate face. If she could only see them! if she could look over the wall and catch one more glimpse of the girl whom as a baby she had held to her bosom, and whom she had carried in her arms through that gate when . . . "<hi rend="italic">Ah, mon Dieu, ayez piti&#x00E9; de moi, pauvre n&#x00E9;gresse!</hi>"
<hi rend="italic">"Dansez, chantez,"</hi> they were singing and
<pb n="60     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
making a <hi rend="italic">ronde</hi>. She heard some one at the gate,--Jeanne, probably, coming out. She turned her back quickly and walked away around the corner, making the tour of the square. When she turned the corner coming the other way, she was quite out of breath with walking so fast; as there was no one in the street, she increased her pace to a run, and reached the oleanders panting; but all was now still inside; the boarders had been summoned to supper. She stretched her arms out and leaned her head against the rough bricks. She turned and looked at the sky; her eyes gleamed through her tears like the hot stars through the blue air. She moved away a few steps, hesitated, returned; then went again, only to be drawn back under the oleanders. She sat down close to the wall, threw her. apron over her head, and drew her feet up out of the way of the passers-by.</p>
<p>Daylight found her still there. When the early carts began to pass, laden for the neighboring market, she rose stiff and sore and walked in the direction of the river, where the morning breeze was just beginning to ripple the waters and drive away the fog.</p>
<pb n="61     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>The great day of the concert began very early.  F&#x00EA;te days always get up before the sun. The boarders in the dormitory' raised their heads from their pillows and listened to the pushing and dragging going on underneath them: the men arranging the chairs for that night. Their heads, done up in white paper <hi rend="italic">papillotes</hi>, looked like so many blanched porcupines. This was one of the first of those innumerable degrees of preparation by which they expected to transform  themselves into houris of loveliness by concert-time. As there can be no beauty without curls, in a school-girls opinion, and as a woman's first duty is to be beautiful they felt called upon to roll lock after lock of their hair around white paper, which was then twisted to the utmost limit of endurance; and on occasions when tightness of curl is regulated by tightness of twist, endurance may safely be said to have no limits. Fear of the unavoidable ensuing disappointment forced Marie to renounce, reluctantly, beauty in favor of discretion. When her companions saw the omission, they screamed in dismay.</p>
<p>"Oh, Marie!"</p>
<pb n="62     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Ah! Why did n't you put your hair up?"</p>
<p>"What a pity!"</p>
<p>"And you won't have curls for this evening?"</p>
<p>"Do it now!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais je t'assure</hi>, it will curl almost as tight."</p>
<p>"Let me do it for you, chore."</p>
<p>"No, me."</p>
<p>"But it is better to have it a little <hi rend="italic">fris&#x00E9;</hi>, than straight, so."</p>
<p>Marie, from practice accomplished in exuses, persisted that she had a migraine.</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">la migraine</hi>, poor thing!"</p>
<p>"I implore you, don't be ill to-night."</p>
<p>"Try my <hi rend="italic">eau de Cologne</hi>."</p>
</hi>"No, my <hi rend="italic">eau s&#x00E9;dative</hi> is better."</p>
<p>"Put this on your head."</p>
<p>"Tie this around your neck."</p>
<p>"Carry this in your pocket."</p>
<p>"Some water from Notre Dame de Lourdes."</p>
<p>"Some smelling-salts."</p>
*line
<p>Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re opened her eyes that morning as from an unsuccessful experiment. She cared little about sleep as a restorative,
<pb n="63     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
but it was invaluable to her in this emergency as a cosmetic.</p>
<p>Jeanne brought in her morning cup of coffee, with the news that the men had almost finished in the <hi rend="italic">Salle de Concert</hi>.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">C'est bon</hi>; tell Marc&#x00E9;lite to come as soon as she is ready."</p>
<p>The eyes closed again on the pillow in expectation of speedy interruption. But sleep, the coquette, courted and coaxed in vain all night, came now with blandishment, lullaby, and soft caress, and fastened the already heavy lids down over the brown eyes, and carried the occupant of the big bed away out on pretty dreams of youth and pleasure; away, beyond all distractions, noises, interruptions; beyond the reach of matutinal habits, duties, engagements, rehearsals, prizes; beyond even the practising of the "<hi rend="italic">Cheval de Bronze</hi>" on four pianos just underneath her. She slept as people sleep only on the field of battle or amid the ruins of broken promises; and thanks to her exalted position, she slept undisturbed.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais</hi>, come in <hi rend="italic">donc</hi>, Marc&#x00E9;lite!" she exclaimed, as a perseverant knocking at the door
<pb n="64     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
for the past five minutes had the effect of balancing her in a state of uncertain wakefulness. "You are a little early this morning, it seems."</p>
<p>She rubbed her hands very softly over her still-closed eyes; that last dream was so sweet, so clinging, what a pity to open them!</p>
<p>"It is not Marc&#x00E9;lite; it is I,--Madame Joubert."</p>
<p>"You! Madame Joubert!"</p>
<p>The excellent, punctilious, cold, austere, inflexible French teacher by her bedside!</p>
<p>"I thought it was Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>She still was hardly awake.</p>
<p>"No, it is I."</p>
<p>"But what is the matter, Madame Joubert?"</p>
<p>"It is twelve o'clock, Madame."</p>
<p>"Twelve o'clock! Impossible!"</p>
<p>"You hear it ringing, Madame."</p>
<p>"But where is Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come this morning."</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come this morning!"</p>
<p>She was again going to say "Impossible!" but she perceived Madame Joubert's head, and was silent.</p>
<pb n="65     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>Instead of her characteristic, formal, but conventionally fashionable coiffure, Madame Joubert had returned to, or assumed, that most primitive and innocent way of combing her hair, called <hi rend="italic">la sauvagesse</hi>. Unrelieved by the soft perspective of Marc&#x00E9;lite's handiwork, her plain, prominent features stood out with the savage boldness of rocks on a shrubless beach. "How frightfully ugly!" thought Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re.</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come this morning? Why?"</p>
<p>"How should I know, Madame?"</p>
<p>"She must be ill; send Jeanne to see."</p>
<p>"I did that, Madame, five hours ago; she was not in her room."</p>
<p>"But what can have become of her?"</p>
<p>Madame Joubert had early in life eliminated the consideration of supposititious cases from the catalogue of her salaried duties; but she answered gratuitously,--</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine, Madame."</p>
<p>"But I must have some one to comb my hair."</p>
<p>"The music-teacher is waiting for you. The
<pb n="66     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
French professor says he will be here again in a half-hour; he has been here twice already. Madame Criard says that it is indispensable for her to consult you about the choruses."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais, mon Dieu!</hi> Madame Joubert, I must have a hairdresser!"</p>
<p>Madame Joubert waived all participation in this responsibility by continuing her communication.</p>
<p>"The girls are all very tired; they say they will be worn out by to-night if they are kept much longer. They have been up ever since six o'clock."</p>
<p>"I know, I know, Madame Joubert; it was an accident. I also was awake at six o'clock. <hi rend="italic">J'ai fait la nuit blanche</hi>. Then I fell asleep again. Ah! that miserable Marc&#x00E9;lite! I beg of you, tell Jeanne to go for some one, no matter whom--Henriette, Julie, Artemise. I shall be ready in a moment."</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short while she was quite ready, all but her hair, and stood in her white muslin peignoir, tied with blue ribbons, before her toilette, waiting impatiently for some one to come to her assistance.</p>
<pb n="67     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>How terrible it is not to be able to comb one's own hair! Her hands had grown completely unaccustomed to the exercise of the comb and brush.</p>
<p>"Madame," said Jeanne at the door, "I have been everywhere. I cannot find a hairdresser at home; I have left word at several places, and Madame Joubert says they are waiting for you."</p>
<p>What could she do? She looked in the glass at her gray, spare locks; she looked on her toilette at her beautiful brown curls and plaits. "How in the world did Marcelite manage to secure all that on this?"</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>"Perhaps that was a hairdresser " She hastened to unfasten it.</p>
<p>"Madame," said a little girl, trying to speak distinctly, despite a nervous shortness of breath,</p>
<p>"Madame Joubert sent me to tell you they were waiting."</p>
<p>"Very well, <hi rend="italic">mon enfant</hi>, very well. I am coming."</p>
<p>"I shall be a greater fright than Madame Joubert," she murmured to herself.</p>
<pb n="68     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>The drops of perspiration disfiguring the clear tissue of the muslin-peignoir were the only visible results of her conscientious efforts.</p>
<p>"I will never be able to fix my hair."</p>
<p>There was another knock at the door, another "Madame Joubert <hi rend="italic">vous fait dire</hi>," etc.</p>
<p>"Tell Madame Joubert I am coming in a moment."</p>
<p>How impatient Madame Joubert was this morning. Oh for Marc&#x00E9;lite!</p>
<p>She knew nothing about hair, that was evident; but she remembered that she knew something about lace. Under the pressure of accelerating summonses from Madame Joubert, she fashioned a fichu, left on a chair from last night, into a very presentable substitute for curls and puffs.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais ce n'est pas mal, en effet</hi>," she muttered. Hearing the sound of footsteps again in the corridor, she rushed from the mirror and met the messenger just as her hand was poised to give a knock at the door. The "<hi rend="italic">Sa . . . lu . . . t! mois de va . . . can . . . ces!</hi>" and the "<hi rend="italic">Vi.. .er . .. ge, Ma . . ri . . . e</hi>" had been chorused and re-chorused; the "<hi rend="italic">Cheval de Bronze</hi>" had been hammered into durable
<pb n="69     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
perfection; the solos and duos, dialogues and scenes, the salutatory and valedictory had been rehearsed ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Madame finally dismissed the tired actors, with the recommendation to collect all their <hi rend="italic">petites affaires</hi>, so that their trunks could be sent away very early the next morning.</p>
<p>"I suppose Marc&#x00E9;lite will be sure to come this evening?" she asked Madame Joubert.</p>
<p>"Oh, that is sure, Madame," Madame Joubert replied, as if this were one of the few rules of life without exceptions; and Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re believed her as confidently as if No&#x00EB;l and Chapsal had passed upon her answer, and the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de l'Acad&#x00E9;me had indorsed it.</p>
<p>The girls scattered themselves all over the school, effacing with cheerful industry every trace of their passage through the desert of education. "<hi rend="italic">Dieu merci!</hi> that was all past." Marie had emptied her desk of everything belonging to her except her name, dug out of the black lid with a dull knife. That had to remain, with a good many other Marie Modeste Mottes on the different desks that had harbored her books during her sojourn in the various classes. This
<pb n="70     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
was all that would be left of her in the rooms where she had passed thirteen years of her life. The vacant teacher's desk, the throne of so many tyrants (the English teachers were all hateful!); the white walls with their ugly protecting dado of black; the rows of pegs, where the hats and cloaks hung; the white marble mantel, with its carving of naked cherubs, which the stove had discreetly clothed in soot,--she could never forget them. Sitting in her future home, the house of her uncle, she knew that these homely objects would come to her memory, as through sunset clouds of rose and gold.</p>
<p>"What will you do when you quit school, Marie?" her companions would ask, after detailing with ostentatious prolixity their own pleasant prospects.</p>
<p>"Ah, you know that depends entirely upon my uncle," she would reply, shrugging her thin shoulders under her calico waist.</p>
<p>This rich old uncle, an obstinate recluse, was the traditional <hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi> of the school.</p>
<p>"How is <hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi> to-day?" they would call to Marc&#x00E9;lite.</p>
<pb n="71     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Give my love to <hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi>."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Dis donc</hi>, why does n't <hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi> take Marie away in the summer?"</p>
<p>"Did you see the beautiful <hi rend="italic">&#x00E9;trennes le vieux</hi> has sent Marie?"</p>
<p>"They say he has sent her a superb toilette for the exhibition, made at Madame Treize's, and white satin boots."</p>
<p>Her trunk had been brought down with the others, and placed at her bedside. What more credible witness than a coffin or a trunk? It stood there as it might have stood thirteen years ago, when her baby wardrobe was unpacked. Her dear, ugly, little, old trunk! It had belonged to her mother, and bore three faded M's on its leather skin. She leaned her head against the top as she knelt on the floor before it to pack her books. How much that trunk could tell her if it could only speak! If she were as old as that trunk, she would have known a father, a mother, and a home!  She wrinkled her forehead in a concentrated effort to think a little farther back; to push her memory just a little,--a little beyond that mist out of which it arose. In vain! The big bell at the
<pb n="72     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
gate, with its clanging orders, remained the boundary of consciousness.</p>
<p>And Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come, not even when the lamps were lighted, to comb their hair, fasten their dresses, and tie their sashes; did not even come at the very end to see how their toilettes became them. The young ladies had waited until the last moment, dressed to the last pin, taken their hair out of the last <hi rend="italic">papillote</hi>, and then looked at one another in despair, indignation, and grief.</p>
<p>"Just look at my head, I ask you!"</p>
<p>"But mine is worse than yours."</p>
<p>"I shall never be able to do anything with mine."</p>
<p>"The more I brush, the more like a <hi rend="italic">n&#x00E8;gre</hi> I look."</p>
<p>"Ah, Marie, how wise you were not to put your hair in <hi rend="italic">papillotes!"</hi></p>
<p>"And all that trouble for nothing, <hi rend="italic">hein</hi>!"</p>
<p>"And the pain."</p>
<p>"I did n't sleep a wink last night."</p>
<p>"See how nice Marie looks with her hair smoothly plaited."</p>
<p>"I will never forgive Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<pb n="73     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Nor I."</p>
<p>"Nor I."</p>
<p>"Nor I."</p>
<p>Marie's heart sank when she thought how difficult it would be for Marc&#x00E9;lite to efface this disappointment from the remembrance of her clients; and she felt guilty, as being in a measure responsible for it all. Marc&#x00E9;lite was evidently detained, or prevented from coming, by preparations for Marie's return. Who knows?--perhaps the eccentric old uncle had something to do with it! Madame Joubert positively refused to mitigate the injury or condone the offence by the employment of another hairdresser. As she had commenced, so she closed the day <hi rend="italic">&#x00E0; la sauvagesse</hi>; and so she determined to wear her hair to the end of her life, maintaining, logically, that what one hairdresser had done, all were liable to do; life should never serve this disappointment to her a second time: she would employ no more of them.</p>
<p>The being deserted in a critical moment by a trusted servitor, dropped without warning by a confidante, left with an indifference, which amounted to heartlessness, to the prying eyes
<pb n="74     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
and gossiping tongue of a stranger,--this, not the mere trivial combing, was what isolated and distinguished Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re in her affliction. The question had been lifted beyond material consequences. Morally, it approached tragic seriousness. Marc&#x00E9;lite would naturally have suggested, whether she thought so or not, that the color of the new gray moire-antique was a trifle <hi rend="italic">ingrate</hi>, and Madame at least might have had the merit of declining propitiatory compromises between it and her complexion. . . . Julie was an idiot, there was no doubt about that; and the length of her tongue was notorious. By to-morrow evening the delicate mysteries of the youthful-looking Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re's toilette would be unveiled to satisfy the sensational cravings of her malicious patronesses.</p>
<p>The young ladies were placed on a high platform of steps, and rose tier above tier like flowers in a horticultural show,--the upper classes at the top and the best-looking girls well in the centre, as if the product of their beauty as well as their study went to the credit of the institute. When anything particular
<pb n="75     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
arrested their attention they whispered behind their fans, and it was as if a hive of bees had been let loose; when they laughed it was like a cascade rippling from step to step; when they opened their white, blue, and rose-colored fans (school-girls always do the same thing at the same time) and fluttered them, then it was like a cloud of butterflies hovering and coquetting about their own lips.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Externes</hi> were radiant in toilettes unmarred by accident or omission; the flattering compliments of their mirrors at home had turned their heads in the direction of perfect self-content. Resignation was the only equivalent the unfortunate <hi rend="italic">Internes</hi> could offer in extenuation of the unfinished appearance of their heads.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais, dis donc, ch&#x00E8;re</hi>, what is the matter with your hair?"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come."</p>
<p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">doudouce</hi>, how could you allow your hair to be combed that way?"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ch&#x00E9;rie</hi>, I think your hair is curled a little tight this evening."</p>
<pb n="76     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"I should think so; that <hi rend="italic">diable</hi> Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come."</p>
<p>"Mon Dieu, look at Madame Joubert <hi rend="italic">&3x00E0; la sauvagesse!</hi>"</p>
<p>"And Madame <hi rend="italic">&#x00E0; la grand maman!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite did not come, you see."</p>
<p>Not only was the room filled, but an eager audience crowded the yard and peeped in through the windows. The stairways, of course, were filled with the colored servants, an enthusiastic, irrepressible <hi rend="italic">claque</hi>. When it was all over, and the last <hi rend="italic">bis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">encore</hi> had subsided, row after row of girls was gleaned by the parents, proud possessors of such shawlfuls of beauty, talent, and prizes. Marie's class, the last to leave, were picked off one by one. She helped the others to put on their wraps, gather up their prizes, and kissed one after another good-by.</p>
<p>Each man that came up was, by a glance, measured and compared with her imaginary standard. "He is too young." "He is too fat." "I hope he is not that cross-looking one." "Maybe it is he." "What a funny little one that is!" "Ah, he is very nice-look-
<pb n="77     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
ing!" "Is it he?" "No, he is Corinne's father." "I feel sure he is that ugly, disagreeable one." "Ah, here he is at last! at last!" "No; he only came to say good-night to Madame." " He is afraid of the crowd." "He is waiting outside." "He is at the gate in a carriage." "After all, he has only sent Marc&#x00E9;lite." "I saw her here on the steps a while ago." She looked at the steps, they were deserted. There was but one person left in the room besides herself; Madame and her suite had gone to partake of their yearly exhibitional refreshments,--lemonade and <hi rend="italic">masse-pain</hi>, served in the little parlor. Her uncle must be that man. The person walked out after finding a fan he had returned to seek.</p>
<p>She remained standing so by the piano a long while, her gold crown on her head, her prizes in her arms, and a light shawl she had thoughtfully provided to wear home. Home! She looked all around very slowly once more. She heard Jeanne crossing the yard, but before the servant could enter the door, the white muslin dress, blue sash, and satin boots had bounded into the darkness of the stairway. The white-
<pb n="78     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
veiled beds which the night before had nestled the gay <hi rend="italic">papillotted</hi> heads were deserted and silent in the darkness. What a shelter the darkness was! She caught hold of the bedpost, not thinking, but feeling. Then Madame Joubert came tripping across the gallery with a candle, on her way to bed. The prizes and shawl dropped to the floor, and Marie crouched down close behind the bar. "Oh, God," she prayed, "keep her from seeing me!" The teacher after a pause of reflection passed on to her room; the child on the floor gave herself up to the full grief of a disappointment which was not childish in its bitterness. The events of the evening 'kept slipping away from her while the contents of her previous life were poured out with never-ending detail, and as they lay there, before and all around her, she saw for the first time how bare, how denuded, of pleasure and comfort it had been. What had her weak little body not endured in patient ignorance? But the others were not ignorant,--the teachers, Marc&#x00E9;lite, her uncle! How had they imposed upon the orphan in their hands! She saw it now, and she felt a woman's indigna-
<pb n="79     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
tion and pity over it. The maternal instinct in her bosom was roused by the contemplation of her own infancy. "Marc&#x00E9;lite! Marc&#x00E9;lite!" she called out, "how could you? for you knew, you knew it all!" The thought of a mother compelled to leave her baby on such an earth, the betrayal of the confidence of her own mother by her uncle, drew the first tears from her eyes. She leaned her head against the side of her bed and wept, not for herself, but for all women and all orphans. Her hand fell on the lace of her dress, and she could not recall at first what it was. She bounded up, and with eager, trembling fingers tearing open the fastenings, she threw the grotesque masquerade, boots and all, far from her on the floor, and stood clasping her naked arms over her panting breast; she had forgotten the gilt wreath on her head. "If she could die then and there! that would hurt her uncle who cared so little for her, Marc&#x00E9;lite who had deserted her!" Living she had no one, but dead, she felt she had a mother. Before getting into bed, she mechanically fell on her knees, and her lips repeated the formula of a prayer, an uncorrected, rude tradition of her
<pb n="80     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
baby days, belonging to the other side of her memory. It consisted of one simple petition for her own welfare, but the blessings of peace, prosperity, and eternal salvation of her uncle and Marc&#x00E9;lite were insisted upon with pious determination.</p>
<p>"I know I shall not sleep, I cannot sleep." Even with the words she sank into the oblivion of tired nature at seventeen years; an oblivion which blotted out everything,--toilette, prizes scattered on the floor, graduation, disappointment, and discomfort from the gilt-paper crown still encircling her black plaits.</p>
*empty line
<p>"Has Marc&#x00E9;lite come?" demanded Madame, before she tasted her coffee.</p>
<p>"Not yet, Madame."</p>
<p>"I wonder what has become of her?"</p>
<p>Jeanne sniffed a volume of unspeakable probabilities.</p>
<p>"Well, then, I will not have that <hi rend="italic">sotte</hi> Julie; tell her so when she comes. I would rather dress myself."</p>
<p>"Will Madame take her breakfast alone, or with Madame Joubert?"</p>
<pb n="81     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>The pleasure of vacation was tempered by the companionship of Madame Joubert at her daily meals,--a presence imposed by that stern tyrant, common courtesy.</p>
<p>"Not to-day, Jeanne; tell Madame Joubert I have <hi rend="italic">la migraine</hi>. I shall eat breakfast alone."</p>
<p>"And Mamzelle Marie Modeste?"</p>
<p>"Marie Modeste!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Madame; where must she take her breakfast?"</p>
<p>The Gasconne's eyes flamed suddenly from under her red lashes and her voice ventured on its normal loud tones in these sacred precincts.</p>
<p>"It's a shame of that negress! She ought to be punished well for it, too, ha! Not to come for that poor young lady last night; to leave her in that big dormitory all by herself; and all the other young ladies to go home and have their pleasure, and she all by herself, just because she is an orphan. You think she does n't feel that, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi> If I had known it I would have helped her undress, and stayed with her, too; I would have slept on the floor,--a delicate little nervous thing like that; and a great, big, fat, lazy, good-for-nothing quadroon like Mar-

c&#x00E9;lite. <hi rend="italic">Mais c'est inf&#x00E2;lite! It is enough to give her <hi rend="italic">des crises</hi>. Oh, I would not have done that! <hi rend="italic">tenes</hi>, not to go back to France would I have done that. And when I got up this morning, and saw her sitting in the arbor, so pale, I was frightened myself--I--"</p>
<p>"What is all this you are telling me? Jeanne, Jeanne, go immediately; run, I tell you--run and fetch that poor child here. <hi rend="italic">Ah, mon Dieu!</hi> egoist that I am to forget her! <hi rend="italic">Pauvre petite chatte!</hi> What must she think of me?"</p>
<p>She jumped out of bed, threw on a wrapper, and waited at the door, peeping out.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma fille</hi>; I did not know--Jeanne has just told me."</p>
<p>The pale little figure made an effort to answer with the old pride and indifference.</p>
<p>"It seems my uncle--"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mais qu'est-ce que c'est donc, mon enfant?</hi> Do not cry so! What is one night more in your old school? It is all my fault; the idea that I should forget you,--leave you all alone while we were enjoying our lemonade and <hi rend="italic">masse-pain!</hi> But why did you not come to me? Oh! oh! if you cry so, I shall think you are sorry not to
<pb n="83     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
leave me; besides, it will spoil your pretty eyes."</p>
<p>"If Marc&#x00E9;lite had only come--"</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear! do not speak of her! do not mention her name to me. We are <hi rend="italic">quittes</hi> from this day; you hear me? We are <hi rend="italic">quittes</hi>. But Marie, my child, you will make yourself ill if you cry so. Really, you must try and compose yourself. What is it that troubles you so? Come here, come sit by me; let me confess you. I shall play that I am your <hi rend="italic">maman</hi>. There, there, put your head here, my <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>, so. Oh, I know how you feel. I have known what disappointment was; but <hi rend="italic">enfin</hi>, my child, that will all pass; and one day, when you are old and gray-headed like me, you will laugh well over it."</p>
<p>The tender words, the caresses, the enfolding arms, the tears that she saw standing in the august schoolmistress's eyes, the sympathetic movement of the soft, warm bosom,--her idea of a mother was not a vain imagining. This was it; this was what she had longed for all her life. And she did confess to her,--confessed it all, from the first childish trouble to the last disappointment. Oh, the delicious relief of
<pb n="84     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
complete, entire confession to a sympathetic ear 
The noble heart of Madame, which had frittered itself away over puny distributions of prizes and deceiving cosmetics, beat young, fresh, and impulsive as in the days when the gray hairs were <hi rend="italic">chatains clair</hi>, and the cheeks bloomed natural roses. Tears fell from her eyes on the little black head lying so truthful, so confiding on her bosom. <hi rend="italic">Grand Dieu!</hi> and they had been living thirteen years under the same roof,--the poor, insignificant, abandoned, suffering little Marie, and the gay, beautiful, rich, envied Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re! This was their first moment of confidence. Would God ever forgive her? Could she ever forgive herself? How good it feels to have a child in your arms! so. She went to the stand by her bed and filled a small gilded glass with <hi rend="italic">eau des carmes</hi> and water.
"There, drink that, my child; it will compose you. I must make my toilette; it is breakfast-time. You see, <hi rend="italic">ma fille</hi>, this is a lesson. You must not expect too much of the men; they are not like us. Oh, I know them well. They are all <hi rend="italic">&#x00E9;go&#x00EF;stes</hi>. They take a great deal of trouble
<pb n="85     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
for you when you do not want it, if it suits them; and then they refuse to raise their little finger for you, though you get down on your knees to them. Now, there's your uncle. You see he has sent you to the best and most expensive school in the city, and he has dressed you well,--oh, yes, very well; look at your toilette last night! real lace; I remarked it. Yet he would not come for you and take you home, and spare you this disappointment. I wrote him a note myself and sent it by Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>"He is old, Madame," said Marie, loyally.</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! <hi rend="italic">Plus les hommes sont vieux plus ils sont m&#x00E9;chants</hi>. Oh, I have done that so often; I said, 'If you do not do this, I will not do that.' And what was the result? They did not do this, and I had <hi rend="italic">tout simplement et bonnement</hi> to do that. I write to Monsieur Motte, 'Your niece shall not leave the Pension until you come for her;' he does not come, and I take her to him. <hi rend="italic">Voil&#x00E0; la politique f&#x00E9;minine."</hi></p>
<p>After breakfast, when they had dressed, bonneted, and gloved themselves, Madame said,--</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma foi!</hi> I do not even know where the
<pb n="86     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
old Diog&#x00E8;ne lives. Do you remember the name of the street, Marie?"</p>
<p>"No, Madame; somewhere in the <hi rend="italic">Faubourg d'en bas</hi>."</p>
<p>"Ah, well! I must look for it here."</p>
She went to the table and quickly turned over the leaves of a ledger.</p>
<p>"Marie Modeste Motte, niece of Monsieur Motte. <hi rend="italic">Mais, tiens</hi>, there is no address!"</p>
<p>Marie looked with interest at her name written in red ink.<p>
<p>"No; it is not there."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ah, que je suis b&#x00EA;te. It is in the other one. This one is only for the last ten years. There, <hi rend="italic">ma fille</hi>, get on a chair; can you reach that one? No, not that, the other one. How warm it is! You look it out for me!"</p>
<p>"I do not see any address here either, Madame."</p>
<p>"Impossible! There must be an address there. True, nothing but Marie Modeste Motte, niece of Monsieur Motte, just like the other one. Now, you see, that's Marc&#x00E9;lite again; that's all her fault. It was her duty to give that address thirteen years ago. In thirteen
<pb n="87     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
years she has not had the time to do that!"</p>
<p>They both sat down warm and vexed.</p>
<p>"I shall send Jeanne for her again!"</p>
<p>But Jeanne's zeal had anticipated orders.</p>
<p>"I have already been there, Madame; I beat on her door, I beat on it as hard as I could, and the neighbors opened their windows and said they didn't think she had been there all night."</p>
<p>"Well, then, there is nothing for me to do but send for Monsieur le Notaire! Here, Jeanne; take this note to Monsieur Goupilleau."</p>
<p>All unmarried women, widows or maids if put to the torture, would reveal some secret, unsuspected sources of advisory assistance,--a subterranean passage for friendship which sometimes offers a retreat into matrimony,--and the last possible wrinkle, the last resisting gray hair is added to other female burdens at the death of this secret counsellor or the closing up of the hidden passage. Therefore, how dreadful it is for women to be condemned to a life of such logical exactions where a reason is demanded for everything, even for
<pb n="88     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
a <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> affection of fifteen years or more. Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re did not possess courage enough to defy logic, but her imagination and wit could seriously embarrass its conclusions. The <hi rend="italic">raison d'&#x00EA;tre</hi> of a Goupilleau in her life had exercised both into athletic proportions.</p>
<p>"An old friend, <hi rend="italic">ma mignonne</hi>; I look upon him as a father, and he treats me just as if I were his daughter. I go to him as to a confessor. And a great institute like this requires so much advice,--oh, so much! He is very old,--as old as Monsieur Motte himself. We might just as well take off our things; he will not come before evening. You see, he is so discreet, he would not come in the morning for anything in the world. He is just exactly like a father, I assure you, and very, very old."</p>
<p>The graduate and young lady of a day sat in he rocking-chair, quiet, almost happy. ,She was not in the home she had looked forward to; but Madame's tenderness; the beautiful room in its soothing twilight, and the patronizing majesty of the <hi rend="italic">lit de justice</hi> made this a very pleasant abiding place in her journey,--the journey so long and so difficult from school
<pb n="89     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
to her real home, from girlhood to real young ladyhood. It was nearly two days now since she had seen Marc&#x00E9;lite. How she longed for her, and what a scolding she intended to give her when she arrived at her uncle's, where, of course, Marc&#x00E9;lite was waiting for her. How silly she had acted about the address! But, after all, procrastination is so natural. As for Madame, Marie smiled as she thought how easily a reconciliation could be effected between them, <hi rend="italic">quittes</hi> though they were.</p>
<p>It is hard to wean young hearts from hoping and planning; they will do it in the very presence of the angel of death, and with their shrouds in full view.
Monsieur Goupilleau came: a Frenchman of small stature but large head. He had the eyes of a poet and the smile of a woman.</p>
<p>The prelude of compliments, the tentative flourish to determine in which key the ensuing variation on their little romance should be played, was omitted. Madame came brusquely to the <hi rend="italic">motif</hi>, not personal to either of them.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Goupilleau, I take pleasure in presenting you to Mademoiselle Marie Motte,
<pb n="90     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
one of our young lady graduates. <hi rend="italic">Mon ami</hi>, we are in the greatest trouble imaginable. Just imagine, Monsieur Motte, the uncle of mademoiselle could not come for her last night to take her home. He is so old and infirm," added Madame, considerately; "so you see mademoiselle could not leave last night: I want to take her home myself--a great pleasure it is, and not a trouble, I assure you, Marie--but we do not know where he lives."</p>
<p>"Ah! you have not his address."</p>
<p>"No, it should be in the ledger; but an accident,--in fact, the laziness of her <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi>, who never brought it, not once in thirteen years."</p>
<p>"Her <hi rend="italic">bonne?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Yes, her <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi> Marc&#x00E9;lite; you know Marc&#x00E9;lite <hi rend="italic">la coiffeuse</hi>; what, you do not know Marc&#x00E9;lite, that great, fat--"</p>
<p>"Does Marc&#x00E9;lite know where he lives?"</p>
<p>"But of course, my friend, Marc&#x00E9;lite knows, she goes there every day."</p>
<p>"Well, send for Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>"Send for Marc&#x00E9;lite! but I have sent for Marc&#x00E9;lite at least a dozen times! she is never
<pb n="91     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
at her room. Marc&#x00E9;lite! ha! my friend, I am done with Marc&#x00E9;lite. What do you think? After combing my hair for fifteen years!--fifteen years, I tell you--she did not come yesterday at all, not once; and the concert at night! You should have seen our heads last night! we were frights--frights, I assure you!"</p>
<p>It was a poetical license, but the eyes of Monsieur Goupilleau disclaimed any such possibility for the head before him.</p>
<p>"Does not mademoiselle know the address of her uncle?"</p>
<p>"Ah, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, no. Mademoiselle has been a <hi rend="italic">pensionnaire</hi> at the Institut St. Denis for thirteen years, and she has never been anywhere except to church; she has seen no one without a chaperon; she has received no letter that has not passed through Madame Joubert's hands. Ah! for that I am particular, and it was Monsieur Motte himself who requested it."</p>
<p>"Then you need a directory."</p>
<p>"A what?"</p>
<p>"A directory."</p>
<p>"But what is that,--a directory?"</p>
<p>"It's a volume, Madame, a book contain-
<pb n="92     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
ing the addresses of all the residents of the city."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Quelle bonne id&#x00E9;e! If I had only known that! I shall buy one. Jeanne! Jeanne! run quick, <hi rend="italic">ma bonne</hi>, to Morel's and buy me a directory."</p>
<p>"Pardon, Madame, I think it would be quicker to send to Bale's, the <hi rend="italic">pharmacien</hi> at the corner, and borrow one. Here, Jeanne, take my card."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">A la bonne heure!</hi> now we shall find our affair."</p>
<p>But the M's, which started so many names in the directory, were perfectly innocent of any combination applicable to an old uncle by the name of Motte.</p>
<p>"You see, your directory is no better than my books!"</p>
<p>Monsieur Goupilleau looked mortified, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"He must live outside the city limits, Madame."</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite always said, 'in the <hi rend="italic">Faubourg d'en bas.</hi>'"</p>
<p>Jeanne interrupted stolidly: "Monsieur Bale
<pb n="93     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
told me to bring the book right back; it is against his rules to lend it out of his store."</p>
<p>"Here, take it! take it! Tell him  I am infinitely obliged. It was of no use, any way. Ah, <hi rend="italic">les hommes!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Madame," began Monsieur Goupilleau in precautionary deprecation.</p>
<p>A sudden noise outside,--apparently an assault at the front door; a violent struggle in the antechamber!</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Grand Dieu!</hi> what can that be!" Madame's lips opened for a shrill <hi rend="italic">Au secours! Voleurs!</hi> but seeing the notary rush to the door, she held him fast with her two little white hands on his arm.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mon ami</hi>, I implore you!"</p>
<p>The first recognition; the first expression of a fifteen years' secret affection! The first thrill (old as he was) of his first passion! But danger called him outside; he unloosed the hands and opened the door.</p>
<p>A heavy body propelled by Jeanne's strong hands fell on the floor of the room, accompanied by a shower of leaves from Monsieur B&#x00E2;le's directory.</p>
<pb n="94     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mis&#x00E9;rable! Inf&#x00E2;me! Effront&#x00E9;e!</hi> Ah, I have caught you! <hi rend="italic">Sc&#x00E9;l&#x00E9;rate!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite!"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite!"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite?"</p>
<p>"Sneaking outside the gate! Like an animal! like a thief! like a dog! Ha! I caught you well!"</p>
<p>The powerful arms seemed ready again to crush the unresisting form rising from the floor.</p>
<p>"Jeanne! hush! How dare you speak to Marc&#x00E9;lite like that? Oh, <hi rend="italic">ma bonne</hi>, what is the matter with you?"</p>
<p>Shaking, trembling, she cowered before them silent.</p>
<p>"Ah ! she did n't expect me, <hi rend="italic">la fi&#x00E8;re n&#x00E9;gresse!</hi> Just look at her!"</p>
<p>They did, in painful, questioning surprise. Was this their own clean, neat, brave, honest, handsome Marc&#x00E9;lite,--this panting, tottering, bedraggled wretch before them, threatening to fall on the floor again, not daring to raise even her eyes?</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite! Marc&#x00E9;lite! who has done this to you ! Tell me, tell your <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>, Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<pb n="95     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Is she drunk?" whispered Madame to the notary.</p>
<p>Her <hi rend="italic">tignon</hi> had been dragged from her head. Her calico dress, torn and defaced, showed her skin in naked streaks. Her black woolly hair, always so carefully packed away under her head-kerchief, stood in grotesque masses around her face, scratched and bleeding like her exposed bosom. She jerked herself violently away from Marie's clasp.</p>
<p>"Send them away! Send them away!" she at last said to Monsieur Goupilleau, in a low, unnatural voice. "I will talk to you, but send them all away."</p>
<p>Madame and Marie immediately obeyed his look; but outside the door Marie stopped firmly.</p>
<p>"Madame, Marc&#x00E9;lite can have nothing to say which I should not hear--"</p>
<p>"Hush--" Madame put her finger to her lips; the door was still a little open and the voices came to them.</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite, from the corner of her bleared eyes, watched them retire, and then with a great heave of her naked chest she threw herself on the floor at the notary's feet.</p>
<pb n="96     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Master! Oh master! Help me!"</p>
<p>All the suffering and pathos of a woman's heart were in the tones, all the weakness, dependence, and abandonment in the words.</p>
<p>The notary started at the unexpected appeal. His humanity, his manhood, his chivalry, answered it.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma fille</hi>, speak; what can I do for you?"</p>
<p>He bent over her as she lay before him, and put his thin, white, wrinkled hand on her shoulder, where it had burst through her dress. His low voice promised the willing devotion of a saviour.</p>
<p>"But don't tell my <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>, don't let her know. My God! it will kill her! She 's got no uncle--no Monsieur Motte! It was all a lie. It was me,--me a nigger, that sent her to school and paid for her--"</p>
<p>"You! Marc&#x00E9;lite! You!"</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite jumped up and tried to escape from the room. Monsieur Goupilleau quickly advanced before her to the door.</p>
<p>"You fooled me! It was you fooled me!" she screamed to Madame. "God will never forgive you for that! My <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi> has heard it all!"</p>
<pb n="97     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>Marie clung to her; Monsieur Goupilleau caught her by the arm.</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite! It was you,--you who sent me to school, who paid for me! And I have no uncle?"</p>
<p>Marc&#x00E9;lite looked at the notary,--a prayer for help. The girl fell in a chair and hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p>"Oh, my God! I knew it would kill her! I knew it would! To be supported by a nigger!" She knelt by the chair. "Speak to me, Mamzelle Marie. Speak to me just once! Pardon me, my little mistress! Pardon me! I did not know what I was doing; I am only a fool nigger, anyhow! I wanted you to go to the finest school with ladies, and--and--oh! my <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi> won't speak to me; she won't even look at me."</p>
<p>Marie raised her head, put both hands on the nurse's shoulders, and looked her straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>"And that also was all a lie about"--she sank her trembling voice--"about my mother?"</p>
<p>"That a lie! That a lie! 'Fore God in heaven, that was the truth; I swear it. I will
<pb n="98     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
kiss the crucifix. What do you take me for, Mamzelle Marie? Tell a lie about--"</p>
<p>Marie fell back in the chair with a despairing cry.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe any of it."</p>
<p>"Monsieur! Madame! I swear to you it's the truth! God in heaven knows it is. I would n't lie about that,--about my poor dead young mistress. Monsieur! Madame! tell Miss Marie for me; can't you believe me?" She shrieked in desperation to Monsieur Goupilleau.</p>
<p>He came to her unhesitatingly. "I believe you, Marc&#x00E9;lite." He put his hand again on her shoulder; his voice faltered, "Poor Marc&#x00E9;lite!"</p>
<p>"God bless you, master! God bless you for that. Let me tell you; you believe me when my <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi> won't. My young mistress, she died; my young master, he had been killed in the war. My young mistress was all alone by herself, with nobody but me, and I did n't take her poor little baby out of her arms till she was dead, as she told me. <hi rend="italic">Mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;, mon b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;!</hi> don't you know that's the truth? Can't you feel that's the truth? You see that; she will never speak to me again. I knew it; I told you
<pb n="99     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
so. I heard her last night, in that big room, all by herself, crying for Marc&#x00E9;lite. Marc&#x00E9;lite! my God! I was afraid to go to her, and I was just under a bed; you think that did n't 'most kill me?" She hid her face in her arms, and swayed her body back and forth.</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite," said Monsieur Goupilleau. The voice of the champion trembled, and his eyes glistened with tears at the distress he had pledged himself to relieve. "Marc&#x00E9;lite, I believe you, my poor woman; I believe you. Tell me the name of the lady, the mother of Mademoiselle."
"Ha! her name! I am not ashamed to tell her name before anybody. Her name! I will tell you her name." She sprang to her feet. "You ask anybody from the Paroisse St. Jacques if they ever heard the name of Mamzelle Marie Modeste Viel and Monsieur Alphonse Motte. That was the name of her mother and her father, and I am not ashamed of it that I should n't tell, ha! Yes, and I am Marc&#x00E9;lite Gaulois, and when my mother was sold out the parish, who took me and brought me up, and made me sleep on the foot of her bed, and fed me like her own baby, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi> Mamzelle Marie Viel's mother, and Mam-
<pb n="100     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
zelle was the other baby; and she nursed us like twins, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi> You ask anybody from the Paroisse St. Jacques. They know; they can tell you."</p>
<p>Marie stood up.</p>
<p>"Come, Marc&#x00E9;lite, let us go. Madame, Monsieur--" She evidently struggled to say something else, but she only reiterated, "I must go; we must go; come, Marc&#x00E9;lite, let us go."</p>
<p>No one would have remarked now that her eyes were too old for her face.</p>
<p>"Go? My Lord! Where have you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to go to?"</p>
<p>"I want to go home to Marc&#x00E9;lite; I want to go away with her; come, Marc&#x00E9;lite, let us go. Oh! don't you all see I can't stay here any longer? Let me go! Let me go!"</p>
<p>"Go with me! Go to my home! A white young lady like you go live with a nigger like me!"</p>
<p>"Come, Marc&#x00E9;lite; please come; go with me; I don't want to stay here."</p>
<p>"You stand there! You hear that! Monsieur! Madame! You hear that!"</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite, I want to go with you; I want to live with you; I am not too good for that."</p>
<pb n="101     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"What! You don't think you ain't white! Oh, God! Strike me dead!"</p>
<p>She raised her naked arms over her head, imploring destruction.</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite, <hi rend="italic">ma fille</hi>, do not forget, I have promised to help you. Marc&#x00E9;lite, only listen to me a moment. Mademoiselle, do not fear; Mademoiselle shall not leave us. I shall protect her; I shall be a father to her--"</p>
<p>"And I," said Madame, drawing Marie still closer to her,--"I shall be her mother."</p>
<p>"Now, try, Marc&#x00E9;lite," continued Monsieur Goupilleau,--"try to remember somebody, anybody who knows you, who knew your mistress; I want their names. Anybody, anybody will do, my poor Marc&#x00E9;lite! Indeed, I believe you; we all believe you; we know you are telling the truth; but is there not a person, even a book, a piece of paper, anything, you can remember?"</p>
<p>He stood close to her; his head did not reach above her shoulders, but his eyes plead into her face as if petitioning for his own honor; and then they followed the hands of the woman fumbling, feeling, passing, repassing inside her torn dress-waist. He held his hands out,--the
<pb n="102     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
kind tender little hands that had rested so gently on her bruised black skin.</p>
<p>"If I have not lost it, if I have not dropped it out of my gown since last night--I never have dropped it, and I have carried it round inside my body now for seventeen years; but I was 'most crazy last night--"</p>
<p>She put a small package all wrapped up in an old bandanna handkerchief in his hands.</p>
<p>"I was keeping that for my <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>; I was going to give it to her when she graduated, just to remind her of her own mother. She gave it to me when she died."</p>
<p>It was only a little worn-out prayer-book, but all filled with written papers and locks of hair and dates and certificates,--frail fluttering scraps that dropped all over the table, but unanswerable champions for the honor of dead men and the purity of dead women.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Par la gr&#x00E2;ce de Dieu!</hi>" exclaimed the notary, while the tears fell from his eyes on the precious relics, discolored and worn from bodily contact. Marie sank on her knees by the table, holding Marc&#x00E9;lite tight by the hand.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Par la gr&#x00E2;ce de Dieu!</hi> Nothing is wanting
<pb n="103     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
here,--nothing, nothing except the forgiveness of this good woman, and the assurances of our love and gratitude. And they say," turning to Madame, he hazarded the bold step of taking both her hands in his,--"they say," recollecting the tender pressure on his arm, he ventured still further,--"they say, Eugenie, that the days of heroism are past, and they laugh at our romance!"</p>

<p>And then the vacation again, the midsummer pause in life. The sun increasing its measure and degree of heat day by day, over-assessing the cooling powers of the night; and quietness settling itself more and more fixedly in the schoolrooms and yard, which seemed to grow larger and larger, increasing their space with their emptiness. The hard-worked pianos stood mute in their little cells. The great gate remained locked and bolted, only the little door swinging open at irregular intervals to admit some extra industrious or extra ignorant little mind coming to "make a class," as she called it, with Madame Joubert, always ready to lead a forlorn hope against participles or fractions.
<pb n="104     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
Marie Modeste knew the summer vacation better than any lesson she had learned in the St. Denis. There were no new pages in it for her. It had always contained the same old days sent over and over again, as if there were no need to vary a routine which, bringing rest and silence, brought a never-palling treat to the Institute. The naked beds in the dormitory, the white <hi rend="italic">peignoirs</hi> of Madame Joubert's ungraceful <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;shabille</hi>, the muslins and novels of Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re, her own relaxed efforts for comfort and coolness,--it all might have been any one of the lived-out summers behind her. There was no missing detail of the past in the present. But for the future,--looking for it there was no future. Where it had been, the girl saw only a blank space, or a world thick with strangers, aliens. Was there then no living person among them all to hold her, to connect her, with humanity? Was she only a waif, a vestige? Was there then no house for her feet to enter seeking a home, no home holding a welcoming host for her,--not even a cold, misanthropic, selfish, ungracious old uncle; only tombs, and the incommunicable dead?</p>
<pb n="105     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>The mornings and evenings, the whole life she had filled out in imagination,--was it all a mirage? And her studies, had they been learned only for herself? Ah! she had had hard feelings against her uncle at times; she had secretly cried at nights about him; she had been ashamed of him; she had abused him to Marc&#x00E9;lite; she had even written, in passionate moments, wild letters of expostulation to him; but she had loved him through it all,--<hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi>. However illy he had treated her, he had nevertheless represented her family to her. All her efforts had been made to please him some day, all her hopes cherished subject to his approval. Were he a thousand times worse than her loyalty had ever permitted the accusation, he were a benefaction to her now; for he had not gone out of existence alone,--he had taken her world, her home, her family, her nurse, her friend, her almost mother, with him. Where was the Marc&#x00E9;lite of months and years gone by? Who was this wretched substitute crouching, cringing, trembling before her, unnaturally, unrecognizably?</p>
<p>The quadroon, unmasked, stripped of dis-
<pb n="106     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
guise, had indeed lost her nerve and audacity. Her brave personation was over. As Marc&#x00E9;lite, there was nothing to accomplish except the part of a faithful servant. As Monsieur Motte, what could she not do? If she could only have created him out of her own death! If she could only have made what she had so happily invented! If she could only have prolonged indefinitely the undisturbed confidence and trust which had existed between Marie Modeste and herself! Her old volubility was gone. Whatever she said, lay under one vast suspicion. She could not meet the eyes of Marie Modeste; she could not even hold up her head before Jeanne. She began to reproach God, and vaguely to rebel against the shadow on her skin as casting the shadow on her life.</p>
<p>"Oh, my <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;!</hi> my little mistress! it's your nurse, it's your own negro who loves you, who would die for you!"--words which took the place of her prayers, her thoughts; her lips were always moving under them. She would undo her kerchief and put her hand where once the little face lay like a white magnolia against the dark skin, and go to sleep so. The place
<pb n="107     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
craved and ached so at times that she put plasters on it, and wore consecrated amulets over it. Her love, which had always been unscrupulous, became in her distress ferocious, insatiable; and she would rush to Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re, and like some wild animal that cannot tell its pain would shed mute tears and utter inarticulate moans.</p>
<p>"Frankly," said Madame to Monsieur Goupilleau, who came now in vacation regularly with the evening shades, as if to meet them on her gallery by appointment, "he will kill us all,--that old man! I can never forgive him for not having lived; but it is in accordance with his character," shrugging her shoulders. "What a monster of selfishness! I have been thinking,--ah, you do not know what my life is here with those two, Marie and Marc&#x00E9;lite!--I have been thinking that perhaps I would accept Aurore Angely's invitation. She writes me every year to come on a visit to her plantation for a month or two. What do you say, eh? There is only one objection,--it is in the country. If it were only in the city; but the country,--<hi rend="italic">dame!</hi> I have always held the country in horror. It
<pb n="108     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
is years since I have seen Aurore and F&#x00E9;lix. Ah! he is a torpedo for you! exploding at a touch. Poor little thing! She has never been to the country, never even seen it!" continuing, after a pause unbroken by her friend. The consultations with Monsieur Goupilleau generally took the form of a monologue on her part. "I thought of course her old uncle would take her somewhere this summer, and introduce her to society next winter, and marry her to some good <hi rend="italic">parti</hi>. It is barbarous,--the disappointment; it is positively a massacre!"</p>
<p>If the notary did not speak, it was not because he had nothing to suggest or propose; on the contrary, he was far advanced into the next winter with his plans, which defined. themselves as if by enchantment under the low flexible voice of the lady.</p>
<p>"You see, my friend, a disappointment cracks us all,--us women,--as if we were fine vases. <hi rend="italic">Ma foi!</hi> we ought all to be sold as bargains,--damaged goods. I am sure we are all cracked somewhere; the fracture may be hidden, but never mind, it is there, and every woman knows just where it is, and feels it too. Marie has re-
<pb n="109     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
ceived hers; she will never be sound again. It is very hard, all the same, for us older women to see young girls come into life so fresh, so fair, and so unconscious, and tap! there they are, hit right in the heart, and no one can save or prevent it. I wonder if there is a sound woman in the world!"</p>
<p>"I should hope not, Madame!" exclaimed Monsieur Goupilleau, involuntarily. "What an unbearable creature she would be! No." Of summer evenings, in gallery conversations, one hazards any thought. Perhaps it came from some of his early poetry. "God knows best; when he wishes to put the finishing, the perfecting touch to a woman, he simply sends her in youth some misfortune. It is his way; and I for one," shrugging his shoulders, "have nothing to criticise, seeing the results;" looking--but she was not aware of it--at the woman before him.</p>
<p>"The invitation comes this year like a God-send."</p>
<p>Apropos of the Deity, Madame drifted back to the important item in her mind. "I can see now, it is positively the best thing we can
<pb n="110     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
do. To-day is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday," she counted on her fingers. "Yes, I think we can take the Saturday boat; you know the boats leave every Saturday evening. And now,"--rising,--"I must go immediately and inform Madame Joubert. To tell you the truth, my friend,"--in the merest whisper,--"I do not think I could endure Madame Joubert all the summer. She is of a rigidity,--a rigidity!" raising her eyes and hands to express it. "But do not go; I shall return in a moment. I have something else to consult you about, you are so kind!"</p>

II.
ON THE PLANTATION.
<p>THE autumn was struggling for recognition, and was making an impression upon all but the mid-day hours. In the mornings, the air came cool and crisp, full of incentives to work. In the evenings, the soft languor and dreamy inertness of summer had been driven away by a wide-
<pb n="111     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
awake activity, with good resolutions and plans of future energy to be discussed inside closed doors and windows into late hours of the night. The roses in the garden bloomed pale and listless after their exhausting summer season, shivering perfumelessly in the practical October breezes. The trees were in the full glory of their rich green foliage. The cane in the fields stood in thick, solid maturity, with long, green, pendent leaves curling over and over in bewildering luxuriance. The sunset clouds, bursting with light and color, gilded the tops of the boundary woods and illumined like a halo the familiar features of plantation life. The Mississippi River, reflecting and rivalling the sky above, rolled, an iridescent current, between its yellow mud banks cut into grotesque silhouettes by crevasses and steamboat landings as it dimpled in eddies over shallows, boiled and swirled in hollow whirlpools over depths, or rushed with inflexible, relentless rapidity, following the channel in its angular course from point to point.</p>
<p>The day's work had come to an end. The plantation bell rang out its dismissal and benediction. The blacksmith laid down the half-
<pb n="112     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
sharpened cane-knife and began covering up the fire. From mysterious openings on all sides of the sugar-house workmen issued with tools in their hands. The stable doors were thrown open, and the hostlers, old crooked-legged negroes, hurried about with food for the mules. The cows tinkled their impatient bells outside the milking-lot, while the frantic calves bounded and bleated inside. From the two long rows of whitewashed cabins in the quarters the smoke began to rise. The drowsy young women, sitting with their babies on the cabin steps, shifted their positions, and raised their apathetic eyes from the eager faces pressing against their bosoms to the heavens above for ocular confirmation of the bell, and turned their ears toward the road from the fields. The exempt old women, the house dragons, wrinkled, withered, decrepit, deformed, with all but life used out of them, hobbled around in a fictitious bustle, picking up chips, filling buckets of water at the cistern, or stood with their hands pressed against their bent backs to send blood-curdling threats and promises after the children.</p>
<p>Along the smooth yellow road through the
<pb n="113     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
field came the "gang," with their mules and wagons, ploughs and hoes. In advance walked the women, swaying themselves from side to side with characteristic abandon, lighting their rude pipes, hailing the truce to toil with loud volubility. Against the luminous evening sky their black profiles came out with startling distinctness, showing features just sharpening into regularity from cartilaginous formlessness, the gleam of white teeth, and the gaudy colors of the cotton kerchiefs knotted across their brows. Their bodies, as though vaguely recalling ancestral nudity amid tropical forests, seemed to defy concealment, throwing out bold curves and showing lines, of savage grace through the scant folds of their loose-fitting garments. Sylvan secrets seemed still to hang around them. In their soft sad eyes, not yet cleared and brightened by sophistication, spoke the untamed desires of wild, free Nature; while fitfully in the opaque depths shone bright gleams of a struggling intelligence, pathetic appeals as from an imprisoned spirit protesting against foul Circean enchantment. The men followed, aggressively masculine, heavy-limbed, slow of movement on
<pb n="114     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
their hampered, shod feet; wearing their clothes like harness; with unhandsome, chaotic faces, small eyes, and concealed natures. They watched the women with jealous interest, excluding them from their hilarity, and responding grudgingly and depreciatingly to their frank overtures. The water-carriers, half-grown boys and girls, idled at a distance, balancing their empty pails on their bare heads,--quick and light on their feet, graceful, alert, intuitive, exuberant with life and animal spirits, they were happy in the thoughtless, unconscious enjoyment of the short moment that yet separated them from their hot, dull, heavy, dangerous maturity.</p>
<p>The anticipations of cheer and rest, the subtile satisfaction of honestly tired bodies; the flattering commendations of their own skill from the finely cultivated stand of cane on each side of them; the past expiations of ploughing, ditching, weeding, hoeing; the freezing rains; the scorching suns; but, above all, the approach of the grinding season, the "roulaison," with its frolics, excitements, and good pay,--all tended to elate their spirits; and their voices, in joke, song, laugh, and retort, sped down the road
<pb n="115     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
before them to the quarters, and evoked responsive barks and shouts from the dogs and children there.</p>
<p>It was the busy time of the year, and the anxious time too,--the roulaison. It was the period to which the rest of the year led up, the chronological terminus of calculation and cultivation, when the fields with their accumulated interest of labor and capital were delivered over for judgment to the sugar-house. Always dominating the place, the material importance of the sugar-house became tyrannical, oppressive, as cane-cutting approached. It reared itself--an ugly, square, red-brick structure--menacingly before the fields; it dwarfed the "big house" into insignificance, and, with its vast shed, divided by the cane-carrier, its chimneys, furnaces, boiler, bagasse-heaps, its mountainous wood-pile and barricade of new hogsheads, it shut out the view of the river from the quarters, and consigned the latter to a species of seclusion. What its verdict would be, was now the one item of interest to all, from the oldest gray-beard to the youngest thinker on "Bel Angely" plantation. What the sugar-house decided,
<pb n="116     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
fixed the good or bad character of the past year, and approved or disproved the executive ability of the plantation manager. It is a close contest between man and Nature, and the always increasing science of the one is more than counterbalanced by the capricious obstinacy of the other. The old men and women, heirlooms of departed experiences, found themselves growing in importance with autumn, and their rusty memories became oracles to furnish data for prognostication. There were the "big freeze" and the "early freeze" and the "late freeze" years. There were years when the cane sprouted in the mats, when the second-year stubble could not be told from first-year, and the first-year stubble filled up like plant cane. Then there were all the years marked by a water-line of rises, overflows, and crevasses. There was one memory that contained a year in which the Mississippi froze all over, and several that perpetuated the falling of the stars; but however persistently such a recurrence was periodically suggested, Nature had been pleased to withhold a repetition. The autocratic sugar-house itself was not beyond damaging recollec-
<pb n="117     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
tions: it might have been a natural product, or a season, for the number of hitches and breaks with which it managed to vary its runs, and the success with which it eluded its yearly examiners and tinkers. Then, there was the sacharometer to disparage the splendid growth of the cane, the polariscope to contradict the sacharometer, and, finally, the commission merchant to give the lie to Nature and man; with high charges and low prices to enjoin all hopes, reverse all calculations, and not only damn the past but confound the future. No roulaison ever came exactly like a preceding one, and no season ever duplicated its calamities; but never had roulaison come with such guarantee of success, to be met with so unforeseen a mishap as the illness of Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix,--ill in bed of sciatica!</p>
<p>In the great ledger commenced by the first sugar-making Angely, down to day before yesterday, never had such an item been recorded. It was like the illness of a commander just before battle. And such a commander as Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix was!--not trusting the sun to shine or the cane to grow in his absence; his ever-watchful eye and unwearied sagacity pervading
<pb n="118     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
the plantation from limit to limit; so omniscient and self-reliant that if there were one place on the perverse globe that could dispense with supernal jurisdiction, one place that could be safely trusted to earthly viceregency, that place was Bel Angely plantation, Parish of St. Charles. He had had his bed pulled close to the window, and any hour of the day, from dawn to dark, his bright red face, with its fierce gray mustache, could be seen looking out, and his excited voice heard screaming, scolding, expostulating, and threatening, until even the pet chickens and ducks deserted their favorite feeding-place, and the little, crawling black children, with their skirts tied up under their arms, learned to imitate their elders, and crept nimbly under the gallery or dodged behind the out-houses to avoid him. If the door of his bedchamber were inadvertently left open but a second, little gusts of passion would escape down the hall, blasting like tiny siroccos the healthful calm and good-humor outside. Mademoiselle Aurore herself, with all her natural and cultivated conscientiousness, had to feign deafness in order to secure necessary leisure for housekeeping directions.</p>
<pb n="119     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<hi rend="italic">"Ah, mon Dieu! les hommes! les hommes!"</hi> was all she could exclaim to her own and the interrogatories of others. She knew by experience that weather contingencies and constitutional irregularities were always to be visited on the females of the house. She did not repine at things she was inured to, or rebel against a manifest design of Providence; but that wretched Gabi! The abbreviation named an important division in the cares and responsibilities of her life,--a half-Indian, half-negro waif whom she had hopefully taken in charge, a rightful heir of the combined laziness of two races, and trustee of the mischief of all.</p>
<p>No wonder she was nearly distracted and completely unable, as heretofore, to extract good omens from patent misfortunes. Her life had been counted by roulaisons, as some women's are by Springs, and she felt as if this one were going to put her, with the cane in the fields, between the great revolving grinders of the mill. There was always enough to be done,--enough impatience and vexation to contend with naturally. If Gabi could only have acquitted himself properly! If F&#x00E9;lix could only
<pb n="120     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
have gotten ill at some other time! If she could only be allowed to take the sciatica as a physical instead of a mental burden! She had done everything, as a sister and a Christian, to relieve the tension of affairs. She had placed herself at the disposition of every functionary on the place,--sugar-maker, cooper, engineer, blacksmith,--and was at the beck and call of every "hand" coming for food, medicine, advice, or instruction. She had entered into negotiations with every saint in the calendar amenable to representations on the subject of sugar or sciatica. Her room fairly blazed with temporary shrines, and candles which her own little personal requisitions had kept for years in a state of perpetual incandescence; by a <hi rend="italic">coup-d'&#x00E9;tat she had transferred them all from her own account to that of the plantation and her brother. She was in constant communication with the parish priest, although he was a rough, vulgar Gascon whom she detested. In fact, she had expended vows and promises so recklessly, that were but half her prayers granted, she could look forward to none but a future of religious insolvency if not bankruptcy.
<pb n="121     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
But Gabi! that was an entirely superfluous complication.</p>
<p>As usual she had been too zealous. To save the labor of a man, at so critical a time, and to extort tardy appreciation of her prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9;, she had taken it upon herself to send him for the mail. She had often wished to send him before, his trustworthiness being a matter of dispute between her and her brother; but F&#x00E9;lix had always peremptorily refused. He was prejudiced against Gabi, and there was no arguing away his prejudices; but his illness afforded a timely opportunity of destroying them. <hi rend="italic">H&#x00E9;las!</hi></p>
<p>She stood by the door of the chamber, in which not one but a dozen sciaticas appeared to be unleashed, holding in her hands the mail-bag: not the one she had given Gabi with so many careful instructions in the gray light of the morning,--that one had been dropped and dropped in the dust and mud of the road and ditches; and finally, when Gabi had concluded to take his rest unbroken in the shade of a tree instead of in fractional naps on the mule's back, the swine had come along, and with ruthless tusks had reduced
<pb n="122     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
the contents to a shapeless mass. She had extracted one crumpled, soiled, foul letter from the d&#x00E9;bris, and put it in the new, clean, alternate bag,--one letter! when at this season Felix was corresponding with every other man in New Orleans! And Gabi had made such a good first communion last spring, and never, never missed church! The mule, too, had wandered away, Saint Anthony alone knew where; Gabi was in her cabinet now, hiding from Edmond, who was searching for him with a whip. She could keep it from F&#x00E9;lix until he got well; but then, of course, she must tell him.</p>
<p>When she came out of the room a half-hour later she was enveloped in a bitter condemnation of postmistresses and neglectful correspondents, and pursued by a last rush of important commissions.</p>
<p>"Send Edmond to me. Tell Joe to get ready to take the next boat to the city. I thought you were going to hunt up that roll of wire in the store-room. Has n't old Simon sent yet? Don't forget to copy Smith's estimate. Go to the sugar-house--no; I shall tell Duval myself to go to the devil with his charges. Don't
<pb n="123     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
forget about the lamp-wicks and the towels for the sugar-house, and--oh, yes, tell Stasie to fetch me some ink; it is very strange that the inkstand is never filled unless I see about it myself--and Aurore!"</p>
<p>"Yes, F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9;."</p>
<p>"The key of the medicine chest!"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Mis&#x00E8;re! Mis&#x00E8;re!</hi>" She held her hands to her head, trying to sort them out. She made a motion toward the sugar-house, but changed it to the direction of the store-room. She remembered the medicine-chest key, and felt for the key-basket on her arm. It was not there. She wondered where it could be, and started toward her chamber in search of it, when she caught a glimpse of Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re on the gallery. Then the reproach came to her that she had not yet wished her friend good-evening.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Bon-soir</hi>, Eugenie."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Bon-soir</hi>, Aurore."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ma ch&#x00E8;re</hi>, I feel like a pagan, leaving you so much alone; but F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9;,--you cannot imagine what he is! What makes men such devils when they are sick? If F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9; would only be sensible
<pb n="124     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
and have a physician and get well; but no, he and Stasie think they can cure anything. Physician! he would as soon see a priest, and priests are his <hi rend="italic">b&#x00EA;tes-noires</hi>. How can an intelligent man be so prejudiced? But it is the way he was educated; that comes of sending boys to France to be educated; that is the teaching of Messieurs Voltaire and Rousseau. Oh, I compliment them!"</p>
<p>Her irony was mordant. She came out of the doorway and seated herself upon the top step of the staircase that wound its way to the basement underneath. "And Gabi! ah, that is too much! Fancy, Eug&#x00E9;nie, after all the trouble I took to explain to him this morning, he brings the mail-bag devoured by hogs,--all the letters a disgusting mass. Only one could I extricate entire for F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9;. I don't speak of your letters--"</p>
<p>"Oh, you know very well I never get letters from any one but Madame Joubert; always the same school news. The swine are welcome."</p>
<p>"I wish F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9; were so reasonable. He will be furious, both about the letters and the mule. And he will say--you know what reason he will
<pb n="125     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
give for it all--religion; too much Mass. He will say he expected it before, and I shall never hear the end of it. Now, we,--because Gabi was pious, and really, Eug&#x00E9;nie, at times in church I have watched him, he had moments of genuine fervor,--we would say that his religion was a reason why he should bring the mail well and be a good servant; but not F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9;, he is so prejudiced. It prevents everything."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Aurore sighed and looked down the avenue to the river, her thoughts sadly enumerating the calculations and hopes blighted by Gabi's recalcitrance. Her thin, regular features and sallow complexion showed the exhaustive harassment of the past two days.</p>
<p>She and Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re had been to school together, were <hi rend="italic">amies de c&#x0153;ur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">toute d&#x00E9;vou&#x00E9;es</hi> on every class-book, from the <hi rend="italic">ab&#x00E9;c&#x00E9;daire</hi> up to the "Histoire de France," and their confidences had followed the uninterrupted growth of their hearts from dolls to sentiments. There was a period when their hearts had been as bare to each other as their faces; but that was long, long ago. Time, age, or self-consciousness had since draped and obscured them one from the
<pb n="126     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
other. The abundant stream of their confessions was being reduced to a clear, cool surface-rill of generalities. One could only guess at the changes that must have taken place in the other, or try to compute them by covert observation, furtive soundings, and silent criticism. Habit now continued the links that bound them, and prolonged the intimacy inaugurated by impulse. They were together this summer after a longer period of separation than usual.</p>
<p>Madame sighed with Mademoiselle Aurore, but her sympathetic look was accompanied with the private reflection: "Heavens! what a difference a man makes in a woman's looks,--that is, of course, a man who is not a brother,--poor Aurore!" At school, Aurore's relations with her sex had been as close as possible; she was <hi rend="italic">la plus femme des femmes</hi>. Now, economical Nature seemed stealthily recalling one by one charms which had proved a useless, unprofitable investment; flattening her chest, straightening her curves, prosaicising her eyes, diluting her voice; in short, despoiling the handmaiden of Saint Catherine almost beyond the recognition of her dearest friend. The little heart that once
<pb n="127     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
bounded so frankly forward toward orange blossoms was being led by religion now away from mirrors, adornments, fripperies, and follies of the flesh, away from Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re, away from herself, down an austere path rugged with artificial vicissitudes, where a crucifix and Golgotha replaced the rose-winged visions of youth, and hope offered the extinction in place of the gratification of desire.</p>
<p>"Mamzelle, Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix asks if you have forgotten the key of the medicine chest?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Ah! la, la!</hi>" The suspended avalanche of neglected commissions fell upon her.</p>
<p>"Mamzelle, Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix asks--"</p>
<p>"I hear, Stasie, I hear."</p>
<p>She put her hand mechanically to her arm for the key-basket. "Ah, yes, my key-basket,--I have left it somewhere; but where can I have left it?"</p>
<p>"It is impossible, Mamzelle, to hear one word you are saying."</p>
<p>"I was only talking to myself, Stasie."</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Plait-il?"</hi></p>
<p>"Nothing, Stasie, nothing."</p>
<p>She screamed this beyond doubt of misunder-
<pb n="128     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
standing, and went into the hall audibly wondering as to the whereabouts of her key-basket. It was perhaps from accommodating her voice to Stasie's increasing deafness, and her patience to the increasing obstinacy of this crab-bed, peevish heritage, that both had become so attenuated in Mademoiselle Aurore.</p>
<p>The master's house--the big house, as it was metaphorically called--stood aloof in fastidious isolation from, but in watchful proximity withal of, the money-making sugar-house and plebeian quarters. It was not,--to the people on the plantation at least, and few others ever came nearer to it than the road in front,--it was not, nor ever had been, simply a massive brick cottage, with tall round pillars, a tiled basement, a pointed, projecting roof, and deep, shady galleries. It was not this nor any other technically defined edifice, any more than the altar is a carpenter's contrivance to believers, or Louis XIV. was a man of small stature to his courtiers. It was never intended to be an ordinary, common dwelling-place for ordinary, common people, and time had respected the original purpose.</p>
<pb n="129     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>Changes had come into the world, and even crept into the parish of St. Charles; but a rigid quarantine had kept all but the inevitable revolutions of Nature and reform from the house and its inmates, and had preserved in unbroken transmission the atmosphere and spirit of an age which supplied adventurous noblemen with principalities in a new world, and equipped them with a princely largesse of power from an old one. As far as bricks and mortar and hand-sawed cypress boards and hand-made nails could do it, they expressed here caste, wealth, power, pride, government, religion. Whatever the record of other similar houses may be, this one had maintained its responsibilities and sustained its traditions with a spirit that Versailles might not have blushed to own and imitate. The garden, with its carefully planned star and crescent shaped beds, had paths which a century ago-connected them into a milky way of loveliness and sweetness,--encouraging and inspiring walks for lovers; but now a riotous growth of roses had tangled them to such a wilderness that the original gardener would have needed divine guidance through
<pb n="130     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
his own work, and lovers--had there been any now--would have been restricted to the broad avenue leading from house to river without deviations or obscurities for either feet or hearts. It was hedged all around with wild orange, except in front, where the river was allowed a glance at the gallery. What once had been a grateful shade had increased to a damp gloom. The magnolias and oaks had so abused their privilege of growing, that they leaned their branches against the very roof itself, and veiled with their moss the little Gothic windows and the observatory into complete inutility, frightening away even the vivacious tendencies of October from the front of the somnolent, superannuated homestead. Here it was always seventeenth century and retrospection and regrets; but on the other side of the house, where the trees had been cut and the sun shone, the breeze was welcome to frolic and sing; there it was always nineteenth century with the latest change of date, for there were Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix's bedchamber and office.</p>
<p>There was a beautiful vista through the orange-trees to the river, and there were ever-
<pb n="131     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
varying heights of rose and gold and lilac overhead,--a mocking-bird sang in the shadows of the neglected garden. Eug&#x00E9;nie Lareveill&#x00E8;re, balancing herself backward and forward in the rocking-chair by the rosetted tip of her slipper, saw nothing, heard nothing but herself. Her muslin dress rose and fell light as the clouds above her; she held her chin in her hand and pursued the thoughts interrupted by Aurore,--thoughts which, since Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix's illness, had been allowed to gain more and more complete possession of her, until it seemed that all Nature had become a cheval-glass to reflect her; and not to reflect merely the dainty piquante outward figure with vexing reminders of the mutations of time and the mutability of woman, but her <hi rend="italic">int&#x00E9;rieur</hi> also,--the disordered interior of one of the undecided sex in the throes of a decision. It is true she had come to the country for reflection, but she had managed to elude it successfully until within the last two days. In a week she would return to the city,--if the summer could only have been prolonged indefinitely! The old <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> at the school came entrancingly before her, where she and Aurore--
<pb n="132     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
the pretty, poor little blonde and the pretty, rich little brunette--used to promenade arm in arm in the twilight, interchanging the deep mysteries and experiences of their sixteen-year-old hearts. The confidences ceased as soon as there was really something to confide. Madame longed for just one such twilight moment; but the only <hi rend="italic">all&#x00E9;e</hi> was the broad one to the river, and--they were not sixteen, and Aurore could think of nothing but her religion, Gabi, and sugar-making.</p>
<p>"If I only had a friend, an adviser; ah! a woman ought never to be without one,--two in fact."</p>
<p>The evening was getting cool; she tied her handkerchief around her throat, and moved her chair closer to the wall.</p>
<p>"If it were only a question of duty; There was nothing a woman could not do for duty, or religion; that made marriage so much more reasonable so much less ridiculous, <hi rend="italic">enfin</hi>; but love!" A rosy reflection from the clouds fell all over her face, and she undid the hand-kerchief.</p>
<p>She could see her friends smile delicately,
<pb n="133     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
and raise their shoulders ever so slightly, and hear the "ho! ho.! ho!" of some irrepressible <hi rend="italic">comm&#x00E8;re</hi>.</p>
<p>"Love! what! she believes in it still? <hi rend="italic">Elle en veut, encore!</hi> what innocence, <hi rend="italic">hein?</hi>"</p>
<p>"But is a woman's heart a thermometer to be regulated according to' outside appearances?" she asked herself, indignantly. "Ah! if <hi rend="italic">pauvre maman</hi> were here!"</p>
<p>The tears came in her eyes, as they always did at the remembrance of the pale, abraded face and shrinking, poor, genteel figure of her mother. Many an "All Saints" had passed since she had placed her first chrysanthemum bouquet and black bead souvenir before poor maman's tomb in the old St. Louis Cemetery.</p>
<p>"If she were here, she would decide for me!"</p>
<p>Eugenie had hot been required to say even a word to her <hi rend="italic">fianc&#x00E9;</hi> Lareveill&#x00E8;re. He had seen her at the exhibition of her school. She played the harp and wore sleeves to fall back off her arms, and her golden curls were all that hid her neck. She had the dress still; poor
<pb n="134     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
maman made it, and trimmed it with the lace from her own wedding dress. Poor maman was only afraid that the fianc&#x00E9; might change his mind; <hi rend="italic">pas de chance!</hi></p>
<p>And he whose companionship had been so thorough an education in men and matrimony,--he had his bouquet and souvenir also on "All Saints," and a Mass besides, just the same as if--</p>
<p>"Whatever marriage is, it is least of all what a school-girl thinks."</p>
<p>There was something else buried in the same tomb, too,--seventeen years old, fresh and innocent, shrouded in a bridal veil. "Ah! if the young only knew more, or the old less." These thoughts always came to her with such peculiar emphasis that the tears which usually rose over "poor maman" fell over herself.</p>
<p>"The first time you go into it blind; the second, ha! with microscopes over the eyes!"</p>
<p>The old deaf Stasie came from under the gallery and walked out in front with her conch shell to blow the summons to supper. She was stiff with rheumatism, and the wavering melancholy notes fell on the air like a <hi rend="italic">Memento mori.</hi>
<pb n="135     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
With characteristic obstinacy she held to the office intrusted to her when she was elastic and graceful; when her wrinkled skin was bright smooth gold; when her lips were full and red, and her teeth white and firm as the shell they clasped. That was before the trees were allowed to overshadow the garden, and the moss to hang in such mournful folds; when the roses were kept in subjection; when the occupants of the tombs under the clump of cypresses out there, her masters and mistresses, hurried in from fields, levee, and garden at her clear resonant calls,--calls which easily vaulted the broad stream and fell in musical cadence on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>Marie Modeste caught the sound on the levee, and started as if she were still at school and still punishable.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">A&#x00EF;e,</hi> Marc&#x00E9;lite! the horn! I shall be late again for supper."</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Oh la nature! la belle nature!</hi> Marie had written compositions on it, and learned poetry about it; but that was before she and Racine and Corneille had seen it. This was all different,--these sunsets and moon-risings, these
<pb n="136     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
clouds and stars and fields, the river, the trees, the flowers, the animals, the poultry, the men and women in the quarters, with their primeval domesticity, the slow movements, the sudden developments, the mysteries, the revelations, the veils withdrawn, one after another, like the mists from the river, until the great stream of life lay bare before her awed gaze. How much of the world lay outside the walls of St. Denis, unmentioned in geography, or history! How much of God outside the Catechism! What was a school life of fourteen years in comparison with a plantation life of three months! Her imagination had not prepared her for it; there was no end to thinking about it; every moment a new thought shone out in a blank space like the stars in the sky, and still her mind was not full.</p>
<p>She hurried through the quarters, nodding to the women, speaking to the children, looking for glimpses of the procession from the fields, pursued by the persistent, vivid, recurring feeling of having been there and done it all before,--the feeling which had thrilled her again and again on the plantation, but never at school.
<pb n="137     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
From the first day it had been natural for her to talk to the negroes, go into their little cabins, seek and respond to their confidences. They accepted her too, spontaneously, as if she had been their own Mamzelle by fact and title.</p>
<p>Not so with Marc&#x00E9;lite. Between her and her people there was no good feeling; instead, the distrust of a class toward a superior member of it, and the disdain of an ascending member toward an inferior class. The men ignored her; the women followed her with resentful eyes, and whetted their tongues when she passed, taking good care that their remarks should fall short of retort, but not of hearing.</p>
<p>The brick-dust on the bare floor crackled under Marie's feet as she hastily entered the dining-room in the basement, almost expecting to hear the customary, "Twenty-five lines by heart, Mademoiselle."</p>
<p>Madame and Mademoiselle Aurore were at the table; Stasie was bringing in the large glasses of cold boiled milk, with the heavy cream wrinkling on top. A candelabra of two candles illuminated the table, while its fellow
<pb n="138     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
dispelled the gloom of the tall mantel-piece, and enabled Mademoiselle Aurore's guests and the portrait of her father to see each other dimly. There were very few living operations in the old house that did not go on in the presence of some pictured Angely. They hung in every room against the pale-green walls variegated by damp and mould,--a diminishing line, nourished by constant intermarriage, until Mademoiselle Aurore and Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix looked like their first Louisiana progenitors seen through the small end of an opera-glass. Mademoiselle Aurore was talking excitedly. "<hi rend="italic">Ma ch&#x00E8;re!</hi> you will scarcely believe it; I can hardly recover from the surprise myself. Talk of changes; that's a change. F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9; will actually have to send to the city this roulaison for Italians, Italians!"--she pronounced the name with every facial expression of disgust,--"Italians to take off the crops; if poor papa could see that!" She looked with filial reverence at the beardless youth in the gilt frame. Her papa had been painted when at school in France, and died too soon to leave a more parental representation of himself. "But, Stasie, give Mademoiselle
<pb n="139     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
Marie some <hi rend="italic">fricass&#x00E9;e, fricass&#x00E9;e! fricass&#x00E9;e!</hi> That is what competition does,--negroes running from place to place to get five cents more pay; and it all comes from that old Simon and Mr. Smith. What more can you expect? They do not care; they have no sentiment. A plantation is a sugar factory to them, that is all. The idea that such <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi> should be allowed to profit by the ruin of our old families, and buy up the finest places in Louisiana! Oh, they can afford to offer more to negroes than others, and force us to hire Italians! Old S&#x00EE;mon: Stasie can tell you who old S&#x00EE;mon is; you ought to hear Stasie talk about him. She remembers the day well when he used to go up and down the coast with a pack on his back, crying <hi rend="italic">Rabais</hi>, and selling things to the negroes; it is only right that he should pay them well now,--he made them pay enough, <hi rend="italic">vas!</hi> and now he owns <hi rend="italic">La Trinit&#x00E9;</hi>. And Mr. Smith, <hi rend="italic">tiens!</hi> Eug&#x00E9;nie, you remember Nathalie Cortez at school; you know when she graduated! Well, her daughter has just been married to this Mr. Smith. Don't repeat it as coming from me, you know, but," she lowered her voice,
<pb n="140     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
"his father was a negro trader,--a negro trader, my dear! absolutely a man Nathalie would not have permitted to sit at the table with her. Stasie knows; you ask Stasie. That's what poverty does." Her face was red and her eyes gleamed with excitement.</p>
<p>"I cannot hear a word you say, Mamzelle," said Stasie, in despair. "If you would only speak a little more distinctly, instead of getting excited."</p>
<p>"The <hi rend="italic">pain-perdu! pain-perdu!</hi>" screamed Mademoiselle Aurore, eagerly profiting by the opportunity. "And F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9;, he exasperates me so! Whatever old S&#x00EE;mon or Mr. Smith gets, F&#x00E9;f&#x00E9; thinks he must buy too,--vacuum-pans, condensers, steam-trains, bagasse-burners, a perfect 'galimatias' of machinery. As if gentlemen needed all that; and as if they had not been making sugar long enough in Louisiana without it! For my part, I like the old open kettles, and I prefer the sugar, too, though it was not so white,--and Stasie, she prefers it too. In poor papa's time it was all so different; but F&#x00E9;lix has his own ideas. He loves everything modern and new; he is all for the practical. The house
<pb n="141     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
and garden might just as well be in Texas, for all he cares about them; and then, after all, if old S&@x00EE;mon or Mr. Smith makes sugar a little whiter than ours, or sells it a little bit higher, oh, then it is Good Friday the rest of the winter! But, '<hi rend="italic">Mon cher</hi>,' I tell him, 'think who they are.'"</p>
<p>"Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix asks Mamzelle to come there just one moment," said Edmond, Stasie's brother, putting his head inside the door.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what it is,--it is that estimate I forgot to copy. <hi rend="italic">Sans excuses, ch&#x00E9;rie</hi>; you see how it is."</p>
<p>Before Monsieur F&#x00E9;lix's illness it was very gay after supper, sitting on the gallery watching the shooting-stars above the river, talking about old times <hi rend="italic">avant la guerre</hi>, or playing dominos in the hall for bon-bons; but now it was sadness itself. Madame and Marie went up the winding steps to the gallery to await Mademoiselle Aurore and her never-ceasing theme of plantation crises. The moon had risen, and changed the landscape from the showy splendor of sunset to a weird etherealization. The rose-vines, which had crept over from the garden to garland and wreathe the brick pillars,
<pb n="142     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
threw fantastic, flitting shadows on the gallery floor, and checkered their faces. The broad path to the river was silver, the tall gate-posts were whitened into marble monuments, the river was a boundless sea of golden ripples. The faint sounds of animated life in the quarters made the loneliness and silence inside the wild-orange hedge more intense. Madame sank in her rocking-chair for another <hi rend="italic">s&#x00E9;ance</hi> with herself:--</p>
<p>"Marie was young, Marie could have ideals, Marie could yet dream in the moonlight, unchidden by life and experience."</p>
<p>She looked at the slight, childish figure, seated on the balustrade, leaning her head far back in her arms, looking up, beyond the moss, the trees, and the clouds, to follow the moon making and unmaking phantasmagorial cities, lakes, and mountains in the world above her,--lost in an ecstasy of self-forgetfulness, drifting away from earth and mortality, soaring higher and higher on the wings of a pure, fresh imagination, until the glorious orb itself is reached, and the silver rays make her one of themselves.</p>
<p>She envied morbidly the pure spirituality
<pb n="143     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
which yet enveloped the young girl, her unspotted cleanliness of simplicity, her virgin ignorance of the quantities in the problem of life, her incapacity for calculation. There were surprises yet in store for her, there was still an unknown before her. Whatever misfortune had done to her, could do to her, her seventeen years had been protected and were flawless in their innocence.
"I was once like Marie, and she will one day be like me. Why must women be always looking for the unattainable,--why cannot we be contented? <hi rend="italic">Enfin</hi>,--one cannot always be seventeen and wear white dresses; but if it is the will of God, why must we have these feelings, these moments, for example? She will know it all, she will crave to know it, and then, like me, she will crave acquittance of the knowledge and the refreshment of ignorance again. It is always with us women the fight between the heart and the soul. The happy ones are born without the one or the other."</p>
<p>As through the intervening shadows of the trees she could see the dazzling river, so beyond her present doubts and hesitations a transcendental prospect offered itself; but sarcastic
<pb n="144     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
society and frigid friends came between to be propitiated by sophistical reasonings and prosaic excuses. Aurore particularly,--if Aurore were only sympathetic as she used to be! But to a woman who scorned one honeymoon, what reasons would justify two?</p>
<p>"I shall not tell her,--that I am determined; she shall not find it out, until--I would rather confide in Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>The hairdresser, in her silk apron and white kerchief, passed on tiptoe, not to disturb her, holding her stiff calico dress to keep it from rattling; she went to Marie.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">B&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;!</hi>" she whispered.</p>
<p>The girl took no notice of her.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">B&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;!</hi>"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Paix, Marc&#x00E9;lite, paix.</hi>" She barely moved her lips; it was so delicate, so exquisite, a breath would destroy it,--her moon-dream.</p>
<p>"You will catch cold."</p>
<p>"Ah, Marc&#x00E9;lite!" she said entreatingly, "why could you not have left me one moment more? Now--" She sighed, and turned her eyes upward once again.
Marc&#x00E9;lite advanced to the edge of the balus-
<pb n="145     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
trade and looked up too, to see what attraction the commonplace moon was offering. She knew that when the moon was on the increase it was a good time to cut the ends of the hair, and some persons could read the <hi rend="italic">bon aventure</hi> in the moonlight, and the Voudous--she made the sign of the cross whenever she thought of them, although her experience had proved it a very insufficient protection against their charms. She asked herself, eying Marie from under her heavy lids, why her <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi> looked so thin and pale. She was smaller and lighter even than when at school; after three months in the country, too! and her eyes with the same hollow black shadows,--why did not those shadows go, now that studying was all done and life was so pleasant? A fierce impatience and rebellion surged in her as usual when confronted by what she could not understand or prevent. Other girls were women in appearance at Marie's age; why did she not shed her childhood also? Why did not her arms round and her shoulders soften? Why could not some of her own exuberant flesh and blood be given to her <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;?</hi> She did not want it; she would like to tear it off and fling it away,
<pb n="146     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
if her <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi> were to be always so <hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E9;tive</hi>, so <hi rend="italic">triste</hi>. One sickness--</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">B&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>," she whispered, her voice trembling at the thought; "you will catch cold, or fever, the air is so bad at this season."</p>
<p>"There, I hope you are satisfied now!" Marie said irritably, jumping down, and grumbling to herself, "If Marc&#x00E9;lite would only let her alone! The moonlight was so beautiful, and at school they never enjoyed the moonlight except in contraband. In a week she would be back at school. Why could not Marc&#x00E9;lite let her forget that; it was so seldom she could forget it! Marc&#x00E9;lite never thought about it, nor Madame either, but she--" she had rehearsed it so often, the whole scene came before her in a flash.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Tiens, voil&#x00E0; Marie Modeste</hi>, back again at school! <hi rend="italic">mais, ch&#x00E8;re</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">le vieux</hi> going to make you stay another year? <hi rend="italic">Quelle injustice!</hi>" She would shrug her shoulders, and say in an indifferent way, just as if it were a matter of course, "Ah! you know, it is a romance,--all a romance of <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;</hi>'s. My papa, he was killed during the war, my mamma, she died when I was a baby, and Marc&#x00E9;lite--just fancy,
<pb n="147     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<hi rend="italic">ch&#x00E8;re</hi>, that good Marc&#x00E9;lite--worked for me night and day, to send me to school; she it was who gave me everything."</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, straightened her head, and her lips moved rapidly, just as if she were at school, only the tightness came right across her chest, always just at this point, and she had to swallow very rapidly to keep the tears from coming to her eyes; for the important thing was not to cry, not to let them suspect. Oh, she had learned at school not to cry; even Madame Joubert, when she used to stand her in the corner with the foolscap on, for making faults in her dictation, could not make her cry when she was a little girl,--and she was a woman now. Did Marc&#x00E9;lite think she was afraid of the fever? If it would only come and kill her before next week, it would be better, far better. What had she to--"</p>
<p>"I shall go to bed; come, Marc&#x00E9;lite." It was better, anyway, to be in the bed, in the dark, all by herself. She stopped to kiss Madame good-night,--Madame in her pretty toilette, with her rings and laces and ribbons. Ah! God was good to Madame; she did not have such things
<pb n="148     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
to think about. "Why, after all, did He select precisely her to orphan, and make her credulous simply to be deceived? Who was to be furthered or bettered by the experiment upon her? Could the same Providence create a Marie Modeste and a Madame Lareveill&#x00E8;re?"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Bonne-nuit, ma mignonne</hi>; going to Mass again to-morrow morning?"</p>
<p>For Mademoiselle Aurore had drawn Marie into the active routine of her religious exercises. Masses, confessions, communions, retreats, penances, novenas, fastings; they had discouraged the kindly efforts of Nature in behalf of her physical improvement, but her mind reflected the benefit of the discipline by a satisfactory state of quiescence. There were moments of transcendental serenity accorded to her when suffering appeared the only proper joy, and martyrdom the only proper vocation of women; but after a long walk. or a visit to the quarters, and talking to the women there, or the moon-light, as at present, they vanished,--these moments; and the lives of the saints she yearned to imitate,--her heart rejected them; and their being exposed to the jeering multitude, or
<pb n="149     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
thrown to beasts,--what was that to going back to St. Denis? She was at the pitiable age when sensitiveness is a disease, before moral courage has had time to develop. "<hi rend="italic">You</hi> are happy, <hi rend="italic">ma fille?</hi>" Madame drew the face again to her lips; she loved to hear it confirmed.</p>
<p>"I, Madame? happy!"</p>
<p>"But, of course, Marie is going to Mass with me to-morrow."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Aurore answered the question she had heard in the hall. The moon poured its effulgence on her pious, enthusiastic face as, an hour afterward; from her seat on the staircase, she was still eloquently extolling to her friend the celestial peace vouchsafed to those women and only to those women, who, renouncing with fortitude the pleasures of sex and youth, forsake the world and consecrate themselves to the perfect vocation of perpetual virginity and prayer, thus preparing their souls for those beatitudes in a future life reserved solely for the pure and undefiled.</p>
<p>"Madame is as bad as Marc&#x00E9;lite," thought Marie in her chamber; "but what can they suppose I am thinking of all the time?" She had
<pb n="150     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
only monosyllables for the kindly services and inquiries of the nurse.</p>
<p>"Is anything the matter with you, <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;?</hi>"</p>
<p>"Nothing, Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>"You are sure you feel well?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I feel well."</p>
<p>"Let me get you a glass of sirup and water."</p>
<p>"No, thank you, Marc&#x00E9;lite."</p>
<p>"Did you hear about that little rascal Gabi?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Edmond should give him a good whipping; the idea of Mademoiselle Aurore hiding him in her room! She spoils him until he is perfectly good for nothing." But, as usual, it seemed impossible to awake an interest in Marie.</p>
<p>Was it to be always that way? Would she never open her heart to Marc&#x00E9;lite? What could she be thinking of all the time,--was it hatred and contempt of her nurse? Then let her say it. Better the loud-mouthed fury and passion of her own people down there in the quarters, than this apathetic <hi rend="italic">white</hi> silence. Oh for one moment of equality and confidence!</p>
<p>"You like it here on the plantation, <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;?</hi>"</p>
<p>"You think perhaps I prefer boarding-school?"</p>
<pb n="151     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Ah, but wait till you see the grinding! That is the grand time of the year on a plantation! Some night, soon, a frost will come; in the gray daylight it will look like flour sprinkled all over the cane; then, when it gets lighter, it looks like silver; when the sun gets on it, it is diamonds, diamonds scattered everywhere. Then you hear the cane-knives, <hi rend="italic">cling! clang! cling! clang!</hi> and the cane falling, <hi rend="italic">fron! fron! fron! fron!</hi> One cut at the top, one cut at the roots, over it goes! Each hand takes a row; I tell you the women are not behind the men then! I have seen them keep up, step by step, twenty rows at a time! A field soon gets flat and bare at that rate; then the carts coming and going, dumping their loads in the shed, the sugar-mill with all steam up; and the cane-carrier,--you will hear them sing at the cane-carrier! You never heard singing like that, all day, all night."</p>
<p>Did Marie hear or not?</p>
<p>"That will be fine, eh, <hi rend="italic">b&#x00E9;b&#x00E9;?</hi>"</p>
<p>She only shook her head.</p>
<p>"The river ran in front of the old plantation, just as it does here," Marc&#x00E9;lite continued coura-
<pb n="152     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
geously. "And the orange-trees went in long rows to the levee. The flower-garden was here, the fields over there, and the quarters on this side," indicating the localities by gesture. "But it was finer, grander. Ah, the Motte plantation was celebrated, I tell you, all up and down the coast. The quarters were like a street in the city, the sugar-house looked as big as the custom-house. The largest boats on the river would stop at our levee for the sugar and molasses. The dwelling-house was twice the size of this, and the furniture, four, five, ten times handsomer. The <hi rend="italic">armoires</hi> were filled with laces and silks and feathers left by the mamans, grand-mamans, the aunts and cousins who were dead and gone. There were pictures all over the walls, like here, only Mottes and Viels; and this," pointing to a framed escutcheon, "was on everything,--silver, china, glass--" A thousand daily contacts had revivified what had sunk into indistinctness in her memory. She could have talked all night and not have exhausted her enumeration. "And the books! <hi rend="italic">tiens!</hi> There was one book I will never forget; it was full of pictures about--"</p>
<pb n="153     <hi rend="italic">Monsieur Motte.</hi>"/>
<p>"Good-night, <hi rend="italic">ma bonne</hi>; I am afraid Madame may need you."</p>
<p>"Marc&#x00E9;lite, it was your home! Why don't you listen? Why don't you believe me? Do you think I would lie to you about that?" She had not the courage to say the words, though they sprang not only to her mouth but to her eyes; her very hands tried to gesticulate the appeal. No! As if she were a dog, or a lying negro caught stealing, she crept away.</p>
<p>Why should it be different with Madame? She had only been her paid servant, yet she was not ashamed before her, she could talk to her. And why should Madame believe her unquestioningly; yes, and give her confidences too?</p>
<p>"Madame, she will die! It will kill her! I knew it! I knew it that night! It will choke her heart to death. Ah, the Mottes are proud! You never saw people like them! She loves me no more! I see that,--she hates me! She believes not a word I say! My God! My God!"</p>
<p>Never a word of her sacrifices, her generosities, only the remorse of an impotent servant over disgrace and failure in a committed trust.</p>

forth ameliorating modifications of the condi-

atica was on the wane, -both his confidence in


himself and Mademoiselle Aurore's trust in the


saints being justified. A slight frost in the

Bel Angely would surpass any former record.

against my religion; but if you knew how many


hopes I have seen go to pieces that way! Mon


Dieu/ I am tired of getting new ones. Ah, you


are fortunate, your life is so simple, so clear, so


smooth. Now, there's Gabi, I should not have


sent him; ah! I see that clearly this morning.


But I have raised that child ever since he was


a baby. He was picked up in the sugar-house


and brought to me. I have no idea even who


his mother is. Well, I thought I would take


him and make a reasonable human being of


him. Fefe and Stasie were against it, of course;


they have never liked him. I wanted to push


him; I thought I would give him the oppor-


tunity. Well, perhaps Fefe is right, after all.


And he learned his Catechism so well, and made


such a good first communion! Last spring, you


know what I did ? I got all the children of the


proper age in the quarters, I taught them the


Catechism myself, and I made them all make


their first communion; there was a cane-cart


full. Fefe and Stasie were against that too, but


I was firm. Ah, it is so elevating to work like


that  Fefe, he said they were rascals already,

and that I would only make hypocrites of them.


Hypocrites! I ask you, Eugenie, if religion


makes hypocrites? But that is Monsieur Vol-


taire again. I will never hear the last of this


from Stasie, and next spring Fef6 will only be


more determined; I know Fef."


Madame shook her head responsively. Marie's


surprised, pained interrogation, Mademoiselle


Aurore's discourse, Marcelite's voluble despair,


had procured for her a sleepless, penitential night.


She was disposed this morning for any pessim-


istic generalities on women, but answered not so


much Mademoiselle Aurore as her own self:


"Yes, our lives  se surprise-boxes to us


women; we never know wnaris gong to come


out of them: our own plans, our own ideas


count for nothing. Loo  at our schoolmates:


not one turned out as she expected. Those who


had a vocation to religious lives, who would be


nothing but nuns, they were the first ones mar-


ried and having children christened. Those who


were ready to fall in love with every new tenor


at the opera, they became dEvotes. Those who


cared only for money fell in love with poor men;


and those who made their lives a poem, with love













<pb n="159"/>

Monsieur Motte.         159


for the hero, they,-they married for money.


When we are old and passdes, we get what would


have made our youth divine. Men are the serious


occupation, women are the playthings, of fate."


"Ah, yes, men are more fortunate." Made-


moiselle Aurore eagerly availed herself of the


fissure in which to insert her peculiar complaint.


"There is something sure, something stable in


a man's life. Look at Fef&. I do not say he


has not had griefs, disappointments, misfortunes


even, in his life, but they did not change it, only


interrupted it a minute; with me, those things


take away my life itself." Her voice quivered,


and the emotion in her face made her look some-


thing as she did at sixteen. She took a long


breath and resumed: " It is like this: either Fefe


would not have sent Gabi for the mail, or Gabi


would have brought it properly, or he would


have informed the whole world about it, me first


of all, coAte que coste. He would not have man-


aged the truth on account of my prejudices, he


would have had no hopes attached to it; now


with me - " She was going to open her heart


a little lower down to Madame, and reveal those


hopes so paltry as to be involved in Gabi's good

conduct, so grand as to influence a terrestrial and


celestial future. Mondaine as, to her disappoint-


ment, she had found Eug6nie to be, she could


well remember the angelic devotion of the little


wife to that old rout Lareveillere. How pa-


tiently she had labored with him after the stroke


of paralysis confined him night and day to his


house; teaching him the graces of repentance,


leading him to the altar he had deserted, per-


suading him to the sacraments he had mocked,


forcing him -actually forcing him -to give


to charity a goodly portion of that inheritance


she had so hardly earned. Whatever small


prospect of heaven the old French merchant


now enjoyed, he owed it to Eugdnie, and no


one else. Aurore was determined to drive Mes-


sieurs Voltaire and Rousseau from the heart of


Monsieur Felix. Eug6nie could not but sym-


pathize and encourage her.


And Madame, -at the quiver of her friend's


voice, the softening of her face, the old allde and


the twilight came before her, and she felt that


she might perhaps venture -


" Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta I " A tiny staccato rap,


light as the pecking of a bird. The ladies raised

their heads simultaneously with a nervous start.


It had a preternatural sound, so sudden, just at


that moment. There it was again!


" But, Eug6nie, what can that be?" Aurore


looked accusingly at the row of kinsmen and


kinswomen gleaming on the wall in their heavy


gilt frames.


Eugenie held her hand against her heart.


"How it frightened me! It must be some one


knocking."


" Some one knocking at the front door ?


Impossible!"


"Some one, perhaps, to see Monsieur Felix."


"Felix? But his visitors all know they have to


go around to the other gallery. There it is again ! "


"Maybe it is some one who does not know."


"I will call Stasie."


"But let us see who it is."


"Not for the world! It might be something


horrible out there."


She dropped her flowers and commenced a


shrill, "Stasie! Stasie!" from the very table,


continuing it to the back gallery and out into


the yard to some inaudible distance. Madame


had disappeared when they returned together.


IT













<pb n="162"/>

162           Monsieur Motte.


" Go, ma bonne Stasie. It must be some one


to see Monsieur Felix; conduct him around to


the other side of the house."


The door was carefully unbolted, and Stasie,


with all imaginable precautions against sudden


assault, put her head out.


"But what are you doing, Stasie?" screamed


Mademoiselle Aurore, as she saw the door


steadily open. She had not time for the ac-


customed iteration, but was forced to escape


unceremoniously into Madame Lareveillkre's


room to escape the view of the intruder. Ma-


dame was unbuttoning her peignoir.


"What do you think? " Aurore was excited,


or she would not have been guilty of the filial


impiety. "That sotte Stasie has actually opened


the front door, and there is a stranger, at this


moment, in the hall. But no; impossible! "- as


she heard a stiff door being pushed open-" in


the parlor ! She has invited him into the parlor !"


"Mamzelle," said Stasie, coming into the


room.


"Well, Stasie, I compliment you! Letting


a stranger into the house this way!" Made-


moiselle Aurore's voice was strident; the tone

rather than the words penetrated to the ears


so tightly bandaged by the faded bandanna.


"What do you mean by opening the house


this way? Are you crazy?"


"He is a gentleman -a visitor." Then, as


the full meaning of Mademoiselle Aurore's


attack came to her, she raised her voice, queru-


lously: " Comment donc? Would you have me


shut the door in his face? Would you have


me drive him away-a gentleman-when he


comes on a visit?"


"What nonsense! A visitor! " She turned


to her friend for a dispassionate opinion.


"What! You are undressing, Eugenie?"


"Only changing my peignoir, Aurore. The


air seems a little cool to me."


"You must understand, Stasie, there is some


mistake. If he does not come to see Mon-


sieur Felix on business, he must be going to


old Simon's or Mr. Smith's. Go and explain


to him -although you should have told him on


the gallery, not brought him into the house."


She uttered the words emphatically, close to


Stasie's ear, and pushed her gently out of the


door. "If Stasie would only allow me to get

a younger servant! " she exclaimed, when the


door closed.


"There, Marnzelle, there; see for yourself!"


the old woman returned, thrusting a visiting-


card before her mistress's eyes as if she were as


blind as she, Stasie, was deaf. "Ah, I told you


so! Shut the door in his face! Put him out by


the shoulders! Ah, that was not the etiquette


of your grandmother, par exemple "


Marcelite had come in by another door. She


slipped behind Madame and whispered some-


thing in her ear.


" Mais qu'est-ce quit c'est que fa? " Mademoi-


selle Aurore looked perfectly nonplussed. "I


cannot understand it. Monsieur-"


" My nigligi from Paris," whispered Madame


to Marcelite, so that Mademoiselle Aurore


could not notice it.


" Monsieur Armand Goupilleau. Goupilleau?


Goupilleau? But I never heard of a Goupilleau.


And you, Eug6nie?"


"Monsieur Armand Goupilleau?    Surely I


know Monsieur Armand Goupilleau. He is a


notary public in New Orleans - oh, but one


of the most celebrated notaries there! He is













<pb n="165"/>

Monsieur Motte.         i65


a good, good friend of mine, an old friend. He


advises me about all my affairs; and an institute


like the St. Denis requires a great deal of ad-


vice, I can tell you. Do I know him? I should


think so. He is like a father to me, in fact."


Marc6lite dropped the ndgligl over her head.


"Just tie this ribbon for me, ma bonne." Her


thin, white fingers, with the long, pointed nails,


could only wander aimlessly amid the bows and


laces. But the hairdresser needed neither direc-


tions nor explanations. Her dark face glowed


with intelligence; she seemed transformed by


a sudden illumination; her deft, light fingers


never worked so felicitously, pulling out lace,


tying ribbon, putting in ear-rings, lifting up a


puff here and pinning a curl there until the


whole expression of the coiffure was reanimated,


passing a powder-puff over the pale face, brush-


ing out the eyebrows, rummaging through a


sachet for the appropriate handkerchief.


"Is he married, Eugenie?"


"But no, Aurore. - What brutality! " she


thought.


"Ah! " Aurore opened the door for them


to go out.













<pb n="166"/>

i66          Monsieur Motte.


"One moment, Madame," whispered Mar-


celite. She was kneeling on the floor with


a pair of high-heeled bronze slippers in her


hand.


"Ah, I knew it! Marcelite is more of a


woman than Aurore."


The nigligi hung in long, beautiful, diapha-


nous folds, and exhaled a delicate fragrance of


vityver, as Marcelite shut the door on both


ladies.


Madame took the initiative, with effusion.


"Ah, mon ami! what a delightful surprise!


Never could you come at a better time." She


held both hands to him. "Let me present you


to my. friend, my best friend, my old school-


mate, my sister in fact, Mademoiselle Angely.


Chkre Aurore, this is my good friend Monsieur


Goupilleau, of whom you have heard me speak


so often. Now you will tell us what good fairy


sent you to the parish of St. Charles."


" As I said in the note which yesterday Mon-


sieur your brother received-" began the


notary in courteous explanation.


"Ah, mon Dieu ! That is the beginning -"


exclaimed Mademoiselle Aurore. "Gabi ! I

must tell F6lix immediately." She abruptly


left the room, Monsieur Goupilleau bowing be-


fore her. Madame's vivacity fled with her; the


social graces, which hung like a silken domino


around her, seemed to vanish, leaving her as


undisguised and embarrassed in her natural


emotion as a peasant before the questioning,


expectant eyes of the notary.


"And you also did not receive my letter


yesterday?"


" No; as you hear, an accident-"


He took her indiscreet hand and guided her


through the twilight of the large parlors to a


sofa. It was a letter that had cost him an effort


to write, -the wording of inexhaustible senti-


ment. He could never speak what he had tran-


scribed alone in his quiet office, her image before


him, musty official records around him, and a


companionless life behind him. His heart, his


eager, long-suppressed heart, drove the clean,


sharp, steel notarial pen, and what had it not


said? So, it was all lost by an accident! but


it had contained one affair of business.


" Madame Joubert has made a proposition to


purchase your interest in the St. Denis."













<pb n="168"/>

X68           Monsieur Motte.


"Madame Joubert!" Madame Lareveillere


repeated in supreme astonishment. Madame


Joubert at the head of her brilliant aristocratic


pension ! Why, she had not a single qualifica-


tion, nothing, except an education. The item of


business brought reprieve, but also disappoint-


ment. Had she, then, been wrong in her intui-


tions, premature in her expectations?


"And Mademoiselle Motte?"


"Ah, Marie Modeste!" The sweet, novel,


motherly look came into her eyes,-the one


beautiful expression of which life had hitherto


deprived them.


"Mon ami, how can I tell you! When I


think of Marcelite I am ashamed of myself,-


I who am white and have an education. Ah,


I detest myself; but you see I was thinking so


much of my own affairs."


A blush that must have been caused by her


thoughts sprang from her heart and spread up


to her face, and warmed even the tips of her


chilled fingers.


"Aurore knew it, Aurore felt it to be a truth.


And I promised to be a mother to her -"


"And I," said the notary, " a father."













<pb n="169"/>

Monsieur Motte.          i69


"Would a mother forget her child, a young


girl, for her own affairs? " It was a chaplet of


self-reproach, the penitential accumulation of a


wakeful, feverish night, exaggerated, incoherent.


"But I thought she was happy; she is so


young, you know."


She raised her eyes to his. The swine, not


she, had received his letter, but his eyes con-


tained it all, and were repeating it over and over


again to the hair, the head, the face, the figure


beside him, -those wonderful, eloquent eyes of


a recluse poet; and she read it all, and could


not feign misunderstanding. His timid, hesitat-


ing words were entirely superfluous so long as


she looked at him; but her own eyes - it was


safer to turn them on the piano. The diamonds


gleamed on her excited fingers. Last night,


when she could not sleep, she had composed it


all- she always prepared her pretty speeches


and notes beforehand for possible emergencies.


It was to be a consent, - oh, yes, there had never


been any doubt about that, -but a consent based


on the exalted motives of duty and self-sacrifice,


and a common obligation toward Marie Mo-


deste; a consent expressive of all that she did

not feel; one worthy of Mademoiselle Aurore,


and unobjectionable to the most fastidious wit


of a sarcastic society. Her fluent tongue recited


the chef-d'auvre as if her friends had all been


there to listen, were stationed behind the heavy


curtains to hear. Only the notary himself had


been forgotten; he alone should not have been


present. The light died away from his face,


and a grave misapprehension clouded his eyes.


"I shall go now and announce it to Aurore


myself, and Monsieur Felix. Oh, yes, there is


no need to conceal it a moment from the world;


and you can explain it to Marie Modeste. I


shall send her to you immediately."


It was as if she were speaking to her pro-


fessor of mathematics. His letter might have


made it all different! He had offered the- love


~'~. of his lifetime, he had asked for love. Was


she to give him duty, self-sacrifice? -And the


ttte-a-ttte was coming to an end!


She stood a moment to steady herself on her


high heels; the room was as private as a grave,


as secret as her own heart at midnight; it was


mysterious and still. She looked all around at


the portraits on the wall,-portraits, not mir-

rors, - and, as it were a dream, she forgot all that


she had been remembering for three months; for-


got it all completely, deliciously. She turned to


the sofa, but the notary had risen too; he had


been standing at her side pleading, reproachful.


" Mon ami." The lace sleeves fell back from


the arms she held to him, all her heart trembled


in her voice and looked through the tears in


her eyes. "Mon ami, it is not so; do not


believe it: it is not duty, Armand."


There was no one to see them or hear them.


The birds outside were singing and the sun shin-


ing, the fresh new breezes rustling the trees, the


cane sweetening, the roses resting in the shade;


the negroes were working in the field, the women


nursing and tending in the quarters; Marie


Modeste was listening to curious prophecies


from Marcelite; Mademoiselle Aurore was ex-


plaining to Monsieur Fl6ix; Stasie was grum-


bling; Gabi was submitting to his delayed


punishment from Edmond. The world had for-


gotten them; it was rolling on without them, or


rather it had rolled back for them. She was sev-


enteen, dreaming in the allie, under the olean-


ders, of love and a first lover. He was twenty-

five, rhyming sonnets in the moonlight, a


'inconnue. And the rapture that came to them


then in a vision enfolded them now as they


exchanged their first embrace.


"Of course, Eugenie, you know your own


affairs best," said Mademoiselle Aurore. They


were again on the gallery, the sunset again on


the river. "As for me -" she shrugged her


shoulders, leaving the rest of the sentence (in


truth abortive in her own mind) to the imagi-


nation of Madame Lareveillere. A prolonged


pause threatened the extinction of the subject


of conversation. Mademoiselle Aurore resumed


in a cool tone of voice and polite reserve of man-


ner better calculated to extract embarrassing an-


swers than information from the friend who sat


helpless at her mercy. The tone and manner


were a personal accomplishment, apparently


not incompatible with her advanced degree of


religiosity.


"Has he money, -your Monsieur, your


fiance? "


One never gets past blushing, it seems, at


such terms, however perfectly the tongue can


simulate coldness.

Monsieur Motte.         173


"He is not a beggar, nor a millionnaire: he


has a certain income from his profession."


" And you are independent, Lareveillere left


you so well provided for! He is a notary public,


you said?"


" Yes, a notary public."


Their rocking-chairs rocked farther and far-


ther apart, making intercommunication an ef-


fort. But there was no one on the gallery or


about, and at a certain age mystery is presumed


absurd, at least by Mademoiselle Aurore, as


Madame Lareveillere acutely felt.


"And he lives on Royal Street?"


"Near St. Louis."


"Will you go there when -after the cere-


mony?"


" Yes, we will live in Royal Street."


"I beg your pardon! I am indiscreet."


"Not at all; it is no secret."


"I suppose your arrangements have been


made some time."


" I assure you only since to-day."


"And when -the wedding? I implore you,


do not answer unless you wish! "


"In November."













<pb n="174"/>

174           Monsieur Motte.


"November I So soon! But that is true, why


waste time?"


" We only thought of that poor child Marie


Modeste. You see, her home will be with us,


naturally. There is so much to do, so many


affairs to regulate, Madame Joubert taking the


Institute-" Madame strove to make it ordi-


nary, commonplace, quite a business arrange-


ment; but whatever she said sounded apologetic


to humiliation, and her eyes felt the obscurity of


tears when they saw a thin smile on Mademoi-


selle Aurore's lips.


" It is hard for me to understand,-one like me,


who never has been married at all; " the maiden


lady raised her hands, the fingers extended as if


from the touch of something unpleasant. " But

" she never got married." In truth, her thoughts


were very busy about her friend all the time, and


may be credited with a gallant assault against 


an attachment which had so far proved impreg-


nable to time.


"It is not that, Aurore, but," forcing her-


self resolutely to speak, " if you would let me


leave her with you for a few days. If you would


take care of her until we are arranged in the city.


Monsieur Goupilleau advises it, and I - I know


nothing better to propose. It is a favor I ask for

it will lay me under the greatest obligations.

painful for her to go back to the school again."


"Eugenie! How can you doubt it? How can

tality or friendship, Mademoiselle Aurore yielded


to no one. " I was going to.propose it myself!

Poor child, that is one of our war-claims! As


for Marc6lite, I can't tell you what I think of her


conduct. It is heroic; it is sublime!  Oh, she


will never want a friend as long as I live, or Fe-


lix either! And Ninie," calling her by her old,


school, pet name, abruptly changing the subject,


leaving her chair, too, to get nearer her friend,


" there is something you must not deny me, -


indeed I have a right to insist upon it; I am sure


you will not wound me by a refusal. I thought


of it instantly; I have planned it all out; I have


even announced it to Felix and Stasie." The


thin little woman had gone back, back, in her


life, far away from the present; where was she


going to stop, in the sweet loveliness of her ca-


ressing manner and words? She was so delicate,


so genuine!


" Chdrie, you must remain here too, you must


be married from Bel Angely, - from the home of


your oldest, best friends, with your old sister Au-


rore to wait on you, to love you to the last-"


"Aurore ! my angel! my treasure! Titite," -

It was worth so much difference, so many dif-


ferences,- the reconciliation; the crossing over


from such a separation in their natures to meet


again as they had started in life, heart open to


heart, tongue garrulous to tongue, all revealed,


understood, nothing concealed, - absolutely


nothing. For there was a generous rivalry in


loyal self-surrender and confession until Stasie


again blew the horn for supper; and the feeble


echoes returning quickly to the gallery, like


aged birds after a short flight; put an end to


the interview.

THE DRAMA OF AN EVENING.


T was carnival time of the year in New


Orleans. The annual machinery of


gayety had been set in motion: heavy,


cumbersome, antiquated machinery, with eti-


quette, ceremony, precautions, and -safeguards


innumerable for the inflammable hearts trans-


planted from a tropical court to a tropical clime.


It was the meeting-time of the year for the young


people, the season for opportunity, the mating-


time to come later in the spring, when the flowers


twisted themselves naturally into bridal-wreaths,


or in the early summer, when the mocking-birds


sang all through the moonlight nights. In the


wise little self-sufficient creole world there was no


opportunity like that offered by a soirte. From


time immemorial a soirle had been the official


gate of entrance into the great world of society,













<pb n="182"/>

x82       The Drama of an Evening.


and this year Madame Fleurissant was to open


the season,-Madame Edmond Fleurissant; for


the last name had been so stretched that it em-


braced not individuals, but classes. The soirde


was given to her grand-daughter, Stephanie


Morel, who was to make her dibut into the


great world out of the little world of school.


Stephanie had not graduated; indeed, she was


only in the second class; but Nature would not


wait for the diploma of St. Denis. Nature is


that way in New Orleans,-so impatient. A


young girl must be very industrious there to


get an education before her debut.


From the time the invitations were sent out


there had been nothing else talked about by the


debutantes. The giddy little heads, still full of


Mass, and still wet with the touch of holy water,


would loiter, on their way from the cathedral,


by the seductive shops, or come together out-


side the artificial-flower windows (rivalling the


show within) to consult on the proper parure


for the occasion. Field flowers, lilies of the


valley, daisies, myosotis, and rosebuds, "rose


tendre," the sweetest of all flowers for a debu-


tante,-they bloomed, a miraculous spring, in

the confined laborariums, and but for the glass


would have poured out over the damp stone


banquette. The day of the intellect was felt


to be over; it was the body which had to be


furnished now. It was not only a question of


artificial flowers, tulles and tarlatans, gloves,


and slippers, but of pointed or round bodices,


clinging or spread skirts. With Paris so far


away, and American fashions so encroaching


and so prosaic, what problem had their arith-


metic ever furnished to compare with it?


The interest, which had been diffused to the


extreme limits of the square of the city, as the


original French settlement is called, began in


reflex to return as the 27th of December


approached, until with the day itself it hov-


ered over a once fashionable neighborhood,


now a quartier perdu given over to coffee-houses,


oyster-stands, mattress-makers, and chambres


garnies suspects, and finally concentrated on


the old gray stucco building, - a by no means


insignificant theatre of social festivities in that


celebrated time long past, to which even a refer-


ence now is monotonous. As night fell, the


venerable mansion arose through the darkness,

glittering with light, shedding a stately radiance


over the humble roofs opposite, and shaming


the social degradation of its whilom intimates


and neighbors on each side. Both portals were


opened for the reception of guests, - the great


wide porte-cochere in front, and the back gate


on the street in the rear. This gate had been


thoughtfully propped open, that the hinges


might not be injured or the mistress disturbed


by the continual opening and shutting of another


procession of guests,- the expected if uninvited,


a not inconsiderable gathering from an old osten-


tatious superfluous retinue. Having come within


the radius of the news that Madame Edmond was


going to give a soirle, they, naturally considering


their former intimate relations with the family,


came to the soirle itself. Those who had ante-


emancipation costumes of flowered mousseline-


de-laine gowns, black-silk aprons, and real

eyes and glut their bodies on whatever chance


might throw in their way. All entered alike


boldly and assuredly, in the consciousness of


their unabrogated funeral and festal privileges,


inspected, with their heaven-given leisurely


manner the provisions for refreshment, com-

rooms, and finally selected advantageous posi-


tions for observation behind the shutters of

this way or that, is enough to settle a destiny.


Nowwonder they were nervous and excited.


Self-confidence vanished as it had never done


before, even in an "Histoire de France" contest at


school. And in matters of toilet there is no


such thing as luck. There seemed to be an


idea that Fate could be propitiated by self-


abnegation. The looking-glass extorted the


most humble confessions.


" I am a fright! "


" As for me, I am perfectly hideous! "


" I told maman how it would be !"


"Now, it's no use ! "


"It is that Madame Treize! ah, what a


demon! "


"I can hardly stand in my slippers, they are


so tight."


" And mine are so loose, - perfect ships."


"Ah, that Renaudiere! the rascal!" came


in chorus from all, for they all knew the shoe-


maker well.


"Just see what wretched gloves! "


"Look at my bodice ! My dear, it was laced


three times over, -the last time more crooked


than the first."

a modiste or fabricant of any kind that had not


betrayed trust. And so restricted as they were

Each one yielded unreservedly to her own panic,


but strove to infuse courage into the others.


" Chlre, you look lovely!" imprinting pru-

And they fell into still greater trepidation over


this exhibition of expenditure on their behalf.


"There's going to be a crowd! "


"Ah, mon Dieu /" came from a despairing


heart.

"Marcelite, I am so afraid," whispered Marie

"And don't forget me, Marcelite "


"Here, this is for good luck! " And with


signs of the cross and exhortation they went


downstairs into -not the parlors, that was not


what frightened them, but the future; the illimi-


table future, that for which all their previous life


had been a preface. One step more, it would be


the present, and their childhood would be over.


From the time her carriage left her door,


Madame Montyon had talked incessantly to her


son, a handsome young man with a listless face,


who was carefully seated in an opposite corner,


out of the way of the never-an-instant-to-be-


forgotten new velvet gown. What she intended


to do, what she intended to say, what her lis-


teners intended to do and say, - nay, what they


intended to think! Always speaking and think-


ing consonant to her disposition, she evidently


intended to carry her business to the ball, and


had laid out her plans in consequence of some


recent interview with her agent.


"I told Goupilleau, 'Goupilleau, nonsense!


You don't know whom you are talking to! Can't


get money out of this people! bah! Giving

not pay office-rent, not even pay interest on


their debts! debts reduced to ten cents on the


dollar! But what are you singing to me, mon


ami?' 'But Madame must not judge by the


present.' 'And why not? Why not judge by


the present?' 'The crises, the revolution, the


reconstruction -  'La, la, la, you are too sym-


pathetic. Goupilleau, my friend, let me tell


you, you are no longer a notary, you are no


longer an agent. You are a philanthropist,-


a poetic philanthropist. Go coo with the doves,


but don't talk business like that! ' And Gou-


pilleau knew I was right. I can read thought!


One is n't a Duperre for nothing."


This was a well-known allusion to the fact


that her father, General Duperre, a child of the


Revolution in default of more illustrious ances-


try, had distinguished himself once in a certain


provincial trouble in France by his boundless


sagacity and impregnable firmness.


The young man made a movement, but only


with his foot.

expression. "No, my son." She pronounced


these words with a slight insistence on the " my,"

the pretender. "One must give a hand to one's

every stroke of the clock since their departure


from France.

"You forget that I, too, am a reole.'


"Charles," -the voice came back suddenly,


cold with offended dignity, -" you forget your-


self; you must not speak so, I do not like it;


in fact, you know it displeases me extremely;"


and silence lasted now until the carriage stopped


before the house, where, really, a policeman


was very much needed, to keep not only the


forward bodies of the banquette children, but


also their impudent tongues, in order.


She had been going on to tell him much


more, - about the " Succession d'Arvil," which,


after all, had been the important reason of her


coming to America; how the half-million she


hoped from it was still buried in a mass of old


paper, a regular rag-picker collection. " That

be at least a half-million! " She had suffered


that amount of shame from him during his life-


time, it was worth half a million to appear


as his niece now.


"But Goupilleau is so slow! I shall give


him a talk to-morrow! I shall say 'so and so,'


and he will say 'so and so."'


Her irascibility once excited, eloquence flowed


without bounds; her verbal castigation of the


notary was satisfactory and complete, and the


succession of her uncle hastened to a conclu-


sion,-her own conclusion, a half-million. It


would be a neat addition to Charles's heritage.


"Charles!" her .robust, strong nature melted


over the name. Late in life her fortune had


bought her the temporary possession of a hus-


band but the permanent ownership of a child, -


a beautiful little child, who had unlocked the


passion of maternity in her. She was of the


kind who are born to be mothers ot wivs-y-


who can do better without a husband than with-


out children.  As her old Uncle Arvil had


hoarded money, so she hoarded this affection.

his desire, so had she descended to unworthy

The little boy had responded well to her efforts,


had given her much, had forgotten much. But


he had not given her all, and he had not for-


gotten the one whom to eradicate from his


memory she would have bartered all her pos-


sessions, much as she loved them,-his own


mother.


"I am your maman, Charles."


"You are my maman, but not my own


maman." The childish verbal distinction be-


came the menace of her life, the sentiment of


his. And the dead mother,     dead mothers


do, became a religion, while the living one


remained a devotion.


She walked like a Duperre through the vol-


leys of commentaries on the sidewalk. " Ma-


man," said the young man in a low voice, as


they mounted the steps, "be discreet, I im-


plore you."


"Bah! " was the answer; and then he began


to regret that he had not sought an excuse to


stay away. He was as sensitive as she was ob-


tuse, and there seemed to be no escape from


impending ridicule. He placed himself out of

Every one naturally said the same thing, com-

of breakwater to turn the tide of compliment into

young man's coat.

"Ah! I can tell you, my maman went to

"Ninety! Who would think it?"


"It is a miracle! "


"And so charming, so spirituelle!"


"A beautiful ball! Really like old times."


"Eh, Odile!"   Tante Pauline spread her


fan (rusting spangles on a ground of faded red

the tears of merriment from her eyes with a

since she, too, was dancing out on the floor


there, a young girl, he a young man, - dancing,


with the honeymoon in their distant horizon,


gayly and thoughtlessly as any. They had

gown this evening, fresh still, with only the

his coat carelessly, left a button out of his vest.

nated the young man who was still in fixed con-

But Henri Maziel had left; indeed, he had

as if they did not see them, their anxious, cal-


culating faces, their sombre-hued bodies, or


their sombre-hued lives; danced in the frank,


joyous exuberance of youth on its first entrance


into the " great world." Their tulle and tarla-


tane skirts spread wider and wider in the breeze


from their own motions, until they stood out like


full-blown roses, showing the little high-heeled


slippers underneath playing as lightly on the


floor as Benoit's fingers on the piano. Bunches


and crowns of artificial flowers were pinned on


their quick-moving, restless heads. Their fresh,


young, bending, curving bodies swelled under


the tightly-laced satin bodices. Eighteen, seven-


teen, sixteen, -they were not out a moment too

were varied, unconventional, changing, with'


nothing regular, nothing perfect, nothing mo-


notonous in them, presenting constant surpris-


ing, piquant variations on the usual coloring and


features, with exotic exaggerations and freaks in


both, which permitted little audacities of toilet,


risks in coiffure, originality in bows'; they walked,


spoke, were graceful, fascinating, and charm-


ing, grandes dames, by inspiration or tradition,


as the grammatical but ill-spelling court of


Louis XIV. talked.


Their timidity had left them, self-confidence


had returned. Narvely proud of their new trous-


seaux, of looks and clothes, they dispensed their


favors with prodigal generosity, unconscious of


their own wastefulness; experimenting with looks


and smiles and winsome address; using their


dangerous woman-eyes with childish hardihood;


charging their transparent little phrases with ex-


pressions of which life had not yet taught them


the significance.


They were, without doubt, now delighted with


themselves. They could not keep from looking


up at the mirrors, as they passed in promenade,


twirling with Cuban agility their scintillating

plumed fans. And the old mirrors, at times,


could hardly contain between their gilded frames


the upturned, flower-crowned, questioning faces.


They did not indorse each other now, or ask


indorsement; they had already journeyed too far


in their feminine tactics.


The breath-laden air, mounting warmer and


warmer, seemed to brighten the Cupids and


the flowers painted on the ceiling. The white


lint from the drugget floated around like pollen


in autumn in search of flower-hearts to fructify.


One could not look across the room without


traversing the dazzling electricity shooting from


eye to eye.


"Ah, they are very happy, Madame Ed-


mond! " said her old beau, with a sigh.  ---

cause they cannot stay away. They compli-


mented one another's families, talked Alphonse


Karr and Lamartine, repeated sharp truths from


Thiers or blunt ones from Guizot between their


sips of punch, and in the neutral garb of their


dress-coats discussed moderately, republicans,


royalists, and imperialists, the politics of France.


They made periodical excursions into the par-


lors, where their old hearts (grown torpid in the


monotonous decorum of married life), warming


at the sight of so much beauty and the taste of


punch, grew lusty, and were eager to fall in love


again -with one another's grand-daughters.

"A perfect bonbon !"


"It's a family trait. 'La gentille Fleurissant,'

suited a kipi.

out of the darkness of their faces. The hair-


dressers and maids, in virtue of their superior


appearance, had the privilege of the steps all


the way down to the floor beneath. They


sat, their bright bandanna heads looking like


huge posies, exchanging their bold, frank, and


characteristically shrewd comments on their


whilom masters and mistresses. What did they


not know of the world in which destiny had


placed them in the best of all possible positions


for observation? What had been two low dim,

gilded with romance, the tragedies from the


aspiring passions of some, the degrading pas-


sions of others, and all the impurities from


common   self-indulgence, with indestructible


consequences to stalk like ghosts through the


leasant present! Their school had well taught

standing the problems of the heart better than


those of the head, they translated them into


the unveiled terms of their intimate language,


giving free vent to their versions and theories,


but aggressively in their loyal partisanship and


their obstinate servility to family and name. It


was a pleasure to look up and see them, to


catch a furtive greeting or a demonstration of


admiration. Their unselfish delight in the en-


joyment of others gave a consecration to it.

One of the women of the house spoke sharply


to the crowd above.


" It's not me! It's not me! " came a score


of whispers; " it's Nourrice ! "


"Nourrice! For the love of-"


"Eh, poor devil! But let her come, Olym-


pia," came in antistrophe from the crowd on


the steps. "She '11 soon go away; she never


stays long."


"Here, Nourrice! here!"


"By me, Nourrice! "


"Here's a nice place for you, Nourrice! "


The kind-hearted women moved this way and


that to find a place for her on the steps.


Two long, thin, naked, yellow feet, caked with


mud, came down the steps, feeling their way


over the carpet, and an old woman stiffly sat


in the corner offered, tucking her ragged, soiled


skirt about her, and drawing her piece of shawl


over her breast. Her arms were bare, and the


elbow-joints projected sharply. Her kerchief


seemed to have worn in holes on her head; the


gray wool stuck out everywhere, like moss from


an old mattress. She had drifted in from the

street through the back gate, in her rags, her dirt,


and her mendicancy, like some belated bug at-


tracted from the distant swamps to the gaslight.


They began to joke her in a rough, good-


natured way.


" HI! but, Nourrice, you love balls still?"


"Like old times, hein, Nourrice?"


"You could show    them  how to dance,


Nourrice? "


"Who used to run off to the balls at night,


Nourrice? " for they all knew her, - a character


famous for escapades in the old times.


But the old woman paid as little attention to


them as if she had not heard them. The lips


of her sunken mouth, into which all the wrin-


kles of her face converged, were glued together;


and so the comments resumed their way without


regard to her.


"Whom   is she dancing with there, -that


little Mamzelle of the Goupilleaus? "


"Eh! but she 's not pretty! "


"Not pretty? Mamzelle Motte not pretty?


Ah, par exemple " Marcelite's voice took an-


other tone from that in which she had criticised


others.

" Chutl it is her Mamzelle! "


" Here is Madame la Grande-Duchesse again."


They had all been attendants on the opera-bouffe,


and could fix a title on Madame Montyon as


well as any one.


"She has not got any prettier, that's the


truth!"


"Nourrice! Nourrice! " shaking her by the


shoulder, " look, look - your old mistress! "


"A nice old mistress, vas/"


"A mistress who was too good to own slaves;


she had to sell them."


" Madame had susceptibilities; Madame was a


Parisian, not a creole."

" It was not her baby; it was the first one's


baby."


" That's the reason she was jealous, -jealous


of Nourrice; " and they all laughed except Nour-


rice herself, who pressed her thin fingers over


her mouth and looked on the crowd below.


"And the little boy, the young man, where is


he?"

" Oh, but I would like to see him, - Monsieur


Florval."


"Florval? Charles, you mean."


"It is you who do not know what you are


talking about; his name is Charles Florval."


"Ask Nourrice; she knows."


" She used to nurse him; he was the apple of


her eye, poor wretch! " one whispered, pointing


to Nourrice.


" I remember him well. Such a temper! a


perfect little devil! but Nourrice could always


manage him."


A late comer, a very late comer, ascended the


stairs, and they all stood up to let him pass.


He walked as if hurrying from a danger, his


large blond face exhibiting the nervous panic


of a bashful man,-a panic not assuaged by


the coolly critical eyes that scanned him up the


long way,- eyes that were pitiless to anything


like a social infirmity.


"But who is he?"


" Pas connais i."


"Not one of us, sure," meaning creoles.


"An American from up-town."


"Some rich American," corrected another.

He soon descended; the nervousness driven


from his face to his hands, - great, stout hands,


which worked incessantly, smoothing his white


gloves, the sleeve of his coat, and travelling up to


his cravat. He avoided the gaze of the women,


betraying a fatal cowardice, and made his way,


through the old gentlemen around the punch-


bowl, to the parlors. He was, in fact, a debu-


tant. No young girl could have been more


overcome on entering the room than he; no one


could have felt more helpless and bashful; no


one could have more excusably yielded to the


strong temptation to flight. He felt awkward in


his new clothes, not one article of which was an


acquaintance of more than an hour's standing:


he was vexed that their delay in coming had


postponed his arrival at the ball until such an


ostentatiously late hour; and the people all


around him were as new as his clothes. His


long quiet evenings at the plantation, after the


hard day's work, came up before him. There


he was at ease; there he was master; there, on


the finest plantation in St. James's Parish, he was


in a position to inspire, not feel, a panic. He re-


mained at the door stock-still under the charm

of retrospection, until some deputy of the Fleu-


rissant family, all apologies and fine speeches,


put an end to the uncomplimentary position.


According to etiquette he was taken around the


circle and introduced to every individual, chap-


eron and relative, composing it.


"Monsieur Morris Frank."


"Monsieur Maurice Frank."


"Monsieur Maurice Frank."


"Of the Parish of St. James."


"Of the Ste. Marie plantation of the Parish


of St. James."


The repetition, reinforcing name with title,


title with name, accumulated such a deposit of


self-esteem, that at the end of it he could really


assume the air of a young proprietor with a large


bank-account, - the air which distinguished the


plantationless, bank-accountless young scions


about him.


" From St. James, you say, - from St. James,


Monsieur Fleurissant? What a chance! He


may know something of an old friend of mine,


a particular friend, Monsieur Deron, -Phi-


lippe Deron, of the Ste. Helena plantation."

dresses crushing up against him, the bare arms


grazing him, and the white necks everywhere,


like the dropping petals of the Malmaison roses


from the vine on his gallery at home. He had


to move this way and that, to keep out of the


waltz.


" Monsieur Deron, - Philippe Deron? "


At first he could only bow low and reveren-


tially, with blushes of pleasure. His language


could not come on the instant, before such a


volume of black velvet and a diamond neck-


lace, that was so beautiful it charmed the be-


holders into admiration of the neck it encircled,


and puffy marabout feathers, like his own tender


ducklings at home, in her hair.


"Monsieur Philippe Deron?"


His face lighted with pleasure at the ease of


the reply: "Philippe Deron? Intimately; his


plantation is next to mine."


"And his crop, - his crop last year? "


"Superb."


"Superb? Ah, you see that! The fox!

that! Come with me; we will find Goupilleau.

circle, when Madame Montyon prevented the


pleasure about to be expressed on both sides by


carrying one of the participants bodily away.


" Goupilleau ! listen! Ah, that Deron! what


turpitude! "


The patience as well as the politeness of even


a notary, however, can come to an end.


"To-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, in my


office." Monsieur Goupilleau was firm and


silent after these words.


" Montyon manners! The manners of a po-


liceman, my dear, absolutely," explained Tante


Pauline to her companion, whom fate had


only released by intervals from her depressing


lonesomeness.


"That is the way with those rivolutionnaires.


They come from the depths; not from the


bourgeoisie, my dear, but from the people, - the


people." And she pronounced these words


with the unique expression of contempt which


she conscientiously reserved for them.

She turned to her interlocutor on the left.


" He is drawing the devil by the tail, I hear."


(I1 tire le diable par la queue.)


" Not a cent !" She had said it of almost every


one in the room, not from default of imagina-


tion, but from the monotonously truthful, un-


fortunate circumstances.


"The on dit," - Tante Pauline suddenly


remembered that she had let a precious subject


pass without relating all she knew about it,-


"the on dit about this young girl, -you must


have heard it. Odile, you have heard it, have


you not? Quite romantic; of course, they tried


to hush it. Very naturally; but it is the truth,


nevertheless. I see nothing in it to be ashamed


of, or, of course, I would not repeat it. Ma-

mise, the coiffeuse, - Art6mise Angely, you


remember; she belonged to Amenarde Angely.


Well-"


"Tante Pauline "--the fan was tapping

her hand and arrested it, - "for the love of

Besides, remember how kind Eug6nie Goupil-


leau has always been to you."


"If it is a story, there is no harm in repeat-


ing it. I don't say positively it is the truth.


Silly! It is not silly, even if it were true."


She resented bitterly any imputation of ma-


liciousness. Her kind heart repudiated any


desire to do evil. She talked simply with the


vague idea of affording gratification. She was


also proud of her reputation of knowing every-


body and everything, and desired to sustain it.


So, to prove her perfect disinterestedness, and


to leave it to the impartiality of her hearers,


she related all the circumstances from the be-


ginning, - from the very beginning, where Arte-


mise, the coiffeuse, had been called in to comb


Madame Lareveillere for a grand concert and


distribution of prizes. "And such an Iclair-


cissement, my dear, about Eug6nie's toilet mys-


teries," etc., carrying her story successfully


and fluently to the end. "Although the Mottes


are of good family, best creole blood. Marie

uttering the criticism with appropriate grimace


and intonation.


"Alphonse Motte was a very nice young man,


quite comme i faut. Not over-burdened with

how delicate she was; every one else knew that

take her in. He's no relation, - at least, not

the matter for her heardrs, human certainty of


knowledge not going in New Orleans beyond


that possessed by Mademoiselle Pauline Ruche.


The story, as water by capillary attraction,


soaked farther and farther away from the


fountain-head, making the tour of the room

ing from one to another until all had become

bliss, passing away with a sigh,-the absent-


minded, causeless sigh of young girls, who,

and then they feel that they have lived and


known this moment ages before.


All around Marie Modeste were dancing her


school companions, young ladies now,-and


she was a young lady too! --almost disguised


one from another in their beauty and mature


manner. Could that be Elmina, who had passed


hours in the corner with a foolscap on; and


Loulou, who had almost wept her eyes away


over faults of orthography; and Ernestine,


who had monopolized the leathern medal; and


Gabrielle, who had waged a persistent war, a


perfect siege of Troy in duration, against her


music-teacher; and all those who had passed


out of the gates of St. Denis before her, year


after year, graduated into the then far-distant


great world? These did not dance, but walked


around with the languid movements and pre-


occupied eyes of young matrons. "What a


bright, what a beautiful world! Was there


ever a dark day in it? Was it ever so bright or


so beautiful to any one before?"  So they all


thought, each one dancing in a fresh, new,


original creation, - a special paradise, full for


each one to name and classify. Her first illu-

sion goes when the young girl finds her own


Eden neither the brightest nor the best, nor an


individual creation; the last goes when she finds


that she is not the only woman in it, but that


Eves are under every tree.


When they looked at anything, they looked at


themselves in the mirrors, or at their partners,


not at the crow's-feet and wrinkles which had


travelled from the hearts to the faces of the


debutantes of twenty-five years ago, the pos-


sessors, then, of a paradise too.


The young girls had of course consulted the


bonne aventure about him, - the future one


whom they hoped to meet this or some other


near evening. Was he to be fair or brown, tall


or short, widower or bachelor? Candles were


even now burning before distant altars to hasten


his coming, placed by the zealous hands of some


of those very nurses out on the stairs; the saints


were being arraigned, perhaps, by some of the


impatient mother-spectators about him; all to


be forgotten in the supreme moment by the


most interested ones! Quadrilles, deux-temps,


and waltzes succeeded one another; but the


heedless young girls thought only of the pleas-

ure of the dance, forgetting the profit. How


could they do otherwise, with that new blood


beating in their veins, and new life bursting in


their hearts under the forceful music of Benoit,


-that warm, free, full, subtilely sensualized


African music? The buds themselves would


have burst into blossom under the strains, and


the little birds anticipated spring.


"Ah, what a beautiful world it is I How


good it is to live! How good God is ! "


And it came about as Marie Modeste danced


with the young "Parisianized creole; " it is so


inexplicable, so indescribable; to state it destroys


the delicacy of it; to confess it almost vulgar-


izes it; but an impression was made on their


fresh, impressionable hearts, slight and faint,


easy to efface or subdue, but more easily


kept alive and fixed.  Neither knew- how


could they? it was the first time- what it was.


A change came over the charm upon her; a


dissatisfaction crept into the young girl's heart;


her pleasure all departed. When she spoke, it


was to perceive that she was silly; she became


conscious of marked inferiority in her appear-


ance; she was wearied; and when she looked in

the mirror now, it reflected not her face but her


mood. And he, seeing the light pass from her


face, became self-accusing, self-depreciative, and


taciturn; his life became a hateful barren to


look back upon, his stepmother an intolerable


irritant whom he wished to deny before Marie.


When the time came for them to part, they


both started, as if being together were a sudden


impropriety. She had not a glance to encour-


age him in her embarrassment. He followed


her upstairs to the dressing-room without a


word to retrieve himself with, so absorbed in


the new sensation that he stumbled over an old


negro woman who had apparently forgotten, in


her enjoyment of the scene, to take herself


away with the rest.


Her companions it was that had forgotten to


drive her away into the back-yard for supper, or


into the back-street for shelter. The music crept


through her brain like soft fingers through her


matted, knotted, massed hair, loosening the tan-


gles in her half-crazy mind. " How would she


know him, they were all so much alike, the young


men, and all dressed the same?"

kiss. My little soul." A long-buried litany of


diminutive tenderness, the irrepressible cajoleries


of colored creole nurses; she kept her fingers


pressed tight against her lips; not a word of


the myriads that teemed in her heart disturbed


the scented, warm atmosphere. She nodded


at times, and dreamed she was at the bedside


of a patient.  The lace-lined trains of tired


ladies on their way to the dressing-room swept


over her. At the sound of every man's step


she would raise her head alertly, and the gleam


in her eye would transfuse the white film that


obscured it.


A little boy with black hair which she used


to curl, black eyes which she used to kiss, and


lace petticoats! If he would only come up the


stair that way! Oh, he will know me! He


will do me justice! He will give me satisfaction


for all,--all! His poor old Nourrice! His


nigger! His dog! His Patate!


Her menial heart, which had cast tendernesses


on her nursling, cast humiliations on herself.


Her thoughts flew like martins back to old times,


and there dallied and rested. She was no longer

a pampered, spoiled nurse, the unmanageable,


the wild, the reckless 4uadroon of a wild, reck-


less period. Some one tn   ed over her; she


caught hold of the baluster and pulled herself


up, instinct with old servile apology. Bidden


by the same impulse that had brought her there,


she followed after, close to the footsteps of the


young man, stretching out her arms to catch


him, to detain him.


" I know you! I know you! It's God did


it,-God! "


She had caught him somehow; half pulling,


half pushing, had got him through the open


door to the dark gallery behind.


" Your Nourrice! Your poor old Nourrice! "


He had not pronounced the word in twenty


years. " Nourrice." It meant then a world of


solicitude, - protection from danger, covering


from cold, food when hungry, drink when


thirsty, a cooling, a soothing, a lullaby, a great


strong, dark bulwark to fly to, a willing Provi-


'dence in reach of baby arms. He stretched out


his arms again at the word; they reached far


over the limp, mal-odorous object at his feet.

" It's God sent you, - God ! "


He felt her lips, a soft, humid, toothless mass,


pressing again and again on his hands. Beyond


her, over the irregular roofs and chimneys and


balconies, the skies stretched full of hot, gleam-


ing, Southern stars; the music from the piano,


the chattering voices in the dressing-room, filled


the gallery. She kept raising her voice louder


and louder, for her own dull ears to hear the


epitome of her sufferings; he could hear plainly


enough.


"Little master! I've no home, no bed, no


food, no nothing. I'm 'most naked! I'm 'most


starved! "


The heart-rending sob of human desperation


broke her voice.


"Nourrice! Poor old Nourrice! Patate! "


It was an inspiration, - his recollection of the


old nickname. God must have ordered it with


the rest.

I have worked and worked! but God knows I


am too old. I was an old woman when I nursed


you. I can hardly see, I can hardly hear, I can


hardly stand; and I am sick, I am diseased."


"I've no home, no bed, no food, no noth-


ing!" she repeated. "The little children run


after me in the street, they throw dirt at me;


' Hi! la folle! la folle!'" raising her voice in


piercing imitation of their cruelty. "The little 


nigger children, -the rottenness of the earth!


I fall in the gutters! The policemen drag me


off. They club me; they beat me all over; they


tear my clothes! - nigger policemen, little mas-


ter! " Passion exhausted her breath at every


item; her voice came hoarse and gusty out of


her exposed, bony chest. " Clubbed by nigger


policemen! Ah, God! They lock me up in


the calaboose. Poor me!"


Her breath and recital ended in a wail of mis-


ery. The wail and the misery reached him, not


here, but in that bright, gay, selfish world of


Paris, where he had passed a happy youth, a


useless manhood. "France? What was he, an


American, a creole, doing in France, when such


things were passing in America?"

"It was not right to sell me! It was not


right to sell the nurse of a child!"


"Sell ?" he repeated. " Sell ?"


"I begged on my knees, I begged and begged !"


"Sell," he thought, " my nurse,- the nurse of


my mother, - sell her, and spend the money in


France"! He felt a hot wave in his heart, as if


it were blushing.


"What did God free me for, Iein? To be


beaten by niggers? To be run after by little


nigger dogs? Why didn't He kill me?


"Philo! Odette! Tom!" They were her


children. She began to curse them, horribly,


frightfully.


"They stole my money! They drove me


out! They put the police on me! They set


the children to insult me! I curse them! I


curse them!"


Her shawl had fallen from her shoulders. She


pulled and tore in the darkness at her shrivelled


bare breasts, as if to tear away the ungrateful lips


they had once nourished. He picked up the


wretched rag and folded it around her. It felt


good to touch her ill-treated limbs, to soothe


the violence away from her trembling head.

"Hush ! Hush! " She might be overheard.


He tried to conform his Parisian accent to her


creole ears; he even recollected some fragmen-


tary creolisms. "Hush! hush! Philo, Odette,


Tom; forget them! It is Charlot you must re-


member,-your little Chariot; eh, Nourrice? "


The Goupilleaus were going downstairs now,


- the husband and wife arm in arm. He should


have been there for the young lady.


" Give me satisfaction! Give me justice, Mon-


sieur Charles! "


He remembered now distinctly hearing her


call his father so, -" Monsieur Charles." A


faint, shadowy form came out of his memory;


it never came more distinctly than that, but he


knew it for his own mother, and as he thought


of her, his eyes again sought the stairway; the


blue myosotis wreath was just disappearing.


His own mother was a creole girl too, like


Marie Modeste Motte.


"A little cabin somewhere, and a few pica-


yunes to keep me from starving until I die!

"To-morrow, Nourrice!    To-morrow, the

His white gloves received the soil of the


gutter-mud as he took her horny, wrinkled


hands in his.


"And those mulattresses! those impudent


mulattresses in their fine clothes! As if they


had not been freed too!"


She was a mulattress herself, but she could


not forbear the insult, the curiously galling in-


sult invented by the pure blacks.


"To-morrow! To-morrow     morning, Nour-


rice ! See, it is almost here! " It was not far off


-the dawn. The stars were beginning to look


pale and weary as if the ball had lasted too long


for them also. On the gallery, the darkness


was becoming gray.


The old woman felt her way along by the


balustrade to the back-stairs. After waiting so


many years, it was not too much to wait a few


hours more,-out on the banquette in front of


his house. She would follow him home; she


could not trust even him; when he went out in


the morning it would be better to be there to


remind him.

The repetition of quadrilles, waltzes, deux-

in the parlors; from the supper-room the guests


went to the dressing-room; the procession was


turning to the street again.


As Tante Pauline had said, it was a kind of


judgment-day for the poor creoles. It is not


pleasant to be in debt, but it is a comfortable


mitigation of it to have an ocean between one


and one's creditor. They could not help feeling


towards Madame Montyon as on the real judg-


ment-day the poor sinners may feel towards the


archangel who wakes them from the sweet secu-


rity of death to receive long-delayed punish-


ment. If she had not said a word, her presence


would have proved too suggestive for their con-


sciences; but the good lady belonged to a school


which did not economize powder and shot when


occasion required, nor did she breath; she car-


ried out her plans only too well. At the end of


her prepared speeches, finding that the respon-


dent did not assume the r61e of either thinking


or speaking attributed to him or to her, she was


enabled to elaborate her own manner and argu-


ment d indiscrdtion. The initiative of polite-

ness had been tried, the propitiation of a cordial


welcome, the head held high to avoid her, or at


least the eyes, so that only the marabout feath-


ers came in the plane of vision,-- the attitude that


expresses an effort to keep on a level with ele-


vated principles, the attitude generally of the poor


in pocket. Some quietly avoided her;. others


fled before her, but nothing diverted her. She


lent not only one hand but two hands to her


affairs.  Her conversation rolled on uninter-


ruptedly, exhaling rent-bills, due-bills, promis-


sory notes, mortgages, and every other variety


of debt which had been used to procure money


from her or old Arvil. Her voice took the


suavity out of the truffles, the bouquet from the


champagne. The creole gentlemen (and who


says creole says gastronome) had never eaten


their pat6s, woodcock, and galantine with such


obtuse palates. Law, conscience, honor! She


arrayed herself and her obligations under the


protection of each and all. "Extravagant as


creoles, no\wonder they cannot pay their debts!

munity is bankrupt."


"My dear lady, we must make an effort


for our young people; we must marry our


daughters."


Marriage was the last necessity for her to


recognize.


" But on what basis, - on what basis, in the


name of Heaven, do you intend to found your


families?"


"On love, pure and simple; it is the best


we have, having no money."


"Love! Love! And what of honesty, eh?


Can you buy bread for love in New Orleans?


meat? rent houses? pay debts with love?"


"Would to Heaven we could, Madame! "


"Ah, Monsieur Frank," she said, - she had


taken a fancy to the young German, and kept


him near her, - " it is a community of Philippe


Derons ! Apropos, you will not forget to come


to Goupilleau's office to-morrow at ten? We


will show Mr. Philippe Deron whom he has to

a grand-daughter into society, I believe. I re-


minded her of it this evening. And Goupilleau


says that the law does not compel the payment


of such debts; the law! yes, the law! but honor,


the famous old creole honor! For gentlemen


and ladies, all debts are debts of honor!"


It was unfortunately said in the hearing of


one who, though the least solvent pecuniarily,


was good for any amount payable by the


code,-Monsieur Henri Maziel.


"That, that is a little strong," he muttered, -


" fa, c'est un peu fort."


He sought out some undertakers of duelling


pomps and ceremonies, who promptly requested


Monsieur Charles Montyon, then descending


the staircase, to furnish at his earliest conven-


ience reparation to creole honor impugned by


his step-mother. The waiters carried it to


the back-yard, the guests whispered it in the


dressing-room; Madame Montyon herself was


the only one to ignore it.

ing of a new day. The 28th of December

left by the 27th. Old Madame Fleurissant


slept, under the weight of her ninety, ninety-


two, or ninety-five years, the hermetically


sealed sleep of the aged, with no crack or


crevice for gnawing thought to intrude and


torture the brain; while her guests carried to


their homes and into their future lives the


germs of variations in both which she through


her soiree had sown.


Morris Frank, never more secure in the pos-


session of his magnificent plantation, went over


his nightly r6sum6 of the details composing


it,-the acres under cultivation, the uncleared


forest, the sweep of the river-front, the sugar-


house, the hands, even to the names of the


mules; his settlement with his merchant that


day: his bank-book heavy with amounts of


deposit. His elation for the first time was un-


tempered by regret for his father, whose toil-


some life and recent death had made him heir


to it all. In his superb physical strength and


accumulated fortune he had but to put his


hands out to grasp the pleasures of life,--his


great, strong hands made to grasp, and his


great, strong heart made to enjoy. The mag-

nificent, complimentary Madame Montyon had


also her share in his self-satisfaction. Through


his dreams ran the appointment to meet her the


next day in the notary's office, and he sought


in his mind all possibly useful information with


which to confuse the plausible Philippe Deron.


Madame Montyon, whose fatigues blurred the


enjoyable retrospect of her evening's business,


felt only a sleepy triumph. The imported white


maid missed her usual scolding, as she removed


the panache of feathers and velvet train, -with


professional tenderness and solicitude for them,


professional indifference to their wearer.


To Madame Odile Maziel, instead of slum-


ber came a vigil filled with the recollection of


an evening of mortification and ennui, domi-


nated by the prophecies she had defied at her


marriage, which came now to brood over her


future like sluggish crows.


Young Montyon, in his feelings an old Mon-


tyon, looked through a veil of cigar-smoke at the


old raving Nourrice and the adjacent childish re-


membrances her presence evoked; at his native


city, and the people whom his step-mother and


father had abandoned in time of crisis; at the

irrepressible step-mother herself, at the immi-


nent choice of swords or pistols her indiscretion


had brought upon him, and the probable even-


tualities of the morrow; but last, and longest,


he looked at a crown of blue myosotis over


eyes that seemed the eyes of a thousand women


in one, and at a face made from the core of his


own heart, and at the history of it which he


had overheard from his station near the parlor


door.


And Marie Modeste; the music, the inexora-


ble music, carried her around and around, on


and on, until, horribly awake, yet expiring with


fatigue, the early church-bells dissolved the


infernal charm. She sank like a feather into


a sleep of eider-down, where dreams came to


tease her with sudden fallings, or with hints and


suggestions touched her sensibilities to the color-


ing of a blush, the starting of a tear; her feet


twitching and moving still in the waltz,--the


one waltz with the young Parisian.


Even a soirle, however unusual the occur-


rence, could not disturb the equilibrium of


Monsieur Goupilleau's notarial existence. He


descended at his habitual hour the next morn-

ing to his office, situated on the ground-floor


of his dwelling, and resumed the interrupted


business of yesterday; leaving stoically on the


threshold all thoughts of the seducing comforts


and luxuries so recently installed in his chambers


upstairs.


He was soon immersed in the "Succession


d'Arvil," extracting the papers from a tin box,


smoothing, cataloguing, annotating them, and


arranging them in distinct little piles on his


long office-table.


The private door of his office was pushed open


by Marc6lite.


"Monsieur! " she said, "Monsieur! " her


voice boding ill news.


The whole upper stories of his house, with


their treasures of domestic love and happiness,


tottered under the notary's sudden fear.


"Speak quick "


"Monsieur," -she gave vent to a long-re-


pressed excitement, her words coming rapidly,


incoherently,-" that, that was Morris Frank


last night! "


"Ah! " Monsieur Goupilleau gave a sigh of


relief.

"Morris Frank! But who is Morris Frank?


Do you know who Morris Frank is? " she


asked, raising her voice.


"Morris Frank?" repeated Monsieur Gou-


pilleau, wonderingly.


She looked at him, still in the doubt which


had confused her all night. Would it have


been better to say nothing about it? Was it


really better to tell? A year ago she would


have kept it to herself; now-


"A little white-headed boy," she bent over


and stretched her hand out, at the height of


a young child, above the floor, " playing around


the plantation quarters with the little negro


children, -the son of the overseer, a German


overseer, a man who hired himself out to-whip


slaves he was too poor to own! " Her scathing,


fierce tongue brought the fire into her eyes.


" My God! The son of an overseer at the


ball of the aristocrats! On my old planta-


tion?" She read the confused inquiry in the


notary's face. " The plantation of Monsieur Al-


phonse Motte, the father of my Mamzelle? He


lives there still?"  Monsieur Goupilleau's face


brightened with a discovery. He commenced

a question: " The son of the overseer on Mon-


sieur Motte's plantation? "


"That night! That night! It makes me


crazy to think of it! The ringing of alarm-bells,


the shooting of cannon, the gun-boats coming


down the river, the negroes running away


setting fire, steng; andthsoldie r sodiers


everywhere, none of our white gentlemen about.


My God! we were so frightened we could not


think; we left everything in the house and ran.

see? The young white boy the soldiers were


hanging!  No wonder she died, Mamzelle


Marie! " She tried to steady her hand on the


back of a chair, but it shook and trembled to


the floor.


The front door of the office flew wide. Ma-


dame Montyon had jerked the knob out of the


hand of the bowing clerk.


"Hi! Goupilleau, my friend ! " she exclaimed


brusquely; "on time, you see! To work; to


work! What have we here, eh?"


She had divested herself of so much the


night before, and invested herself in so little

this morning, that really her manner (which was


always the same) alone remained to identify


her.


She threw back the ends of her India shawl,


which she had put over her purple cashmere


morning peignoir, and tossed up her black lace


veil, under which the gray hair stood out


crinkled and crisp from the crimping and ma-


nipulation of the evening before.


"Just out of bed, you see! Only a cup of


coffee! "


She seated herself at the table and began


recklessly to open, examine, mingle, and scatter


the papers arranged by the notary.


Monsieur Goupilleau had made a sign to


Marc6lite to place herself in a corner.


"Pardon me, Madame," he said to the lady,


rescuing some of the documents, "but these


papers are now in my possession. I am re-


sponsible for them."


"Pooh ! pooh! " She was about to express


further contempt of the admonition, when her


words were cut short by the surprising appear-


ance of her son. He was as much astounded as


she at the meeting, and more confused.













<pb n="250"/>

250       The Drama of an Evening.


"My son! Up at this hour! " She extended


her cheek for his morning salute. " What in the


world do you want here, with Goupilleau? But


what is that - filth? " She got it from her father


to select the strongest and coarsest word, but it


was not entirely inapplicable to Nourrice, who


had followed him in like a spaniel.


The poor old woman started at the voice; her


ears were younger than her eyes. "Ah, mis-


tress ! You do not know me. He has better eyes


than you; he knew me at once! Ah, Madame,


it was not right to sell me, an old woman, a


nurse! I begged you! I begged you on my


knees!"


Madame Montyon, taken by surprise, wavered


under the assault. "Nourrice! Elvire "


"I was old, I was past the age, I was dis-


eased!"


"Will you be silent? " She shook her hand


before the face of the negro. What revelations,


the terror of her motherhood, might not be


impending?


" To sell a nurse! God never intended that! "


The young man stood in close conversation


with the notary.













<pb n="251"/>

The Drama of an Evening.     251


"Eh? What is that, -what is that? " Madame


Montyon unceremoniously thrust herself in be-


tween them.


" Only a little cabin somewhere, little master,


to keep me out of the gutters!" Nourrice,


afraid still of her old mistress, raised her voice


in anxiety.


"What is this nonsense? what is this crazi-


ness?" Madame screamed to her son. To the


old woman: " Will you cease that whining? A


little cabin? A little policeman! "


" My baby I My baby I It's your poor old


Nourrice I"


"But, my son, what have you got in your


head? I never received one cent for her,-not


one cent! Those dishonest Montamats! They


were only too glad of the emancipation! "


The gentlemen had continued their conver-


sation without attention to her. She overheard


some of their words.


" Money! money!"- the clerks in the next


room must have heard her excited voice,- " to


a wretch like that! Never! never! I forbid


it l" She snatched from the notary the paper


he had prepared.













<pb n="252"/>

252       The Drama of an Evening.


"Do you understand, Charles? I forbid it!


I command you to desist! " She launched full


speed into one of her ungovernable tempers.


"A check, tudiezu a check! without my advice!


without my consent! One must have a private


fortune, tudieu! to pension, to squander, to


throw away, - a private fortune ! My money,


tudieu / my money! "


To her son's face arose an expression that


only an intolerable insult could provoke; and


the temper that seized him,- she knew only


too well what that was, if she had not been too


blind to see it. He closed his lips and turned


away.


"Enough!    Come, Nourrice! " The old


woman followed him again; her back - the


strong back he had once ridden for a horse -


bent over nearly double; this time not in play,


but in decrepitude.


He paused at the door and pointed to Nour-


rice. He had also thought of a supreme retort,


an irreparable one: " She was my nurse, given


me by my own mother. You sold her! "


The door had not closed on their exit before


it was opened again.

"Mr. Morris Frank, to see Monsieur Goupil-


leau by appointment," announced the clerk.


The young German, fresh, fair, and rosy, had


to struggle almost as hard to enter an office as a


parlor. "Monsieur," said he, bowing to Mon-


sieur Goupilleau; then, remembering the lady,


"Madame," to Madame Montyon; then he


paused, not knowing whether to offer his hand


or not, until the opportunity passed, and he had


to compose something appropriate to say.


The notary came to the rescue: "Ah, Mr.


Frank! You are a little early, we are not quite


prepared - in fact - "


" But, Goupilleau! what do you mean? You


are going to let Monseiur Frank go without


giving the information? He is a witness, don't


you see, against Deron." Madame Montyon got


this also from her father,-her versatility in


passing from one passion to another.


"As you please, Madame; interrogate Mr.


Frank yourself! "


Monsieur Goupilleau was plainly preoccupied


about some other matter now, but she did not


see it. She put her young friend through a


cross-examination to prove her point of view of













<pb n="254"/>

254       The Drama of an Evening.


the creole character as presented by the distant


Deron.


"There, you see, Goupilleau, I am right!


Monsieur Frank proves everything. All you


have to do now is to make Deron pay."


"One moment, Mr. Frank," said Monsieur


Goupilleau, as the young man was preparing


to leave, "have you any objections to telling


me if your plantation, the Ste. Marie plantation


in the Parish of St. James, was once the prop-


erty of Monsieur Alphonse Motte ? "


The old lady's eyes brightened. She saw a


new claim, a new debt. She looked greedily


at the spread papers, and suspiciously at her


young friend, ready to detect and expose any


subterfuge.


"Motte? Motte? Is there something there,


Goupilleau? Something new? Motte? But who


are they? Motte  Motte!" She kept repeat-


ing the name to start her ear into recognition.


" One of our high-minded, borrow-in-haste-and-


repay-at-leisure creoles? "


Marcelite came from the corner where she


had been waiting.


"Pardon, Madame, pardon," she said, in

eager defence. "Those words should not be 


used to designate the deceased Monsieur Al-


phonse Motte."


"Eh! eh! " Madame Montyon responded


sharply to the assault. "What is this? Whom


have we here? One of the family? "


The quadroon's eyes burned at the insult.


The blood rushed to her head, deepening the


color of her dark skin, reddening her lips, swell-


ing her throat, inflating her nostrils, maddening


her beyond all discretion. She raised her voice


in the impudent way quadroons know so well,


and looked at the white lady with an expression


which, brave as she was, once she would not


have dared.


"Madame is, perhaps, not satisfied; the in-


sults of last night were, perhaps, not enough;


Madame apparently does not mind duels; she


would have one every day. Madame, perhaps,


loves blood, or perhaps Madame thinks Mon-


sieur Henri Maziel cannot fight, or perhaps she


thinks her son has more lives than one; or -"


Even Morris Frank was prompt in the emer-


gency. He caught Marcelite by the arm.


"Silence !"













<pb n="256"/>

256       The Drama of an Evoning.


"Marcelite! " the notary raised his voice in


anger.


"Speak! I command you, wretch      Gou-


pilleau, make her talk, I say! A duel! My


son! "


Physical and verbal violence struggled for


the mastery. Her face changed rapidly from


crimson to white, then to crimson again; her


lips trembled and became blue. She fell into


her chair. Was it apoplexy, or a swoon?


She responded to the quick touch of the


notary.


"Goupilleau! Goupilleau!" her voice was


all anguish, all submission, now. "She says


-she says," pointing in the direction of Mar-


celite -  "My son! - a duel! " She tried to


rise, to pull herself up by the help of the table.


"Wait!" said Monsieur Goupilleau, forcing


her back into her chair. "Do not stir  Not a


word until I return! "


The little man had a manner which in emer-


gencies could rise above occasions and impose


commands on the most exalted.


In the very next room, sitting at one of his


desks, plodding over some notarial copying,

Monsieur Goupilleau possessed the very Su-


preme Court of the Duel, the very infallibility


of the code of honor, - a tall, thin, sallow young


man, behind whose fierce black moustaches


were no front teeth whatever.


"Ah," thought the notary, after the first


glance, " Theodule is silent; Th6odule is mys-


terious; Theodule has on his black coat and


white cravat, -a duel, sure! "


The old lady had laid her head on the table.


Her vigor had snapped. "My money! my


money! " and the retort, "My own mother," -


that was all she could hear from the buzzing in


her ears. What she saw? All she could see;


what, as a soldier's daughter, she should have


better borne. When she raised her face, on the


notary's return, her eyes -her little, strong, bold,


brigadier eyes- were weeping.


" Madame!" It was the sympathy in Mon-


sieur Goupilleau's voice that prepared her for


the worst. " Madame, words spoken last night,


no doubt in an unguarded moment, insults


passed, taxing with dishonor honorable per-


sonages, -under the circumstances, Madame,


nothing is to be done." He shrugged his shoul-

ders hopelessly, just as Th6odule had done.


"Gentlemen, even if they have no money, I


might say particularly if they have no money,


pay their debts of honor.'


"Words spoken last night! but I only said


the truth!"  She began to reiterate them an-


grily, then changed to an attack on the notary.


" Nothing to be done, tudieu I Nothing to be


done! You dare tell me that, Goupilleau,--


me, a mother! " She had strength enough to


rise now, and shake her head at him until


her bonnet dropped to the floor. "You dare


tell any mother that, when her son is going to


fight a duel?"


The " Succession d'Arvil " lay scattered every-


where,--documents folded, unfolded, face up,


face down. She seized one and grasped a pen.


Her fingers had not recovered, nor could her


eyes see clearly; but despite wavering, blots,


and irregularities, the words yet stood out with


sufficient clearness: -


I apologize to Monsieur--  for offensive words


spoken at Madame Fleurissant's ball last night. I


beg him to believe that a moneyed debt is not a debt


of honor.         LOUISE DUPERRE MONTYON.

"Tudieu ! nothing to be done! Goupilleau,


you are a fool! You will see that something is


to be done. Here, supply the name and send it


to that-" and she called Monsieur Henri Ma-


ziel, in French, the name of a man who prepares


ambushes for assassination. "What's that?"


She jerked her head aside from a touch. It


was Marc6lite gently replacing her bonnet, and


examining her face and head with professional


interest.


"Blessed Virgin!" she thought; "what a     /


genius her hairdresser must be!"


"Here, my good woman," said the old lady,


when the bonnet was fastened and the lace veil


dropped, "give me your arm; conduct me


home immediately."


The notary read first one side of the paper,


then the other, scratched over with the hard


terms of some of old Arvil's extortions.


"Ah! " said he, looking around his office,


deserted now of all except the young German,


who was still trying to think of something to say,


something to do.

called .Madame Goupilleau to a


passing servant. " Continue, Sister, continue; I


am listening."


And the low voice of the Sister of Charity


poured forth such a tale of asylum necessities


mingled with asylum gossip, that Madame Gou-


pilleau was carried away again into forgetfulness


of both Marc6lite and the parlor.


" Is it possible! I can hardly believe it f"


The Sister had asked but for one moment in


the corridor, but she had underestimated the

ment of her asylum's particular lack and exhaus-


tion of its particular grievance, did duty recall


with painful jerk the chaperon to her charge.


" Ah! simpleton that I am! and I have vowed


and vowed never to see those tiresome Sisters


again."


She ran along the corridor to save what time


she could, her long skirts rustling after her,


holding her head with both hands and scold-


ing it well. Without stopping she entered


the parlor. Too late! At the first glance she


saw that.


"Tante Eugenie! " exclaimed Marie Modeste


with quavering breath, as if waking from a


dream.


"Madame! " apostrophized Charles Montyon,


hurrying forward to meet her.


"Not a word ! I know it all! It is my fault! "


but she looked at them both reproachfully.


She had planned it otherwise, and far better,-


this scene,- with a minute particularity for de-


tail which only an outsider and a schemer in futu-


rity can command. The young man would come


to her first, of course, with his avowal, as eti-

quette prescribes. She would go to Marie her-


self, and delicately, as only a woman can, she


would draw aside the veil from the unconscious


heart and show the young girl the dormant


figure of her love there, - love whose existence


she did not dream of.


"My daughter," she would say. Ah! she


had rehearsed the discourse too often to have


halted for a word. At any moment of the night


or day her tongue could have delivered it.


" My daughter! " All that as a daughter she had


once craved to hear and been disappointed of,


and all that her exempt mother heart yearned


to utter, she would tell. For she had a mother s


heart, if by an error of Nature she had never /


been a mother.                       -


But the event always fools the prepared.


Now, she knew not what to say or do. She was


in fact embarrassed. It would have been better


to depend upon the inspiration of the moment.


She sank into an arm-chair and fanned herself


with a handkerchief which scented the air with


violet perfume.


" I beg a thousand pardons. I did not intend;


I had no idea-" protested the young man.

That was so; when she was called away they


were conversing about the climate of Paris.


" Tante Eug6nie!" was all that Marie could


murmur; for the dream held her still, - a dream


out of which she could not awake. Her eyes


shone, touched with a new, bright light, and her


white face swam behind blushes, appearing and


disappearing like the moon behind thin clouds.


"She looks adorable, the little one," thought


Madame. "If I could only have got hold of


Marcelite, I would have sent her to chaperon


them."


It was not pleasant to think that the vigilance


which had guaranteed a whole institute of girls


should damage its record in these simple cir-


cumstances. A pest on Sisters and asylums!


"Eh, Mignonne "   She drew the girl to her


to look into those wonderfully brilliant eyes.


It was impossible; the lids closed so quickly,


and the long black lashes fell so thick on the


cheeks, curling up at the ends as if singeing


from the hot blushes, that even burned Ma-


dame's lips pressed against them. The trouble-


some face finally hid itself among the laces on


her shoulder.

what I expected. And you, Monsieur," to


Charles, who was standing close on the other


side of her chair, "you have been indiscreet,


as indiscreet as possible.  You should have

cannot pardon you, at least not immediately.


Have you spoken to Monsieur Goupilleau?"


"Madame, I intended-"


"What! Not even spoken to my husband?


But go downstairs this moment, this instant!


He is in his office."


"I assure you it was unpremeditated - leav-

"Ah! that is what I have always said; those


Sisters do no good, going around from house


to house-"


She was fixed and inexorable; would not


listen to him, would not even look at him, rest-


ing her head against the tall back of her chair,


directing her eyes into vacancy.


Behind her, discretion was again violated


and outraged. The hands of Marie and Charles

purposely, and would not part. The eyes


which had so much to conceal from Madame


had for him abundant revelations, which the


lashes did not hide, from eyes that caused her


lids to rise merely by glances. Her face came


out of the blushes, -a thin, white face in


an oval frame of plaited black hair, the lips


parted as if again in the tremor of caress; -


Madame Goupilleau, with that big back to her


chair, might just as well have been in the corri-


dor again with the Sister.


"Tante Eugenie, I shall go with him. I,


I-" She had to go, for the hands absolutely


would not unclasp.


" My little girl is no more," thought Madame


Goupilleau as they left her alone.  "Well!


Ma bonne !" to Marcelite, who came at last into


the room. "Your young lady is going to make


a fine marriage,- a fine marriage I Tiens ! " in-


terrupting herself suddenly. "I wanted you;


where were you? I called you to go into the


parlor to chaperon. Ah ! - I see now. You


were in connivance! What innocence I have,

good opportunity - "


"At least,--at least, you did not send that


stupid Sister to me?"


"That! No, Madame! On my word of


honor."


" In truth, I believe you capable of anything.


What a rigmarole! the Archbishop and some


Madame Houbi, or Hibou, and a priest of


heaven knows where!   All the while ce beau


monsieur was on his knees to Mademoiselle.


It is old Madame Montyon, however, who will


have something to say," concluded Madame


Goupilleau in thought. " She will beat a tocsin


about our ears."


Madame Montyon, as expected, from the


very first word of announcement resolutely ve-


toed any proposition of marriage between her


step-son, her prospective heir, and a dowerless


bride. When the young man came to her, the


old lady was sitting in her room in the twilight,


going over her accounts, which for conven-


ience and secrecy she carried in her head, - a


pleasant, wakeful occupation, adding dollar to


dollar; watching the pile of gold, the concrete

presentment of her numerous investments, grow


in endless, ceaseless procreation. Her boudoir


was as bare and simple as a soldier's quarters.


There were no more effeminacies of culture or


religion about it than about herself. She had


asked no other assistance from Providence than


a neutral position as to her affairs, which she


managed as her father had his army, without


intermediation of saints or intermeddling of


priests. And no one could deny that her af-


fairs had paid her the compliment of prospering


under the regime.


" No, my son, no! " she reiterated, varying the


formula not in the slightest degree. "Believe


me, I know better than you. The young lady


will not suit at all. In the first place, she has


nothing."


"But, my mother-"


"In marriage there must be something;


money is tangible, money remains; money is


something, in fact-"


"Love?" he said, in a low voice, for it was


novel to him, and he had yet to learn not to


be shy of it.


"Love I Love! That for love I" snapping

effect.


And love was his theme, his inspiration, his


reason; and love was her only dower! But it


was like talking of God to an unbeliever.


" Be reasonable; listen to me! On my word


of honor, as a woman who was not born yester-


day, and who has not lived with her eyes shut,

No! I can never consent."


The rebellious retorts, the marplot of their


domestic intercourse, which always rose in his


heart at the sound of her voice, crowded to his


tongue now, but he had no temper to utter them.


" Love, my dear, it passes like everything, -


only a little quicker." He was standing. She


did not raise her head to him. She was speak-


ing not to him alone, but all men. " Mon Dieu I

again in two years. Ah! don't jump so; don't


exclaim at me that way. It is not my fault. I

for the first time tried to divest her of age,


ugliness, and cynicism. She had been young


once like Marie Modeste. Had she ever lifted


her eyes to a man as Marie did, praying, yet


dreading, his love? Had her warm hands ever


got cold and trembled in the hand of another,


as Marie's did? Had her slim form for one


instant been in the arm of another - could first


love ever be forgotten? Or was there one hu-

"And you think, you think -  And women,"


changing the question, "can they not love?


This young girl, Marie, she loves me, she has


told me so." He laid his hand on her shoulder


to accentuate his whisper.


The old lady's husband had married her for


money, and had widowed her contemptuously


during his life. She answered truthfully.


"If she loves you, all I have to say is that


she will not be more disappointed now if you


do not marry her, than some day if you do."


His hand fell from her shoulder; he turned


away. So old! So gray-haired,-and the widow


of his own father! He had not a word to


say. His dreams and fantasies were frightened


away. How the young are tied and hobbled!


their most innocent plans twisted, turned, 


thwarted by the skeleton hand of a dead father,


or mother, or grandparent, holding a careful


entail of unhappiness and disgrace. And there


is no relief from the heritage! Flash after


flash, illumination came in his brain along the


dark spots of his ignorances, -spots in his


father's and mother's life which thought had


glided over before, which his manhood had

secrets, preserved so far by the miracle which


preserves the simplicity of the young in a se-

"I assure you, my son," his step-mother


changed her voice briskly at the super-impor-


tance of her own business, " I am exceedingly


pleased at the results of the Arvil succession.


It is very good I came to attend to it myself.

"Return to France ?"


"I said, when we return to France. Then

been louder nor more authoritative. He came


around and stood close in front of her chair.


Without thinking, - for his heart gave him no


time,- he spoke, soon changing his tone and his


words, for his audience changed, - the old


woman and the chair fading away, and the


young girl appearing, standing before him as


she did this morning, transforming his defence


into a tribute. It was dark in the room, or his


face would have betrayed the vision. In the


early, powerful moments of first love the real


presence is carried around everywhere, and the


sacrament of communion is celebrated by the


heart, in any place, at any moment.


"Listen! Let me tell you, once for all. A


war had broken over her country. Her father M.


was killed in the first engagement. Her mother


died as soon as the news reached her, - shot in 


fact and in truth by the same bullet. But one


life was spared, a weak, wretched, frail infant, i.


as if by a curse,- a girl to live and grow and  .


develop in a detached condition. Her nurse, 


one of the very slaves about whom the war was


being fought, aided the flight of the panic-


stricken wife from her home on the approach

of a noisy, victorious enemy, and received into


her arms the child which was born an orphan.


Orpanemy mother, is what a child never


utgrows< it is what God himself cannot rem-


edy." His voice took intonations unknown be-


fore to him. "The nurse, a slave no longer,


since she had flown with the infant to this city


in the possession of the emancipationists, took


the child to herself and nursed it,- nursed it


as the Virgin Mary must have nursed her


Heaven-sent babe; nursed it on her knees, in


abnegation, in adoration; lodging it in her room,


which became, not a room, but a sanctuary;


couching it in her own bed, which became an


altar; feeding it, tending it, as imagination can


conceive a passionate heart in a black skin


-tending a white child under the ghostly super-


vision of dead parents. When the child grew


to intelligence of its surroundings, when memory


began, day by day, to weave together frail bits


of history, then a fiction arose as if by incanta-


tion out of the rude, ignorant, determined mind


of the nurse. She placed the child at a school,


that the child's memory could not antedate.


She gave the child a responsible white guardian,

which the child's knowledge could not contra-


dict. She took her forever out of the homely


surroundings which love had made sumptuous


and self-sacrifice holy, but which would event-


ually prove social ostracism. To maintain this


fiction, patience, money, time were needed.


Patience? Did a woman ever need patience


for a child? Was money ever lacking, from


an inferior to a superior? Time,--the good


God gives the same time to the slave as the


free, the black as the white, the ignorant as


the wise, the weak as the strong. Patience fed


the fiction, anticipated doubts, allayed suspi-


cions. Money came in quantities sufficient to


form not a shield, but a pedestal; and time


took the little girl and led her onward and


onward through an education, and through the


experience which brings the necessary ingre-


dients to the formation of a woman's heart


Time protected the fiction to the last moment;


but - the last moment came. The basis of the


young girl's life was suddenly withdrawn, and


truth came, in the fall to the earth. With the


truth came, however, the substance of what


fiction had supposed. To the nurse came two

willing associates. To the young girl, bereaved


by the fiction almost as cruelly as she had


been by the war, came parents,-volunteer


parents. Ah! who could see her and refrain


from loving her? " He stopped breathless.


" He raves," thought the old lady, "like De


Musset! But she did not answer, -perhaps some


hitherto unperceived merits in God's creation of


men coming before her mental vision. She was


only what experience had made her; her theo-


ries, like most women's theories, came from the


heart, not the brain, and she had no imagination


to beautify or make them palatable.


Love is a noxious grass for growth. One


rootlet planted in the heart, and two beings are


soon so tied, tangled, and knotted together by


the miraculous reduplication of perhaps a single


look, sigh, form of face, glance of the eye,


that there is nothing for it but marriage, with


the shortest possible engagement, to get the


trousseau ready in; the creoles, wisely or not,


prefering to apply the test of fidelity to hus-


band rather than lover.


This was in winter. The spring approached,


each day an incendiary to the heart, and all

hymeneal. No one grows reasonable with the


spring. The old lady felt the occult influences


against her, and resented them,-the birds


aggressively lusty, the sky bringing the roses


out until the bushes threatened premature ex-


haustion from wanton prodigality in blooming,


the moon acting like a venal Voudou charm. In


a community where none but dowerless brides


are born, love easily discounts money; and


money was her only capital. She was left more


and more in a helpless minority, fighting hard


to maintain the solidarity of her resolution and


fortune; daily reaffirming the one and intrench-


ing the other by testament and codicil behind


a bulwark of papers proof against the assaults


of present generations, and unborn ones to the  L/


third and fourth degree.


The contract of marriage, her consolation


now, was to be her substitute when she was


gone, an unanswerable rebuke, a certificate of


consent but not approval, a notarial monument


to the wealth and generosity of the step-mother,


the foolishness of the groom, and to all per-


petuity a confession of poverty by the bride. It


is hard to be rich, and a mother at the same time;

but the old lady undertook the task. And while


the young people were learning the necessary


indispensable vocabulary of endearment for fu-


ture intimacy, she applied herself to drawing


with equal security the strings about her heart


and the strings about her purse.


June brought the wedding day; for June


brings more wedding days in New Orleans than


any other month of the year. June by the


calendar, and accredited for the forward month


with hot suns and light showers, had peeped in


upon every moon since December, confusing all


meteorological rules, befooling the silly weeds


as usual, and by unseasonable enticement into


blossoming, losing the fruit-trees their crops.


In the forenoon hours, with their compliments


and presents, came the bridesmaids, - all in one


body, contagious with emotion; exclamatory,


effusive, vibrating from the verge of tears to the


verge of laughter.


"Ah, Marie!"


"Ah, czre !"


"At last!"


"Your wedding day "


"You are well, c/rie?."

" You are not frightened? "


" You do not tremble the least, - the least in


the world?"


" Let me feel your heart! "


" It would paralyze me! "


" Such a beautiful day! "


" A little warm ! "


An unconfessed but patent awe of her held


them aloof. They stood together in a group,


from which their sentences issued spasmodically


in bunches. They had been schoolmates from


their a, b, c class, - most of them; so had the


mothers and grandmothers of some of them.


Since short dresses and socks, mindful of their


destiny, they had promised to be bridesmaids


one to another. Or, death supervening, por-


teuses: to walk in white toilettes and white


veils at the head of the burial procession, as


this evening they intended to do at the bridal.


An office so conspicuously desirable, this last,


that it was made the subject of barter and


bond; a matter of written and sealed docu-


ments, hidden in secret corners of their desks,


-the most precious archives of their school


life, though fluctuating annals of its friendships.

Bride or corpse, how remote Marie Modeste


was already on that road which they could


travel as yet only in imagination.  She was


changing already. Taking the cue from their


relative positions, they spoke disparagingly of


themselves, meanly of their offerings, in de-


spondent voices:-


"Nothing but a souvenir from your old


Fifine."


"You won't forget the dunce of your class


when you look at this, chore?"


" This has no value, Marie, but sentiment."


"Promise not to open this until I leave; it's


a horror."


" You won't mind wearing this for my sake,


Marie, you are so amiable."


" Chtrie, hang this somewhere out of sight,


but keep your faithful Louise in mind."


"I made this myself, for you; that's the


reason it's so ugly."


"A little porte-bonheur for your new life."


"A little vide-poche for your toilette."


"A cushion for your prie-Dieu; 'I implore you


do not look at the stitches! "


" You will not forget us, Marie?"

"You will always be the same to us, Marie? "


"We did n't learn our a, b, c together for


nothing, did we, Marie? "


" And we did n't miss our cosmography to-


gether for nothing, did we, Marie? "


" Do you remember, Marie, when -"


" Or that day-"


They were actually beginning to have a past


to talk about, like their mamans!


" Mon Dieu ! how long ago that is; it seems


like another life."


" Just about a year "


" And Marie the first one married! "


"But you are engaged, Fifine!" they all


cried. Fifine as usual persisted in a denial,


absurd in the face of evidence.


"Well, Marie, I give it to you with all


my heart." (Meaning the honor.) And they


all kissed her again to affirm the sentiment


unanimously. "Ah, you are very fortunate! "


" And he is so handsome, cthre."


"And distingud."


" And such good family."


" Oh, he has everything, - everything."


"Was it a Novena, Marie? "

" If it had not been for that pretty toilette at


Madame Fleurissant's ball! "


" That was the first time you saw him, hein,

" Mon Die ! " in chorus at her assent.


" I told maman my dress was hideous there."


" Three months ago! You kept your secret


well, Marie."


"As for me, I would announce the first


week."


" Like old Maman Birotteau; one hour after-


wards, - one hour, that's positive, - she was in


the street announcing Adelayde's engagement."


" To cut off retreat from the gentleman."


" Poor Auguste! "


" I will never get married, I'm sure."


" Nor I either; I never had any luck."


" If I do not get married, I do not want to

" Nor I, chtrie, candidly."


" Not to get married, is to confess one's self 


simply a -a Gorgon."


"But it's a woman's vocation! What must


she do else?"


"There is always the convent."


"The convent! bah! The convent doesn't

" Non, merci! No convent for me! "


" I would rather comb Saint Catharine."


" Like Tante Pauline? "


"And ,tangle the whole town with your

"My maman was married at sixteen."


"And my grandmaman at fourteen."


"Ah, but times were different then! "


"Women had more chance."


"And men less egotism."


"Frankly, I find men insipid." 


This was too obvious an insincerity to be


taken seriously; even the bride laughed.

"Yes, chirie, we must leave you."

"He should have been blond."


"Brown and brown, that is bad."


"Every one ought to marry her opposite."


"I adore blondes; they look so cold."

"On the contrary, I heard, not a cent."


"But what will Charles do for a living? "


"Work, like other men."


"A Parisian work?" Loulou mimicked his


Parisian accent.


" He is not a Parisian, he only affects it; he

"And she has nothing."


"Not a cent. If old Monsieur Motte had

to their school traditions of his wealth.


Vestiges of winter were still lurking in the


damp, stone-paved corridor, chilling them a


little before they got into the bright street,


where a summer sun shone all the year round.


The chill remained slightly in their hearts as


they walked away, for beauty and youth were


the only dower of most of them, and both -


were fragile; one year already had passed over


their maturity, and patience is not a Creole


virtue. Their aspirations being neither high


nor many, disappointment need only come in


one form, to be effectual.

which custom recognizes as salutary if not


needful, -alone, yet not entirely alone, for she


had the spiritual companionship which comes


in the solemn moments of life to the pure in


heart, and permits them while on earth to feel


if not to see God. A week ago she had passed


her eighteenth birthday. Only eighteen anni-


versaries since her birth! It was little to form


a separation from then and now. Looking


back, she saw them rising, her birthdays, an


ascending plane of mental and physical growth,


until they culminated three months ago. That


date had changed her: she was a woman now.


Over her face had fallen the dignity which over


faces of her type falls without crepuscular inter-


lude, severing them from childhood as from a


day that is past. Her dreaming eyes, wakened


to look on life itself, not illusions fed by the im-


agination, were beginning to fill with women's


wares, all on top and exposed, as good women's


wares are, for the world to see. The inchoate


sentiments that had held the mouth in vacilla-


tion were gone; the lips that had said " I love,"


had found their character and expression. But


the body was still in arrears, still hesitating

over the sure 5rofito of a change, receiving yet  7/


from the long, thin, white gown the curves and

She walked across the room to where the


usual pictures of devotion hung on the walls.


They had answered their purpose in her life,


and were beginning to be useless. Her religion ) $


was no longer to be fed by symbols, but to


produce them.   But as she looked at them,


holding in her hand the little worn prayer-book


that had once belonged to her mother, they


helped her to span the interval that separated


her from her dead parents, -those absent guests


represented only by proxies at all the feasts of


her life. Her mother had once stood this way


in bridal dress, waiting for him who was to


become her husband and Marie's father. The


virgins and sainted women from across the


centuries made the thought plain to her, of


the immensity of eternity and woman's voca-


tion in it. Her heart throbbed and expanded


under her novitiate's dress; she soared higher


and,higher in spirit; she touched immortality


in vision. She felt the protecting hand of God,

had brought a heart for her heart from a dis-


tance, from the unknown, across an ocean! He


had deprived her in youth, and saved the hoard-


ings for a dower of love on her wedding day!


.She hid her face in her hands, to tell Him her


love and gratitude.


Young girls who come into a world already


prepared for them, from their layette to their


trousseau, on their marriage day sit and think


about the wedding banquet preparing for them,


the costly presents, the beautiful dress, the new-


fashioned wreath,-- not of orange-flowers, but


of blossoms more appropriate to the virgin-


ity of the rich, -what they will do after mar-


riage, and what after that, sending their thoughts


along blushing paths maybe too surely blazed


by secret gossip or contraband literature. They


do not feel their destiny like the young girls


who are led along by God Himself,--patiently


waiting in seclusion, poverty, and affliction the


appointed seasons for knowledge, hearing in


silences and darknesses divine notifications, re-


ceiving understanding with the intimations of

futurity; the young girls whom He reserves


for the good of the human race, to mother a


Saviour, or transform the seed of a ploughman


into the soul of a hero.


Marcelite entered the room and stood silently


waiting, looking, thinking how best to carry out


her intentions. "Mamzelle Marie!" She did


not speak as the authoritative nurse to her


charge; she was the humble servant of a future


madame.


" Oh, Marcelite! the thoughts,-the thoughts


one has! " It was so good to lay her head once


more on the shoulder that had cradled her, a


baby! so good to feel that soft, dark hand


caressing her as it had caressed. her all through


life! For a moment she' had felt strange and


lonely in this glimpse of the new, foreign future.


"Marc6lite, do you know what it is to love?


When I think of it, you know, ma bonne, I am


glad that my-that Monsieur Motte did not


live." How happy she must have been to pro-


nounce that name again! "I wanted to die at


first, I wanted it to kill me; but it is all gone,-


that feeling," laying her hand on her heart and


making gratuitous confession. " Think; if he had

lived, it might all have been different. I might


.not have met Charles; and all this love I give


him, and all the love he gives me, - what is the


love of an uncle in comparison? God was right


to manage it that way,- to send you to manage


it for Him. And, Marcelite, all the time I was


studying, I thought it was for my uncle- but I


see now it was forCharles. Everything I did


was for- him. I believe I was born just to


marry him. I am frightened now, when I think


I might have died without it. It is grand to


be a woman. Oh, I feel like a woman now; I


know what it is to be a woman. God has told


me everything." The low voice hardly carried


the words to the nurse's ear, but her breath fell


like the sweetest caresses on the dark skin.


" B/b! Bb/! " was all the woman could


say. Her own marriage in the far-off days of


-   slavery, - what a thing it had been, not to be


mentioned, not to be thought of, before her


white child bride!


"Marcelite, do you think he loves me as


much as I love him?" A question of supreme


importance, requiring a long, rambling, but


never-ending answer.













<pb n="293"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.    293


"Because, Marcelite, what do you do in


life when the one you love does not love


you?"


Although no one in the city, - a city of in-


trigue, -knew better than the hairdresser, she


had nothing to say.


"Marcelite, did my maman look like me as a


bride? And my papa, was he like Gharles? ".


"BdbE, Zozo " Could human beings ever


unite the beauties and excellences she de-


scribed, or eloquence stray farther beyond the


boundaries of truth?


"Their pictures hang on the walls of the


house, there on the plantation; their books,


their furniture - "


Pictures of what had been a pictureless ideal


to her! Her orphan presentment of parents


was no better than the blind one's presentment


of sight.


"One of these days, Marc6lite, you and I,


we will slip away from home - oh, Charles


shall not prevent me! " she blushed and smiled;


she had never smiled that way before she met


him. "We will travel to that plantation; we


will walk through the fields, slowly, easily; we

will come to the gardens; we will go through


them slowly, easily; you will be my guide; we


will creep to the house, slowly, easily; we will


peep through the shutters, and quick! quick!


you will point out the place where those pic-


tures are. Heaven! if I do not die in that


moment, I will tear open the doors, I will rush


in! If there should be dogs about! I hope


there will be no dogs -"


She stopped suddenly. As if it were true,- all


this! As if the nurse would not destroy a world


to please her, or fabricate one to delude her


into security! She knew the woman, and the


extravagances of her heart. Almost, almost


she felt as if she could give up her bridegroom


that it might be true, Marc6lite's story,-her


bridegroom, and all the love that dazzled


around her future like an aureole. She forced


herself away from the thought.


"But what a toilette! What elegance! I


never saw you so fine in my life before! No,


stand still I Let me look at you !" She walked


round and round the nurse. In truth, calico


skirts could not stand out more stiffly, nor a


bandanna be tied into more bows and knots.













<pb n="295"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.   295


Simply to look at the new silk apron made


it rustle.


" What is that you have in your hand? For


me?"


" B/b, you will hide it in your drawer. You


will not look at it, - not yet. To-morrow, next


day."


"Par exemple, I am not to look at anything


to-day, it seems! Well, you for one, -you


reckon without my curiosity."


She laughed as she snatched a package out


of the nurse's hands. She had never laughed


so easily, so merrily in her life. It was like


the laugh of her old school companions, and


sounded novel and charming in her own ears.


"Fifine, Loulou, Tetelle, all said the same


thing. It is too absurd!"


"Zozo ! To-morrow or next day."


"Bah! I am going to do as I please. I am


going to open this. I am going to open them


all, right now. You need not think I do not


know what it is! It is my present, - my wedding


present from you. And I have been expecting


it all day, and I knew you were going to keep


it till the last minute! LJ ! Madame Marcelite

always takes her time! Madame Marcelite


must always produce her effect! Ah, I know


you, you ogre!" And she stopped again to


pass her hands affectionately over the nurse's


shoulders, which stood out like feather pillows.


" Now we will see what it is. A box, a work-


box, a beautiful ndcessaire. Thimble, see! it


fits. Needles, scissors, thread, -evidently I


am to do my own sewing in future. No


more Marc6lite to darn, no more Marcelite to


mend. And another compartment underneath!


A-h !"


The little compartment underneath was filled


with gold dollars. At first one would have


thought it jewelry. The nurse started more


violently at the discovery than the young lady.


" It is what I have saved for you, Bb/!-for


your wedding day, - ever since you were born,


ever since your maman gave you to me."


Looking at the face before her, Marcelite


tested another argument.


For a year she had not ventured to offer her


earnings. She had uncomplainingly borne that


the Goupilleaus should supplant her, the sole


provider heretofore, but now -













<pb n="297"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.   297


"It was your own time, Bdab; I belonged


to you: you have a right to it. Who made 


me your slave? God. Who made me free,


hein "


The girl looked stolidly, mechanically, at the


box in her hand.


It seemed impossible for the quadroon's voice


to become more humble, more pleading; but


the words that followed proved that it could.


"Zozo / You don't mind taking it from me,


from your Marcelite, your nurse, your own


negro. No one will ever know it! I swear


before God, no one will ever know it! B/bd,


you must have a little money, just for yourself,


-when you get married you don't know. You


see, Bbd, they are strangers, they are not us,


they are not Marcelite, they are not you. I


could have bought you something; but I wanted


you to have some money, some picayunes of


your own."


It was hard to understand that the softness


of her breath, the strength of her arms, the


activity of her feet, the chained freedom of her


whole life, could be accepted without dishonor,


and not the money value in coin; hard for the













<pb n="298"/>

girl to understand it, too. Her past life of un-


conscious dependence rose before her, humili-


ating, degrading her. Tears of mortification


came into her eyes; the bright, beautiful day


was tarnished.


" Only for the first few days, Bdbe; after that,


you won't mind taking their money. Oh, it


will all be different after you are married, when


you are his wife. What use have I got for it?


I've got no parents; I 've got no children, only


you! They must n't say you came to them


without a picayune; with only your clothes in


a bundle, like a poor unknown! Whom must


I give it to, if not to you? To negroes? You


think I am going to work for negroes, eh!"


There was something else in marriage than


love? There were distinctions. She had no


money; that made a difference! She was to


take this, acquiesce in what conscience, tradi-


tion forbade, receive money from a negro wo-


man rather than her husband.   For the first


few days - they, the Montyons, were rich; she


was poor.


Gauging effect on the face of Marie, Mar-


celite saw that she was misunderstood, felt that













<pb n="299"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.   299


she had blundered. She had come to the end


of her argument with her cause lost.


"You won't take it! You are going to re-


fuse it!  You despise it!  You would rather


go to the Montyons for money than take it


from me!    I know, I know, it's because I


am black, it's because I am a negro! " She


closed her eyes over the tears, and her mouth


over the sobs that shook inside her huge frame.


It had escaped her,--the first confession of the


galling drop in her heart. Gay, insouciante,


impudent, she had worn her color like a trav-


esty. Who would have suspected her?


"Marcelite! Marcelite! You must not talk


that way! See, I take it, I take it thankfully !


Have I not taken everything from you? You


do me injustice. How can you reproach me?"


But it came too late to appease. The woman


shook her head, flinging the tears savagely from


her eyes.


"No! No! Throw it away! Pitch it out


of the window! They have money,-the Mon-


tyons have plenty of money. Everything I do


goes wrong; no one helps me. Even God will


not help a negro! "













<pb n="300"/>

300      Marriage of Marie Modeste.


There was a rustling of skirts in the hall out-


side, a tap at the door.


"Tante Eugenie!" exclaimed the girl, joy-


fully. "I shall show it to her! She will see


it! She will thank you too!" She bounded


forward with the open box.


"Let her know you take money from me!


Non ! Non I " The situation was reversed.


With an adroit movement of the hand the


quadroon possessed herself of the box and hid


it from Madame Goupilleau, effacing magically


all trace of emotion except in her eyes, in whose


depths feeling seemed to surge and roll like the


billows of the sea after the storm has passed.


"It is time, mignonne ! Come! They are


going to sign the contract now. Oh, you will


understand all about it when you hear it! It is


long, and, ma foi ! perfectly incomprehensible.


It is in my head in such confusion ! Marcelite,


my good woman, go downstairs to the office,


and ask the young gentlemen who are to serve


as witnesses to have the kindness to ascend


to the parlor."


Monsieur Goupilleau, the notary, was clos-


eted in his private office with Mr. Morris Frank.













<pb n="301"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.    301


They had been together the entire morning in


an interview which was the rdsumi of a month's


correspondence and a week's personal inter-


course. The notary, glancing at his watch be-


tween sentences, saw that economy of words


must be practised to conclude within the ap-


pointed time; his face was grave at the reflec-


tion of his miscalculation; perhaps a day or


two more would have saved him the disappoint-


ment of his scheme and still rendere'd feasible


his coup de thddtre, as he called it to himself.


The young German's face was grave also,


graver than the notary's. It was a summary


proceeding,-this thrusting not only a planta-


tion in the balance, but, gently as the notary


put it, a father's reputation also. If his father


had only lived one year longer to answer and


act in his own defence! In embarrassment of


manner and words the young man had repeated


over and over again: -


"Monsieur, I assure you, you do not know


my father. He never made a mistake in his


life."


The notary whose profession was officially


to prevent the depredations of friends and













<pb n="302"/>

302      Marriage of Marie Modeste.


relations upon one another, replied less as a


notary than as a Frenchman,-


"Monsieur, a father never makes mistakes


to a son such as you are."


It was a cruel predicament. The notary held


a letter in his hand; continually referring to it


with his eyes, he continually forbore reading


it aloud.


"To acknowledge what you wish, criminates


my father."


"Restitution is all that could vindicate him."


"There must be some law, some-"


"She is a young girl, an orphan; you a


man, strong-"


A desperate last hope, and the swiftly-passing


time, impelled the notary to seek this adjunct


to his legal argument.


"A   donation?"  The young man asked


eagerly.


" No, sir," - Monseiur Goupilleau drew him-


self up haughtily, -" restitution."


Armed with decision, Monsieur Goupilleau


began to read the letter in his hand, fixing


his eyes resolutely on the paper and throwing


his voice into the official tone of indifference













<pb n="303"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.   303


to human interests, sentiments, and affections


which is the mode of conveyance of notarial


communications.


"You ask me-"


"You have already consulted a lawyerl I


thought it was understood between us-"


"I have sought legal advice in a supposititious


case, from an unquestioned authority," giving


the source. "As you will see, no names have


been mentioned."  Proceeding with the letter,


"'You ask me, Would it be possible, the


owners of a plantation dying, both husband


and wife, the first year of the war, and the nurse


running away with the only heir, an infant, that


the overseer of the plantation could obtain pos-


session of the property and retain it, unmo-


lested, unquestioned, for seventeen years?  I


answer, he could, by chicanery and rascaly-


"Sir! Sir! " The young man rose excitedly


from his seat.


"'If he knew the child was alive. Sup-


pose at the commencement of the war. the


owners of the plantation were in debt to the


overseer, say for wages, the salary of a year or


more. Overseers often preferred letting their

salaries accumulate before drawing them. The


husband enlists, leaving the plantation in charge


of the overseer, -a most natural arrangement.


You say he is killed, the wife dies, the nurse


disappears with the baby. New Orleans was


captured in 1862. A   United States District


Court was established, aving jurisdiction of the


captured territory below the mouth of the Red


River. Now the overseer, by going down to the


ity, if the plantation was in this territory,' -


the Parish of St. James, as you are aware, Mon-


sieur Frank, is within it, -' by going down to


the city and giving information that the owner


of the plantation was a rebel, an officer in


the army, concealing the fact that he was


dead -'"


" Monsieur! I cannot! I refuse to listen! "


Morris Frank's face was red with anger, his eyes


moist with feeling.


The notary continued, slightly hurrying his


words: "' Could have the property seized, con-


demned as the property of a rebel, purchase it


himself at the confiscation sale, paying a nom-


inal price, say five thousand dollars, for it,


which five thousand he would not pay in cash,













<pb n="305"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.  305


but claim as a privileged debt the amount


actually due, and make up the balance of the


price by charges for overseeing, up to the date


of proceedings. He could thus hold the plan-


tation under an apparently legal title. No one


but a child could contest.'"


"And the young lady?"


The notary's time was up. He was overdue


upstairs with the contract.


" That point, I thought, was settled yester-


day," said he, curtly. "Now, I must bid you


good-day." He paused at the door; another


thought came into his brain. For an instant he


was embarrassed, undecided; then, dismissing


his official character, and simply as an old


gentleman with infinite worldly knowledge and


infinite human sympathy, he laid his hand on


the young man's shoulder: " My friend, reflect


for an instant what the condition of the South


would be at this moment were such titles to


property as yours good; and," -his voice


sinking with feeling, -" thank God that by the


Constitution of the United States no attainder


of treason can work corruption of blood or


forfeiture, except during the life of the person

306       Marriage of Marie Modeste.


attainted."  At a better recollection of his


own family history, he said: "Children here


are not punishable for the offence of an an-


cestor." Then, with a pressure of his sensitive


fingers, he continued: "My boy, remember,


restitution involves no confession. Fathers


are but human beings like ourselves; when


they die, the best thing we can do is to


act for them as we wish they might have


acted."


Mr. Frank also left the private office, but he


halted in the next room, sat down at a desk,


and pondered.


"Sir, I assure you, you do not know my


father. He never made a mistake in his life.


He was a man of unquestioned integrity." He


repeated the words over and over again, as if


the notary still could hear them.


Reared in the strictest of ecclesiastical col-


leges, where credulity had been assiduously


fostered and simplicity preserved, his youth


was passed in a calm world of perfect submis-


sion and perfect trust. In his uncritical mind


the visible and invisible world rested on one


vast quiescent billow of faith. His father, his













<pb n="307"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.    307


mother, his plantation; as well question the


saints, miracles, heaven!


The clerks from their desks looked furtively


at him as he buried his face in his hands, - the


face of a man in helpless anxiety of mind. He


had come to the city only three months ago


in a vague search for some unknown pleasure


which his swelling manhood craved,- a pleas-


ure not to be found on the plantation, in the


green fields under the blue sky, not in the


morning rIveille to duty, nor in the tired lan-


guor of the welcome curfew. The luxury which


parsimony had banished from his parents' lives


had descended to him intact, principal and in-


terest, with the inheritance to buy it, - a heri-


tage to spend and a heritage to gratify. The


beautiful young girls at that Fleurissant ball!


His life had never held a ball nor a young girl


before. Oh, the plainest one there would have


been a queen in his home, a houri in his heart!


His home! Which home, -the little white-


washed cabin near the sugar-house, where the


sows littered under the gallery and the mules


galloped by on their way to the stables, -the


home of his birth, the despised overseer's house,













<pb n="308"/>

308      Marriage of Marie Modeste.


exhaling menace, inhaling hatred; or the other


home, the home to which he returned from


college, the master's residence, the beautiful


home which his father had bought for him, with


pictures and books, glass and silver, carved


furniture and silken hangings? "By chicanery


and rascality!"


He had lived in the house, slept in the beds,


studied the books. And the pictures, - ah,


Nature had given him stuch sordid, homely par-


ents ! He had idolized these pictured ladies


and gentlemen. In adoration, he had tried to


fit himself, not for heaven, but for them. He


had tilled the fields as their successor, main-


tained the manor as their heir. "I assure you,


th-ere must be some mistake; my father was


a man of integrity." If he had not integrity,


what had he? Could he, the son, have lived


in that house else? And his father and mother


both slept in the cemetery of these people,--


these Mottes!


Ideals of marriage had come to him during


the long evenings in the quiet house. In fancy


he had often led a bride across the threshold of


it, -a black-eyed, black-haired bride, like the













<pb n="309"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.   309


black-eyed, black-haired women in the pic-


tures; and imagination had gone still farther


beyond, into those far-off dreams that lure the


lonely into domesticity. The tears wet his


fingers at the recollection of them.


Could his father have known of the exist-


ence of the child? That was all the question-


now; the plantation and the money in bank


were a cheap exchange for the redeeming


answer.


Searching weariedly among the commonplace


incidents of his child-life for some saving mem-


ory which would give testimony in favor of the


dead, as one turns and overturns domestic arti-


cles in search of a lost jewel, the figure of a


quadroon woman came suddenly to remem-


brance, clear and distinct,- clearly and distinctly


as her voice now sounded in the doorway.


" Monsieur requests the presence of the gen-


tlemen who are to act as witnesses."


Two of the young clerks, in gala dress,


who had been scratching their pens sedulously


in feigned indifference to the honor, rose with


alacrity.


This was the woman who had run away with

310       Marriage of Marie Modeste.


the child! Morris Frank arrested her, seized


her by the wrist, and drew her in through the


door of the back office. With an old instinct


of fear she resisted and struggled. His father,


the overseer, had not handled her color too


softly.


" For God's sake let me go! What do you


want? I have n't done anything! " she cried.


" Tell me, tell me the truth about that child,-


about that baby! "


He questioned, he cross-questioned, he twisted


and turned her answers.


"As there is a God in heaven, it's the truth!


As the blessed Virgin hears me, it's the truth!


Ask Monsieur Goupilleau, ask the priest, ask


old Uncle Ursin on the plantation, - they all


know it! Mr. Frank, Mr. Morris, you are


not going to harm her! I kept it from you;


I would have died before you found it out


'   from  me!   She does n't know it! No one.


knows it!"


The same old terror of causeless violence that


had made her a fugitive eighteen years ago pos-


sessed her again, sweeping away reason and


presence of mind, making her believe, with the













<pb n="311"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.     311


barbarous anticipations of ferocity which had


survived civilization in her, the tragic fate of


the parents as immanent to the child.


" You swear it is the truth? "


" On the cross, on the Blessed Virgin, on the


Saviour." All that was sacred in her religion,


all that was terrific in her superstition, she in-


vocated with unhesitating tongue to attest a ve-


racity impugned with her race by custom and


tradition.


It is not pleasant reading, -a marriage con-


tract: stipulations in one clause, counter-stip-


ulations in another; so much money here, so


much money there; distrust of the contracting


parties, distrust of the relatives, distrust of the


unsophisticated goodness of God himself, who


had trammels of every notarial variety thrown


across any future development of trust and con- 


fidence.  There were provisions against fraud, 


deception, indebtedness; provisions against


change, indifference, enmity, death, remarriage,


against improper alliances of unborn daughters,


against dissipation and extravagance of unborn


sons, - provisions for everything but the contin-

uance of the love which had waxed and grown


to the inevitable conclusion of marriage.


It was a triumph of astuteness on the part


of old Madame Montyon. She sat on the sofa


nodding her head and purple-flowered bonnet,


at each clause repeating the words after Mon-


sieur Goupilleau with great satisfaction.


" Ah, mon Dieu !"   Mademoiselle Angely


sighed at the end of it, not knowing anything


more appropriate to do or to say.


"Those marriage contracts, - they are all


against the women, the poor women! That


is the way with Eugenie there. Old Lareveil-


lere made a marriage contract against her; she


had nothing of her own, and all her life there


he has held her." Tante Pauline pressed her


right thumb expressively against the palm of


her left hand.


"At the last moment I thought," said Ma-


dame Montyon to herself, "that Goupilleau


would have given her something; but that was


not like a notary, nor a Goupilleau."


"If I had succeeded in my plans," thought


Monsieur Goupilleau, "the favor would have


been all the other way."













<pb n="313"/>

Marriage of Marie Modeste.    313


"Pauvre petite chatte !" thought his wife, as


a last resource of consolation, "at least her 


children will be secure."


"We will now sign it," said the notary.


"But I must go for the bride," prompted


his wife.


They seemed to have forgotten her com-


pletely in their excitement over the settlement


of so much property and money, -both her


and the young man who stood unheeded, un-


consulted, in the corner of the room; his own


insignificant personal capital of youth, hope,


strength, love, honor, ambition, unmentioned


in the elaborate catalogue prepared by the


step-mother. It was all valueless as an en-


dowment. Like an automaton he had been


provided for and given over to his childish


foible for a wife.


The noise of the street invaded the parlors,


but genteelly and discreetly sifted of impurity


by the fine lace curtains at the end windows of


the long narrow room. The half-closed shutters


gave oblique views of the gallery, with its iron


balustrade and canopy, and rows of plants thriv-


ing luxuriantly. They had only contracted pots

for root, but the whole blue heavens for foliage.


There reigned the gentle obscurity which the


people of the climate affect, -an obscurity that


flatters rather than conceals the physiognomy,


and tones the voices in soft Creole modulations.


The green-glazed marine monsters of a tall Pa-


lissy vase collected the few entering rays of


light, and rose a beacon over an invisible cen-


tre-table, which carried an indistinct collection


of velvet-cased miniatures, ivory carvings, Bohe-


mian glasses, and other small objects, which in


Monsieur Goupilleau's days of extravagance


gratified the taste for bric-d-brac.


There was a lull in the conversation. The


occupants of the chairs and sofas devoted them-


selves to their fans and handkerchiefs, or put


on eye-glasses to solve the enigmatical pictures


hanging in oblivion, within gilt frames, on the


walls. The moments of Madame Goupilleau's


absence were slow, dry, and detached. What


was said was hurried, indifferent, in an under-


tone, mere packing-paper to fill up space, each


volunteer fearing to be caught with a truncated


word or an unfinished smile on the lips,--the


women of course alone risking it.

"Eugenie's rooms are really beautiful! "


"Can you see what that is in the corner?"


"An etagare."


"Ah!"


"I never noticed that lamp before."

"Right here at your elbow, on the table."


" Carcel ."


"And cise' brass! "

"I believe I feel a draught! "


" Mon Dieu! where?"


"Change your seat."


"There in the corner is a fauteuil."


"Who is that old skeleton? "


"Armand Goupilleau's confidential clerk! "


" Ah! "


"He will have to read the contract all over


again! "


"Of course; the bride did not hear it! "

death to break it."

( Poor little thing! "


"How pale she is! "


"And so frail! "


" Just like her mother."


"H'sh! they are going to begin "


"Heavens! What a glare!"


"It is barbarous! "


Monsieur Goupilleau's confidential clerk was


to repeat the deed,- an old man with sight


almost beyond recall of double glasses. He


stood as near as possible to the coveted day-


light of the outside world, against the window,


holding the paper as close to his eyes as his


long thin nose would permit; it was still too


far off for smooth reading. Profiting by the


confusion succeeding the entrance, he slyly laid


his hand on the shutters to widen the crack of


light by the merest trifle; at a touch they all


fell open from top to bottom, letting the sun


in like a flash of lightning, striking them all


with sudden distinctness, brightening the writ-


ten page into delicious legibility.  Before a


countermanding order could be issued, before


the bride could be seated, he began the lecture,


overriding the protests of the ladies with his un-

human mechanical voice, cracked by use, ignor-


ing the opened fans used as screens against his


end of the room.


The young girl stood where she was. The


sun falling across her head increased the fair-


ness of her face and the blackness of her hair.


She held her hands clasped before her, and


seemed with eyes as well as ears listening to


the terms on which she was to be admitted to


the, professioni of her love. In the last hours


of her innocent, unconscious girlhood she was


pathetic, pitiful, to 'the ladies, who shed furtive


tears. The gentlemen, at sight of her, felt a


stirring in their hearts and conscience, or


maybe the eyes of the married women present


resurrected a primitive, latent, effete distrust of


themselves, - a remorseful sense of unworthiness 


as conceded possessors of the other sex.       t


After the reading had ended, Marie Modeste


still listened and thought, trying to make her


head speak as distinctly as her heart had done.


"You will have the kindness to sign your


name here, Mademoiselle," said the old clerk,


delighted with his window evolution and the


fluency of his rendition of the contract.

The young men from the office pressed for-


ward alertly, under fear of the awful possibility


of being overlooked. The ladies and gentle-


men rose from their seats, and all advanced


toward the centre-table, where a space was


being cleared for the signing.


The young girl took the pen, which had been


dipped in ink, and waited for the papers to be


straightened out and pressed flat.


"Here, on this line, Mademoiselle." She


placed her hand where he pointed, and bent


over.


"No! no!" she cried, straightening herself,


holding the document in her hand. Her face


became red as she heard her weak, thin voice


trying to raise and steady itself to audibility in


the room full of strange faces.


"No! no! I cannot sign it! I will not sign


it! I do not wish it! I refuse! I give noth-


ing, I will take nothing, - nothing! "


She forced her lips, trembling convulsively,


to utter what was resolutely being proclaimed


in her breast.


"I give nothing but love! I want nothing


but love! " and the elaborate act, the notarial

work of a week, fell in long thin strips to the


floor.


There was a sudden decline in the value of'


bonds and stocks and landed investments;


Madame Montyon's hillock of gold disappeared


for once from before her eyes, leaving them


staring at blank poverty.


" Tudieu ! Tudieu /" she swore, in her un-


whisperable voice.


"The marriage broken! Ah, I knew it!"


exclaimed Tante Pauline.


" Eugenie! Eug6nie! " Mademoiselle Aurore


Angely pulled Madame Goupilleau's gown.


"But look at them! Stop them! 'It is not


proper! It is not convenablel "


It was against etiquette which had held him


in strict quarantine for twenty-four hours; but 


the young groom broke from his corner and his


passiveness, as unrestrained as if the wedding


were past and not to come, and his bride, turn-


ing, received him as if she had all the money in


the world and he not a cent. Their embrace


made all hearts and lips envious.


Mademoiselle Angely would have had to


acknowledge at the confessional that it was not

so much because it was shocking as because it


was a sin, that forced her to turn her back on


them.


The officious young witnesses sprang to the


floor to gather up the fragments of the contract.


The confidential clerk, as . deaf as he was


blind, and equally conscientious, after showing


the place on the document and giving the pen,


was intent only upon closing the shutters as


he had found them, and as slyly. The room


passed again, without warning, into darkness,


granting, until the eyes accommodated them-


selves to it, momentary shelter to the lovers and


relief to the spectators.


"Ah! she's a fool all the same! " Tante


Pauline found time to say.


"Come! " said Morris Frank, "take me up


there, - instantly! "


Grasping the quadroon by the wrist, he fol-


lowed up the stairs, through the hall, into a


dark room separated by a portikre from the


parlor. Pushing aside the faded red and yellow


damask, he stood, hearing, seeing all. The

flesh and blood, the face, of his pictured hosts


in the old plantation home! The black-eyed,


black-haired girl! What did she need more


than love for a dower? And her lover? What


other capital did he need besides the strength


of the arms that clasped her? They would de-


spise him, insult him, condemn his father, vilify


his memory, - the usurper of a home!


"Speak! speak! for God's sake, speak!"


whispered Marcelite at his side. She was afraid


he would change his mind.


He had dreamed and basked under the eyes


of her kindred, while she had been the pro-


tigle of a negro woman ! Oh, the years beyond


recall !


Would they dig up his father and mother, and


cast them out of the pilfered grave?


Her father and mother, - where were they


buried? What would he do with himself with-


out a home, without a plantation, without a pro-


fession, without, -yes, without a reputation?


" Speak! speak! " muttered Marc6lite.


"Ladies and gentlemen! " No, they had


nothing to do with it. " Mademoiselle! " He


crossed the room, pushing aside those in his

way; if they had been alone he would have


knelt to her.


"Mademoiselle! it is all there waiting for


you, ready for you, -your plantation, your ser-


vants, your home, the pictures, the books, the


silver; there, just as your father left them to go


to the war, just as your mother left them to fly


to her death. Let me make restitution, let me


make atonement; but oh, let me implore for


the dead, -my father!" He looked so tall


in the midst of them; in his emotion, his stiff,


awkward language, so boyish! His ingenuous


eyes were fixed on her face in simple, earnest,


humble devotion, as many an evening he had


fixed them on the po. traits at home.


With swift, sure impu ,e, the quadroon woman


put herself before him, took the words from his


mouth, crazy as she was at the moment.


-- "It was myif ault, Monsieur!" to Monsieur


Goupilleau. " He did not know it! His father


did not know it! I swear that old Monsieur


Frank did not know it! I sent word myself


that the baby was dead.   Old Uncle Ursin


knows it's the truth; ask him. Monsieur Frank


sent him to me. I made him lie. My God!

I didn't know any better. I thought the Yan-


kees would kill her too! "


Was it truth, or falsehood? There was no


one to certify or convict. Old Uncle Ursin?


He had been found dead in his bed before


Morris Frank left the plantation.


"It is all there, and in bank," the young man


continued. The bank-book was in his pocket;


he got it, handed it to Monsieur Goupilleau.


"You will find the amount-"


He mentioned it quite simply and naturally,-


the amount which year after year had been


growing in the bank, the result of many a day's


hard work, the savings from a life's self-denial


and parsimony. It was a fortune to astonish


the little room, to strike even the women dumb.


He thanked Heaven, as he mentioned it, that the


spendings had been trivial.


"I never suspected it, I grew up unconscious


of it. The woman, Marcelite, saw me at the


ball; she told Monsieur Goupilleau. Mademoi-


selle, your marriage contract would have been


different if-if I-"


But Monsieur Goupilleau would not allow


any more explanation. It was a coup de th&dtre

serted him, his eyes blinded his spectacles.


Frenchman as he was, if he could have been


granted a son then and there, it would have


been the young German, the overseer's boy, he


would have chosen, as he told him over and


over again, or tried to tell him.


"It is she who is too good for him,


now," whispered Tante Pauline to Mademoi-


selle Aurore.


" Hein! She is a partie, after all !" Madame


Montyon felt elated, for she flattered herself


that it was she who by her determination had


forced the hand of Providence. "I am going


to have an angel for a daughter-in-law."


" Flix! Felix! " cried Mademoiselle Aurore,


clasping her hands. "What can you say now


against the good God? That superb plantation


in St. James! " For the plantation was known


all up and down the coast, and the fame of


the Frank management was a State affair.

books, the furniture! You   didn't believe


me! You thought I was lying -"


"That quadroon will raise the roof off the


house," said Tante Pauline; "when they begin


their noise, there is no stopping them."


" Monsieur Morris," - Marcelite threw herself  /


before him, -" let me work for you, let me be


your slave -"


" Mignonne ! Mignonne " expostulated Ma-


dame Goupilleau with Marie. "You must not

child, it is all true! Do you not hear Charles,

with your screaming. "Non, Monsieur," to


Charles, "to-day she is still mine; to-morrow I


will not dispute her with you. Armand, my


friend," to her husband, " send them all away,


get rid of them, we must have some repose


before the ceremony."


".Well, Goupilleau," said the Madame Mon-


tyon, composing her face after a pinch of snuff,


"we are to have all our trouble over again I "

stumbled against Marctlite. "Eh! my good


woman!" My good woman! He raised her


from the floor and held both her hands. " It is


admirable, it is. sublime. Why do you weep?


He could not have done it better himself, -


your Monsieur Motte! "


It was not Madame Goupilleau, but Marcelite,


who walked behind the bride that night to the


altar, for so Marie Modeste had commanded.


It was not to Madame Goupilleau, but to Marce-


lite, that the bride turned for her first blessing


after the ceremony. It was not Madame Goupil-


leau, but Marc6lite, who folded away the mar-


riage garments that night. It was not from


Madame Goupilleau, but from Marcelite, that


Charles Montyon received his bride. It was not


Madame Goupilleau, nor any other woman, but


Marctlite, who in her distant, unlighted room


watched the night through, shedding on the


bridal wreath the tears that only mothers shed


on bridal wreaths of daughters, praying the


prayers that only mothers pray on the wedding


nights of daughters.

Time still carries on the story, life still fur-


nishes the incidents; there is no last chapter to


the record. The intercepted inheritance has


come to the rightful heir, but it has not de-


parted from the young German. Morris Frank


had claims which not he, but Monsieur Gou-


pilleau, asserted. He is part owner of the Ste.


Marie plantation, sole manager; his crops rival


the celebrated ones of his father; his yield of


cane leads the statistics of his State. The old


house he loved is still his home,-the home


too of Marie Modeste, her husband, her chil-


dren, and Marcelite.


They all live well, happily, prosperously to-


gether; for in giving hearts, God assigned


destinies.

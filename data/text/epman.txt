K!D        i' "Of course," he began again with a
catch in his breath, "this is, as I said,
a monstrous story. But I should like
to be able to say something about it."
"Have you ever seen this - this fab-
ulous creature?" asked Joan, with curl-
ing lip.
"No! God forbid! No!"
"Has anybody else ?"
" You know," suggested Douglas
Ray, with a merciful but pitiful attempt
to be jocular, "that phrase people use
in the country, ' There are those that' -
There are those that affirm some such
preposterous legend, Joan."
" And you," demanded Joan, " what
have you said ?" 
"I have said," replied Ray, "every-
thing that a man can say in behalf of a
woman, without injuring the woman.
I have done everything except to kick

the whole village into the sewer. But
I thought I had - I think I have the
right to your confidence. I am here to
ask for it."
" I have none to give you," answered
Joan. " I have nothing to say. If my
life and my character cannot defend
me from this thing, no man can -or
shall," she added through set teeth.
" I thought if you would take Mary
Caroline back ?" pleaded Ray, "or send
for some elderly female relative? or do
something to put a stop to this thing?"
" I can do nothing," answered Joan,
"to put a stop to it."
" Not even offer me some explana-
tion ? Something I could say ?"
" I have no explanation to offer you,"
she repeated monotonously. " Not even
if you do not trust me any longer. I
cannot help that. You need not unless

you want to. There is no reason why
I·           you should trust me unless you choose.
;I |I have no claim upon your confidence,
Douglas, except that you have known
me a good while--and that you did
love me."
Her voice trembled almost imper-
ceptibly upon the last three words, but
her eyes were staring bright and dry.
Then swiftly, with a heart-breaking,
sweet smile, she held out her hand.
"Good-night," she said, " good-by."
"I will say good-night," he an-
swered, "but I will never say good-
by."
He offered her no caress, but took
the hand she lent, and held it mightily
in both of his; then bowed his face
upon it and staggered to the door.
"Don't mind it so, Douglas," pleaded
Joan. "It cannot -  it cannot be

helped  I am sorry, but I am not
ashamed."
As unconsciously as her shadow fol-
lowed her, the woman in that vital
moment had followed her lover. Both
had now crossed the threshold of the
library. His hand was upon the knob
of the door, when the red hall light
flared in some sudden draft. While the
two stood there mute and miserable, a
footfall clicked distinctly somewhere
overhead.
"There!" cried Ray. "What is
that ?"
" It might be Martin Luther," sug-
gested Joan, with composure.
But as she spoke these words, there
reverberated from hall to hall and from
wall to wall of the silent house a
muffled hollow noise. It was the sound
of a man's cough.

CHAPTER V
- - ASK T the time of our story
i  I _  the church terrestrial in
the town of Mapleleaf
was like the church ce-
lestial of religious hope
and dream -it was one and indivisi-
ble. With a fine unconsciousness of
any other existing sect The Denomi-
nation represented ecclesiastical Chris-
tianity to an incurious acceptance. The
people, untempted by any other, took
their inherited polity as a matter of
course, and the Protestant community
referred to their religious organization
with the tone, if not the accent, of good
Catholics. One said The Church. To-

day there are five in Mapleleaf. Then
there was only the complacent, com-
monplace edifice which sat back in the
square as easily as a commuter in a car
seat. Had the building not been of
wood, and painted a chilly brown, it
would have failed to meet the sub-
urban architectural ideals at that day in
vogue.
In fact, the church met most of the
suburban ideals  these were not ex-
acting -and received in return the
unqualified allegiance of people who
regarded their church as a soul insur-
ance corporation, and their pastor as a
species of religious clerk or agent hired
for spiritual occasions to make out the
policies. In a word, the little Congre-
gational parish of Mapleleaf was a large
force - the strongest in the town. In
it were vested the moral and social
o09



<pb n="110"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
codes. Out of it went the written and
unwritten law. Its fiat was irretrieva-
ble. There was no appeal from its ver-
dict; whether it educated saints or
cultivated sinners, whether it had in-
spirations or made mistakes, whether
it represented God's heart or man's
stupidity, it represented power. One
might as well fling one's self before the
fender of the green car blurring down
the hill before one could read its num-
ber, as oppose one's self to the judgment,
the will, or the tradition of the village
church.
Nevertheless, and in spite of the ab-
solute oligarchy which handed the pas-
tor his salary four times a year on
quarter-day, the parish of Mapleleaf
had in its pulpit a man.
The Rev. Eliakim Cotton was an
elderly man, as we have said; there was
I10

THE MAN IN THE CASE
snow on his hair, there was fire in his
eye, there was sun in his smile. He
represented the notable instance of a
New England minister who was not
afraid of his people. When he had oc-
cupied the parsonage with the hundred-
foot lot and the concrete walk for five
years, the usual movement to exchange
a pastor whose virtues you know for
one whose faults you do not know was
accidentally omitted from the politics
of the congregation--who could say
why? - and Mr. Cotton, holding over
that mysterious danger line, had re-
mained where he was. He had now
been the minister of Mapleleaf for
twenty years.
Some ten months from the date of
the last chapter which we have re-
corded in the biography of Joan Dare,
the Rev. Mr. Cotton sat in his study
III



<pb n="112"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
with iron on his lips, and trouble in his
eyes. His committee sat with him-
five in number: two deacons, the clerk,
the theological member, and the rich
member.
The minister was in his study chair
before his old walnut desk; this showed
the precision of a methodical man.
No letter went astray, no paper played
truant, no book lolled upon that sacred
surface; the pens rested in their rack
with an air of infinite leisure; only his
blotter showed the signs of work, and
that was black with it.
The room was brown and ascetic.
The ragged carpet was darned, the
faded furniture was patched, but the
large bookcases were full. Above the
mantel hung an old-fashioned lith-
ograph of Cromwell preaching to his
pious soldiers. Behind Mr. Cotton's

chair John Calvin, seeming almost as
large as life, and quite as shocking,
gasped forever upon his death-bed.
One was therefore surprised that a
photograph of Da Vinci's Christ was
fastened to the revolving bookcase,
close within the minister's reach; this
occupied such a position that his eyes
constantly met it.
The theological member (who had
just been speaking) followed the min-
ister's glance; but it was not apparent
that he saw the picture. The rich
member looked at his watch; he felt
that he was wasting time; there was
no money to be made out of the occa-
sion, and, it seemed, no progress either.
The rich member frowned at the
dilatory nature of these ecclesiastical
matters; a man of affairs would have ac-
quitted or condemned the accused, and

I greatly regret the necessity of action
upon it."
"What would you do ?" asked the
senior deacon uneasily.
"That's it ! That's it! " cried the
rich member. "What will you do?
Put it that way. Put it in any way,
only do something, gentlemen! Make
a move! Make any move and I'11
second it."
" I move," suggested the theological
member, " that a committee of three
be appointed to visit the accused, and
confer with her as to the nature of her
offense."
"Second the motion! " said the rich
member, getting to his feet. "Why
not this evening? What's the use of
wasting time? Time, gentlemen, is
always above par."
"These rumors are an injury to the

been done with it, an hour and a half
ago. In point of fact the minister and
his committee had been in executive
session behind locked doors for two
hours, and had come to no agreement.
Within the incumbency of the present
pastor no similar case had come before
the attention of the church of Maple-
leaf. The senior deacon could not re-
collect that he had ever been called
upon to discipline a member for an
important offense.
( She has been in regular standing a
good while," he sighed. "If I am cor-
rect, she made a profession when she
was in early youth. She still attends
Divine Service and the weekly confer-
ence of prayer."
"It is an extraordinary case," observed
the junior deacon. " I never knew one
like it. I deeply deplore it, brethren.
I 14

THE MAN IN THE CASE
church," argued the theological mem-
ber. "It is common scandal. It is a
very serious matter."
"( She always has borne an unblem-
ished reputation," argued the junior
deacon timidly. His eyes met those
of the minister, which had assumed
a stern expression. At this point some
one proposed that the pastor should
become one of the committee selected
to confer with the offending mem-
ber.
" I decline," said the Rev. Mr. Cot-
ton shortly. " I absolutely decline to
have anything to do with such a step.
You know my opinion, gentlemen. I
have expressed it to you repeatedly. If
you hound down this unhappy woman
you will do it without my approval or
my sanction. I have explained my po-
sition in this matter to you till there
ii6



<pb n="117"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
is really nothing more for me to say
about it."
" Have you ever reasoned with her
yourself, sir," asked the theological
member, "as to the nature of her
offense ?"
" I have said everything to her that
I can properly say," replied the pastor
gravely.
"Does she offer any explanation or
-exculpation of her conduct?"
" Neither. None whatever."
"You defend her   in face of the
facts, do you ?"
"I do not understand the facts, sir.
Do you?"
"But," persisted the theological
member, "the question is, do you de-
fend her conduct?"
" Her conduct is a mystery," replied
the minister. " But her spotless char-

<pb n="118"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
acter is her advocate. I will not arraign
her for I don't know what. The only
Christian course to pursue, in my opin-
ion, is to let the poor girl alone. Time
may justify her against these unfortu-
nate suspicions. I say time should be
given her. If we don't trust her, who
will? If we show her no mercy, who
should ?"
The clerk, a little silent man who
had scarcely spoken, now  observed
tentatively: "The offending member
should first be visited, as our polity
requires, in a friendly capacity by one
or two fellow-members. She should
be approached in a friendly manner,
before she is officially censured."
"This has already been done," said
the minister sadly. " Some ladies of the
congregation have called upon her; my
wife was one of the number, and Mrs.

<pb n="119"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
Hammerton; I grant you that this
difficult duty has been performed with
as much delicacy as the case admits of.
Ecclesiastically I own that you are free
to act, in this case, gentlemen, if you
insist upon it. My advice is against it,
that's all. If you prefer to talk it
over," he added, "wyithout me, sup-
pose I give you the opportunity ?"
" That might be advisable," replied
the senior deacon thoughtfully, " even
if it is a little out of order. It won't
take us long, Mr. Cotton. We'll call
you."
"Very well," assented the minister.
He rose at once and left the room; he did
not seek his wife; they had talked this
thing out till there was nothing more
to be said; the minister had been forced
to observe that Mrs. Cotton underwent
variations of this painful theme; he
119



<pb n="120"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
could not at any given crisis in the
affair predicate that her opinion would
or would not coincide with his own.
He paced the oil-cloth of his little dark
entry hotly till his committee recalled
him.
"Well, gentlemen ?" he began.
But he saw before they spoke that
they had decided against him. The
elderly minister had never played lackey
to his committee. But he knew them.
He made no idle attempt to dissuade
them from their purpose, but seemed
rather suddenly to fall into step with 
it.
"I see that you intend to act in this
matter. Perhaps it is as well," he said
unexpectedly. "It will satisfy you.
And it won't"   but he paused. He
could not say that the official censure
of her church would not harm the

THE MAN IN THE CASE
arraigned church-member. He con-
tented himself with asking the sub-
committee to report the result of their
effort at once, and, when they had
hurried over the necessary formalities
which intervened, the clerk, the senior
deacon, and the theological member
put on their hats and went out.
In a short time-a very short time
- they returned.   "
It was a warm September night, and
one of the study windows was open.
The committee, as they came up the
concrete walk, saw the tall figure of
their minister pacing the floor with an
unendurable nervousness. The junior
deacon, who was not a nervous person,
sat reading the denominational weekly.
The rich member was casting up ac-
counts in his pocket diary. These two
I21



<pb n="122"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
men got to their feet at once, and the
minister ran like a boy to open the
front door.
"Gentlemen," he began eagerly,
you made a short call."
" Long enough," snapped the senior
deacon. "Too darned long in my
opinion."
Now history recorded not in that
parish the time when the senior deacon
had been heard to say "darn." The
minister allowed himself a secular
laugh.
"We must appoint a committee to
call on you, my brother," he suggested
pleasantly. Then herepeated his phrase.
"Well, gentlemen ?"
He turned the key in the study door,
and the six church officers confronted
each other for a moment in silence.
The gravity of their position now
I22



<pb n="123"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
urged itself upon the lightest of them;
and none of them were careless men.
"Well ?" reiterated the pastor.
"I move," said the senior deacon,
"that we proceed with the case. It
should come before the church."
"I second the motion," said the
theological member eagerly. "It is a
clear instance of falling from grace."
"Our sister seems to me to be a sad
woman," ventured the little clerk.
"And a comely. I regretted our er-
rand when we had accomplished it."
" I did not," said the senior deacon.
"We were not received in a proper
manner."
"May I ask," inquired the pastor,
"how you were received?"
"As if she had been the Queen of
Heaven, sir. She had that -that gen-
eral appearance, sir."
123



<pb n="124"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
; "She gave no evidence of conviction
of sin," said the theological member.
"She had a beautiful collie with
her," deprecated the little clerk.
"A vicious dog," urged the theolo-
gical member. "He snapped at me
twice."
"She did not even ask us to be
seated," complained the senior deacon.
The pastor bit off an unsanctified ex-
clamation between his teeth. There
dashed before him a flashlight of the
scene-that desolate, delicate woman
- those three well-meaning, stupid
Christians  the insolent nature of
their errand--they men, all men !
" There should have been a woman
among you if you had to go !" blazed
the minister.
"The polity of our church does not
place females upon the governing

<pb n="125"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
board," the theological member re-
minded him.
" Then it ought to ! " cried the elderly
minister, "and I have been preaching
forty years and never thought of it till
this minute." 
The Rev. Eliakim Cotton was a
man, as we have said, and for a mo-
ment's span he could have cried
" Shame !" upon his ecclesiastical of-
ficers. But he had the graciousness of
his wide experience, and of his large
heart, on which saint and sinner both
must lean.
"They think they are doing right,"
he thought. "They, too, must be led."
His closed hand relaxed; it fell upon
the open Testament on his study table.
He wheeled in his chair, and turned
his pale face instinctively towards the
Leonardo's Christ. He did not look
125



<pb n="126"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
at Oliver Cromwell; and John Calvin
was behind him.
" My brothers," he said gently, " be-
fore you decide this question I should
like to say a little more about it."
Then the Rev. Eliakim Cotton be-
gan to talk.
It was then well after nine o'clock.
It was past ten when the church officers
left the study, and quietly separated
for the night. When the door closed
upon the last of them (it happened to
be the theological member) the Rev.
Mr. Cotton ran to the foot of the stairs
and eagerly called his wife:-
"Maria? Maria! Come down, please.
I want you to accompany me on an
errand of Christian mercy."
"Where ?" asked Mrs. Cotton, "and
what for?"
She stood in her wrapper, with her
126



<pb n="127"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
arms upraised; she was putting her
gray hair in crimping-pins for the
night.
"We are going to Joan Dare's at
once - immediately. Come, Maria !
Put your things on, won't you ? I will
explain on the way over."
"I 've got a headache," urged the
minister's wife.
The minister whirled on the heel of
his well-worn boot.
"Very well," he said. "Then I
must go without you."
"Oh, but you can't do that. It
would n't do, Mr. Cotton. You would
be talked about."
" When I'm afraid of being talked
about," returned Mr. Cotton slowly,
"I will give up preaching. I suppose
if I went to hell after a lost soul the
parish would talk about it. But my
127



<pb n="128"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
parish knows I should go if I thought
I ought to."
( You put me in a hard position,"
complained Mrs. Cotton, "and it would
take me so long to dress- Eliakim ?
Eliakim!"
But the Reverend Eliakim Cotton
had left the house. He walked rapidly,
squaring his bent shoulders; he held
his gray head high; his thin hands
hung clenched at his sides. He had a
headache, too, though he had not men-
tioned it, and his eyes were tired and
strained. As he walked, these tricked
him somehow, for the picture on the
revolving bookcase appeared to move
and swing before him through the
deserted streets of Mapleleaf. Now in
darkness, then in light - now with a
tremor on the lip, then with a tear on
the cheek-the saddest and the strong-

est Christ of all that art has offered
Christianity followed the old pastor all
the way.
The lights were still burning in the
house of Joan Dare.
"I am glad of that," he thought
he ran up the steps like a boy - "or
else I might have had to give it up."
He did not ring, but lifted the
knocker gently; the fate with the
muzzled mouth called three times.
That had been the minister's knock
ever since Joan could remember; she
recognized it, and opened the door at
once.
The pastor came in without a word,
and stood in the middle of the library.
Joan, in her long gray dress, stood
opposite him. Her face had the wiz-
ened look of an animal that is aging
from physical pain.
I29



<pb n="130"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
"Joan, I've come to tell you"-
he began. But she put up her hand as
if she warded off a blow.
"Don't I" she entreated.
"Oh, you poor girl! " cried the min-
ister. " How you suffer!"
He was a tall man, as we have no-
ticed, and he looked down at Joan's
upturned face. Afterwards he said of it:
"I have never seen anything like it
on any human countenance. It was as
if I saw the riven side."
"There, there, my dear," said the
pastor. " I came to tell you - I have
conferred with my committee. No-
thing will come of it, Joan. This eccle-
siastical tornado has blown itself out. I
am here to tell you not to distress your-
self -  I thought," he added, "you
would sleep better to know."
But Joan had sunk upon the nearest
130



<pb n="131"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
chair and hid her face. Since she was
a girl, when she had great troubles to
bear, the minister had never seen this
self-possessed woman cry. He dashed
his own hand across his dim eyes and
let her sob it out. He wished he had
been a woman, that he might have
taken her in his arms and comforted
her.
"It's the insult!" she moaned.
"It 's the - disgrace ! "
While he stood looking at her with
his hands locked behind his black coat,
the front door opened without ring or
knock, and the swish of a woman's
skirt crossed the library floor.
The minister's wife had thrown her
long raincoat over her wrapper; her
gray hair was half in crimping-pins, half
astray upon her wrinkled forehead; she
was not a picturesque or aesthetic sight;
13'



<pb n="132"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
but something in her expression made
her a beautiful one at that moment to
her old husband. He stood aside, and
turned his face away, as she flung her
thin arms around Joan's shaken shoul-
ders and kissed the stricken girl upon
the cheek.
"They're nothing but men, Joan,"
said the pastor's wife. "What could
you expect?"
Joan slept little and lightly that
night, and at half-past four in the morn-
ing she was thoroughly awakened.
Strange sounds, muffled and stealthy,
were in the house. Now and then she
had heard something of the kind dur-
ing the last year, and never without a
sense of uneasiness. She had not been
able to find any sufficient explanation
of the disturbance, or of certain inci-
132



<pb n="133"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
dents which had accompanied it, and
experienced the discomfort of one who
will not accept the mystical, and cannot
supply the exact hypothesis.
She recalled all that she had read of
supernatural phenomena, but without
mental hospitality. Her robust, practi-
cal temperament recoiled from the
occult.
" There is an explanation of every-
thing," she thought. " Perhaps I shall
get this one now. I may find out how
those things were done for me."
She sprang for her slippers and gown,
and trailed softly down the stairs.
All houses are haunted. Ghosts that
do not come under the classification of
the Psychical Research Society - the
love, passion, sin, joy, anguish, sanctity,
blasphemy, of family life -wander
and contend like spirits forever within

THE MAN IN THE CASE
the walls of human homes. So sur-
charged does a house become with the
experience of its occupants that a man
with the discomfort of imagination
clamors for the right to build his own
roof, to haunt it with his own person-
ality, and hand it down in turn to ten-
ants less sensitive than himself.
With ghosts like these the house of 
Josiah Dare had long been full. Added
to their tragic company were there any
of the other sort ?
Joan admitted asking herself the
question; but she went down the backl
stairs stoutly, and with a colorless face
on which the smile of a skeptic and
the nerves of a woman warred, pushed
open the kitchen door.
She had made no sound in doing this,
and her entrance did not disturb the
occupant or occupants of the kitchen,

THE MAN IN THE CASE
if any such were there. Indeed, if there
were any, they were invisible, and Joan
was conscious of a clutch at the heart
when she perceived that this was the
fact. 
In the range a fire, built, it seemed,
without hands, was burning heartily;
Joan noticed that one of the covers was
red hot.
"It has been going a good while,"
she thought.
Bread kneaded, it seemed, without
fingers, was in the oven. A boiler
lifted without explicable agency stood
steaming on the coals. The floor was
washed, and the windows. The table
was scoured, and the faucets. Joan
went to the door. The key hung in its
place by its leathern tag on the nail by
the jamb. She tried the door. It was
locked. At that moment she became

aware that a rhythmical sound which
she was sure she had heard when she
stepped from the stairs to the kitchen,
had abruptly ceased. The kitchen was
perfectly still. The room was filled
with the unreal light of dawn.
As Joan stood in it, confused and
hesitating, she saw a yellow crack at
the bottom of a closed door flare and
go out like extinguished gas. Hurry-
ing to this door, which led to the
laundry, she stumbled over a chair; her
hands touched and clutched at some-
thing soft; this she drew to the window
and examined.
It was a woman's garment; a Scotch
plaid golf cape, whose pattern and col-
ors sent the blood driving fast through
Joan's veins.
She struck a match, lit a lamp and
holding it, she could not have told why,

high above her head, as if she had far
to search, opened the door into the
laundry and went in.
Forcing itself against the wall as if
it would force itself (trough to escape
detection, a deprecating figure huddled.
Plainly it was the figure of a woman,
and Joan's courage lifted. Who could
say why a woman's ghost should be
more harmless than a man's? It is
doubtful if history would reinforce
Joan's assumption.
With wet arms bared above the
elbows, with red, parboiled hands be-
fore her face, the intruder uttered four
short words: 
"Oh, Miss Joan dear !"
"Mary    Caroline,"  began  Joan
sternly, "what does this mean ?"
But her trembling lips refused her,
and when Mary Caroline held up her

dripping hands, Joan caught and clasped
them impetuously-no ghosts they,
but warm, living, loving hands, big,
work-worn faithful hands - the hands
that had served her and toiled for her
with the passion of self-effacement that
only women know, and which they
may offer to another woman as ro-
mantically and as loyally as to the
master, man.
"What are you doing here ?" asked
Joan as soon as she could speak. But
her eyes answered her own question.
" Your washin'," sobbed Mary Caro-
line. " I did n't suppose I 'd get caught
at it. I 'd a-got'em all out on the line
by half-past six-I see you at it,"
added Mary Caroline, "nights after
dark. I can't stand it, that's all."
"Mary Caroline," began Joan, across
whose face revelation was slowly steal-

they were all up."
"That was me," replied Mary Caro-

"Was it you that baked the biscuits
and the pies and washed the floor that
day - at the beginning ?"
"Yes, that was me."
"Was it you who did the ironing
three weeks ago in the night? Mary
Caroline, was it you who gave the
kitchen a spring cleaning? And was it
you Martin Luther roared at so last

tumbled down the cellar stairs ?"
"That was all me," said Mary Caro-

cry, as if she had been a guilty child.
"Don't scold me for it! "

Joan's lip quivered.
"I had to do it," pleaded Mary Car-

"Where do you come from?" de-
manded Joan. " What are you doing?
Where are you staying? Why do you
take all this trouble for me,-dear
Mary Caroline!"
Mary Caroline went to the laundry
window and dashed the shade up. She
pointed across the hollow to the short
"unaccepted" street that cut between
the square and the trolley lines. An
acre of Miss Dare's oaks and maples
rose beyond the little garden fore-
ground, in which the fire of nastur-
tiums and salvia, half quenched by frost,
seemed to smoke and flare up before it
went out.
"Me and my sister have rented that
house," said Mary Caroline quietly.

" No, nor I won't now, Miss Joan."

Mary Caroline dashed into the
kitchen, and Miss Dare followed her
slowly. When Mary Caroline had
closed the drafts, the two women stood
and regarded each other with a con-
scious awkwardness.
Into Joan's puzzled eyes a swift in-
terrogation ran. Her glance fell upon
the closed door, whose key hung from
its leathern strap upon the nail beside
the jamb.
"Mary Caroline," she said abruptly,
"I can't understand yet how you got
into this house. The house is always
locked, and the key is always out."
"There ain't no bolt," returned
Mary Caroline with a grim smile. "I
get in with my own key."

forthwith produced an old back-door
key. 
"Do you want it?" she deprecated.
"It's yourn."
Joan shook her head gently, and
Mary Caroline restored the key to her
pocket with a smile of ecstasy.
" I don't know what to say," began
Joan lamely. "It is divine; but it is
dangerous, Mary Caroline."
"Marm?" said Mary Caroline.
"I can't bear to say-I don't want

clear gaze clouded before the steady
eyes of her old servant.
"Seems to me I 'm about as fit to be

gested Mary Caroline, with dignity.
There seemed something almost like a
reversal of their positions; as if the
mistress had in some unexpected sense
become answerable to the maid.
"As fit," replied Joan quickly, "as
any person I know in the world. But
I have nothing to say, Mary Caroline

"I must go now, dear Mary Caroline."
"I shall finish that there washin',"
Mary Caroline announced. "I don't

a-goin' to leave it in the suds -say !
Miss Joan?" 
Joan, with her hand on the knob of
the half-open door, paused at the foot
of the stairs. As she did so she shut
the door again, and stood with her back
against it.
" Miss Joan," said Mary Caroline,
"I hain't nothin' to say but this here
one thing. By all them years I done
for you -you promise me one pro-
mise, an' I won't ask ye no more."
"I'm in something of a hurry,"

manner. "Tell me what it is, Mary

"I will remember," sighed Miss

washing hung flapping merrily on the
line in a high September wind, and
Mary Caroline was gone. When Joan
went into the laundry she saw that
Mary Caroline had omitted to wash
one article. Thil was a necktie, a
summer tie of striped cotton stuff; it
might, or it might not have been part
of a man's wardrobe. Mary Caroline
had folded it very neatly upon the
shelf above the tubs and left it there.
Joan's fingers closed over it slowly.

weight locked around the neck. It
eludes reason, it flees truth, it incar-
cerates the free, it drowns the swim-
ming.
Sometimes Joan Dare felt herself
barred and bolted apart from human
kind; she sat in the " dark solitary "
where the remorseless judgment of men
and women equally immures the ar- 
raigned, the convicted, and the misun- 
derstood. At other times she seemed

to herself to be falling down depths
unmeasured, freighted with lead to
keep her there, blindly seeing through
fathoms of crushing water the stir of
happy keels and sails upon the surface
of life.
We are used to saying that health is
never valued until it is lost, nor happi-
ness unless it is missed, nor affluence
till it is gone, nor position unless it is
obscured. Which of us estimates the
simple value of fair fame ? Who of us
appraises the common, unnoticed prop-
erty of an unblemished name ? For a
good reputation, who takes the trouble
to thank God?
One warm night when Joan sat on
her doorsteps in the soft autumn dark,
the south wind took the voices of
passers on the concrete sidewalk and
flung at her these words:-

"We ain't anyways uncommon, our
family ain't. None of us ever did any
great thing. We ain't famous, nor ed-
ucated, nor rich--we're just plain
folks. But there's one thing we've
always had, and that's character. I tell
you, sir, it 's more precious than rubies."
Joan recognized the voice; it was
that of a neighbor, a working-man,
a poor, uninteresting man; nobody
thought much about him, or indeed
much of him; he used to take care of
her furnace; she could scarcely recall
his name.
Her leaping heart scorched her face.
"They are talking about me," she
thought. She could well have changed
lots with this stupid, irreproachable
person, and blessed Heaven for the
chance.

leaf was not peculiarly cruel; less so,
perhaps, than that of some larger or
smaller places. It was and is a kindly,
well-meaning suburb, too much in-
volved with the overlapping of metro-
politan life to find leisure for the paltry
curiosity of more remote and less busy,
or more active and less conscientious
communities.
The mystery which hung, or which
appeared to hang, over Josiah Dare's
daughter was not brutally treated; only
naturally, perhaps; but, if the village
criticism had been of a ruder variety,
it could not have doomed her to a
solitude more definite or more sad.
The too punctilious recognition, the
too mechanical smile, the cool, cour-
teous salutation, the silent avoidance

sult. Her delicate flesh received poi-

soned assegais rather than bludgeon

Mapleleaf was, in fact, one large
family; and when it became known,
as everything does become known, in
such neighborhoods, that the church
had censured, and, it was suspected, had
narrowly escaped excommunicating
Joan Dare, she found herself the ob-
ject of a scandal the more serious be-
cause no one expressed it to her in so
many barbarous words.
Averted looks turned from her in
public places. People crossed the street
to avoid meeting her. Customers in
stores were zealously busy at counters
when she approached. Her friends
dropped like fading flowers in a steady,
rising wind. Her oldest and best proved
no exception to the general retreat;
Mrs. Hammerton had ceased to visit

her; Mrs. Cotton came several times,
but she could not, though, to do her
justice, she honestly meant to, divest
herself of that pointedly Christian man-
ner which Joan found so trying; and
the attempts of the minister's wife to
do her duty by the harassed woman
were, on the whole, little or no com-
fort. Mrs. Cotton had exhausted her
sympathetic inspirations on that even-
ing when she came to heal the gashes
made by the church committee, who
were " nothing but men." She found
it difficult in colder and heavier air to
rise to heights so fine.
But the Reverend Eliakim Cotton
persisted with a celestial obstinacy in
befriending the unfriended woman;
Joan found herself unable to distance
the simple, dogged, Christian manliness
of her pastor. He would neither desert

her nor neglect her. He ignored her
rebuffs, and overlooked the recoil from
sympathy which suffering developed in
her. But this priestly oversight was,
of course, only an occasional break in
the monotonous solitude of her life.
With the loyalty of her lover Joan
owned it harder to contend. Douglas
Ray defended and guarded the ostra-
cized girl as if he had the right to do
so which she had denied him. It mat-
tered nothing to him that she fended
off his sympathy, declined every practi-
cal service which he would have ren-
dered her, and forbade his presence in
her house. If he absented himself, it
was for her sake. He protected her
reputation as if it had been that of his
sister; and laid his silent homage at
her feet as if she had been his promised
wife. He had long ceased to ask for

explanations of the course of life that
she pursued. In spite of it, and without
them, he preserved an allegiance whose
existence she felt as one feels the influ-
ence of a rtnge of hills, distant but
powerful. In the old Scriptural phrase,
she " lifted up her eyes" to it. But she
did not tell him so.
On the rare occasions when they
met, he found her pale and quiet. She
remained calm and dumb. She wrapped
herself in a reserve on whose dignity
her own mother could not have in-
fringed. She had the expression of a
woman whose thoughts are high, but
whose attitude cannot be. Her nature
seemed to stoop, as if under invisible
burdens; her soul, we might say, had
begun to grow round-shouldered be-
neath its load. She had lost the joyous
erectness of one who has the confidence

<pb n="156"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
and the respect of her fellow-townsmen.
She had acquired the furtive look of
the hunted. Her candid eye evaded
her neighbors.
Half with censure, half with pity,
and always with the irritated wonder
of the unimaginative when confronted
with a mystery, the people of Maple-
leaf watched the movements of the
solitary woman.
In her dull gray gown she faced them
when she must, or eluded them when
she could. Joan now almost always
wore gray - who could say why ? - as
if her misfortunes had selected a uni-
form. Who can explain why a woman
clothes her experience with its kindred
or its complementary colors ?
There were not wanting a few ob-
servers, lovers of the theatre, who half
unconsciously associated Joan Dare with

boards in the city, and represented by
actors of an excellent grade.
" I can't help it! I cannot help it!"
admitted Mrs. Hammerton in a guilty
whisper. " but those gray things keep
reminding me of Hester Prynne."
Mrs. Hammerton had selected Mrs.
Cotton as the recipient of this confi-
dence; as if the fact that she was the
wife of a minister palliated or even
sanctified the confession.
' Hester Prynne ?" asked Mrs. Cot-
ton with a frown of gentle perplexity.

wife did not attend the theatre. She
felt the limitations of her ecclesiastical
training and position before a worldly
experience. To her mind Annie Ham-
merton's picturesque impression pre-
sented no definite significance. The
lifeless, loveless draperies of Hester
Prynne upon the stage, her blanched
face, her sumptuous figure, the pathos
of her haughty bearing in public, its
more pathetic humility in solitude--
Hester, derided on the streets with her
child -radiant in the forest with her
lover - proud upon the scaffold at his
side - and always Hester with the
cunning embroidery scarlet and heavy
on her breast - these scenes the mind 
of the theatre-goer carried from the 
play. But the pastor's wife had read
the book a good while ago.

THE MAN IN THE CASE
In the now desolate and difficult life
of Joan Dare, one woman remained, in
the ultimate sense of the word, her
friend. Mary Caroline had reached
that upper altitude of human loyalty
which is content "not to question
why." With an intelligence not to be
expected of her class, and a reserve
hitherto foreign to herself as a specimen
of it, the old servant seemed to have
reasoned herself or loved herself into
such a tact and dedication as forced
themselves upon the acceptance of her
mistress whether with or against the
lady's will.
Often, perhaps too often, Joan, stand-
ing in the laundry window which com-
manded the pretty foreground of garden,
the middle distance of the grove, and
the perspective of the unaccepted street,
perceived the stanch figure of Mary
I59



<pb n="160"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
Caroline occupied with some obvious
excuse for being where it was, but se-
cretly, Joan felt, watchful of her house
and of herself. She could have iden-
tified (she was now sure) the room in
which Mary Caroline slept or waked
and thought of her; its light burned
far into the night; its shade was usually
lifted; at any moment a figure might
fill it, with arms upraised and large
hands carried to its eyes, shutting out
the light to penetrate the darkness.
Often, more often again, Joan, com-
ing down in the morning, found in her
kitchen the miracles of domestic art
against whose loving-kindness she had
ceased to contend. Every household
task which it was possible for the
affectionate burglar with the duplicate
latch-key to perform within the house,
at hours when such could be secretly

and successfully conducted, Mary Car-
oline achieved with a triumphant skill.
Joan perceived that her old servant
now never, in her wildest or tenderest
depredations, stepped beyond the topog-
raphy of the kitchen. Mary Caroline
had reached the point of self-effacement
where she respected the will of her
mistress, if not the nature of the cir-
cumstances which separated the two.
Joan, in the darkening dawns of au-
tumn, listened to Mary Caroline's
stealthy movements downstairs, and
turned and slept. Sometimes she said:
"Dear Mary Caroline!" and her lip
curved tenderly; it did not tremble;
her eyes were bright and dry. Joan
had ceased to exhibit signs of emo-
tion. It was as if she now experienced
none.

THE MAN IN THE CASE
It was not long after the visit of the
church committee at her house - per-
haps three weeks or four - that Joan
went out one afternoon into the grove
beyond the garden with her books and
sewing and Martin Luther. It was one
of the summer days which may burst
like a blossom from the dying roots of
the year. It was so warm as to be
oppressive, and so dry that the grove
was an acre of tinder; the dead leaves
would have ignited like gunpowder at
a match; the moss crackled beneath
the foot; in the garden the frosted
flowers tried to lift their heads - the
salvia could not, but some of the nas-
turtiums did.
Across the hollow in the unaccepted
street the figure of Mary Caroline passed
to and fro beneath flapping white out-
lines that flung themselves about in

a rising wind, writhing upon a clothes-
reel of great size. No weaker woman
than Mary Caroline could have grap-
pled with it, in the now considerable
breeze. Misj Dare, with a sigh, per-
ceived these indications that Mary Car-
oline, for eighteen years proud of her
position as a trusted family servant, had
fallen to another which all her life she
would have scorned. That this social
descent had been elected for her sake,
Miss Dare could not doubt. She re-
membered Mary Caroline's parting
words:
"Death 'n hell will give up the
things that are in them, before I give
up feelin' the way I've always felt to
you."
This recollection touched Joan, and
when a footstep crackled on the dead
leaves of the grove, and she turned

si   quickly to see who it was, her face
carried a softened, suffused appeal--
gentler than its now habitual expres-

Half-tints, like the shadows of clouds
or the wraiths of color, chased across
her cheeks and forehead, when she per-
ceived that Douglas Ray, with a firm
step, was coming to her through the
complaining leaves. He lifted his hat,
but did not speak. Martin Luther had
gone to meet him leisurely; the dog's
hospitality was dignified and critical;
Martin Luther had not forgotten the
Morris chair, and regarded Douglas
Ray with the suspicion of the collie's
bitterest memories.
Joan was sitting on an old rustic seat,
moss-grown between two pines, whose
needles drifted over her, and upon the
magazines and work-basket which lay

THE MAN IN THE CASE
beside her. Without remark, Ray took
these things off, and sat down in the
space that they had occupied. This
action was so characteristic of him
that she smiled'slowly. It was a good
while since she had seen him, and in
spite of herself her eyes leaned towards
him. His fed upon her hungrily. For a
poignant moment neither weakened the
intensity of feeling by words. Then,
abruptly, Joan began to button her
long coat, and stooped for her hat, which
lay on the leaves at her feet. An iron
hand prevented her.
"What are you going to do ?" he
demanded.
"I 'm going into the house."
"Why?"
"I told you not to come."
" You forbade me the house. This
is not the house."

" Of course I shall be seen. That is

Mapleleaf will see me. I mean it
shall." 
Joan put her pathetic lips together.
She continued to gather her booksand
work, and extended her hand for the
hat that he held. But he shook his
head.
"It is not things that can be seen 
which could harm you - Dear. You
know I would not do anything to in-
jure you -not if I never saw your face
again. You know I can be trusted to do
what is really best for you. You know it,
Joan."
"Yes," she admitted feebly. "I do

to come. Douglas, I do not want you

" How much difference," asked Ray,
"do you suppose that makes to me? I

that I purposed to guard you, to pro-

nind."
f"Then go away!" cried Joan with
sudden passion.
" I do not intend to go away," re-
plied Ray quietly. " I do not intend to
go away at all."
Now Joan's pale face scorched and

Martin Luther, who had never been
taught to charge, catching the too
familiar word " Down!" crouched,
with a groan of protest and resentment,
at the Scotchman's feet. Joan, too,

the pines, whose shaken needles drove
upon her.
" Dogs or women," she said bitterly.
"It seems we're much the same.
,Vhat do r6u want of me, Douglas?
What are you here for ?"
" I am here," said Douglas Ray, in
an uneventful tone, " to ask you to be-

"You have asked me that before."

bit her sentence off.
"I repeat," said Ray, "I seek- I

my wife at once. Let us have no more
of this misery, Joan. Let us be mar-

"Without an explanation of what
people call my conduct ?"
"I ask no explanations of your con-

"Do you mean to say," inquired
Joan, brushing a lapful of pine needles
on Martin Luther's head, "that you
would assume the burden of my -
perplexities ? That you would share
my painful position ? After all that has
happened! After all this dreadful year !
That you would trust me -so far as
that ?"
"I would trust you," replied Ray

<pb n="171"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
slowly, " further than that, if I could.
I suppose a man can't very well go
beyond it. I offer you the service and
devotion of my life. I urge you to do me
the honor to accept the shelter of my
name, what people call the protection
of a husband's presence. I wish to
shield you from everything. I ask you
to let me share your troubles-no
matter what they are! "
" Even if I could not explain them
to you ?" quivered Joan.
" If you could have explained them
to me," returned Ray quietly, "I know
that you would have done so long
ago."
"You would take me, mystery and
all?"
" And thank God for the privilege,"
said Ray solemnly.
Joan wrung her thin hands together

where they lay upon her gray dress.
Martin Luther put his head in the collie
fashion upon her knee. Joan's tense
fingers relaxed, and caressed the old
dog unconsciously.
Ray looked at the collie with a sav-
age envy.
"A man might better be a dog," he
said bitterly.
"And yet," she breathed, "other
men offer women what they call
love! . . . I wish I could! Oh, I wish
I could! . . . I cannot," she added.
"You can, because you must," he 
answered quickly.
"Alas, I cannot because I must not
.  . I thank you, Douglas. You do
love me. I see that. I bless you for 
that."
Then Douglas Ray sternly repeated
his old phrase: " The roots of my love

have gone down like a mountain's.
Nothing can stir it; nothing that you do
or say. You might as well try to over-
throw Wachusett with those poor, thin
little hands."
"'" I do not deserve it " cried Joan
passionately. "I do not believe there
are many women who would. Men do
not love like that. We are not accus-
tomed to it. We have not been taught
to be worthy of it."
"Most men have not the honor of
loving you," replied the Scotchman
simply.  "See here, Joan, I have
something to show you."
With an abrupt motion he took from
the pocket of his coat a paper, unfolded
it, and laid it upon her lap.
In one hurrying glance Joan's startled
eyes perceived the full significance of
what he had done. The paper was
173



<pb n="174"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
signed by the town clerk of Mapleleaf,
and contained the license for the mar-
riage of Douglas Ray and Joan Dare.
"Come, Joan," said Ray gravely.
"Let us not talk about it any more.
I wish you to become my wife at
once. To-day is just as well as any other
time. Whatever it is that distresses you,
let me share it. Whatever isolates
you, let me bear it. Your trouble shall
be my trouble, and your life my life,
- your home my home, if that must
be. I will ask no questions -I trust
you. I will shelter you from every-
thing -I love you .... That's a
good man - your dominie - that Mr.
Cotton. I have been to talk with him.
He will come right over and marry us
now. He is waiting to hear from me.
He will bring his wife. We shall need
one more witness -we will send for

that person down in the hollow hang-
ing lout clothes. Something about her
looks very familiar to me.-Come,
Joan I"
The marriage license fell from Joan's
lap,and Martin Luther pounced upon it.
In a moment he would have torn it to
fringe, but a tremendous grip throttled
him, and the dog dropped the paper
without a word. Martin Luther, who
had been without a master too many
years, recognized the hand of one, and
yielded to it with the pride of a collie
i    it.
o I shall either kill that dog, or love
him," said Ray through set teeth.
He secured the license and returned
it to his pocket. His own face had now
become as rigid as the woman's, and
had been from the first more resolute.
" Douglas," said Joan feebly, "you

are the best man I ever knew. I wish
I could do as you want me to. I can-
not-I cannot do it!" 
In the position which the two oc-
cupied upon the rustic seat between the
pines, Joan's observation commanded,
as it had done all the time, the full
view of the house; the man sat with
his back to it. He had begun to plead
with her, more powerfully (to the
woman) because more passionately than
he had yet done, when he stopped with
an abrupt and breathless exclamation.
Across Joan's eyes had swiftly crept an
expression of something which was
neither terror nor entreaty, but a cu-
rious interplay of both. He could have
said that she made, towards the house, 
an all but imperceptible sign. He
could have sworn that her whole figure
and face were significant, conscious, one
176



<pb n="177"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
might have thought articulate. Did
she raise an instinctive hand? Was it a
gesture of command? or of supplica-
tion ? or of anguish ?
Then Douglas Ray did a noble
thing. He sat still as he was, and did
not turn his head. The collie had
sprung up and run on towards the
house. But not a muscle of the man
moved. His face betrayed no more
curiosity than the carpet of pine
needles beneath her feet.
She was on them and on it now,
standing tall and resolute. He rose and
confronted her, still with his back to
the house.
" I must go! " she panted, " I must
go in at once. Let me pass, Douglas.
Dear Douglas, let me go by you !"
"What's that?" cried Ray, wheel-
ing. " It smells like - it sounds like a

bonfire. It's too windy a day. It won't
do-   Where is it ?"
"It's just a bush," said Joan, re-
suming herself, "one of those dead
spiraea bushes on the edge of the gar-
den. It's got afire somehow. Don't
bother about it, Douglas. It won't
amount to anything."
"I 'm not so sure of that," replied
Ray decidedly. "It's a pretty high
wind, and very dry. I'11 put it out.-
No. Stay still, Joan. I can't have you
anywhere around fire with your wo-
man's skirts. Keep the dog off- if
you can- and stay just where you
are."
Ray hurried across the garden, and
she heard him stamping on the little
blaze among the spiraea bushes. These
were as dry as excelsior and burned
obstinately.
I78



<pb n="179"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
The wind had now in fact assumed
the proportions of a gale. The grove
began to Writhe as if it were in fear;
the pines and oaks took on the look
of living creatures chained to the stake.
Mined and countermined with pine
needles and dead leaves, consumed by
drought, and uncleared for years, the
floor of the grove presented a surface
parched for ignition. One narrow line
of flame, like a long fuse, ran from the
bush to the underbrush.
It did not take Joan long to per-
ceive that the blaze was beyond the
control of one man, and she pushed
through the now stifling smoke.
" I can help! " she cried. "' Between
us, we can put it out."
" Keep your thin skirts out of the
fire! " thundered Ray.
At this critical moment a woman's

THE MAN IN THE CASE
figure panted up across the hollow;
Joan saw that its hands and arms were
loaded; they held a mop, two brooms,
and a snow-shovel.
"Here I be !" cried Mary Caro-
line.
With her big arms and big hands
she fell mightily upon the burning
garden. Mary Caroline fought that
fire as if she had been cleaning house
or digging paths. She swept it, she
scrubbed it, she mopped it, she beat it,
she shoveled it. She uttered short,
sharp sounds, neither language nor mu-
sic, like those of sailors hurling anchor
or furling sails. Martin Luther tried
to help her, vociferating profanely, and
retreated altogether like the coward
collie that he was when he burned his
tail. Suddenly the dog's whine changed
into a violent, anxious bark, and all the
I8o

THE MAN IN THE CASE
collie sense of responsibility returned
proudly to him.
The smarting eyes of the three fire-
fighters followed the motions of the
dog, who was now dashing desperately
from the garden to the grove and back
again.
" It's no use!" cried Ray, running
hatless through the smoke. " It's got
beyona us! We must have help! The
grove is on fire! "
Before the words had left his lips, a
small, sharp petal of flame looking like
"a crocus in the shade" sprang from
the dry grass within ten feet of the
house. The fire-fighters had no time to
study the map of the conflagration, and
had not followed the course of a tiny
root of fire which had been running
unnoticed between the spirea bush and
the hot, yellow blossom on the grass.
ISI



<pb n="182"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
Ray, scarcely comprehending the
significance of this new danger, never- 
theless turned his attention for a mo-
ment to it, and Joan saw that he was 
trying to stamp out the briskly burning
grass, where the crocus of flame had
now multiplied into a parterre. She
saw that he stooped and examined the
spot, glanced about him, and picked
something up. She was at his side in a
moment.
"Give it to me," she commanded.
"I will take care of it," said Ray.
"Please give it to me," insisted Joan.
Without a word he put into her
hand the stump of a half-burned
cigar.
The wind had now risen alarmingly,
and the fire with it. It seemed to Joan
that she had but looked, and the tap-
estry of pine needles in the grove was
182

ablaze from the garden to the hollow.
It seemed to her that she but turned,
and the jace was alive with people.
The solitary woman felt the intrusion
of human life upon her privacy with a
pang sharper than that of fear for her
endangered home.
Neighbors were there from the sur-
rounding homes, passers from the
streets' children and men, a few women;
the police; and other neighbors still-
a phantasmagoria of interference with
her isolation which filled her with in-
communicable horror; as if the well-
meaning people who had thronged her
premises had been the spectres of
delirium.
In one of these apparitions she per-
ceived the figure of the.Reverend Eli-
akim Cotton, crimson to his hair, as all
fire-fighters are. The circumstance
183



<pb n="184"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
that his hair was gray seemed to
heighten the color of his face. He
was bringing water from somewhere in
pails. His wife was taking books out
from the library, and Annie Hammer-
ton was helping her.
The furnace man who said that
character was more precious than rubies
was trying to open the rusty piazza
stop-cock which he had handled so
many times. The junior deacon (who
lived a few doors down the street) came
running around the house with a hand
grenade. Through the asphyxiating
smoke Joan perceived Mary Caroline
helping the furnace man to drag seventy
feet of hose out of the cellar. The
quiet voice of Douglas Ray, raised, but
perfectly controlled, dominated the
unorganized good-will of the thicken-
ing crowd.
184



<pb n="185"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
" It can't be helped," he said, "we
must have the Department."
A small boy came running around
the corner of the house. As he ran he
shouted:
"Here they be! Here's the chemi-
call The ingine's comin'. So's the
hook and ladder!"
Joan tried to cry out, "Douglas!
Douglas! Can't we do without that ?"
but before her dry lips could frame the
words, the place was swarming with
iremen.
The grove was now a lake of fire
whose waves had begun to rise and
pplash. Ivy vines on dead, dry oaks
curled and scorched. One could see
:he outlines of leaves like burning em-
broidery blaze and fall off. The low-
est boughs of the tallest pines began to
Vince and shrivel. It was as if the

trees threw up their arms and cried for
mercy. When the power of the water
fell upon them they seemed to weep
for joy. Joan's trees looked to her like
sentient beings, saved from or doomed
to a tragic death.
Douglas Ray appeared suddenly at
her side.
"You had better go in now," he
said quietly. "Leave everything to
me. I think the worst is over."
As he spoke the words the violent
autumn gale abruptly veered and set
powerfully towards the house. Sparks
licked the metallic paint of the shingles
on the roof. Beautiful, blazing effects
of leaves and twigs drove through the
air and fell. The smouldering trouble
in the grass flared up and crawled
under the piazza.
"Look! Look! Look!" cried a

The /Iremen made a dash towards

OUGLAS RAY dropped
the scorched broom with
which he had been beat-

the house where Joan
had disappeared. He entered as she
had by the piazza; this was reached
through a vestibule. He passed through
the outer door, which he shut behind
him, as Joan had done, and put his
hand not very confidently upon the
latch of the inner door. It was without
actual surprise that he found this locked.
He turned the knob noisily; he
knocked loudly; he rang the bell au-

orders, the shouts of the crowd, the
hissing sound of water on the roof,
the roar of the fire in the grove, and
the rage of the unappeasable wind made
a jargon in which he could scarcely
hear his own voice.
" Joan! " he repeated, " Joan, come
down! "
He went through the long hall and
took a step or two up the front stairs.
" Come down," he pleaded; " if you
will, I won't come up."
But Joan remained silent. Ray now
perceived what in the excitement of
the moment he had entirely over-
looked, that the front door was ajar,
and some one was in the library- the
two ladies, Mrs. Cotton and Mrs. Ham-
merton, who, with the passion of people
at a fire to do the wrong thing, were
assiduously removing the books.

Smiling, he shut the door upon the
visitors, and locked it hard.

"They have gone, Joan," he called.
He ran halfway up the stairs.
A slight motion in the upper hall
replied to him, and looking up through
the smoke he saw a fold of Joan's gray
gown blown around the banister at the
top of the stairs. She did not present
herself within the range of his eyes.
"What are you going to do?" he
asked quietly.
"I am going to stay."
"Stay where ?"
"Here- upstairs, where I am. I
am not going to come down. You are
not coming up."
"Better I than the firemen," sug-
gested Ray.
"Nobody is coming up."
"The Department doesn't take a
woman's 'no!' for an answer, Joan.
Nor do I."

" Joan," he began in a different tone,

line is looking after the other. I want

Ray stood halfwayup the stairs, hat-
less, dripping, muddy, and torn. The
face of the fire-fighter was dull, pur-
plish crimson, as if its shadows had been
painted from a palette of blues. There
was blood upon his clothes, and on his
right hand. Joan stirred a step or two
and saw him.
" Oh ! " she cried. " You are bleed-
ing! You are hurt !" She melted down
the stairs and caught his wounded
hand. Through the smoke he saw
her lifted face, her yielding attitude--
very woman of very woman, as he had
called her once.
Infinite tenderness touched  him
through her fingers; low, passionate
exclamations formed, it seemed, uncon-

" Every fireman in Mapleleaf would be
in every room in this house. If they
did n't, I should. You would be carried
out like a sofa pillow."
"But you said," replied Joan, " that
the house was n't going to burn down."
I95



<pb n="196"/>
THE MAN IN THE CASE
"It is n't.... Now will you marry

But Joan shook her heavy head.
At this moment a fireman on the
piazza roof called to some one be- 
low:                                   I
"Guess we've got to the end of 
this! Anyways, if everything's right

"Joan," said Ray abruptly, "let me  !
pass, please. I must get up into the 
second story and examine that roof. If
I don't, somebody else will."
"I cannot allow it! " cried Joan.
"I don't ask you to," replied Ray
quietly. Gently putting aside her de-
terring hands, he passed her and ran up
into the attic. He was gone but a few
minutes, and, glancing neither to the
right nor to the left, he ran quickly

down again; he passed the closed doors
of Joan's house as if the sword of
Paradise and exile had whirled before
them.
"Therel" he said. "That's done."
A glint of admiration like the gold
spark in the heart of a brown pansy
burned in Joan's soft eyes. She did not
speak.
The smoking grove was writhing
till, for the wind had not gone down.
B]at the lake of fire at the foot of the
trees had become a pond of muddy
water. Burning embroidery of leaves
and vines had ceased to fall, tattered
and glittering, through the air. The
oaks held up black, dripping arms, and
the fingers of the pines were drenched.
The spirea that had wrought the mis-
chief was drowned and broken in every

slender bone; the salvia and the nas-
turtiums were trampled into mud. The
sparks had now scattered like a flock
of bright birds driven to flight. The
little blaze under the piazza was out.
Plenty of shingles were burned, but the
soaked roof had ceased to smoke. The
drenched house was saved.
At the kitchen door Mary Caroline,
sleeves rolled to her broad shoulders,
soot and water and mud splashed upon
her white apron, her high cheek bones
Indian red, her honest eyes dark with
excitement, stood dispensing hospitality
and defying entrance to the crowd.
"The lemonade to the firemen first,"
said Mary Caroline, " and the boys can
have what's left over. I guess there's
enough for the whole o' yer. If I'd
expected such a party, I'd a' beat up a

served Mary Caroline, importantly.
"They're makin' coffee. Miss Dare
says for the firemen to cool off on the

to you, gentlemen, very much indeed,
and so be I."
One of the firemen came up and
took the pail of lemonade. He saluted
respectfully as he said, "We was n't
expecting to see you here, Miss. Folks
said you got through some time ago."
"They did, did they ?" cried Mary
Caroline scornfully. "Well, you just
tell 'em here I be."
The Chief of the Fire Department
of Mapleleaf came around like a caller
to the front door, and lifted the fate
with the bit in its mouth to knock.

He was surprised to find that the
door was locked; that which opened
on the piazza he had already tried; the
windows were fast; he had found it a
species of discourtesy to force his way
by Mary Caroline after accepting her
lemonade and coffee. The Chief felt
that his official prerogative was not
recognized, and when Douglas Ray,
with Martin Luther roaring behind
him, opened the front door, the man
pushed in officiously.
"The fire is over," quickly said Ray.
"The fire is over to all appearance,"
replied the Chief, "but I prefer to
make quite sure of it. I should like to
see the inside of the house."
"I have already done that," answered
Douglas Ray, with a pleasant smile.
"I have examined the house myself.
I am confident that there is n't a spark

left in it. You will excuse me, but
Miss Dare is very tired with all this,
and I should like to keep the premises
as quiet as I can for her.
"I have assumed the responsibilities
of the occasion," added Ray deliber-
ately and distinctly, "as the lady is to
become my wife."
The Chief touched his helmet and
withdrew. Ray shut the door again,
and turned about with his Scotch ex-
pression.
" Oh, what did you say that for ?"
cried Joan from the upper landing.
" Because it's true," replied Douglas
Ray.
"It will be -why, it will be all
over town by night!"
"I meant it should be."
"But everybody will hear it! Every-
body will know it! "

"I hope everybody will."
"It will make everything worse!" "
urged Joan.
"It will make everything better,"
urged Ray.
The two fire-fighters regarded each
other like duelists across the height
and width of the stairs. Smoked and
torn and crimson, the woman looked
down. Muddy and black and bleeding,
the man looked up.
"I shall never see her look less at-
tractive," he thought; his heart leaped 
because he loved her so much when
she was not beautiful. 
"He looks as if he had been in a
battle," thought Joan. But she knew
that she loved him the more for that.
"The crowd is breaking up," said
Ray hastily. " The chemical has gone;
the rest are going. I hear Mrs. Cotton

and Mrs. Hammerton in the dining-
room. Mary Caroline can't keep them
back any longer. You'd better be on
hand, Joan."
Joan came down the stairs, and went
to meet her old friends. She was now
quite self-possessed.

CHAPTER VIII
HE winter set in bitterly.
It was colder than the
last, and Joan, in her sol-
itary home, found the
practical perplexities of
daily life more rather than less severe.
There was a great deal of snow, and
Mapleleaf took her share of it. The
avenue was often   closed, and the
scorched grove stood knee-deep in blue-
white drifts, or glittered to the brows
with chain armor of gray-white ice.
From  the unaccepted street to Miss
Dare's house, a steady foot-path ran
across the hollow the winter long. No
blizzard blockaded  Mary Caroline.
She waded through seas of slush and

water as merrily as if she had been
mopping a kitchen floor. Mary Caro-
line wore rubber boots, and the golf-
cape whose pointed hood rose like a
Gothic arch from head bent to wind
or storm. Her strong figure had the
rude picturesqueness of a Millet pea-
sant contending with a climate that
Millet never knew.
Often, in the freezing dawn, Joan
would hear the chug ! of a snow-shovel
underneath her window, and looking
out, would surprise the strong figure
of her old woman-servant manfully dig-
ging out paths.
One morning she opened the window
and said:-
"Mary Caroline, this must stop. It
is not fit work for you. I cannot have
it."
"Well, I supposed you'd say so,"

'THE MAN IN THE CASE
answered Mary Caroline, resting on her
wooden shovel. " I 've engaged a man
to do it."
She mentioned the name of the fur- 
nace man whose family had always had
character.
"I 've give him the paths an' ash 
barrels," proceeded Mary Caroline
calmly. "I have swore him  not to
come into the house. I told him you
was a-trainin' some pet alligators you 'd
had sent you from Floridy an' you was 
afraid they'd bite somebody."
"He believed you, of course! " re-
plied Miss Dare bitterly.
"Land! "said Mary Caroline. "He'd
believe anything I told him. He's
ben some considerable sweet on me for
quite a spell." 
With thesealleviations of her lot, Joan

continued her solitary and inexplicable
life. The village had now accepted the
mystery if not the pathos of it, and the
definite disapproval of her fellow towns-
men had ceased to express itself to her.
This fact, of course, in no wise im-
peded the current of public criticism.
Like a subterranean river it ran on
beneath her.
Chance words and petty incidents,
dropped into the vortex, went whirling
like garbage down that invisible stream.
People discussed her life in all its known
and unknown particulars. The village
mystery which had now become com-
mon property was put to a painful ex-
ercise. The family history was recalled.
Its details were torn from the merciful
silence of many years. The bereave-
ments, the cares, the tragedies which
had befallen the household of Josiah

Dare, long half-forgotten, were nowa
remembered. It was recollected that
the family had moved out of the state
for a time, and that Joan Dare had lived
for at least three years during her first
youth in some distant city -Chicago
or New York.
Around this circumstance the gossip
of the neighborhood concentrated. It
was felt that anybody who could absent
herself from Mapleleaf for a matter of
years, might, in the nature of things, be
capable of an extraordinary personal
record. It was understood that in Chi-
cago or New York the standards of life
were unfortunately not always identical
with those of the church and society
of Mapleleaf. In these remote and
abandoned  places plainly anything
might occur.

her regrettable absence from the most
cdesirable suburb in the world, to the
daughter of Josiah Dare? The eccen-
tricities of the family were exhumed;
their misfortunes were recalled with a
shake of the head or a droop of the
eyelid. Who could say that there was
not an unhappy tendency in the blood?
It might take this form; it might
choose that. Really, now that one
came to consider it, who knew what
dark scenes might have passed over the
stage of Joan Dare's once troubled ex-
perience ?
The architect, when these scandals
reached him, set his teeth, but said no
word. What could he do? What might
he say? Any step that he took in her
direction, every excuse that he offered
for her sake, might drag her deeper
into the underground river of the com-

mon talk. He was in the position, of 
all most intolerable to a lover, when L
man cannot shield a woman without
multiplying the very pangs from which
he would protect her.
After the fire they had resumed their 
old relations. His masculine persistence
had not dominated her in the least.
She had not conceded by the flutter of
an eyelash to his entreaties. In fact,
he thought she distanced him more
successfully than ever. She had reen-
tered the desolation of her life, and be-
yond the boundaries of that desert he
stood and watched her with a helpless
--it was in fact becoming a hopeless
-misery. He had reached the pass
where he acknowledged to himself
that he could do absolutely nothing 
for her.
The spring was like the winter,

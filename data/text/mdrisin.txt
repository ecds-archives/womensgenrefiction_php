<head><l>THE RISING TIDE</l>
<l>CHAPTER I</l>
<p>A SINGLE car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules. Thirty years ago Payton Street had been shocked by the intrusion upon its gentility of a thing so noisy and vulgar as a street-car; but now, when the rest of the town was shuttled with trolleys and clamorous with speed, it seemed to itself an oasis of silence. Its gentility had ebbed long ago. The big houses, standing a little back from the sidewalk, were given over to lodgers or small businesses. Indeed, the Paytons were the only people left who belonged to Payton Street's past--and there was a barber shop next door to them, and a livery-stable across the street.</p>
<p>"Rather different from the time when your dear father brought me here, a bride," Mrs. Payton used to say, sighing.</p>
<p>Her daughter agreed, dryly: "I hope so! Certainly nobody would live on Payton Street now, if they could afford to buy a lot in the cemetery."</p>
<p>Yet the Paytons, who could have bought several lots
<pb n="2     THE RISING TIDE"/>
in the cemetery (or over on the Hill, either, which was where they belonged!), did not leave the old house--a big, brownstone cube, with a belvedere on top of it that looked like a bird-cage. The yard in front of the house was so shaded by ailanthus-trees that grass refused to grow there, and an iron dog, guarding the patch of bare earth, was spotted with mold.</p>
<p>The street was very quiet,--except when the barber's children squabbled shrilly, or Baker's livery-stable sent out a few funeral hacks, or when, from a barred window in the ell of the Payton house, there came a noisy laugh. And always, on the half-hour, the two mules went tinkling along, their neat little feet cupping down over the cobblestones, and their trace-chains swinging and sagging about their heels. The conductor on the car had been on the route so long that he knew many of his patrons, and nodded to them in a friendly way, and said it was a good day, or too cold for the season; occasionally he imparted information which he thought might be of interest to them.</p>
<p>On this October afternoon of brown fog and occasional dashes of rain he enlightened a lady with a vaguely sweet face, who signaled him to stop at No. 15.</p>
<p>"Miss Payton's out," he said, pulling the strap over his head and bringing his car to a standstill; "but her ma's at home. I brought the old lady back on my last trip, just as Miss Freddy was starting off with that pup of hers."</p>
<p>"It's the 'old lady' I've come to see," his fare said, smiling, and, gathering up her skirts, stepped down into
<pb n="3     THE RISING TIDE"/>
the Payton Street mud. The bell jangled and the mules went clattering off over the cobblestones.</p>
<p>Mrs. William Childs, picking her way to the sidewalk, said to herself that she almost wished Freddy and her dog were at home, instead of the "old lady."</p>
<p>"Poor dear Ellen," she thought, in amiable detachment from other people's troubles; "she's always asking me to sit in judgment on Fred--and there's nothing on earth I can do."</p>
<p>It occurred to her as she passed under the dripping ailanthus-trees and up the white marble door-steps that Payton Street was a gloomy place for a young creature like Frederica to live. "Even my Laura would kick," she thought; her thoughts were often in her Laura's vernacular. In the dark hall, clutching at the newelpost on which an Egyptian maiden held aloft a gas-burner in a red globe, she extended a foot to a melancholy mulatto woman, who removed her rubbers and then hung her water-proof on the rack beside a silk hat belonging to the late Mr. Payton--kept there, Mrs. Childs knew, to frighten perennially expected burglars.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Flora," she said. "Has Mr. Weston come yet?" When Flora explained that Mr. Weston was not expected until later, she started up-stairs--then hesitated, her hand on the shoulder of the Egyptian maiden: "Mr. Mortimore--he's not about?"</p>
<p>"Land, no, Mis' Childs!" the woman reassured her; "he don't ever come down 'thout his ma or Miss Carter's along with him."</p>
<p>Mrs. Childs nodded in a relieved way, and went on up
<pb n="4     THE RISING TIDE"/>
to the sitting-room where, as she had been warned, she and Mr. Arthur Weston, one of the trustees of what was popularly known as "the old Andy Payton estate," were to "sit in judgment." "It is hard for Fred to have Mortimore in the house," she thought, kindly; "poor Freddy!"</p>
<p>The sitting-room was in the ell, and pausing on the landing at the steps that led up to it, she looked furtively beyond it, toward another room at the end of the hall. "I wonder if Ellen ever forgets to lock the door on her side?" she thought;--"well, Nelly dear, how are you?" she called out, cheerfully.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton, bustling forward to meet her, overflowed with exclamations of gratitude for her visit. "And such unpleasant weather, too! I do hope you didn't get your feet damp? I always tell Freddy there is no surer way to take cold than to get your feet damp. Of course she doesn't believe me, but I'm used to that! Is William's cold better? I suppose he's glad of an excuse to stay indoors and read about Bacon and Shakespeare; which was which? I never can remember! Now sit right down here. No, take this chair!"</p>
<p>The caller, moving from one chair to another, was perfectly docile; it was Ellen's way, and Mrs. Childs had long ago discovered the secret of a peaceful life, namely, always, so far as possible, to let other people have their own way. She looked about the sitting-room, and thought that her sister-in-law was very comfortable. "Laura would have teased me to death if I had kept my old-fashioned things," she reflected. The room was feminine as well as old-fashioned; the deeply upholstered chairs
<pb n="5     THE RISING TIDE"/>
and couches were covered with flounced and flowery chintz; on a green wire plant-stand, over-watered ferns grew daily more scraggy and anemic; the windows were smothered in lambrequins and curtains, and beadwork valances draped corer brackets holding Parian marble statuettes; of course there was the usual womanish clutter of photographs in silver frames. On the center-table a slowly evolving picture puzzle had pushed a few books to one side--pretty little books with pretty names, <hi rend="italic">Flowers of Peace</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Messages from Heaven</hi>, most of them with the leaves still uncut. It was an eminently comfortable room; indeed, next to her conception of duty, the most important thing in Mrs. Andrew Payton's life was comfort.</p>
<p>Just now, she was tenaciously solicitous for Mrs. Childs's ease; was she warm enough? Wasn't the footstool a little too high? And the fire--dear me! the fire <hi rend="italic">was</hi> too hot! She must put up the screen. She wouldn't make tea until Mr. Weston came; yes, he had promised to come; she had written him, frankly, that he had simply got to do something about Freddy. "He's her trustee, as well as mine, and I told him he simply <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do something about this last wild idea of hers. Now! isn't it better to have the screen in front of the fire?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Childs said the screen was most comfortable; then added, in uncertain reminiscence, "Wasn't Mr. Weston jilted ages ago by some Philadelphia girl?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, yes; so sad. Kate Morrison. She ran off with somebody else just a week before they were to be married. Horribly awkward for him; the invitations all
<pb n="6     THE RISING TIDE"/>
out! He went to Europe, and was agent for Payton's until dear Andrew died. You are quite sure you are not too warm?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed!" Mrs. Childs said. "How is Mortimore?" It was a perfunctory question, but its omission would have pained Mortimore's mother.</p>
<p>"Very well!" Mrs. Payton said; her voice challenging any one to suspect anything wrong with Mortimore's health. "He knew Freddy to-day; he was in the hall when she went out; he can't bear her dog, and he--he scolded a little. I'm sure I don't blame him! I hate dogs, myself. But he knew her; Miss Carter told me about it when I came in. I was so pleased."</p>
<p>"That was very nice," her visitor said, kindly. There was a moment's silence; then, glancing toward a closed door that connected the sitting-room with that room at the end of the ell, she said, hesitatingly: "Nelly dear, don't you think that perhaps Freddy wouldn't be so difficult, if poor Mortimore were not at home? William says he thinks--"</p>
<p>"My son shall never leave this house as long as I am in it myself!" Mrs. Payton interrupted, her face flushing darkly red.</p>
<p>"But it is unpleasant for Fred, and--"</p>
<p>"'Unpleasant' to have her poor afflicted brother in the house? Bessie, I wouldn't have thought such a thing of you! Let me tell you, once for all, as I've told you many, many times before--never, while I live, shall Mortimore be treated cruelly and turned out of his own home!"</p>
<pb n="7     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"But William says they are not cruel, at--at those places; and Mortimore, poor boy! would never know the difference."</p>
<p>"He would! He would! Didn't I tell you he recognized his sister to-day? His sister, who cares more for her dog than she does for him! And he almost always knows me. Bessie, you don't understand how a mother feels--" she had risen and was walking about the room, her fat, worn face sharpening with a sort of animal alertness into power and protection. The claws that hide in every maternal creature slipped out of the fur of good manners: "We've gone all over this a hundred times; I know that you think I am a fool; and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think that you--well, never mind! The amount of it is, you are not a mother."</p>
<p>"My dear! What about my three children?"</p>
<p>"Three healthy children! What do you know of the real child, the afflicted child, like my Mortimore? Why, I'd see Freddy in her grave before I'd--" She stopped short. "I--I love both my children exactly the same," she ended, weakly. Then broke out again: "You and I were brought up to do our duty, and not talk about it whether it was pleasant or unpleasant. And let me tell you, if Freddy would do her duty to her brother, as old Aunt Adelaide did to her invalid brother, she'd be a thousand times happier than she is now, mixing up with perfectly common people, and talking about earning her own living! Yes, that's the last bee in her bonnet,--Working! a girl with a good home, and nothing on earth to do but amuse herself. She uses really vulgar words
<pb n="8     THE RISING TIDE"/>
about women who never worked for their living; you and me, for instance. 'Vermin'--no, 'parasites.' Disgusting! Yes; if Freddy was like her great-aunt Adelaide--" Mrs. Payton, sinking into a chair bubbly with springs and down, was calmer, but she wiped her eyes once or twice: "Aunt Adelaide gave up her life to poor Uncle Henry. Everybody says she had lots of beaux! I heard she had seven offers. But she never dreamed of getting married. She just lived for her brother. And they say <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was dreadful, Bessie; whereas my poor Mortimore is only--not quite like other people." Mrs. Childs gasped. "When Morty was six months old," Mrs. Payton said, in a tense voice, "and we began to be anxious about him, Andrew said to the doctor, 'I suppose the brat' (you know men speak so frankly) 'has no brains?' and Dr. Davis said, 'The intellect is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, Mr. Payton, but it is veiled.' That has always been such a comfort to me; Morty's intellect is there! And besides, you must remember, Bessie, that even if he isn't--very intelligent, he's a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, so he's really the head of the family. As for Freddy, as I say, if she would follow her aunt Adelaide's example, instead of reading horrid books about things that when I was a young lady, girls didn't know existed, she'd be a good deal more comfortable to live with. Oh, dear! what am I going to do about her? As I wrote to Mr. Weston, when I asked him to come in this afternoon, what are we going to do about her?"</p>
<p>"What has poor Fred done now?" Fred's aunt asked, trying patiently to shut off the torrent of talk.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton drew a long breath; her chin was still
<pb n="9     THE RISING TIDE"/>
unsteady. "It isn't so much this last performance, because, of course, in spite of what Mama says, everybody who knows Freddy, knows that there was--nothing wrong. But it's her ideas, and the way she talks. Really, Bessie--"</p>
<p>"My dear, they all talk most unpleasantly!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton shook her fair head. "Your Laura doesn't. I never heard Lolly say the sort of things Freddy does. She calls her father 'Billy-boy,' I know, but that's only fun--though in our day, imagine us calling our fathers by a
nickname! No, Bessie, it's Freddy's taste. It's positively low! There is a Mrs. McKenzie, a scrubwoman out at the Inn, and she is--<hi rend="italic">you</hi> know? It will be the seventh, and they really can hardly feed the six they have. And Freddy, <hi rend="italic">a young girl</hi>, actually told Mrs. McKenzie she ought not to have so many children!"</p>
<p>"Well, Ellen, if there are too many now, it does seem--"</p>
<p>"But, Bessie! A girl to speak of such things! Why, you and I, before we were married, didn't know--still, there's no use harking back to our girlhood. And as for the things she says!...Yesterday I was speaking of the Rev. Mr. Tait, and she said: 'I haven't any use for Tait; he has no guts to him.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Childs was mildly horrified. "But it's only bad taste," she excused her niece. She was fond of this poor, troubled sister-in-law of hers--but really, what was the use of fussing so over mere bad taste? Over really serious things, such as keeping that dreadful Mortimore about, Ellen didn't fuss at all! "How queer she is," Mrs. Childs reflected, impersonal, but kindly; then murmured that if
<pb n="10     THE RISING TIDE"/>
she had been unhappy about her children's slang, she'd have been in her grave by this time; "You should hear my boys! And, after all, Ellen, Fred's a good child, in spite of this thing she's done (you haven't told me what it is yet). She's merely like all the rest of them--thinks she knows it all. Well, we did, too, at her age, only we didn't say so. Sometimes I think they are more straightforward than we were. But I made up my mind, years ago, that there was no use trying to run the children on my ideas. Criticism only provoked them, and made me wretched, and accomplished nothing. So, as William says, why fuss?"</p>
<p>"Fred is my daughter, so I have to 'fuss.'"</p>
<p>"Well," said Mrs. Childs, patiently, "what is it?"</p>
<p>"Hasn't Laura told you? Mama says everybody is talking about it."</p>
<p>"No; she hasn't said anything."</p>
<p>"My dear, Freddy spent the night at the Inn, with Howard Maitland."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">What!</hi>"</p>
<p>"His car broke down--"</p>
<p>"Oh, an accident? You can't blame Fred for that. But why didn't they take the trolley?"</p>
<p>"They just missed the last car."</p>
<p>"Well, they were two careless children, but you wouldn't have had them walk into town, twelve miles, at twelve o'clock at night?"</p>
<p>"I certainly would! Freddy is always telling me I ought to walk to keep my weight down--so why didn't she walk home? And as for their being children, she is twenty-five and I am sure he is twenty-seven."</p>
<pb n="11     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>She paused here to wonder about Mr. Maitland: curious that he liked to live alone in that big house on the hill! Pity he hadn't any relatives--a maiden aunt, or anybody who could keep house for him. His mother was a sweet little thing. Nice that he had money.</p>
<p>"He ought to marry," said Mrs. Childs.</p>
<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Payton; and dropped young Maitland to go back to the Inn escapade: "Mama was
so shocked when she heard about it that she thought William ought to go and see Mr. Maitland and tell him he must marry her. Of course, that is absurd--Mama belongs to another generation. Freddy did take the trouble to telephone me; but Flora took the message--poor Flora! she's so dissatisfied and low-spirited. I wish she'd 'get religion'--that keeps servants contented. Miss Carter says she's in love with one of the men at the livery-stable. But he isn't very devoted. Well, I was in bed with a headache (I've been dreadfully busy this week, and pretty tired, and besides, I had worked all the evening on a puzzle, and I was perfectly worn out); so Flora didn't tell me, and I didn't know Freddy hadn't come home until the next morning. It appears she was advising Mrs. McKenzie as to the size of her family, and when Mr. Maitland found he couldn't make his motor go, and told her they must take the trolley, she just kept on instructing Mrs. McKenzie! So they missed the car. She admitted that it was her fault. Well, then--oh, here is Mr. Weston!"</p>
<p>He came into the room, dusky with the fog that was pressing against the windows, like a slender shadow; a
<pb n="12     THE RISING TIDE"/>
tall, rather delicate-looking man in the late forties, with a handsome, whimsical face, which endeavored, just now, to conceal its boredom.</p>
<p>"Criminal not present?" he said, shaking hands with the two ladies and peering near-sightedly about.</p>
<p>"Oh, she's off with her dog, walking miles and miles, to keep from getting fat," Mrs. Payton said. She sat down at her tea-table, and tried, fussily, to light the lamp under the kettle. "It's wicked to be fat, you know," she ended, with resentful sarcasm; "I wish you could hear Fred talk about it!"</p>
<p>"I wish I could," Frederica's man of business said, lifting a humorous eyebrow; "I always like to hear Fred talk. Let me fix that lamp for you, Mrs. Payton. I hope I'm thin enough to be moral?"</p>
<p>The two ladies regarded him with maternal eyes, and Mrs. Childs recommended a glass of milk at bedtime.</p>
<p>"Be sure it is pasteurized," she warned him; "my William always says it's perfect nonsense to fuss about that--but I say it's only prudent."</p>
<p>"Must I pasteurize my whisky, too?" he said, meekly; "I sometimes take that at bedtime." It occurred to him that when he had the chance he would tell Freddy that what with pasteurized milk, and all the other improvements upon Nature, her children would be supermen; "they'll say they were evolved from us," he reflected, sipping his tea, and listening to his hostess's outpourings about her daughter, "as we say we were evolved from monkeys."</p>
<p>Not that Mrs. Payton--telling him, with endless illus-
<pb n="13     THE RISING TIDE"/>
trations, just how, "impossible" her Freddy was--looked in the least like a monkey; she was a large, fair, dull lady, of fifty-seven or thereabouts, who never took any exercise, and credited the condition of her liver to Providence; but she was nearly as far removed from Miss Frederica Payton as she was from those arboreal ancestors, the very mention of whom would have shocked her religious principles, for Mrs. Payton was very truly and humbly religious.</p>
<p>"And church--Freddy never goes to church," she complained. "She plays tennis all Sunday morning. Rather different from our day, isn't it, Bessie? We children were never allowed even to read secular books on Sunday. Well, I think it was better than the laxity of the present. We always wore our best dresses to church, and--"</p>
<p>"May I have some more tea, Mrs. Payton?" her auditor murmured, and, the tide of reminiscence thus skilfully dammed, Freddy's offense was finally revealed to him. "Well," he said,--"yes, cream please; a great deal! I hope it's pasteurized?--they were stupid to lose the car. Fred told me all about it yesterday; it appears she was talking to some poor woman about the size of her family"--the two ladies exchanged horrified glances;--"of course, Maitland ought to have broken in on eugenics and hustled her off. But an accident isn't one of the seven deadly sins, and--"</p>
<p>"Oh," Fred's mother interrupted, "<hi rend="italic">of course</hi> there was nothing wrong."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston looked at her admiringly; she really conceived it necessary to say such a thing! Those denied
<pb n="14     THE RISING TIDE"/>
ancestors of hers could hardly have been more direct. It occurred to him, reaching for another lump of sugar, that Frederica came by her talent for free speech honestly. "With her mother, it is free thought. Fred goes one better, that's all," he reflected, dreamily. Once or twice, while the complaints flowed steadily on, he roused himself from his amused abstraction to murmur sympathetic disapproval: "Of course she ought not to say things like that--"</p>
<p>"She is impossible!" Mrs. Payton sighed. "Why, she said 'Damn,' right out, before the Rev. Mr. Tait!"</p>
<p>"Did she damn Tait? I know him, and really--"</p>
<p>"Well, no; I think it was the weather. But that is nothing to the way she talks about old people."</p>
<p>"About me, perhaps?"</p>
<p>"Oh no; really, no! About you?" Mrs. Payton stammered; "why--how could she say anything about you?"</p>
<p>Arthur Weston's eyes twinkled. ("I'll make her tell me what it was," he promised himself.)</p>
<p>"As for age," Mrs. Childs corroborated, "she seems to have no respect for it. She spoke quite rudely to her uncle William about Shakespeare and Bacon. She said the subject <hi rend="italic">'bored'</hi> her."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston shook his head, speechless.</p>
<p>"And she said," Mrs. Childs went on, her usual detachment sharpening for a moment into personal displeasure, "she said the antis had no brains; and she knows I'm an anti!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear," Fred's mother condoled, "I'm an anti, and she says shocking things to me; once she said the
<pb n="15     THE RISING TIDE"/>
antis were--I really can't say just what she said before Mr. Weston; but she implied they were--merely mothers. And as for her language! I was saying how perfectly shocked my dear old friend, Miss Maria Spencer, was over this Inn escapade; Miss Maria said that if it were known that Freddy had spent the night at the Inn with Mr. Maitland her reputation would be gone."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston's lips drew up for a whistle, but he frowned.</p>
<p>"I told Freddy, and what do you suppose she said? Really, I hesitate to repeat it."</p>
<p>"But dear Ellen," Mrs. Childs broke in, "it was horrid in Miss Spencer to say such a thing! I don't wonder Freddy was provoked."/p>
<p>"She brought it on herself," Mrs. Payton retorted. "Have another sandwich, Bessie? What she said is almost too shocking to quote. She said of my dear old friend--Miss Spencer used to be my school-teacher, Mr. Weston--'What difference does it make what she said about me? Everybody knows Miss Spencer is a silly old ass.' 'A silly old ass.' What do you think of <hi rend="italic">that?</hi>" Mrs. Payton's voice trembled so with indignation that she did not hear Mr. Weston's gasp of laughter. But as she paused, wounded and ashamed, he was quick to console her:</p>
<p>"It was abominably disrespectful!"</p>
<p>"There is no such thing as reverence left in the world," said Mrs. Childs; "my William says he doesn't know what we are coming to."</p>
<p>"Youth is very cruel," Mr. Weston said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton's eyes filled. "Freddy is cruel," she said,
<pb n="16     THE RISING TIDE"/>
simply. The wounded look in her worn face was pitiful. They both tried to comfort her; they denounced Freddy, and wondered at her, and agreed with Mr. Childs that "nobody knew what we were coming to." In fact, they said every possible thing except the one thing which, with entire accuracy, they might have said, namely, that Miss Spencer was a silly old ass.</p>
<p>"When I was a young lady," Mrs. Payton said, "respect for my elders would have made such words impossible."</p>
<p>"Even if you didn't respect them, you would have been respectful?" Mr. Weston suggested.</p>
<p>"We reverenced age because it was age," she agreed.</p>
<p>"Yes; in those happy days respect was not dependent upon desert," he said, ruefully. (Mrs. Childs looked at him uneasily; just what did he mean by that?) "It must have been very comfortable," he ruminated, "to be respected when you didn't deserve to be! This new state of things I don't like at all; I find that they size me up as I am, these youngsters, not as what they ought to think I am. One of my nephews told me the other day that I didn't know what I was talking about."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Mr. Weston, how shocking!" Mrs. Payton sympathized.</p>
<p>"Well, as it happened, I didn't," he said, mildly; "but how outrageous for the cub to recognize the fact."</p>
<p>"Perfectly outrageous!" said his hostess. "But it's just as Bessie says, they don't know the meaning of the word 'respect.' You should hear Freddy talk about her grandmother. The other day when I told her that my
<pb n="17     THE RISING TIDE"/>
dear mother said that if women had the ballot, chivalry would die out and men wouldn't take off their hats in elevators when ladies were present,--she said, 'Grandmother belongs to the generation of women who were satisfied to have men retain their vices, if they removed their hats.' What do you think of that! I'm sure I don't know what Freddy's father would have said if he had heard his daughter say such a thing about his mother-in-law."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston, having known the late Andy Payton, thought it unwise to quote the probable comment of the deceased. Instead, he tried to change the subject: "Howard Maitland is a nice chap; I wonder if--" he paused; there was a scuffle on the other side of the closed door, a bellowing laugh, then a whine. Mrs. Childs bit her lip and shivered. Mr. Weston's face was inscrutable. "I wonder," he continued, raising his voice--"if Fred will smile on Maitland? By the way, I hear he is going in for conchology seriously."</p>
<p>"Mortimore is nervous this afternoon," Mrs. Payton said, hurriedly; "that horrid puppy worried him. Conchology means shells, doesn't it? Freddy says he has a great collection of shells. I was thinking of sending him that old conch shell I used to use to keep the parlor door open. Do you remember, Bessie? Yes, Mr. Maitland is attentive, but I don't know how serious it is. Of course, I'm the last person to know! Rather different from the time when a young man asked the girl's parents if he might pay his addresses, isn't it? Well, I want to tell you what she said when I spoke to her about this plan of
<pb n="18     THE RISING TIDE"/>
earning her living (that's her latest fad, Mr. Weston), and told her that, as Mama says, it isn't <hi rend="italic">done</hi>; she--"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! There's the car coming," Mrs. Childs broke in, as the tinkle of the mules' bells made itself heard. "Do hurry and tell us, Nelly; I've got to go."</p>
<p>"But you mustn't! I want to know what you think about it all," Mrs. Payton said, distractedly; "wait for the next car."</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, dear Ellen, but I really can't," her sister-in-law declared, rising. "Cheer up! I'm sure she'll settle down if she cares about Mr. Maitland. (I'm out of it!" she was thinking.) But even as she was congratulating herself, she was lost, for from the landing a fresh young voice called out:</p>
<p>"May I come in, Aunt Nelly? How do you do, Mr. Weston! Mama, I came to catch you and make you walk home. Mama has got to walk, she's getting so fat! Aunt Nelly, Howard Maitland is here; I met him on the door-step and brought him in."</p>

<head>CHAPTER II</head>
<p>LAURA CHILDS came into the quiet, fire-lit room like a little whirl of fresh wind. The young man, looming up behind her in the doorway, clean-shaven, square-jawed, honest-eyed, gave a sunshiny grin of general friendliness and said he hoped Mrs. Payton would forgive him for butting in, but Fred had told him to call for some book she wanted him to read, and the maid didn't know anything about it.</p>
<p>"I thought perhaps she had left it with you," he said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton, conscious, as were the other two, of having talked about the speaker only a minute before, expressed flurried and embarrassed concern. She was so sorry! She couldn't imagine where the book was! She got up, and fumbled among the <hi rend="italic">Flowers of Peace</hi>. "You don't remember the title?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Awfully sorry. I'm so stupid about all these deep books Fred's so keen on. Something about birth-rate and the higher education, I think."</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton stiffened visibly. "I don't know of any such book," she said; then murmured, perfunctorily, that he must have a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Again Mr. Maitland was sorry,--"dreadfully sorry,"--but he had to go. He went; and the two ladies looked at each other.</p>
<pb n="20     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you suppose he heard us?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe he did!"</p>
<p>"Nice chap," said Mr. Weston.</p>
<p>On the way down-stairs the nice chap was telling Laura that he had caught on, the minute he got into that room, that it wasn't any social whirl, so he thought he'd better get out.</p>
<p>"They're sitting on Freddy, I'm afraid," Laura said, soberly; "poor old Fred!"</p>
<p>"Well, I put one over when I asked for that book! I bet even old Weston's never read it! Neither have I. But Fred can give us all cards and spades on sociology."</p>
<p>"She's great," Laura agreed; "but the book isn't so awfully deep. Well, I'm going back to root for her!"</p>
<p>She ran up to the sitting-room again, and demanded tea. Her face, under her big black hat, was like a rose, and her pleasant brown eyes glanced with all the sweet, good-natured indifference of kindly youth at the three troubled people about the tea-table. Somehow, quite unreasonably, their depression lightened for a moment.</p>
<p>"No! No sugar, Aunt Nelly."</p>
<p>"Do you want to be as thin as I am, Miss Laura?" Arthur Weston remonstrated, watching her rub her cool cheek against her mother's, and kiss her aunt, and "hook" a sandwich from the tea-table. One had to smile at Laura; her mother smiled, even while she thought of the walk home, and realized, despairingly, that the car was coming--coming--and would be gone in a minute or two!</p>
<p>"My dear, your father says all this fuss about exercise is perfect nonsense. Really, I think we'd better ride,"
<pb n="21     THE RISING TIDE"/>
she pleaded with the pretty creature, who was asking, ruthlessly, for lemon, which meant another delay.</p>
<p>"I'll ring, Auntie; Flora will get it in a minute. Mama, I bet you haven't walked an inch this day! I knew you'd take the car if I didn't come and drag you on to your legs," she ended, maliciously; but it was such pretty malice, and her face was so gayly amiable that her mother surrendered. "The only thing that reconciles me to Billy-boy's being too poor to give us an auto," Laura said, gravely, "is that Mama would weigh a ton if she rode everywhere. I bet you've eaten six cream-cheese sandwiches, Mama? You'll gain a pound for each one!"</p>
<p>"You'll be the death of me, Lolly," her mother sighed. "I only ate three. Well, I'll stay a little longer, Ellen, and walk part way home with this child. She's a perfect tyrant," she added, with tender, scolding pride in the charming young creature, whose arch impertinence was irresistible.</p>
<p>"Take off your coat, my dear," Mrs. Payton said, patting her niece's hand, "and go and look at my puzzle over on the table. Five hundred pieces! I'm afraid it will take me a week yet to work it out;"--then, in an aside: "Laura, I'm mortified that I should have asked Mr. Maitland the title of that book before you,"--Laura opened questioning eyes;--"so indelicate of Fred to tell him to read it! Oh, here's Flora with the lemon. Thank you, Flora. . . Laura, do you know what Freddy is thinking of doing now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the real-estate business. It's perfectly corking! Howard Maitland says he thinks she's simply great to
<pb n="22     THE RISING TIDE"/>
do it. I only wish <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could go into business and earn some money!"</p>
<p>"My dear, if you will save some money in your own home, you will be just as well off," Mrs. Childs said, dryly.</p>
<p>"Better off," Mr. Weston ventured, "but you won't have so much fun. This idea of Fred's is a pretty expensive way of earning money."</p>
<p>"You know about it?" Mrs. Payton said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; she broke it to me yesterday."</p>
<p>"Just what is her idea?" Mrs. Childs asked, with mild impatience.</p>
<p>"Let me explain it," Frederica's man of business said...and proceeded to put the project into words of three letters, so to speak. Fred had hit on the fact that there are many ladies--lone females, Mr. Weston called them; who drift about looking for apartments;--"nice old maids. I know two of them at this minute, the Misses Graham, cousins of mine in Grafton. They are going to spend the winter in town, and they want a furnished apartment. It must be near a drugstore and far enough from an Episcopal church to make a nice walk on Sundays--<hi rend="italic">fair</hi> Sundays. And it must be on the street-car line, so that they can go to concerts, with, of course, a messenger-boy to escort them; for they 'don't mean to be a burden to a young man'; that's me, I'll have you know! 'A young man'! When a chap is forty-six that sounds very well. Fred proposes to find shelters for just such people."</p>
<p>The two ladies were silent with dismay and ignorance. Laura, sucking a piece of lemon, and seeing a chance to
<pb n="23     THE RISING TIDE"/>
"root," said, "How bully to have an office! I'm going to make her take me as office boy."</p>
<p>"The Lord only knows how she got the idea," Arthur Weston went on, "but it isn't entirely bad. I confess I wish her ambition would content itself with a post-office address, but nothing short of a real office will satisfy her. She has her eye on one in the tenth story of the Sturtevant Building; I am on the third, you know. But I think she can do it all on her allowance, though rent and advertising will use up just about all her income."</p>
<p>"I will never consent to it," Mrs. Payton said, angrily. "It is absurd, anyhow! Freddy, to hunt up houses for elderly ladies--<hi rend="italic">Freddy</hi>, of all people! She knows no more about houses, or housekeeping, than--than that fire-screen! Just as an instance, I happened to tell her that I couldn't remember whether I had seventy-two best towels and eighty-four ordinary towels, or the other way round; I was really ashamed to have forgotten which it was, and I said that as soon as I got time I must count them. (Of course, I have the servants' towels, too; five dozen and four, with red borders to distinguish them.) And Freddy was positively insulting! She said women whose minds had stopped growing had to count towels for mental exercise. When <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was a girl, I should have offered to count the towels for my mother! As for her finding apartments for elderly ladies, I would as soon trust a--a baby! Do you mean the Mason Grahams, Mr. Weston? Miss Eliza and Miss Mary? Mama knows them. You've met them, too, haven't you, Bessie? Well, I can only say that I should be exceedingly mortified to have the Misses
<pb n="24     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Graham know that any Payton girl was behaving in such an extraordinary manner The real-estate business! She might as well go out as a servant."</p>
<p>"She would make more money as a cook," he admitted. But he could not divert the stream of hurt and angry objections. Once Mrs. Childs said to tell Fred her uncle William would say it was perfect nonsense; and once Laura whispered to Mr. Weston that she thought it would be great sport to hunt flats for flatlings; to which he whispered back: "Shoal. 'Ware shoal, Laura."</p>
<p>There were many shoals in the distressed argument that followed, and even Arthur Weston's most careful steering could not save some bumps and crashes. In the midst of them the car came clattering down the street, and after a while went clattering back; and still the three elders wrangled over the outlaw's project, and Laura, sitting on the arm of her mother's chair, listened, giggling once in awhile, and saying to herself that Mr. Weston was a perfect lamb--for there was no doubt about it, he, too, was "rooting" for Fred.</p>
<p>"I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go," Mrs. Childs said, at last, in a distressed voice. "No, Lolly, we haven't time to walk; we must take the car. Oh, Ellen, I meant to ask you: can't you join my bridge club? There's going to be a vacancy, and I'm sure you can learn--"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, I couldn't possibly! I'm so busy; I haven't a minute--"</p>
<p>"Well, think it over," Mrs. Childs urged. "And, Nelly dear, I know it will be all right about Fred. I'm sure William would say so. Don't worry!"</p>
<pb n="25     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>But when the door closed upon the escaping aunt and the sympathizing cousin, poor Mrs. Payton's worry overflowed into such endless details that at last her hearer gave up trying to comfort her. When he, too, made his escape, he was profoundly fatigued. His plea that Frederica should be allowed to burn her fingers so that she might learn the meaning of fire had not produced the slightest effect. To everything he said Mrs. Payton had opposed her outraged taste, her wounded love, her fixed belief in the duty of youth to age. When he ventured to quote that</p>
<q><l>"...it was better youth</l><l>Should strive, through acts uncouth,</l><l>Towards making, than repose on aught found made,"</l></q>
<p>she said poetry was all very well, but that, perhaps, if the poet or poetess who wrote that had had a daughter, they would think differently. When she was reminded that she, too, had had different ideas from those of her parents, she said, emphatically, <hi rend="italic">never!</hi>--except in things where they had grown a little old-fashioned.</p>
<p>"I don't believe, when I was a girl, I ever crossed Mama in anything more important than in little matters of dress or furnishings. . . .Oh, do look at my puzzle before you go!"</p>
<p>But Arthur Weston, almost dizzy with the endless words, had fled. Down-stairs, while he hunted for his hat and coat, he paused to draw a long breath and throw out his arms, as if he would stretch his cramped mind, as well as his muscles, stiffened by long relaxing among the cushions of the big arm-chair.</p>
<pb n="26     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Is there anything in this world duller than the pronunciamento of a dull woman!" he said to himself. On the street, for sheer relief of feeling the cool air against his face, instead of the warm stillness of Mrs. Payton's sitting-room, he did not hail the approaching car, but strolled aimlessly along the pavement, sticky with fog.</p>
<p>"I wonder if she talks in her sleep?" he said. "I don't believe she ever stops! How can Fred stand it?" He knew he couldn't stand it himself. "I'd sell popcorn on the street corer, to get away from it--and from Andy's old stovepipe!" It occurred to him that the ideals set forth in Mrs. Payton's ceaseless conversation were of the same era as the hat. "But the hat would fit Fred best," he thought--"Hello!" he broke off, as, straining back on the leash of an exasperated Scotch terrier, a girl came swinging around the corer of the street and caromed into him so violently that he nearly lost his balance.</p>
<p>"Grab him, will you?" she gasped; and when Mr. Weston had grabbed, and the terrier was sprawling abjectly under the discipline of a friendly cuff on his nose, she got her breath, and said, panting, "Where do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> spring from?"</p>
<p>It was Frederica Payton, her short serge skirt splashed with mud, and a lock of hair blown across her eyes. "He's a wretch, that pup!" she said. "I'll give him to you for a present."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't deprive you of him for the world!" he protested, in alarm. "Here, let me have the leash."</p>
<p>She relinquished it, and they walked back together toward Payton Street, Zip shambling meekly at their heels.</p>
<pb n="27     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Well," she said, thrusting a confiding arm in his, "were you able to move her? Or did she turn Aunt Bessie loose on you, too? I knew Aunt Bessie was to be asked to the funeral. I suppose she talked anti-suffrage, and quoted 'my William' every minute? Aunt Bessie hasn't had an idea of her own since the year one! Isn't it queer what stodgy minds middle-aged women have? I suppose you are about dead?"</p>
<p>"I have felt more lively. Fred, why can't you see your mother's side of it?"</p>
<p>"Why can't she see my side of it?"</p>
<p>"But she thinks--"</p>
<p>"But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think! What I object to in Mother is that she wants me to think her thoughts. Apart from the question of hypocrisy, I prefer my own." As she spoke, the light of a street lamp fell full on her face--a wolfish, unhumorous young face, pathetic with its hunger for life; he saw that her chin was twitching, and there was a wet gleam on one flushed cheek. "Besides," she said, "I simply won't go on spending my days as well as my nights in that house. You don't know what it means to live in the same house with--with--"</p>
<p>"I wish you were married," he said, helplessly; "that's the best way to get out of that house."</p>
<p>She laughed, and squeezed his arm. "You want to get off your job?" she said, maliciously; "well, you can't. I'm the Old Man of the Sea, and you'll have to carry me on your back for the rest of your life. No marriage in mine, thank you!"</p>
<p>They were sauntering along now in the darkness, her
<pb n="28     THE RISING TIDE"/>
arm still in his, and her cheek, in her eagerness, almost touching his shoulder; her voice was flippantly bitter:</p>
<p>"I don't want a man; I want an occupation!"</p>
<p>"But it isn't necessary, Fred. And besides, there are home duties."</p>
<p>"In our house? Name 'em! Shall I make the soap, or wait on the table and put Flora out of a job? Where people have any money at all, 'home duties,' so far as girls are concerned, are played out. Machinery is the cuckoo that has pushed women out of the nest of domesticity. I made that up," she added, with frank vanity. "I haven't a blessed thing to do in my good home--I suppose you heard that I had a 'good home'? which means a roof, and food, so far as I can make out. But as there is something besides eating and sleeping in this life, I am going to get busy outside of my 'good home'!"</p>
<p>He thought of the towels, but only murmured vaguely that there were things a girl could do which were not quite so--so--</p>
<p>"'Unwomanly'? That's Mother's word. Grandmother's is 'unladylike.' No, sir! I've done all the nice, 'womanly' things that girls who live at home have to do to kill time. I've painted--can't paint any more than Zip! And I've slummed. I hate poor people, they smell so. And I've taken singing lessons; I have about as much voice as a crow. My Suffrage League isn't work, it's fun. I might have tried nursing, but Grandmother had a fit; that 'warm heart' she's always handing out couldn't stand the idea of relieving male suffering. 'What!' she said, 'see a gen-
<pb n="29     THE RISING TIDE"/>
tleman entirely undressed, in his bed!' I said, 'It would be much more alarming to see him entirely dressed in his bed'!" She paused, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully; "it's queer about Grandmother--I don't really dislike her. She makes me mad, because she's such an awful old liar; but she's no fool."</p>
<p>"That's a concession. I hope you'll make as much for me."</p>
<p>"They were poor when she was a girl, and she had to do things--household things, I mean; really <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to. So she has stuff in her; and, in her way, she's a good sport. But she is narrow and coarse. 'See a gentleman in his bed!' And she thinks she's <hi rend="italic">modest</hi>! But poor dear Mother simply died on the spot when I mentioned nursing. So I gave that up. Well, I have to admit I wasn't very keen for it; I don't like sick people, dressed or undressed."</p>
<p>"They don't like themselves very much, Fred."</p>
<p>"I suppose they don't," she said, absently. "Well, nursing really wasn't my bat, so I have nothing against Mother on that lay. But you see, I've tried all the conventional things, and I've made up my mind to cut 'em out. Business is the thing for me. Business!"</p>
<p>"But isn't there a question of duty?" he said.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to Mortimore? Poor wretch! That's what Mother harps on from morning to night. What duty have I to Mortimore? I'm not responsible for him. I didn't bring him here. Mother has a duty to him, I grant you. She owes him--good Lord! how much she owes him! Apologies, to begin with. What right had she and 'old Andy Payton' to bring him into the world?
<pb n="30     THE RISING TIDE"/>
I should think they would have been ashamed of themselves. Father was old and dissipated; and there was an uncle of his, you know, like Mortimore. His 'intellect was there,' too, but it was very decidedly 'veiled'! I suppose Mother worked the 'veiled intellect' off on you?"</p>
<p.They had reached the Payton house by this time, and Frederica, her hand on the gate, paused in the rainy dusk and looked into Arthur Weston's face, with angry, unabashed eyes. "Don't talk to me about a duty to Mortimore!"</p>
<p>"I meant a duty to your mother. Think of what you owe your mother."</p>
<p>"What do I owe her? Life! Did I ask for life? Was I consulted? Before I am grateful for life, you've got to prove that I've liked living. So far, I haven't. Who would, with Mortimore in the house? When I was a child I couldn't have girls come and see me for fear he would come shuffling about." He saw her shoulders twitch with the horror of that shuffling. "It makes me tired, this rot about a child's gratitude and duty to a parent! It's the other way round, as I look at it; the parent owes the child a lot more than the child owes the parent. Did 'old Andy' and Mama bring me into this world for my pleasure? You know they didn't. 'Duty to parents'--that talk won't go down," she said, harshly, and snapped the gate shut between them.</p>
<p>He looked at her helplessly. She was wrong, but much of what she had said was right,--or, rather, accurate. But when, in all the history of parenthood, had there been a time when children accused their fathers and mothers
<pb n="31     THE RISING TIDE"/>
of selfishness, and cited their own existence as a proof of that selfishness! "Your mother will be very lonely," he said.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Mother doesn't need me in the least. A puzzle of a thousand pieces is a darned sight more interesting than I am."</p>
<p>"You are a puzzle in one piece," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not as much use to Mother as Father's old silk hat down in the hall; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never scared a burglar yet. I tell you what, Mother and I have about as much in common as--as Zip and that awful iron dog! Mother thinks she is terribly noble because she devotes herself to Mortimore. Mr. Weston, she enjoys devoting herself! She says she's doing her duty. I suppose she is, though I would call it instinct, not duty. Anyhow, there's nothing noble about it. It's just nature. Mother is like a cat or a cow; they adore their offspring. And they have a perfect right to lick 'em all over, or anything else that expresses cat-love. But you don't say they are 'noble' when they lick 'em! And cows don't insist that other cows shall lick calves that are not theirs. Mortimore isn't mine. Yes; that's where Mother isn't as sensible as a cow. She can give herself up all she wants to, but she sha'n't give me up. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> won't lick Mortimore!" She was quivering, and her eyes were tragic. "Why, Flora has more in common with me than Mother, for Flora is at least dissatisfied--poor old Flora! Whereas Mother is as satisfied as a vegetable. That's why she's an anti. No; she isn't even a vegetable; vegetables grow! Mother's mind stopped growing when her first baby was born. Mother
<pb n="32     THE RISING TIDE"/>
and I don't speak the same language. I don't suppose she means to be cruel," she ended, "but she is."</p>
<p>"Did it ever occur to you that you are cruel?"</p>
<p>She winced at that; he saw her bite her lip, and for a moment she did not speak. Then she burst out: "That's the worst of it. I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> cruel. I say things--and then, afterward, I could kick myself. Yet they are true. What can I do? I tell the truth, and then I feel as if I had--had kicked Zip in the stomach!"</p>
<p>"Stop kicking Zip anywhere," he admonished her; "it's bad taste."</p>
<p>"But if I don't speak out, I'll <hi rend="italic">bust</hi>!"</p>
<p>"Well, bust," he said, dryly; "that's better than kicking Zip."</p>
<p>Her face broke into a grin, and she leaned over the gate to give his arm a squeeze. "I don't know how I'd get along without you," she told him. "Darn that pup!" she said, and dashed after Zip's trailing leash.</p>
<p>Arthur Weston, looking after her, laughed, and waved his hand. "How young she is! Well, I'll put the office business through for her."</p>
<pb n="33"/>
<div n="3" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER III</head>
<p>SOMEHOW or other he did "put the office business through"; but the persuading of Mrs. Payton was a job of many days. So far as opinions went, he had to concede almost everything; of course Freddy's project was "absurd"; of course "girls didn't do such things" when Mrs. Payton was a young lady;--still, why not let Fred find out by experience how foolish her scheme of self-support was?</p>
<p>"It mortifies me to death," Mrs. Payton moaned.</p>
<p>"I don't like it myself," he admitted.</p>
<p>"What does Mr. Maitland say to it?"</p>
<p>"She says he says it's 'corking,'" Arthur Weston quoted; "I wish they would talk English! The smallness of their vocabulary is dreadfully stupid. They think it is smart to be laconic, but it's only boring. Do you think Fred cares about Maitland?"</p>
<p>"I wish she did, but she isn't--human! Rather different from my girlhood days! Then, a girl liked to have beaux. One of my cousins had a set of spoons--she bought one whenever she had a proposal. I don't think Freddy has had a single offer. I tell her it's because she cheapens herself by being so familiar with the young men. Not an offer! But I don't believe she's at all mortified. Well,
<pb n="34     THE RISING TIDE"/>
it's just part of the 'newness' of things. I dislike everything that is new! I wish Freddy would get married.". . .</p>
<p>"Why," Mr. Weston pondered, as, having wrung a reluctant consent from Mrs. Payton, he closed the door of No. 15 behind him, "why do we consider marriage the universal panacea?" But whether he knew why or not, he believed it was a panacea, and even plotted awkwardly to administer it to Frederica. Maitland was just the man for her; a good fellow, straight and clean, and with money behind him. The worst of it was that he could not be counted on to discourage Fred's folly; indeed, he seemed immensely taken by all her schemes; the more preposterous she was, the more, apparently, he admired her. He was as full of half-baked ideas as Fred herself! But there was this difference between them: Howard did not give you the sense of being abnormal; he was only asinine. And every first-rate boy has to be an ass before he amounts to anything as a man.</p>
<p>But Fred was not normal.</p>
<p>A week later, "<hi rend="italic">F. Payton</hi>" had been painted on the index of the Sturtevant Building, and Arthur Weston, pausing as he got out of the elevator, glanced at the gilt letters with ironical eyes. He was about to let the panels of the revolving door push him into the street when Mr. William Childs entered and hooked an umbrella on his arm.</p>
<p>"Hey! Weston! Most interesting thing: do you recall the twenty-third Sonnet? You don't? Begins:</p>
<q>"'As an imperfect actor on the stage';</q>
<p>I've made a most interesting discovery!"</p>
<pb n="35     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>His prisoner, saying despairingly, "Really?" looked for a way of escape--but the crook of the umbrella held him.</p>
<p>"In a hurry? Hey? What? Well, I'll tell you some other time." Then the umbrella was reversed and pointed to the index. "Perfec' nonsense! What?"</p>
<p>"Girls are very energetic nowadays," Mr. Weston murmured, rubbing his arm.</p>
<p>"She'd better put her energy into housekeeping!"</p>
<p>"Then Mrs. Payton would have nothing to do."</p>
<p>"Well, then let her get married, and keep house for herself,--instead of laying down the law to her elders! She instructed me who I should vote for, if you please! Smith is her man, because he believes in woman suffrage. What do you think of that?"</p>
<p>"I think she's a good deal like you or me, when we want a thing put through."</p>
<p>"No such thing! Smith is the worst boss this state ever had. I told her so, and--Hey, there! Stop--I'm going up!" he called, wildly; and skipped into the elevator. "Tell her to get married!" he called down to Arthur Weston, who watched his ascending spats, and then let the revolving door urge him into the street. "There it is again," he ruminated, "'get married.' But girls don't marry for homes nowadays, my dear William. There are no more 'Clinging Vines.' Mrs. Payton is one of the last of them, and, Lord! what a blasted oak she clung to!" He had an unopened letter from Mrs. Payton in his pocket, and as he sauntered along he wondered whether, if it remained unopened for another hour or two, he could
<pb n="36     THE RISING TIDE"/>
lie truthfully to her and say he had not received it "in time" to come and talk over Freddy. "For that's what she wants, of course," he thought, dolefully; "it's a nice point of conscience. I'll go and sit in the park and think it out. By the time I decide, it will be too late to go--and then I'll open the letter! Why do women who have nothing to say, always write long letters?"--he touched the envelope with an appraising thumb and finger--"eight pages, all full of Freddy's sins!"</p>
<p>Rambling toward the park in the warm November afternoon Arthur Weston wondered just what was the matter with Fred. When, ten years before, he had gone abroad to represent the Payton interests in France (and, incidentally, to cure a heart which had been very roughly handled by a lady whose vocation was the collecting of hearts), Frederica had been a plain, boring, long-legged youngster, who disconcerted him by her silent and persistent stare. She was then apparently like any other fourteen-year-old girl--gawky, dull, and, to a blighted being of thirty-six, entirely uninteresting. When he came home, nine years later (heart-whole), to render an account of his Payton stewardship, it was to find with dismay that "old Andy," just deceased, had expressed his appreciation of services rendered by naming him one of the executors of the Payton estate, and to find, also, that the grubby, silent girl he had left when he went to Europe had shot up into a tall, rather angular woman, no longer silent, and most provokingly interesting. She was still plain, but she had one of those primitive faces which, while sometimes actually ugly, are, under the stress of certain
<pb n="37     THE RISING TIDE"/>
emotions, extraordinarily handsome. She was never pretty; there was too much thought in the jutting lines of her brow and chin, and her cheeks, smudged sometimes with red, sometimes rigidly pale, had no dimpling suggestion of a smile. Her gray, unhumorous eyes still held one by their nakedly direct gaze, even while a bludgeon-like truthfulness of speech made her hearers wince away from her.</p>
<p>Now, except for her rather tiresome slang, she never bored Arthur Weston; she merely bothered him--because he was so powerless to help her. He found himself constantly wondering about her; but his wonder was always good-natured; it had none of the bitterness which marked the bewilderment of her elderly relatives, or the very freely expressed contempt of her masculine cousins. Her man of business felt only amusement, and a pity which made him, at moments, ready to abet her maddest notions, just to give the wild young creature a little comfort. Yet he never forgot Mrs. Payton's pain; for, no matter whether she was reasonable or not, he knew that Freddy's mother suffered.</p>
<p>"I'd like to shake Fred!" he said; "confound it, I run with the hare and hunt with the hounds!"</p>
<p>In the park, in his discouragement at the whole situation, he sat down on one of the concrete benches by the lake, and looked at the children and nursery-maids, and at two swans, snow-white on the dark water. He wished he could feel that Fred was all right or her mother all wrong; but both were right, and both were wrong. Nevertheless, he realized that Fred's suffering moved him more than
<pb n="38     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Mrs. Payton's. Think of having the "veiled intellect" in the ell, "shuffling round" all the time! "But that's life," he reminded himself. Duty handcuffs all of us to our relations. Look at the historic Aunt Adelaide, who wouldn't take any of her beaux--there were more of them every time Mrs. Payton talked of Fred's shortcomings! Aunt Adelaide had turned her beaux down because of this thing called Duty, a word which apparently conveyed nothing whatever to the mind of her grandniece Miss Frederica Payton, who, however, had her own word--<hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>. A word which had once caused her to describe Aunt Adelaide's self-immolation as "damned silly."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston, looking idly at the swans curving their necks and thrusting their bills down into the black water, felt that though Fred's taste was vile, her judgment was sound--it was silly for Aunt Adelaide to sacrifice herself on the altar of a being absolutely useless to society. Then he thought, uneasily, of the possible value to Aunt Adelaide's character of self-sacrifice. "No," he decided, "self-sacrifice which denies common sense isn't virtue; it's spiritual dissipation!"</p>
<p>Then his mind drifted to Laura Childs; Laura was not so hideously truthful as Fred, and her conceit was not quite so obvious; yet she, too, was of the present--full of preposterous theories for reforming the universe! Her activities overflowed the narrow boundaries of domesticity, just as Fred's did; she went to the School of Design, and perpetrated smudgy charcoal-sketches; she had her committees, and her clubs, every other darned, tiresome thing that a tired man, coming home from business, shrinks from
<pb n="39     THE RISING TIDE"/>
hearing discussed, as he would shrink from the noises of his shop or factory. "'The new wine's foaming flow'!--I should think Billy-boy would spank her," Weston thought, sympathetically. Furthermore, Laura detected, with affectionate contempt, the weak places in her elder's armor of pompous authority. He had heard her take off her father's "perfec' nonsense"! Her comments upon her mother's lazy plumpness were as accurate as they were disrespectful. Imagine girls back in the '70's, or even the'80's, doing such things! Yet Laura differed, somehow, from Fred; she was--he couldn't formulate it. He looked absently at the babies, and the nursery-maids, and then the dim idea took shape: you could think of Laura and babies together, but a baby in Frederica's arms was ananomaly. Why? After all, she was a female thing; you ought to be able to picture her with a baby. But you couldn't. "I wish," Arthur Weston began;--but before he could decide exactly what he wished, out of the brown haze across the park came young Maitland, swinging along, as attractive a chap as you would see in a day's work. He hailed the older man joyously, and, standing up before him with his hands in his pockets, began to josh him unmercifully.</p>
<p>"Is She late? I bet She's jealous of all these dames with white caps on! You should choose a more secluded spot."</p>
<p>"She is very late, Howard, and she will be later. She has got to have little curls in the back of her neck, and be afraid of sitting here without a chaperon. And she must have rubbers on, because there is no surer way of taking
<pb n="40     THE RISING TIDE"/>
cold than by having damp feet. And she must do all that all her great-aunts have done. I won't accept her on any other terms. So you see, I shall have to wait sometime for her. In fact, I have given her up. Sit down. I want to talk to you."</p>
<p>Maitland sat down, and said he thought one of those hoop-skirted, ringleted damsels would be a good deal of a peach. "You see the photographs of 'em in old albums, and they certainly were pretty things."</p>
<p>"Howard, Freddy Payton's going into business. Did you know it?"</p>
<p>"Yes; she's a wonder!"</p>
<p>"She is," the other man agreed, dryly.</p>
<p>"I was talking to Laura Childs about her last night, and she told me how tough it was for her at home,--<hi rend="italic">you</hi> know?"</p>
<p>Mr. Weston nodded.</p>
<p>"And her mother is an anti!" Howard said, sympathetically. "I've only seen Mrs. Payton once or twice, but it struck me she was the anti type. Not very exciting to live with."</p>
<p>"She does show considerable cerebral quietude," Weston admitted, chuckling.</p>
<p>"Did you ever make a call in the Payton house, and see old Andy Payton's silk hat on the hat-rack?"</p>
<p>"I have. But I'm not afraid of it;--there are no brains in it now."</p>
<p>"Well, I told Laura I thought she was the finest woman I knew," Maitland said, earnestly.</p>
<p>"Who? Lolly?"</p>
<pb n="41     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Heavens, no! Fred. She's no Victorian miss, I tell you what!"</p>
<p>"The Victorians would send her to bed on bread and water."</p>
<p>"I heard her make a speech to those striking garment-women," Fred's defender said; "she told 'em to get the vote, and their wages would go up. It was fine."</p>
<p>"Whether it was true is immaterial?"</p>
<p>Howard did not go into that. "And then, about morals; she talks to you just like another man. There's none of this business of pretending she doesn't know things. She knows as much about life as you or I."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't pretend to know as much as you," Arthur Weston deprecated, lifting a humorously modest eyebrow.</p>
<p>"She talks well, too, doesn't she?" Howard rambled on; "I don't know what she's talking about sometimes, she's so confoundedly cultivated. The other day I said something about that nasty uplift play that they tried to pull off at the Penn Street Theater; and then I jerked myself up, and sort of apologized. And Freddy said, 'Go ahead; what's eating you?' And I said, 'Oh, well, I didn't know whether I ought to speak of that sort of thing.' And she said, 'Only the truth shall make us free.' That's out of the Bible, I believe."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston nodded. "I know the book. I've even read it, which is probably more than either you or Fred have done. I don't think it says the truth shall make you free--and easy; does it?"</p>
<p>Howard laughed, and got on his feet. "I'm going to beat up business for her. I took her round in my car to
<pb n="42     THE RISING TIDE"/>
look up apartments for those relations of yours. Why doesn't Mrs. Payton have a car? Haven't they money enough?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. But that poor creature, the brother, has to go out in a carriage. An auto would excite him, I suppose."</p>
<p>"I see. I told Fred she ought to have a little motor of her own, just as a matter of business."</p>
<p>"Hold on!" Frederica's trustee remonstrated, in alarm. "Take her in your car, if you want to, but please don't suggest one for her. She'd have to put a mortgage on her office furniture to pay for a week's gasoline! Look here, Howard--don't stand there like the Colossus of Rhodes, looking down at me as if I only weighed as much as one of your legs--tell me this: don't you see that this business of Fred's earning her living is perfectly artificial? She has a little income, and she can live on it; and when her mother dies, she'll have all the Payton money. So it is entirely unnecessary for her to go to work, to say nothing of the fact that she won't earn enough to buy her shoe-strings."</p>
<p>"Oh, but," the young man burst out, "look at the principle involved! If you live on inherited money, you're a parasite. I know I do it myself," he confessed, frankly, "but I'm going to work as soon as I can get a job. I'm going in for shells. And I believe in work for a woman just as much as for a man. The trouble is that when a girl has money, there isn't any <hi rend="italic">real</hi> work for her, so she has to manufacture an occupation--like this social-service stunt at the hospitals they're so hot on nowadays. Joe

Gould--he's an interne--he told me the most of 'em were nuisances. But, oh, how they enjoy it! They just lap it up. It makes me a little fatigued to hear 'em talk about it," he said, yawning. "Laura Childs doesn't talk much, but Gould says the patients like to have her come round, because she's good to look at. But with most girls it isn't real. And if a girl doesn't do real things, if she just amuses herself, she'll go stale, just like a fellow. Fred put that up to me," he explained, modestly. "I wouldn't have thought of it myself."</p>
<p>"I bet you wouldn't!" Arthur Weston said; "but don't you see? Fred's own occupation isn't real."</p>
<p>"She's rather down on me because I'm not in politics," Howard said, drolly; "did you ever notice that reformers don't take other people's stunts very seriously? Fred has no use for shells. Laura thinks my collection is great. But Fred says that it's only an amusement."</p>
<p>"You might do worse," the older man told him; "but never mind that. What I want to know is, why don't some of you fellows brace up and ask Freddy to marry you?"</p>
<p>"She wouldn't look at any of us. I don't know any man who could keep up with her mentally! You ought to hear her talk."</p>
<p>Mr. Weston raised a protesting hand. "Please! I've heard her."</p>
<p>Maitland laughed and strode off into the dusk, leaving Arthur Weston to sit and look at the swans. The nursery-maids and perambulators had gone; the Chinese pagoda on the artificial island showed a sudden spark of light, and
<pb n="44     THE RISING TIDE"/>
the arc-lamps across the park sputtered into the evening haze like lurching moons. The chill of the water and the night made him shiver. That youngster was so big and up-standing and satisfied with life! And certainly he was in love with Fred.</p>
<p>"Then she'll be off my hands," Fred's man of business said; "what a relief!"</p>
<p>And life looked as bleak and uninteresting as the cold dusk of the deserted park.</p>
<pb n="45"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV</head>
<p>I NEVER see her from morning till night," Mrs. Payton said. "Rather different from my day! When I was a young lady, girls stayed indoors with their mothers."</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton's mother, stroking her white gloves down over her knuckly fingers, shrugged her shoulders: "You didn't like 'those days' so very much yourself, my dear. But of course Freddy is shocking. It isn't that she has bad taste--she has no taste! All I hope is that she won't publicly disgrace us. Bessie Childs says that her husband says this business idea is perfect nonsense."</p>
<p>The two ladies were in the double parlor on the left of the wide hall of No 15. It was a gloomy place, even when the ailanthus-trees had lost their leaves; the French windows were so smothered in plush and lace that the gleam of narrow mirrors between them could not lighten the costly ugliness. In its day the room had been very costly. The carpet, with its scrolls and garlands, the ebony cabinets, picked out in gilt--big and foolish and empty--the oil-paintings in vast, tarnished frames, must all have been very expensive. There was an ormolu clock on the black marble mantelpiece holding Time stationary at 7.20 o'clock of some forgotten morning or evening; the bronzes on either side of it--a fisher-maid with her string of fish,
<pb n="46     THE RISING TIDE"/>
and a hunter bearing an antelope on his shoulders--were dulled by the smoky years. Opposite the fireplace, against the chocolate-brown wall-paper, Andrew Payton, on a teakwood pedestal, glimmered in white marble blindness. Beside him, the key-board of a grand piano was yellowing in untouched silence. The room was so dim that Mrs. Holmes, coming in out of the sunshine, stumbled over a rug.</p>
<p>"You have such a clutter of things, Ellen," she complained, sharply.</p>
<p>"It's lighter up-stairs," Mrs. Payton defended herself.</p>
<p>"What did you say? Do speak more distinctly!"</p>
<p>"I said it was lighter up-stairs. Come up, and I'll show you a puzzle I've just worked out. Dreadfully difficult!"</p>
<p>But Mrs. Holmes never went up-stairs in the Payton house; to be sure, the door between the sitting-room and the room beyond it was always locked, but--<hi rend="italic">you heard things</hi>. So she said she couldn't climb the stairs. "I'm getting old, I'm afraid," she said, archly.</p>
<p>"I suppose you are very rheumatic?" her daughter sympathized; "why don't you try--"</p>
<p>"Not at all!" the older lady interrupted; "just a little stiff. Mrs. Dale said her cousin thought you were my sister," she added, maliciously.</p>
<p>As far as clothes went, the cousin might have supposed Mrs. Holmes was Mrs. Payton's daughter--the skirt in the latest ugliness of style, the high heels, the white veil over the elaborate hair, were all far more youthful than the care-worn mother of Frederica (and Mortimore) would have permitted herself.</p>
<pb n="47     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I've been so dreadfully busy," Mrs. Holmes declared; "I meant to come in yesterday, but I had a thousand things to do! Bridge all afternoon at Bessie Childs's. I played with young Mrs. Dale. She ought to get another dressmaker."</p>
<p>"Did you know Mr. Dale's aunt was dying?" Mrs. Payton said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes frowned. She was, as she often said, a very busy woman; she kept house, made calls, had "fittings," shopped, and read the newspapers. She did these things well and thoroughly, for, as her granddaughter had once said, she "was no fool." She was shrewd, capable, energetic, and entirely a woman of the world. Her daughter's social seclusion and mental apathy amazed and irritated her. But intelligent and busy as she was, she had leisure for one thing: <hi rend="italic">Fear</hi>. She never said of what. Nor would she, if she could help it, allow the name of her Fear to be mentioned. "I always run away if people talk of unpleasant things!" she used to say, sharply. The mere reference to Mr. Dale's aunt made her pull her stole about her shoulders, and clutch for bags and card-cases that were always sliding off a steep and slippery lap.</p>
<p>"Why, Mama, you mustn't go," Mrs. Payton remonstrated, "you've just--"</p>
<p>"I only stopped a minute to say that if you don't keep Freddy in order, she will disgrace us all," Mrs. Holmes said, nervously; "but you keep talking about unpleasant things! I am all heart, and I can't bear to hear about other people's troubles."</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton understood; she gave her mother a piti-
<pb n="48     THE RISING TIDE"/>
ful look. ("I believe she'd like to live to be a hundred!" she thought; "whereas, if it wasn't for poor Mortimore I'd be glad to go; I'm so--tired. And Freddy wouldn't miss me.") All the while she was talking in her kind voice, of living, not dying; of her intention of starting in early this year on her Christmas presents--"I get perfectly worn out with them each Christmas!" Of her cook's impertinence--"servants are really impossible!" Of Flora's low-spiritedness--"Miss Carter says she's simply wild to get married, but I can't think so; Flora is so refined."</p>
<p>"Human nature isn't very refined," Mrs. Holmes said.</p>
<p>"Miss Carter says she wants to take music lessons."</p>
<p>"That's terribly refined," Mrs. Holmes said, satirically.</p>
<p>"It's absurd," her daughter declared, with annoyance; "music lessons! Rather different from the time I went to housekeeping--then, servants worked! I gave Flora a lovely embroidered collar the other day; and yet, the next thing I knew, Anne told me she was crying her eyes out down in the coal-cellar. I went right down to the cellar, and said, 'You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> tell me what's the matter.' But all I could get out of her was that she was tired of living. Miss Carter says Anne says that Flora's young man has married somebody else, and she--"</p>
<p>"Don't mumble! It's almost impossible to hear you," her mother broke in; "as for servants, there are no such things nowadays. They have men callers, a thing my mother never tolerated! And they don't dream of being in at ten. My seventh cook in five months comes tomorrow."</p>
<pb n="49     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Don't you think you are rather strict--I mean about hours, and beaux, and all that sort of thing? My three all have beaux--only poor Flora's don't seem very faithful. Mama, don't you think you ought to see an aurist? You really are a little--"</p>
<p>"Not at all! I hear perfectly;--except when people mumble. And I shall never change; my way of keeping house is the right way, so why should I change?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't keep my girls a week if I were as strict as you," Mrs. Payton ventured.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be much loss, my dear!" the older woman said; she ran a white-gloved finger along the top of the piano beside her, and held it up, with a dry laugh. "You could eat off the floor in my house; but you never were much of a housekeeper. However, I didn't come to talk about servants; I came to tell you that I am going to call on those cousins of Mr Weston's, and explain that at any rate <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't approve of my granddaughter's going into business!"</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't, either!" poor Mrs. Payton protested. "I am dreadfully distr--"</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell her it isn't <hi rend="italic">done</hi>? Why do you allow it?" Mrs. Holmes demanded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton raised protesting hands: "'Allow' Freddy?"</p>
<p>"If you'd stop her allowance, you'd stop her nonsense. That is what I would do if a daughter of mine cut such didos!"</p>
<p>"I can't--she's of age. You can't control girls nowadays," Mrs. Payton sighed.</p>
<pb n="50     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"She ought to be married," said Mrs. Holmes, clutching at the back of a gilt chair as she got on to her shaking old legs; "though I can't imagine any nice man wanting to marry a girl who talks as she does. Maria Spencer told me she heard that Fred said that men ought not to be allowed to marry unless they had a health certificate."</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton gasped with horror. "Mama! are you <hi rend="italic">sure</hi>? I can't believe--What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> we coming to?"</p>
<p>"It mortified me to death," said Mrs. Holmes. ("Oh, do pick up that card-case for me!) I wish Arthur Weston would marry her, but I suppose he never got over that Morrison girl's behavior? No; the real trouble is, you insist on living in this out-of-the-way place! Oh, yes, I know; poor Mortimore. Still, the men won't come after her here, because it looks as if she had no money--that, and her queerness. Really, you ought to try to get her settled. You ought to move over to the Hill; but you love that poor, brainless creature up-stairs more than you do Fred!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton stiffened. "I love both my children just the same; and I can't discuss Mortimore, Mama, with anybody. As for being brainless, Doctor Davis always said, 'The intellect is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>; but it is veiled.'" The tears brimmed over. "You don't understand a mother's feelings, Mama."</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes shrugged her shoulders and brushed a powdered cheek against her daughter's worn face. "Goodby. Of course, you never take any advice--I'm used to that! If I wasn't the warmest-hearted creature in the
<pb n="51     THE RISING TIDE"/>
world I should be very cross with you. I suppose you are terribly lonely without Freddy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, terribly," said Mrs. Payton.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Holmes had gone, teetering uncertainly down the front steps to her carriage, Freddy's mother, pausing a moment in the hall to make sure that Mr. Andrew Payton's silk hat had been dusted, went heavily up-stairs and sat down in her big cushioned chair. She wished that she had something to do. Of course, there was that new puzzle--but sometimes the thought of a puzzle gave her a qualm of repulsion, the sort of repulsion one feels at the sight of the drug that soothes and disgusts at the same moment. The household mending was a more wholesome anodyne; but there was very little of that; she had gone all through Freddy's stockings the day before, and found only one thin place. To-day there seemed nothing to do but sit in her soft chair and think of Freddy's shocking talk and how unkind Mrs. Holmes was about Mortimore. She knew, in the bottom of her heart, that her son's presence was painful to everybody except herself; she knew that Freddy didn't like to have people call, for fear they might see him, and that her reluctance dated back to her childhood. "But suppose she doesn't like it, what has that got to do with it?" Morty's mother thought, angrily; "it's a question of duty. Mama doesn't seem to remember that Freddy ought to do her duty!" It came over Mrs. Payton, with a thrill of pride, that she herself had always done her duty. Here, alone, with everything silent on the other side of the bolted door, she could allow her-
<pb n="52     THE RISING TIDE"/>
self to think how well she had done it! To Mortimore, first and foremost--she paused there, with a pang of annoyance at her mother's words: "I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> love him best!" she declared. She did her duty to Freddy, just as much as to Morty. When Fred had scarlet fever no mother could have been more devoted. She hadn't taken her clothes off for four days and nights! Her supreme dutifulness, however, a dutifulness of which she had always been acutely conscious, was in enduring Andrew's behavior. "Some women wouldn't have stood it," she thought, proudly. But what a good wife she had been! She had let him have his own way in everything. When he was cross, she had been silent. When he was drunk, she had wept--silently, of course. When he had done other things, of which anonymous letters had informed her, she had still been silent;--but she had been too angry to weep. She shivered involuntarily to think what would have happened if she had not been silent--if she had dared to remonstrate with him! For Andrew Payton's temper had been as celebrated as the brains which had once filled the now empty hat. "Some wives would have left him," she told herself; "but I always did my duty! Nobody ever supposed that I--<hi rend="italic">knew</hi>." When Andrew died, and her friends were secretly rejoicing over her release, how careful she had been to wear the very deepest crape! "I didn't go out of the house, even to church, for three weeks, and I didn't use a plain white handkerchief for two years," she thought--then flushed, for, side by side with her satisfaction at her exemplary conduct was a rankling memory--a memory which made her constantly tell herself, and
<pb n="53     THE RISING TIDE"/>
everybody else, that she "loved both her children just the same." The remorse--for it amounted to that--began a few weeks after Mr. Payton's death, when Freddy, listening to her mother's pride in the black-bordered handkerchief, had flung out: "If you told the truth, you'd use a flag for a handkerchief, and you'd go to church to return thanks!"</p>
<p>There had been a dreadful scene between the mother and daughter that day.</p>
<p>"As for 'mourning' him," Andrew Payton's daughter said, "you don't. It's a lie to smother yourself in that horrid, sticky veil. You are mighty glad to get rid of him! You were as afraid as death of him, and you didn't love him at all. All this talk about 'mourning' is rot."</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton cowered as if her daughter had struck her: "Oh, how can you be so wicked!"</p>
<p>"Is it wicked to tell the truth?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton clasped and unclasped her hands: "I did my duty! But do you suppose I've been <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>?" Her breath caught in a sob. "I've lived in hell all these years, just to make a home for you! I did my duty."</p>
<p>"I should have thought 'duty' would have made you leave him," Frederica said; "hell isn't a very good home for a child." She was triumphantly aware that she had said something smart; her mother's wincing face admitted it. "I suppose you were afraid to make a break while he was alive," she said, "but why not tell the truth now?"</p>
<p>Already the consciousness of self-betrayal had swept over Andy Payton's wife; her face flamed with anger. "You had no business to make me say a thing like that!
<pb n="54     THE RISING TIDE"/>
You only tell the truth to hurt my feelings. <hi rend="italic">You are just like Andrew!</hi>" She looked straight at her daughter, her eyes fierce with candor. "I love Mortimore best," she said, in a whisper.</p>
<p>For a single instant they stared at each other like two strangers. The mother was the first to come to herself. "I--I didn't mean that, Freddy. I love you both alike. But it was wicked to speak so of your father."</p>
<p>"I was a beast to hurt your feelings!" Frederica said; "and I don't in the least mind your loving Mortimore best. But what I said about Father is true; his being my father doesn't alter the fact that he was horrid. Mother, you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> he was horrid! Don't let's pretend, at any rate to each other."</p>
<p>Her face twitched with eagerness to be understood; she tried to put her arm around her mother; but Mrs. Payton turned a rigid cheek to her lips; and instantly Fred lapsed back into contempt of unreality. The fact was, the deed was done. Each had told the other the truth. Mother and daughter had both seen the flash of the blade of fact as it cut pretense between them. Never again would Mrs. Payton's vanity over duty done dare to raise its head in her daughter's presence: Freddy knew that, so far as her married life went, duty had been cowardly acquiescence. Never again would Frederica be able to fling at her mother her superior morality: Mrs. Payton knew she was cruel, knew she was "just like her father.". . . Like Andy Payton! She ground her teeth with disgust, but she could not deny it. She was so truthful that she saw the Truth; saw her father's intelligence in her own clear
<pb n="55     THE RISING TIDE"/>
mind; his ability in hers; his meanness in her ruthless smartness in proving a point. She hated him for these things--but she hated herself more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton told Arthur Weston of this revealing scene; but her confession confined itself to her remorse for having said she loved one child more than the other. "Of course I love them just <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> the same, but Freddy was wicked to speak disrespectfully of her father."</p>
<p>Then Frederica poured her contrition into his pitying ears.</p>
<p>"I was a beast, but I was not a liar."</p>
<p>"It isn't necessary to be a beast, to be truthful," he reminded her.</p>
<p>"I made her cry," she said. "Father used to do that. Do--do you think I'm like him?"</p>
<p>"Like your father? Good Lord, no!" he said, in horrified haste; then apologized. "I--I mean, Mr. Payton was a very able man, I had great respect for his brains; but he was--severe."</p>
<p>"'Severe'? Well, I'm 'severe,' I suppose? No; the trouble with me is, I'm hideously truthful--<hi rend="italic">and I like to be</hi>."</p>
<pb n="56"/>

<p>THE ridiculous part of Fred's dash for freedom was that she actually picked up a client or two! Of course, her commissions did not quite pay for the advertising that brought the clients--"But what difference does that make?" she demanded.</p>
<p>Arthur Weston, who had come up to the "office" on the tenth floor to check over a bill for her, said, "Oh, no difference, of course. You remind me of the old lady, Fred, who bought eggs for twenty-four cents a dozen and sold them for twenty-three cents. And when asked how she could afford to do that, said it was because she sold so many of them."</p>
<p>"I don't care," she said, doggedly; "when you begin you've got to put up something. I'm putting up my time. If I come out even--"</p>
<p>"You won't," he prophesied.</p>
<p>"Your old dames are coming to-morrow," she said. She had fastened Zip to the umbrella-rack and was sitting on her office table, showing a candid and very pretty leg in a thin silk stocking; she looked at him with the unself-conscious gaze of a child.</p>
<p>"They are to arrive at five, and I'm scared to death for fear that the walk to the Episcopal church is six feet short
<pb n="57     THE RISING TIDE"/>
of half a mile! I wish I had a motor to run around and look at places. Don't you think, as an investment, I could have a motor?"</p>
<p>"I do not!" he said. "Maitland made that alarming suggestion, and I told him not to put such ideas into your head."</p>
<p>"He's on the track of three Ohio girls who want five rooms and a bath, for light housekeeping, furnished. He's going to haul me round in his go-cart to look at some flats. Trouble is, I can't charge my full commission--they're poor. Students at the College of Elocution. Why do girls always want to elocute?"</p>
<p>"Why do they want to run real-estate offices? It's the same thing. Strikes me Howard hauls you round in his go-cart a good deal."</p>
<p>She shrieked with laughter. "Nothing ding! Nothing doing! I see your little hopeful thought. You've got me on your shoulders, like the aged Anchises, and you hoped that Howard might come to the rescue. Mr. Weston, I suppose your aunts, or cousins, or whatever they are, think I'm a freak?"</p>
<p>"Well, you are," he said; "I'll tell you what they think: they think (not having seen you) that you are a sweet girl who is doing something very kind for two old ladies."'</p>
<p>"A 'sweet girl'! Me, a 'sweet girl'?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry. You're not."</p>
<p>"I suppose they think I am doing it to please you? Very likely they think I'm trying to catch you," she said, chuckling.</p>
<p>He looked at her drolly: "Well, you've caught me.
<pb n="58     THE RISING TIDE"/>
You are a perfect nuisance, Fred, but you do serve to kill time."</p>
<p>She slipped down from the table, her high-heeled, low-cut shoes clicking sharply on the floor, and, going over to the window, peered down into the canon of the street. Zip scrabbled up, leaped the length of his leash, jumped, pounced, then put his nose on the floor between his paws and wagged his hindquarters. "No, sir!" she told him, "not yet!" And he crouched down again, patiently curling a furtive tongue over the toe of her shoe. "Howard was to come round for me in his car at four," she said. "Zip! Stop licking my shine off! I hate unpunctual people." Coming back to her caller, she fumbled in the pocket of her coat for her cigarette-case. "Have one?"</p>
<p>He helped himself and approved the quality.</p>
<p>"I offered Mr. Tait one," she said, "and his hair began to curl!"</p>
<p>"My hair is perfectly straight."</p>
<p>"That's the beauty of you. Yet Te&ecirc;te-a&agrave;-te&ecirc;te couldn't have given a reason for his horror, to save his life."</p>
<p>"I could."</p>
<p>She was plainly disappointed in him. "I thought better of you than that! There's no 'right' or 'wrong' about it."</p>
<p>"No, of course there isn't," he agreed; and she applauded him. "But there is a very excellent reason, all the same, why a girl shouldn't smoke."</p>
<p>"What?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"Makes her less agreeable to kiss."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll wait till somebody wants to kiss me," she said, gayly; "when they do, I'll give up cigarettes--and
<pb n="59     THE RISING TIDE"/>
take to a pipe!" She pulled down the top of her desk and slipped the loop of the puppy's leash on her wrist. "As for smoking," she confessed, "I'm not awfully keen on it. Sometimes I forget to open my cigarette-case for days! But I have just as much <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to do it as you have."</p>
<p>The defiance made him laugh. "That's like your sex, insisting that, because we make fools of ourselves, you will make fools of yourselves. That's your principle in demanding an unlimited suffrage."</p>
<p>But Fred was not listening. "I'm afraid you must clear out," she said; "Howard must be on hand by this time."</p>
<p>"I wonder when you'll earn the cost of that desk?" he mused, and looked about the office, with its one big window that muffled the roar of the city ten stories below, and framed, black against a lowering sky, the far-off circle of the hills. It was a gaunt little room, with its desk and straight chairs, and its walls hung with real-estate maps. A vision of Mrs. Payton's fire-lit upholstery flashed into his mind, and made him smile. What a contrast! "But this interests Fred," he thought; "and the petticoated easy-chairs don't. And the only thing that makes life endurable is an interest." He wondered, vaguely, what interests he had himself. Certainly his trustee accounts were not very vital interests! It occurred to him, watching Fred thrust some long and vicious pins through a very rakish hat, that when she settled down and married Maitland he would lose a distinct interest. "I'll have to transfer it to her infants," he thought, cynically; "I suppose I'll be godfather to the lot of 'em, and she and Howard, in
<pb n="60     THE RISING TIDE"/>
the privacy of connubial bliss, will speculate as to how much I'll leave 'em-- Damned if I leave them anything!" he ended, with a flare of temper.</p>
<p>"Come on," said Fred.</p>
<p>They went down-stairs together, and waited in the cold for five minutes until Howard came, brakes on, against the curb, in a great hurry, but not in the least apologetic.</p>
<p>"I stopped to look at some shells at Beasley's," he vouchsafed as Fred was climbing into the car; then opened his throttle, and Mr. Weston, standing on the corner, watched them leap away down the crowded street.</p>
<p>"Look at him trying to cut in ahead of everybody!" he reflected; "but she thinks he's perfect."</p>
<p>If Fred believed her cavalier perfect, that did not keep her from criticizing his driving. Howard, too, was entirely frank, and told her her nose was red. After that they talked about the Ohio girls, and when they reached South G Street, leaving Zip on guard in the auto, he went all over the flat with her, and said the kitchenette was a slick place, but the bath-room was small--"and dark," he objected, following her in, and peering about at the plumbing. Then they decided that they had just time to whiz around to the apartment she had arranged for Arthur Weston's cousins. "They are to come to-morrow," she said.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Payton had seen her Freddy that afternoon, she would hardly have known her. No girl of Mrs. Payton's youth could have been more efficient as to dust; and certainly few young ladies of that golden time would have 
<pb n="61     THE RISING TIDE"/>
made better arrangements for storing away the kindling, nor would they have trampled a negligent plumber more completely underfoot than did Frederica Payton. She had sent Howard flying in his car to bring the man, and she stood over him until he finished his job; then packed him and his kit out of the apartment and washed his horrid finger-marks off the white paint. In the parlor, she sat down on the sofa, drawing up her feet and snuggling back against the cushions.</p>
<p>"This is mighty nice," she said, looking around with a satisfaction as old as the cave-dweller's who hung skins on dripping walls and spread rushes over stone floors.</p>
<p>Howard, sprawling luxuriously in an arm-chair, regarded her with admiration. "It's funny that you can do <hi rend="italic">this</hi> sort of thing," he waved an appreciative hand at the details of curtains and table-covers.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I'm in it for loot. If I'd thought they'd wanted a silk hat in the hall, I would have got it for 'em."</p>
<p>Howard roared. "That's where a woman's instinct comes in. I couldn't have fussed."</p>
<p>"Cut out woman's instinct," she commanded; "there's no such thing. To try to please a customer is only common sense. As for me, I hate all this domestic drool of tidies." And they both believed that she did!</p>
<p>They sat there--or, at least, Maitland sat, and Frederica reclined, for nearly an hour; the empty flat, the wintry dusk, the innumerable cigarettes, all fitted into their talk. . .</p>
<p>At first Howard told her about the shells he had seen
<pb n="62     THE RISING TIDE"/>
at Beasley's. "I bought a <hi rend="italic">gloria-matis</hi>," he said; "cost like the devil!"</p>
<p>Frederica frowned. "I don't see how you can bother with shells when the world is just buzzing with real things! For instance, Smith has come out for votes for women. Isn't that splendid?"</p>
<p>"He'd come out for votes for Judas Iscariot if it would put him in office," he said, sharply; "and let me tell you, Fred, research work, in any department of science, helps the world, finally, a blamed-sight more than most of this hot air that the reformers turn on. It isn't so showy, but one single man like Pasteur is of more permanent value than all the Smiths in our very corrupt legislature, boiled down!"</p>
<p>"Peeved?" she said, good-naturedly. "Why don't you say 'one single woman like Madame Curie'? Well, buy your old shells, if you want to!"</p>
<p>"I will," he said, grinning. "How's business?"</p>
<p>When she announced some small success, he said, wonderingly, "You are the limit!" And added what he thought of her pluck and her intelligence: "I never knew a woman like you!"</p>
<p>"All women are like me--when you let 'em out."</p>
<p>"No, they're not!" he contradicted, with admiring rudeness.</p>
<p>The rudeness pleased her, as, no doubt, the male cave-dweller's candor of fist or foot pleased the female cave-dweller. His praise and wonder were like wine to her. She wanted more of it. Curled up on the sofa, she grew more and more daring in her talk; her face, flushing with
<pb n="63     THE RISING TIDE"/>
excitement, was vividly handsome, and her mind was as vivid as her face; he could hardly keep up with her mind! She was an Intelligence to him, rather than a woman; and that was why he was totally unaware of anything unusual in the situation--the darkness and the solitude. There was absolutely no self-consciousness in him.</p>
<p>With her it was different--she was acutely self-conscious. Once a woman, bred in the tepid reticences of propriety, takes the plunge into free talk, the very tingle and exhilaration of the shock makes her strike out into still deeper water....She talked about herself; of her life at home; of Mortimore--"He ought to have been killed when he was born," she said; "but, of course, he ought never to have been born."</p>
<p>"Of course," Howard said, gravely.</p>
<p>"It all came from ignorance on the part of women," she explained. "In Mother's day, people confused innocence with ignorance--and as a result, Mortimores were born. What do you think? The day Mother was married, her father said to her (she told me this herself!), 'Remember, Ellen, your husband's past life is none of your business.' Think of that! And poor Mother didn't know enough to know that it was the one thing that was her business!"</p>
<p>Her hearer concealed his embarrassed knowledge of that "past life" by nodding and frowning.</p>
<p>"From Mother's point of view," Frederica went on, contemptuously, "every vital thing is indelicate--I mean indecent," she corrected herself, with the satisfaction of finding a more striking word; "according to people like
<pb n="64     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Mother, a really refined baby would think it improper to be born!"</p>
<p>He laughed uproariously; he wished he could repeat that to Laura Childs, but of course he couldn't. However, the fellows would appreciate it. "As for babies," Fred said, with a shrug, "there's going to be lots of reform along that line. To merely rear children is a pretty poor job for an intellectual being. Did I tell you what I pulled off in a speech at our club? . . .<hi rend="italic">'The child is the jailer that has kept woman in prison.'</hi> Don't you think that's pretty well put?"</p>
<p>"Bully," he said.</p>
<p>Then she told him that she had found a bungalow out on the north side of the lake--"the unfashionable side; that place they call Lakeville; all camps. You know? It's just beyond Laketon, where the nice, useless rich people go." She was going to hire it for the summer, she said, and take occasional days off from business, and get up a rattling good speech on woman suffrage--"and sex-slavery. The abolishment of that is what we're really working for, and it will come when we face Truth! Until now, women have been fed up on lies." She would live by herself: "I don't mean to have even a maid; I'm going to be on my own bat. I suppose Grandmother will throw a fit; she'll say, 'It isn't <hi rend="italic">done!</hi>' That's Grandmother's climax of horror. She'd have said it to every Reformer who ever lived."</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say you'll stay there at night, all alone?" he said, astonished.</p>
<p>"Of course. Why not?"</p>
<pb n="65     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Won't you be frightened?"</p>
<p>"Frightened? What of? Would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> be frightened?"</p>
<p>When he was obliged to admit that he would not be what you'd call frightened, "but a girl--"</p>
<p>"Rot! Why should a girl be frightened? I shall take a revolver."</p>
<p>After that, naturally, Feminism became the engrossing theme, bringing with it, as usual, those shallow generalizations that so often belittle this vital and terrible subject, even as creeds sometimes belittle Religion. To Fred's mind, as to many serious minds, Feminism had a religious significance; but she did not know--arrogance never does know!--the stigma her conceit put upon her cause.</p>
<p>"Look at the unrest of women, everywhere. I don't mean the agitation for suffrage;--that is just a symptom of it. It is yeast," she said, with passion; "yeast! We can't help it; something is fermenting; something is pushing us. All kinds of women feel it. I know, because I go round to the factories and talk to the girls at their noon hour, trying to get them to organize--that's the only way we can get the men to do what we want. Organization! Women have got to get together! I've made a door-to-door canvass for our league, and I came up against this--this, I don't know what to call it! This <hi rend="italic">stirring</hi>, among women. Every woman (except fat old dames whose minds stopped growing when they had their first baby) is stirred, somehow. Twenty years from now the women who are girls to-day won't be putting picture puzzles together for want of something better to do." The contempt in her voice revealed nothing to Howard
<pb n="66     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Maitland, who scarcely knew the poor, dull lady in the sitting-room on Payton Street; but he wondered why Fred's face suddenly reddened. "No; girls are doing things! When they get to middle age their brains won't be chubby. Look at the factories, and shops, and offices--all full of women! Girls don't have to knuckle down any more, and 'obey'; they can say 'Thank you for nothing!' and break away, and support themselves. I tell you what! this life servitude that men have imposed upon women of looking after the home, is done, <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, for good and all! That sweet creature, 'the devoted wife,' is being labeled 'kept woman,'--but the ballot is the key to her prison door!"</p>
<p>"Bully simile," he said.</p>
<p>"But isn't it all queer--the change in things?" she said, her voice suddenly vague and wondering; "it's a sort of race movement, with Truth as the motive power. It's bigger than just--people. Even our parlor-maid, Flora, feels it! She wants to do something; she doesn't know what. (I wish she'd put her energies into laundering the centerpieces better, but I regret to say she has a soul above laundry.) Yes, things are stirring! It's yeast."</p>
<p>Such talk was new to Howard. Until now, his young Chivalry had concerned itself only with women's demand for suffrage--which, as Frederica Payton had very truly said, is only a symptom, alarming, or amusing, or divine, as you may happen to look at it--of the world-unrest which she called "feminism." He was keenly interested.</p>
<p>"Gosh, Fred," he said, soberly, as she ended with the assertion that Feminism was the most interesting thing
<pb n="67     THE RISING TIDE"/>
that had come into the Race Conscienceness since humanity began to stand on its hind legs--" gosh, I take off my hat to you!" His admiration was not so much for the thing she was trying to do, as for the fact that she was trying! She was <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> something--anything!--instead of sitting around, like most people, in observant and disapproving idleness. He forgot her snub about his shells; his eyes were ardent with admiring assent to everything she said. "You are the limit!" he said, earnestly.</p>
<p>And she, speaking passionately her poor, bare, ugly facts--all true, but verging on lies, because no one of them was the whole Truth--going deeper into her adventure of candor, felt, suddenly, a quickening of the blood. She had an impulse to put out her hand and touch him--the big, sprawling, handsome fellow! His voice, agreeing to all she said, made her quiver into momentary silence, as a harp-string quivers under a twanging and muting thumb. That his assents, which gave her such acute satisfaction, were merely her own convictions, thrown back to her by the sounding-board of his good nature, she did not realize. The intellectual attraction she felt in him was hers. The other attraction, which was his, she did not analyze. She realized only that something seemed to swell in her throat and her breathing quickened. The newness of the sensation threw her off the track of her argument, which was to prove that women would save society by facing facts--"facts" being, apparently, the single one of sex.</p>
<p>"When I marry," Fred said, "nobody's going to pull that devilish bromide on me, that the man's past isn't my business. There'll be no Mortimores in <hi rend="italic">mine!</hi> I
<pb n="68     THE RISING TIDE"/>
mean to have children who will push the race along to perfection!"</p>
<p>"I bet they will!" he said.</p>
<p>She sat up on the sofa, cross-legged, clasping an ankle with each hand, her eyes glowing in the dusk. "You've given me a brace!" she said.</p>
<p>"You've given <hi rend="italic">me</hi> one! I'd rather talk to you than any man I know."</p>
<p>She put out her hand impulsively, and he gripped it until the seal ring on her little finger cut into the flesh and made her wince with pain and break away; but with the pain there was a curious pang of pleasure. She got on her feet with a spring, and, rubbing her bruised finger, gave a last look about the apartment.</p>
<p>"I hope the tabbies will like it. Heavens, Howard, do you think they'll smell cigarette-smoke? I suppose they'd have a fit if they discovered that the 'sweet girl' smoked cigarettes!"</p>
<p>"Do they call you a 'sweet girl'?" he said, and roared at the idea.</p>
<p>"Mr. Weston doesn't like me to smoke. It gave me quite a shock to find he was such a 'perfect lady.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, he's old. What can you expect? I like you to. You knock off your ashes like a kid boy."</p>
<p>"Open the window a second, will you?" Fred said; "that smoke does hang around.--Howard, I believe they'll think I'm trying to lasso Mr. Weston into marrying me! Poor old boy, you know when he was young, before the flood, some girl turned him down, and I understand he's never got over it. The cousins will think I'm trying to
<pb n="69     THE RISING TIDE"/>
catch him on the rebound! Funny, isn't it, how the elderly unmarried female is always trying to make other people get married? I think it's a form of envy; sort of getting what you want by proxy. Men don't do it."</p>
<p>"Men are not so altruistic," he said.</p>
<p>Frederica's face bloomed in the darkness, rose-red. They went out to the elevator, and dropped down to the entrance in silence. Howard, cranking his car, and getting a slap on the wrist that made him bite off a bad word between his teeth, thought to himself that Fred Payton was a stunner!</p>
<p>He said so that night to Laura Childs, when they were sitting out a dance at the Assembly. They had talked about his <hi rend="italic">gloria-matis</hi>, and she had thrilled at its cost, and pleaded with him to show it to her, "I'm crazy to see it! Please!"</p>
<p>"Fred didn't care a copper about it," he told her, with some amusement. "She's sort of woozy on reforms."</p>
<p>Laura nodded. "Fred's great, perfectly great," she said, looking down at the toe of her slipper, poking out from her pink tulle skirt.</p>
<p>"She has a man's brain," he said.</p>
<p>"Now, why do men always say that sort of thing?" Laura objected, her eyes crinkling good-naturedly. "Brain has no more sex than liver."</p>
<p>Howard made haste to apologize: "'Course not! I only meant she's awfully clever, you know."</p>
<p>Laura agreed, a little wistfully: "I admire Fred awfully. Do you know, she talked to the girls in the rubber-factory out in Hazelton about the Minimum Wage? She wanted
<pb n="70     THE RISING TIDE"/>
me to go there with her, but I'd promised Jack McKnight to play tennis. Well, I'm afraid I wouldn't have gone, anyhow," she added, soberly; "those things bother Father, and it isn't as if I could accomplish anything, as Freddy can. If anybody asked me to make a speech, I should simply die. But Fred has no end of sand," Laura ended; her admiration was as honest as it was humble.</p>
<p>"Sand?" Howard said; "you bet she has sand! Why, she is going to take a bungalow out in Lakeville this summer, and live there all by herself. She wants to read and study, and all that sort of thing."</p>
<p>"By herself?" said Laura, really startled. "You don't mean without even a maid?"</p>
<p>"So she says."</p>
<p>"Aunt Nelly will never allow it! And, really, it wouldn't be safe. She ought to take Flora along, at least."</p>
<p>Upon which Howard boldly tried Fred's own argument: "Why shouldn't she be alone? She'll have a revolver."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't do it for a million dollars!" said Laura."And, besides, nobody goes to Lakeville; it's awfully common."</p>
<p>"Fred is above that sort of thing," Howard said. For once the good-natured Laura was affronted.<p>
"I don't pretend to be like Fred--" she began, but he interrupted her:</p>
<p>"You? Of course you're not like Fred! You couldn't do the things she does!"</p>
<p>Laura gave him a cool glance: "I promised this dance to Jack McKnight. Perhaps we'd better start in?"</p>
<pb n="71     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I'd like to wring his neck," Howard declared, rising reluctantly.</p>
<p>When she and Jack were half-way down the room she told him that there was a new engagement in the air. "The girl's perfectly fine, but the man makes me tired," said Lolly, lifting her pretty foot in the prettiest and daintiest kick imaginable.</p>
<p>"Tell us," Jack entreated, one hand holding hers, and the other spread over her young shoulder-blades.</p>
<p>"Oh, it isn't out yet," she said, "and I don't know that it's--really <hi rend="italic">on</hi>--but I bet it--will be--pretty soon!"</p>
<p>And she tossed her head a little viciously.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI</head>
<p>THE two Misses Graham were very much interested in their real-estate agent.</p>
<p>"A <hi rend="italic">girl</hi>, to be in business," said the younger sister, doubtfully.</p>
<p>"It's very nice in her," said the elder sister. "I suppose the Paytons have lost their money and she has to support the family."</p>
<p>"She is certainly capable," Miss Mary admitted. "But it does seem strange for her to work in this way, when she could give music lessons, for instance."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she's not musical," Miss Eliza objected. "I hate to have a girl pounding the piano, when her talent lies in scrubbing floors." Miss Eliza Graham looked like a frayed old eagle; perhaps because for seventy years she had flapped unavailing wings against the Graham traditions.</p>
<p>Those traditions had kept her from the serious study of music, and later they had "saved" her from marriage with a man who had very little money. The younger Miss Graham looked, and was, as contented as a pouter-pigeon teetering about in a comfortable barn-yard. It was Miss Eliza, tall, thin, piercing-eyed, and sweet-hearted at seventy-two, who had, as she expressed it,
<pb n="73     THE RISING TIDE"/>
"dug Mary up," and brought her to town for the winter. Miss Eliza was for a hotel, but Miss Mary felt that unmarried ladies should have the dignity of their own roof. "We can always have the escort of a messenger-boy, if we go out in the evening," she told her sister, who agreed, her eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>"Excellent idea. We can spank him if he doesn't behave properly!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Eliza!" Miss Mary protested, but she smiled indulgently. Eliza was the most precious thing in the world to the little, plump lady who made endless excuses to herself, and to everybody else, for dear Eliza's ways." It was a "way" of Eliza's to forgive Youth for almost anything it did. . . .</p>
<p>"Of course, Youth makes Age uncomfortable," she would concede. "New wine is very hard on old bottles! But if the bottles burst, it isn't the fault of the wine, it is the fault of the bottles--<hi rend="italic">for having been empty!</hi>" The significance of those last words was quite lost on Miss Mary.</p>
<p>As the two sisters went over their little apartment, and discovered its possibilities, old Miss Eliza's interest centered in the youth as well as the sex of their real-estate agent. "Look at that wood-box!" she said;--"to think of a girl having so much gumption!"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear!" said Miss Mary--and pointed a shrinking finger at the stub of a cigarette on the parlor window-sill, "I thought I smelt smoke; a workman must have left it."</p>
<p>But the cigarette was the only fly in the ointment. The
<pb n="74     THE RISING TIDE"/>
apartment, with its "art" finishings, electricity, and steam-heat, was to the country ladies and their one elderly maid-servant a miracle of beauty and convenience.</p>
<p>"Arthur was wonderfully wise in asking Miss Payton to attend to it for him," Miss Eliza said.</p>
<p>"I wonder if--it means anything?" Miss Mary queried, with an arch look. "After all, he must know her very well, to have told her just what we wanted--rooms and bath, and all that. It is rather intimate, you know."</p>
<p>"I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> it means something! I hope he has got over that wicked jilt, Kate Morrison!"</p>
<p>"Well, the Paytons are nice people," the younger sister said; "she was a Holmes, you know."</p>
<p>They were both eager to see dear Arthur and Miss Payton, for they felt sure they would know the moment they saw them together whether he had "got over" Kate. "When people are in love they always betray it," said Miss Eliza.</p>
<p>But when Mr. Weston brought Miss Frederica Payton to call, no "love" was betrayed on either side. In fact, the call was such an astonishing experience to the two sisters that they quite forgot their sentimental wonderings. Frederica accepted their thanks and appreciation very pleasantly, but a little bluntly. Oh, yes, the sunshine in the dining-room was very nice; she was glad they liked it. But she hoped they'd survive the jig-saw over-mantel and the awful tiles in the parlor. "They made me pretty sick," she said.</p>
<p>"Why, I thought the mantelpiece very artistic," Miss Mary said, blankly.</p>
<pb n="75     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"The porcelain bath-tub is dandy," Fred said, with real pride.</p>
<p>"Dandy?" murmured Miss Eliza.</p>
<p>"It made me feel as if I could hardly wait for Saturday night to take a bath," the Real Estate Agent said. The two ladies looked startled--not at the antique joke, but to refer to bathing in Arthur's presence! "I mean the tub is bully," Fred explained; "and the plumbing--" Here she became so specific that her modest old clients grew quite red. She had been obliged to get a plumber in to work on the trap the afternoon before they came, but she was sure everything was all right now.</p>
<p>The door-bell rang at this moment, and while the Misses Graham, breathless under the shock of Miss Payton's thoroughness, welcomed (of all people!) old Mrs. Holmes, Fred was able to groan to Arthur Weston, "Can't we get out?"</p>
<p>"We cannot," he said, decidedly; "now brace up and be nice to your grandmother."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Oh</hi>, Lord!" said Fred; but she was really very nice. She pecked at Mrs. Holmes's cheek through its white lace veil, and said "Hello, Grandma! How is anti-suffrage?" as politely as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, to make things pleasant for Mrs. Holmes, the Misses Graham repeated all their appreciation of Miss Freddy's efficiency. "She will make an admirable housekeeper," Miss Mary said, in her gentle way.</p>
<p>"She ought to," said Frederica's grandmother. "I'm sure I brought her mother up to know how to keep house! But it is just a fancy of Freddy's to do this sort of thing;"
<pb n="76     THE RISING TIDE"/>
she waved a knuckly white glove at the apartment, which caused Frederica to roll her eyes at Mr. Weston. "Of course, I know it isn't <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, but it's an amusement for her," Mrs. Holmes explained, "and I have so much sympathy with young people--my daughter says I am all heart!--that I love to have the child amuse herself."</p>
<p>She was trying to preserve the Payton dignity, but she was very nervous; she could have said it all so much better if that pert creature had not been sitting there, her knees crossed, and displaying a startling length of silk stocking. She knew that no sense of propriety would keep Fred quiet if she took it into her head to contradict anybody, and she was glad when the two ladies changed the subject, even though it was for the gunpowdery topic of suffrage, on which, it appeared, the younger Miss Graham had strong feelings.</p>
<p>"I am sure female influence is not only more refining, but more effective than the ballot could possibly be," she said.</p>
<p>Of course Fred rushed in: "You're an anti?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear," Miss Mary said, smiling.</p>
<p>"To get things done by 'influence' is to revert, it seems to me, to the methods of the harem," said Fred, earnestly. Frederica was never flippant on this vital topic of suffrage, unless she was angry. Her grandmother's retort supplied the anger:</p>
<p>"Woman's charm will always outweigh woman's ballot," said Mrs. Holmes, with smiling decision. (She, too, was getting hot inside.)</p>
<p>"The antis," Fred flung back, "think that all that
<pb n="77     THE RISING TIDE"/>
is necessary is to 'sit on the stile, and continue to smile'!"</p>
<p>"What did you say?" said Mrs. Holmes, frowning. "Young people speak so indistinctly nowadays! We were taught proper enunciation when I was young."</p>
<p>"Woman," said Miss Mary, raising her voice, "is a princess, but her God-given rule lies in the gentle domain of the home."</p>
<p>"Gosh!" said Fred--and two of her auditors laughed explosively. But Frederica was red with wrath. "I've seen the 'princess' exercising her God-given rule in cleaning the floors of saloons on her hands and knees, because she had to support the children that her husband had foisted on her and then deserted. Do you think under such 'gentle circumstances' her charm would do as much for her as a vote?"</p>
<p>One does not know just how much of an explosion there would have been if the elder Miss Graham had not come to the rescue: "Ah, well, there are so many good reasons on both sides, that I'm glad I don't have to decide it!" Then she began to talk of old friends in Grafton; but, alas, as a subject Grafton, too, was somewhat dangerous; old Mr. So-and-so died two years ago; and Mrs. Black--did Mrs. Holmes remember Mrs. Black? "I am sorry to say she is very ill," Miss Mary said. The chatter of gossip was--as it so often is with age--a rehearsal of sickness and death. In the midst of it Mrs. Holmes clutched at a gold mesh-bag that was slipping from her steep lap, and tried to rise:</p>
<p>"I think I must go. (Oh, do pick up that bag, Freddy

dear.) I am too tender-hearted," she confessed, "I can't bear to hear unpleasant things!"</p>
<p>"Well let us talk of pleasant things," Miss Eliza said;but she looked at the frightened old face under the white veil;--" and 'the feet of the bearers' are coming nearer to her every day!" she thought.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes sat down again, reluctantly. Of course, from the Misses Graham's point of view, there could be nothing pleasanter for a grandmother to hear than plaudits of Miss Freddy's efficiency; so they went back again to that. Dear Arthur had told them how hard she had worked (again Freddy's eyes rolled toward dear Arthur); engaging tradesmen, and making the landlord do the necessary repairing.--"Oh, my dear," Miss Mary interrupted herself, "I meant to warn you that one of your workmen left a half-smoked cigarette here. I knew you would want to reprove him. Dear me! in these days, with all the new ideas, the working-people are very careless. But I feel so strongly our responsibility to them, that I always tell them of their mistakes."</p>
<p>"The working-people didn't make any mistake this time," Fred said; "you mustn't blame the plumber,"--the temptation to get back at her grandmother was too much for her--"it was my own cigarette." There was a stunned silence. "Howard Maitland and I were smoking here quite a while," she said, sweetly. "But I thought I'd aired the room out. I'm awfully sorry,--cigarette-smoke does hang about so." ("'Amusement'!" she was saying to herself; "I'll 'amuse' her!")</p>
<p> But Mrs. Holmes was equal to the occasion. She shook
<pb n="79     THE RISING TIDE"/>
an arch and knobby finger at her granddaughter. "Naughty girl! But that's one of the things that is done nowadays," she said; "ladies smoke just as much as gentlemen, don't they, Mr. Weston?"</p>
<p>"More," he declared, gayly; but he watched his two cousins. Had they taken it in that Maitland and Fred had been in the flat together? It had apparently not struck Mrs. Holmes--or if it had, she chose to ignore it; she was talking, with a very red face, about all sorts of things. It seemed a favorable moment to drag his candid ward away, and he did so, with effusive promises to come again soon--all the time looking out of the corner of his eye at the Misses Graham's farewell to Fred. Alas, Miss Mary's were hardly visible.</p>
<p>But Miss Eliza followed them into the hall, and put a hand on Fred's arm: "I don't mind the smell of smoke in a room half as much as I do on a girl's lips," she said, smiling; "they ought to be like roses." Then she gave the angular young arm a little pat and ran back.</p>
<p>"What a duck she is!" Fred said, honestly moved; "I wish I hadn't let out at Grandmother!"</p>
<p>Her repentance did not soothe Arthur Weston. "I'd like to shake you," he said, as they got into the elevator.</p>
<p>"Me? What's your kick? I thought I behaved beautifully! I kissed an inch of powder off Grandmother's cheek. There's no satisfying you. I supposed you'd give me a bunch of violets, with 'For a good girl,' on the card. Don't be an old maid! Even Miss Graham isn't. She's a dear!"</p>
<p>"I may be an old maid, but you are an imp!" he said. In the taxi, as they rushed, with open windows, across the
<pb n="80     THE RISING TIDE"/>
city back to Payton Street, he spoke more gravely. "You ought not to have gone wandering around in vacant apartments with Maitland." He was really annoyed, and showed it.</p>
<p>Frederica was equally annoyed. "I am a businesswoman. Howard was obliging enough to take me around in his car. In the flat we talked for a while. Why shouldn't we? If he had been a girl, I suppose we could have sat there until midnight and you would have never peeped!"</p>
<p>"But may I call your attention to the fact that he's not a girl?"</p>
<p>"May I call <hi rend="italic">your</hi> attention to the fact that there is such a thing, between men and women, as intellectual relations?" She was getting angry, and her anger betrayed her self-consciousness.</p>
<p>"You compel me," he retorted, "to remind you that there are other relations between men and women which are not markedly intellectual."</p>
<p>"There're none of that kind in mine, thank you! I--"</p>
<p>But he interrupted her, dryly: "Of course you know you had no business to do it. You remind me, Fred, of one of those dirty little boys who put a firecracker under your chair to make you jump. Look here, it's unworthy of a 'business woman' to do unconventional things simply because they are unconventional."</p>
<p>"I didn't!"</p>
<p>"You are like all the rest of your sex--self-conscious as hens when they see an automobile coming! You knew it was queer to shut yourself up there with that darned
<pb n="81     THE RISING TIDE"/>
fool, Maitland, <hi rend="italic">and that's why you loved doing it</hi>," he flung at her. "That's the trouble with women nowadays; not that they do unusual things, but they are so blamed pleased to be unusual! And if they only knew it, they don't shock a man at all. They only bore him to death."</p>
<p>"But I suppose you can't help it; you are so atrociously young," he ended, sighing.</p>
<p>Frederica was almost too angry to speak. "I am old enough to do as I choose!"</p>
<p>"Only Youth does as it chooses," he told her. "Reflect upon what I have said, my dear infant, and profit by it. . . Stop at the iron dog!" he called to the driver. And the next minute Frederica, buffeted by the high, keen wind, ran past the dog, whose back was ridged with grimy snow, and, holding on to her hat with one hand, let herself into the hall with her latch-key.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with <hi rend="italic">him?</hi>." she thought, slamming the front door behind her; "it isn't his funeral!"</p>

<p>AT the jar of the banging door, Andy Payton's hat moved slightly on the hat-rack, and something snarled at the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>"It's nothing, Morty--only sister," a motherly voice said; and Miss Carter leaned over the baluster:</p>
<p>"I'm just bringing him down to his supper; he's a little nervous this evening."</p>
<p>"Oh," Fred said, shortly; "well, wait till I get out of the way, please." She stepped into the unlighted parlor, and stood there in the darkness, between the piano and the bust of Mr. Andrew Payton; as she waited, her hand fell on the open keyboard, and she struck a jangling chord. "Flora has been playing on the sly," she thought; "poor old Floral" Then for a moment her fingers were rigid on the keys--the scrabbling procession was passing through the hall down to the room where Mortimore's food was given to him. When the door closed behind him she drew a breath of relief. She never looked at her brother when she could avoid it. As she went up-stairs she paused on the landing to call out, "Hello, Mother!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton answered from the sitting-room: "Don't you want some tea, dear?"</p>
<pb n="83     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>Frederica hesitated; she didn't want any tea, but--"I suppose it pleases her," she thought, resignedly; and went into the pleasant, fire-lit room, with its bubbling teakettle and fragrance of Roman hyacinths blooming on the window-sills. "Finished your puzzle?" she asked, good-naturedly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton, grateful for a little interest, said: "No; I've been doing up Christmas presents most of the afternoon. I'm pretty tired! Tying all those ribbons is dreadfully hard work," she ended, with an air of achievement that was pathetic or ridiculous, as one might happen to look at it. Her daughter, glancing at the array of white packages tied with gay ribbons, did not see the pathos. That slightly supercilious droop of the lip which always made Mrs. Payton draw back into herself, showed Fred's opinion of the "hard work"; but she only said, laconically:</p>
<p>"Mr. Weston took me to call on the old maids. No, I don't want any tea, thank you."</p>
<p>"You oughtn't to call them 'old maids'; it isn't respectful."</p>
<p>"It's what they are--at least, the younger one is. The other one is very nice. But they are both of 'em of the vintage of 1830.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Payton was sufficiently acquainted with her daughter's picturesque, but limited, vocabulary to know what "vintage" meant, so she said: "Oh, no; they are not so old as that. I don't think Miss Graham is much over seventy."</p>
<p>"I waked Miss Mary up!" Frederica said, joyfully.
<pb n="84     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I am sorry for that," Mrs. Payton sighed.</p>
<p>Fred shrugged her shoulders. "Grandmother will tattle,--yes, she was there; deaf as a post, and all dolled up like a plush horse;--so I suppose I might as well tell you just what happened." She told it, lightly enough. "Old Weston threw fits in the taxi, coming home," she ended.</p>
<p>"I should think he might! Freddy, really--"</p>
<p>Her daughter looked at her with narrowing but not unkind eyes. "I wish I knew why people fuss so over nothing," she said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton put her empty cup back on the tray with a despairing sigh: "If you can't <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the impropriety--"</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, I see what you call 'impropriety'; what I don't see is why you call it 'improper.' What constitutes impropriety? The fact that, as Grandmother says, 'it isn't <hi rend="italic">done'?</hi> I could mention a lot of things that are done, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would call improper! Wearing nasty false fronts, as Grandmother does, and silly tight shoes. A thing is true, or it's a lie. That distinction is worth while. But what you call 'impropriety' isn't worth bothering about."</p>
<p>"Truth and falsehood are not the only distinctions in the world. Things are fitting, or--not."</p>
<p>"Howard and I talked, in an empty flat," Fred said; "I suppose if it had been in our parlor, with the Egyptian virgin out in the hall chaperoning us, it would have been 'fitting'?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton wiped her eyes. "There's no use discussing anything with you. When <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was a young lady, if my mother had reproved--"</p>
<pb n="85     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>Fred made a discouraged gesture: "Oh, don't let's go back to the dark ages. As for Howard--I'll see him at my office, if it makes you any happier."</p>
<p>"Why can't he call on you in your own house? You cheapen yourself by--"</p>
<p>"Mother, there's no use! I couldn't stand it. Mortimore--"</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Frederica!</hi>"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton's gesture of command was inescapable. Involuntarily Fred's lips closed; when her mother spoke to her in that tone, the childish habit of obedience asserted itself. But it was only for a moment:</p>
<p>"Of course you don't mind him," she said; "you are fond of him. But you can't expect me to feel as you do." She drew in her breath with a shiver of disgust.</p>
<p>"I love you both just the same!" Mrs. Payton said, emphatically.</p>
<p>Frederica was not listening. "Oh, by the way," she said, "I've heard of a little bungalow, at that camp place, Lakeville--you know?--that I can rent for twenty-five dollars a month. I'm going to hire it for next summer--rather ahead of time, but somebody might grab it. I want to have a place to go, when I have two or three days off. I hope you'll come out sometimes. And--and Miss Carter can bring Morty," she ended, with generous intention.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton was silent. She was saying to herself, despairingly, "She's jealous!"</p>
<p>"Well, I must go and dress," Frederica said, and got herself out of the room, acutely conscious of her mother's averted face. "'Cheapening' myself--how silly!" she
<pb n="86     THE RISING TIDE"/>
thought, as she closed her own door. When she took her cigarette-case out of her pocket, Miss Graham's words came into her mind and she smiled; but she lighted a cigarette and, standing before her mirror, practised knocking off the ashes. Was it this way? Was it that way? How does the "kid boy" do it? She tried a dozen ways; but she could not remember the entirely unconscious gesture which had pleased Howard Maitland. "How funny and old-fashioned old Miss Graham was! But quite sweet," she thought. It occurred to her, as she took out her hair-pins, that Miss Graham's antiquated ideas did not irritate her, and her mother's did. For a moment she pondered this old puzzle of humanity: "Why are members of your family more provoking than outsiders?" After all, Miss Graham, with her "roses," was just as irrational as Mrs. Payton with her fuss about propriety and "cheapness"--or Arthur Weston, gassing about "relations which are not markedly intellectual." She was angry at him, but that phrase made her giggle. She sat down on the edge of her bed, her brush in her hand, her hair hanging about her shoulders; it had been very interesting, that "cheap" and entirely "intellectual" hour alone with Howard in the darkening flat. . . .</p>
<p>She put her elbow on her knee, her chin in her hand, and smiled. Of course she knew what her mother, and Mr. Weston--"poor old boy!"--and her grandmother, and the Misses Graham all had in the back of their minds. "Idiots!" she said, good-naturedly. If they could have heard the plain, straight, man-to-man talk in the empty apartment, they would have discovered that nowadays men and
<pb n="87     THE RISING TIDE"/>
girls are not interested in those <hi rend="italic">un</hi>intellectual relations at which her man of business had hinted. She remembered Howard's look when he said he would rather talk to her than to any man he knew--and she lifted her head proudly! No girly-girly compliment could have pleased her as that did. It was just as she had always said, the right kind of man knows that a woman wants him to talk horse sense to her, not gush. If the tabbies, and Mr. Weston, and her mother had heard that talk, they wouldn't worry about sentiment! Suddenly, she recalled that strange feeling she had had below her breast-bone as she looked at Howard sprawling in the arm-chair. She remembered her curious impulse to touch him, and the rosy warmth that seemed to go all over her, like a wave; she thought of that pang of pleasure when his hand crushed hers so that the seal ring had cut into the flesh and hurt her. "I wonder--?" she said; and bit her lip. Then her face reddened sharply; she flung her head up like a wild creature who feels the grip of the trap.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Love?</hi></p>
<p>For an instant she felt something like fright. "Of course not! He's just a bully fellow, and I like him. Nothing more; I don't--" She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and the image held her eye. The vivid, smiling face, a little thin, with the color hot, just now, on the high cheek-bones; dark, wavy hair, falling back from a charming brow which, pathetically enough (for she was only twenty-five), had lines in it. "Heavens!" she said, "I believe I <hi rend="italic">do</hi>!" She laughed, and, jumping to her feet, shook the mane of hair over her eyes. But before she began to
<pb n="88     THE RISING TIDE"/>
brush it she lifted the hand Howard Maitland had gripped,and kissed it hard, once--twice!</p>
<p>"I do--care," she said; "I didn't know it was like this!" She glowed all over. "<hi rend="italic">I am in love</hi>," she repeated, amazed.</p>
<p>While she tumbled the soft, dark hair into a loose knot on the top of her head she tried to whistle, but herlips were unsteady. She did not know herself with this quiver all through her, and the sudden stinging in her eyes, and something swelling and tightening in her throat. She forgot the shocked old maids, and the disgusted trustee. She was in love! She began to sing, but broke off at a faint knock.</p>
<p>"Dinner's ready, Miss Freddy."</p>
<p>"Come in, Flora," Frederica called out; "and hook me up." She smiled so gaily at the silent creature, not even scolding when the slim, cold finger-tips touched her warm shoulder, that the woman smiled a little, too. "I thought this was your afternoon out?" Fred said, kindly.</p>
<p>"I 'ain't got no place in partic'lar to go. Anyway, I knew your ma wasn't goin' to be in, and--"</p>
<p>"I bet you played on the piano," Frederica said, smiling at herself in the glass.</p>
<p>"Well, yes'm, I did," the woman confessed. "I picked out the whole of 'Rock of Ages.'"</p>
<p>"Flora! Don't look so low-spirited; I believe you're in love. Have you got a new beau? I've been told that people are always low-spirited when they're in love."</p>
<p>Flora simpered; "Ah, now, Miss Freddy!"</p>
<p>"Come! Who is he? You've got to tell me!"</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. Baker's got a new man on. That there snide
<pb n="89     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Arnold's been bounced. Good riddance! He never did 'mount to nothing. Me, I'm sorry for the girl he married; she'll just slave and git no wages. That's what marryin' Arnold'll do for her!"</p>
<p>"That's what marrying any man does for a woman," Miss Payton instructed her; "a wife is a slave."</p>
<p>But Flora's face had softened into abject sentimentality. "This here new man, Sam, <hi rend="italic">he's</hi> something like. Light, he is; and freckled." Then her face fell: "Anne says he's got a girl on the Hill. Don't make no difference to me, anyhow. It's music I want. If I was young, I'd git an education, and go to one of them conservmatories and learn to play on the piano."</p>
<p>"I'll give you some lessons, one of these days," Fred promised her, good-naturedly. "Poor old Flora," she said to herself, as the maid, like a fragile brown shadow, slipped out of the room. "'He's got a girl on the Hill'! I wonder how I'd feel if Howard had 'a girl on the Hill'?" Again the tremor ran through her; she could not have said whether it was pain or bliss. "I certainly must teach Flora her notes," she said, trying to get back to the commonplace. Then she forgot Flora, and, bending forward, looked at herself in the glass for a long moment. "I'll get that hat at Louise's," she said, turning out the gas; "it's the smartest thing I've struck in many moons."</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
<p>MR. WESTON, riding home in the taxi, was not without some astonishment at himself. Why was he so keenly annoyed at Fred's bad taste? Why had he such an ardent desire to kick Maitland? He might have gone further in his self-analysis and discovered that, though he wanted to kick Howard, he did not want to haul him over the coals, as a man of his years might well have done--merely to give a friendly tip as to propriety to a youngster whom he had seen put into breeches. Had he discovered this reluctance in himself, Arthur Weston might have decided that his indignation was based on a sense of personal injury--which has its own significance in a man of nearly fifty who concerns himself in the affairs of a woman under thirty. The fact was that, though he thought of himself only as her grandfatherly trustee, Frederica Payton was every day taking a larger place in his life. She amused him, and provoked him, and interested him; but, most of all, the pain of her passionate futilities roused him to a pity that made him really suffer. He could not bear to see pain. Briefly, she gave him something to think about.</p>
<p>His displeasure evaporated overnight, and when he went up to her office the next morning he was ready to
<pb n="91     THE RISING TIDE"/>
apologize for his words in the taxi. But it was not necessary. Fred, in the excitement of receiving a letter asking her fee for hunting up rooms, had quite forgotten that she had been scolded.</p>
<p>"I think I'd better advertise in all the daily papers!" she announced, eagerly.</p>
<p>"You're a good fellow," he said; "you take your medicine and don't make faces."</p>
<p>"Make faces? Oh, you mean because you called me down last night? Bless you, if it amuses you, it doesn't hurt me!"</p>
<p>The sense of her youth came over him in a pang of loneliness, and with it, curiously enough, an impulse of flight, which made him say, abruptly: "I shall probably go abroad in January. Can I trust you not to advertise yourself into bankruptcy before I get back?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Weston," she said, blankly; "how awful! Don't go!"</p>
<p>"You don't need me," he assured her; but a faint pleasure stirred about his heart.</p>
<p>"Need you? Why, I simply couldn't live without you! In the first place, my business would go to pot, without your advice; and then--well, you know how it is. You are the only person who speaks my language. Grandmother talks about my vulgarities, and Aunt Bessie talks about my stomach, and the Childs cousins talk about my vices--but nobody talks about my interests, except you. Don't go and leave me," she pleaded with him.</p>
<p>The glow of pleasure about his heart warmed into actual happiness. "Please don't think I approve of you!"</p>
<pb n="92     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>She looked at him with her gray, direct eyes, and nodded. "I know you don't. But I don't mind;--you understand."</p>
<p>"But," he said, raising a rueful eyebrow, "how shall I make Cousin Mary 'understand' your performances?"</p>
<p>"By staying at home and keeping me in order! Don't go away."</p>
<p>It was the everlasting feminine: <hi rend="italic">"I need you!"</hi> There was no "new woman" in it; no self-sufficiency; nothing but the old, dependent arrogance that has charmed and held the man by its flattering selfishness ever since the world began.</p>
<p>He was opening the office door, but she laid a frankly anxious hand on his arm. "Promise me you won't go!"/p>
<p>He would not commit himself. "It depends; if you get married, and shut up shop, you won't want a business adviser."</p>
<p>"I sha'n't get married!" she said, and blushed to her temples.</p>
<p>Mr. Weston saw the color, and his face, as he closed her door and stood waiting for the elevator, dulled a little. "She's head over ears in love with him. Well, he's a very decent chap; it's an excellent match for her,--Oh," he apologized to the elevator boy, on suddenly finding himself on the street floor; "I forgot to get off! You'll have to take me up again." In his own office he was distinctly curt.</p>
<p>"I am very busy," he said, checking his stenographer's languid remark about a telephone call; "I am going to write letters. Don't let any one interrupt me"--and the door of his private office closed in her face.</p>
<pb n="93     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"What's the matter with <hi rend="italic">him?</hi>" the young lady asked herself, idly; then took out her vanity glass and adjusted her marcel wave.</p>
<p>Arthur Weston put his feet on his desk, and reflected. Why had he said what he did about going to Europe? When he went up to see Fred, nothing had been farther from his mind than leaving America. Well, he knew why he had said it. . . .Flight! Self-preservation! "Preposterous," he said, "what am I thinking of? I'm fond of her, and I'm confoundedly sorry for her, but that's all. Anyhow, Maitland settles the question. And if he wasn't in it--she's twenty-five and I'm forty-six." He got up and walked aimlessly about the room. "I've cut my wisdom teeth," he thought, with a dry laugh, and wondered where the lady was who had superintended that teething. For Kate's sake he had taken a broken heart to Europe. The remembrance of that heartbreak reassured him; the feeling he had about Fred wasn't in the least like his misery of that time. He gave a shrug of relief; it occurred to him that he would go and see some Chinese rugs which had been advertised in the morning paper; "might give her one for a wedding present?--oh, the devil! Haven't I anything else to think of than that girl?" He stood at the window for a long time, his hands in his pockets, looking at three pigeons strutting and balancing on a cornice of the Chamber of Commerce. "She interests me," he conceded; then he smiled,--"and she wants me to stay at home and 'take care of her'!" Well, there was nothing he would like better than to take care of Fred. The first thing he would do would be to
<pb n="94     THE RISING TIDE"/>
shut up that ridiculous plaything of an "office" on the tenth floor. Billy Childs put it just right: "perfec' nonsense!" Then, having removed "F. Payton" from the index of the Sturtevant Building, they--he and Fred--would go off, to Europe. He followed this vagrant thought for a moment, then reddened with impatience at his own folly: "What an idiot I am! I'm not the least in love with her, but I'll miss her like the devil when she marries that cub Maitland. She's a perpetual cocktail! She'd be as mad as a hornet if she knew that I never took her seriously." He laughed, and found himself wishing that he could take her in his arms, and tease her, and scold her, and make her "mad as a hornet." Again the color burned in his cheeks; he would do something else than tease her and scold her; he would most certainly kiss her. "Oh, confound it!" he said to himself, angrily; "I'm getting stale." He did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> want to kiss her! He only wanted to make her happy, and be himself amused. "That is the difference between now and ten years ago," he analyzed. "Kate never 'amused' me; oh, how deadly serious it all was!" He speculated about Kate quite comfortably. She was married; very likely she had half a dozen brats. Again he contrasted his feeling for Fred with that brief madness of pain, and was cheered; it was so obvious that he was merely fond of her. How could he help it--she was so honest, so unselfconscious! Besides, she was pathetic. Her harangues upon subjects of which she was (like most of mankind) profoundly ignorant, were funny, but they were touching, too, for her complacent certainties would so inevitably bring her into bruising
<pb n="95     THE RISING TIDE"/>
contact with Life. "She thinks 'suffrage' a cure-all," he thought, amused and pitiful,--"and she's so desperately young!" In her efforts to reform the world, she was like some small creature buffeting the air. In fact, all this row that women were making was like beating the air. "What's it about, anyhow?" he thought. "What on earth do they want--the women?" It seemed to him, looking a little resentfully at the ease and release from certain kinds of toil that had come to women in the last two or three decades, that they had everything that reasonable creatures could possibly want. "Think how their grandmothers had to work!" he said to himself. "Now, all that these ridiculous creatures have to do is to touch a button--and men's brains do the rest." Certainly there is an enormous difference in the collective ease of existence; women don't have to make their candles, or knit their stockings, as their grandmothers did:--"yet, nowadays, they are making more fuss than all the women that ever lived, put together! What's the matter with 'em?"</p>
<p>He grew quite hot over the ingratitude of the sex. His old Scotch housekeeper, reading her Bible, and sewing from morning to night, was far happier than these restless, dissatisfied creatures, who, in the upper classes, flooded into schools of design and conservatories of music--not one in a hundred with talent enough to cover a five-cent piece!--and in the lower classes pulled down wages in factories and shops. "Amateur Man," he said, sarcastically. "Suppose we tried to do their jobs?" Then he paused to think what Fred's job, for instance, would be. Not discovering it offhand, he told himself again that if
<pb n="96     THE RISING TIDE"/>
women would keep busy, like their grandmothers--his contemptuous thought stopped, with a jerk; how could women do the things their grandmothers did? What was it Fred had got off--something about machinery being the cuckoo which had pushed women out of the nest of domesticity? "Why," he was surprised into saying, "she's right!"</p>
<p>He came upon the deduction so abruptly that for a moment he forgot his sore feeling about Frederica's youth. Suppose the women should suddenly take it into their heads to be domestic, and flock out of the mechanical industries, back to the "Home"? Arthur Weston whistled. "Financially," said he, candidly, "we would bu'st in about ten minutes." . . .</p>
<p>"Do you want to give me those prices to Laughlin before I go out to lunch?" a flat voice asked in the outer office; he slid into his desk-chair as the door opened.</p>
<p>"I haven't had time to look them up yet. Don't wait."</p>
<p>He took up his pen, but only made aimless marks on his blotting-paper; the interruption jarred him back into irritated denial of possibilities: "She amuses me, that's all; I'm not in the least--in love." Suddenly, with a spring of resolution, he took down the telephone receiver and called up a number. The conversation was brief: "Hello! Jim? . . .Yes; I'm Arthur. Look here, I want to break away for a week. . . .Yes--break away. B-r-e-a-k. I'm stale. Can't you go down to the marshes with me, for ducks? . . .What? Oh, come on! You're not as important as you think. . . .What? . . .I'll do the work--you just come along!"</p>
<pb n="97     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>There followed a colloquy of some urgency on his part, and then a final, satisfied "Good boy! Wednesday, then, on the seven-thirty."</p>
<p>He had hardly secured his man before he regretted it; the mere prospect of the arrangements he must make for the trip began to bore him. However, he sat there at his desk and made some memoranda, conscious all the time of a nagging self-questioning in the back of his mind. "<hi rend="italic">I'm not!</hi>" he said, again and again. "I'll get some shooting and clear my brain up."</p>
<p>But by the time he had sent a despatch or two, and called Jim Jackson up a second time to decide some detail, he knew that shooting would not help him much. The nag had settled itself: he had accepted the revelation that he was "interested" in Freddy Payton. With the contrast between the pain of the old wound and the new, he would not use the word "love," but "interest" committed him to an affection, tender almost to poignancy. Of course there was nothing to do about it. He must just take his medicine, as Fred took hers, "without making faces." There was nothing to strive for, nothing to avoid, nothing to expect. She was as good as engaged to Howard Maitland, and it would be a very sensible and desirable match;--to marry a man of forty-six would be neither sensible nor desirable! No; the only thing left to her trustee was to take every care of her that her eccentricities would permit, guard her, play with her, and correct her appalling taste. "Lord! what bad taste she has!" Also, while he and Jackson were wading about on the marshes for the next week, kick some sense into himself!</p>

<p>That very evening, dropping in to the Misses Graham's and partaking of a bleakly feminine meal, he laid his lance in rest for her.</p>
<p>Miss Mary was full of flurried apologies at the meagerness of the supper-table, but old Miss Eliza said, with spirit, that bread and milk would be good for him! "Now, tell us about that child, Arthur," she commanded.</p>
<p>"You mean Fred Payton, I suppose?" he said, raising an annoyed eyebrow. "I don't call her a 'child.'"</p>
<p>"You are quite right," Miss Mary agreed, in her little neutral voice; "she is certainly old enough to know how to behave herself."</p>
<p>"It's merely that she wants to reform the world," Miss Eliza said, soothingly. "Reformers have no humor, and, of course, no taste;--or else they wouldn't be reformers!"</p>
<p>"Your dear cousin Eliza is too kind-hearted," Miss Mary said; but her own kind, if conventional, heart made her listen sympathetically enough to the visitor's excusing recital of the hardships of Fred's life.</p>
<p>Once, she interrupted him by saying that it was, of course, painful--the afflicted brother. And once she said she hoped that Miss Payton was a comfort to her mother--"though I don't see how she can be, off every day at what she calls her 'office'--a word only to be applied, it seems to me, to places where gentlemen conduct their business. When I was young, Arthur, a girl's first duty was in her home."</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is nothing for her to do at home," Miss Eliza said.</p>
<pb n="99     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"There is always something to do, in every properly conducted household. Let her dust the china-closet."</p>
<p>"I'd as soon put a tornado into a china-closet as that girl! She ought to be turning a windmill," Miss Eliza said.</p>
<p>Her cousin gave her a grateful look, but the other lady was very serious. "I thought her manner to her grandmother most unpleasant. Youth should respect Age--"</p>
<p>"Not unless Age deserves respect!" cried Miss Eliza, tossing her old head.</p>
<p>Arthur Weston had seen that same flash in Fred's eyes. ("How young she is!" he thought.) But her sister was plainly shocked.</p>
<p>"Oh, my <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> Eliza!" she expostulated. "I am not drawn to Mrs. Holmes myself, but--"</p>
<p>"Neither is Fred drawn to her," Weston interrupted; "and she is so sincere that she shows her feelings. The rest of us don't. That's the only difference."</p>
<p>"It is a very large difference," Miss Graham said; "this matter of showing one's feelings is as apt to mean cruelty as sincerity. It's the reason the child has no charm."</p>
<p>"I think she has charm," he said, frowning.</p>
<p>There was a startled silence; then Miss Eliza said, heartily: "Don't worry about her! Just now she thinks it's smart to put her thumb to her nose and twiddle her fingers at Life--but she'll settle down and be a dear child!"</p>
<p>Miss Mary shook her head. "If I were a friend of the young lady, I should worry very much. Maria Spencer called on us yesterday, and told us a most unpleasant
<pb n="100     THE RISING TIDE"/>
story about her. She spent the night at an inn with this same young man that she smoked with here. Oh, an accident, of course; but--"</p>
<p>"Miss Spencer is the town scavenger," Weston said, angrily.</p>
<p>Miss Mary did not notice the interruption. "I cannot help remarking that I do not think that such a young woman would make any man happy." ("It was difficult to bring the remark in," she told her sister, afterward; "but I felt it my duty.")</p>
<p>"The man who gets Fred will be a lucky fellow," her cousin declared.</p>
<p>"You know her very well, I infer," Miss Mary murmured. "I observe you use her first name."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well! And I knew her father before her. But the use of the first name is one of the new customs. Everybody calls everybody else by their first name. Queer custom."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Very</hi> queer," said Miss Mary.</p>
<p>"Very sensible!" said Miss Eliza.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, we must just accept the fact that girls are not brought up as they were when--when we were young"--Arthur Weston paused, but no one corrected that "we." He sighed, and went on: "The tide of new ideas is sweeping away a lot of the old landmarks; myself, I think it is better for some of them to go. For instance, the freedom nowadays in the relations of boys and girls makes for a straightforwardness that is rather fine."</p>
<p>"Well," said Miss Mary, "I don't like what you call 'new ideas.' 'New' things shock me very much."</p>
<pb n="101     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I'm rather shocked, myself, once in a while," he agreed, good-naturedly.</p>
<p>"What will you do, Mary, when the 'new' heaven and the 'new' earth come along?" Miss Eliza demanded.</p>
<p>The younger sister lifted disapproving hands.</p>
<p>"As for the girls smoking," Weston said, "I don't like it any better than you do. In fact, I dislike it. But my dislike is aesthetic, not ethical."</p>
<p>"I hope you don't think smoking is a sign of the 'new' heaven," Miss Mary said;--but her sister's aside--"the Other Place, more likely!"--disconcerted her so much that for a moment she was silenced.</p>
<p>"I never could see," said Miss Eliza, "that it was any wickeder for a lady to smoke than for a gentleman; but, as I told the child, a girl's lips ought to be sweet."</p>
<p>"Her smoking is far less serious than other things," said the younger sister, sitting up very straight and rigid. "I do not wish to believe ill of the girl, so I shall only repeat that I do not think she will make any man happy."</p>
<p>"She will," Miss Eliza said, "if he will beat her."</p>
<p>"Oh, my <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> Eliza!" Miss Mary remonstrated. Then she tried to be charitable: "However, perhaps she is engaged to this Maitland person, in which case, though her taste would be just as bad, her meeting him here would be less shocking."</p>
<p>"If she isn't now, she will be very soon," Frederica's defender said.</p>
<p>"Well," said Miss Mary, grimly, "let us hope so, for her sake; although, as I say, I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> feel that she--"
<p>Miss Eliza looked at her cousin, and winked; he choked
<pb n="102     THE RISING TIDE"/>
with laughter. Then, with the purpose of saving Freddy, he began to dissect Freddy's grandmother--her powder and false hair; her white veil, her dog-collar--"that's to keep her double chin up," he said. "Yes! She is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> lively for her age!" He wished he could say that old Mrs. Holmes was in the habit of meeting gentlemen in empty apartments--anything to draw attention from his poor Fred!</p>
<p>When he left his cousins, promising to come again as soon as he got back from his shooting trip, and declaring that he hadn't had such milk toast in years, he knew that he had not rehabilitated Frederica. "But Cousin Mary feels that she has done her duty in warning me. Cousin Eliza would gamble on it, and give her to me to-morrow," he thought; "game old soul! But even if Howard wasn't ahead of the game, the odds would be against me--forty-six to twenty-five--and, besides, what could I offer her? Ashes! Kate trampled out the fire."</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX</head>
<p>IN those next few weeks Fred Payton was a little vague and preoccupied. The revelation which had come to her in that moment before the mirror when she had kissed her own hand, remained as a sort of undercurrent in her thoughts, although she did not put it into words again. Instead, she added Howard Maitland to her daily possibilities: Would she meet him on the street?--and her eyes, careless and eager, raked the crowds on the pavements! Would he drop into her office to say he had fished up a client for her?--and she held her breath for an expectant moment when the elevator clanged on her floor. Would he be at the dance at the Country Club?--and when he cut in, and they went down the floor together, something warm and satisfied brooded in her heart, like a bird in its nest. Sometimes she rebuked herself for letting him know how pleased she was to see him; and then rebuked herself again: Why not? Why shouldn't she be as straightforward as he? Hadn't he told her he would rather talk to her than to any man he knew? She flung up her head when she thought of that; she was not vain, but she knew that he would not say that to any other girl in their set. She was very contented now; not even the ell room at 15 Payton Street seriously disturbed
<pb n="104     THE RISING TIDE"/>
her. The fact was, Life was so interesting she hadn't time to think of the ell room--Howard, herself, her business, her league! Yet, busy as she was, she remembered Flora's desire for music lessons, and every two or three days, before it was time to set the table for dinner, she stood by the togaed bust of Andy Payton, trying to teach the pathetically eager creature her notes. But the lessons, begun with enthusiasm, dragged as the weeks passed; poor Flora's numb mind--a little more numb just now because Mr. Baker's Sam had suddenly vanished from her horizon--could not grasp the matter of time. Fred's hand, resting on her shoulder, could feel the tremor of effort through her whole body, as the thin, brown fingers stumbled through the scales:</p>
<p>"Now! Count: One--two--three--"</p>
<p>"One--two--oh, land! Miss Freddy, I cain't."</p>
<p>"Yes, you can. Try again."</p>
<p>"Why don't you jest show me a tune?"</p>
<p>"You have got to know your notes first; and you've got to count, or you never can learn."</p>
<p>"I don't want to learn, Miss Freddy; I want to play! Oh," she said once, clutching her hands against her breast, "I <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to play!" Her mournful eyes, black and opaque, gleamed suddenly; then a tear trembled, brimmed over, and dropped down on the work-worn fingers. "I cain't learn, Miss Freddy; I 'ain't got the 'rithmetic. I want to make music!"</p>
<p>Alas, she never could make music! The clumsy hands, the dull brain, held her back from the singing heights! "I cain't learn 'rithmetic," she said (sixteenth and thirty-
<pb n="105     THE RISING TIDE"/>
second notes drew this assertion from her); "and if I cain't play music without 'rithmetic, I might as well give up now."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't," Frederica said, helplessly. She had cut out the last quarter of her league meeting to come home and give Flora a music lesson. (Up-stairs, Mrs. Payton, listening to the thump of the scales, confided to Mrs. Childs that she didn't approve of Flora's playing on the piano. "The parlor is not the place for Flora," she said.) But, watched by Mr. Andrew Payton's marble eyes, the slow fingers went on stumbling over the keys, until Frederica and her pupil were alike disconsolate.</p>
<p>"You poor dear!" Fred said, at last, putting an impulsive arm over the thin shoulders; "try <hi rend="italic">once</hi> more! And, Flora, Sam isn't the only man in the world. Come now, cheer up! You're well rid of Sam."</p>
<p>"Sam?" said Flora, her face suddenly vindictive; "I ain't pinin' for no Sam! He was a low-down, no-account nigger--" The door-bell rang, and she jumped to her feet. "I must git my clean apron!" she said; and vanished into the pantry.</p>
<p>Frederica waited, frowning uneasily; callers were not welcome at 15 Payton Street when Fred was at home--the consciousness of the veiled intellect upstairs made her inhospitable. But it was only Laura and Howard Maitland, both of them tingling with the cold and overflowing with absurd and puppy-like fun.</p>
<p>"Feed us! Feed us!" Laura demanded; "we've walked six miles, and we're perfectly dead!"</p>
<p>"Pig!" said Fred; "wait till I yell to Flora. Flora!
<pb n="106     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Tea!" Her heart was pounding joyously, but with it was the agonizing calculation as to how long it would be before Miss Carter and her charge came clopping down the front stairs on their way to the room where Mortimore had his supper. "I don't mind Laura," Fred told herself, "but if Howard sees Morty, I'll simply die!"</p>
<p>"Don't you want me to light up?" Maitland was asking; and without waiting for her answer he scratched a match on the sole of his boot, and fumbled about the big, gilt chandelier to turn on the gas.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you played, nowadays," Laura said, looking at the open piano. "Gracious, Freddy, you do everything!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm only teaching poor Flora. She has musical aspirations. Howard, cheer up that fire!"</p>
<p>Tea came, and Laura said kind things to Flora about the music lessons; and then they all three began to chatter, and to scream at each other's jokes, Frederica all the while tense with apprehension. . .("Miss Carter won't have the sense to hold on to him; he'll walk right in!")</p>
<p>But, up-stairs, her mother, leaning over the balusters to discover who had called, had the same thought, and was quick to protect her.</p>
<p>"It's your Lolly," Mrs. Payton said, coming back to her sister-in-law; "and I think I hear Mr. Maitland's voice. I must tell Miss Carter to go down the back stairs with Morty." Having given the order, through the closed door between the two rooms, she sat down and listened with real happiness to the babel of young voices in the parlor. "I do like to have Freddy enjoy herself, as a girl in her
<pb n="107     THE RISING TIDE"/>
position should," she told Mrs. Childs; "just hear them laugh."</p>
<p>The laughter was caused by Howard's displeasure at Fred's story of some rudeness to which she had been subjected in canvassing for Smith--"The Woman's Candidate."</p>
<p>"If I'd been there, I'd have punched the cop's head!" he said, angrily.</p>
<p>Fred shrieked at his absurdity. "If he'd said it to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, you'd only think it was funny; and what's fun for the gander, is fun for--"</p>
<p>"No, it isn't," he said, bluntly.</p>
<p>"Howard," Laura broke in, "do tell Freddy the news!"</p>
<p>"It isn't much," he said, modestly; "I'm ordered off; that's all."</p>
<p>"Ordered off?" Fred repeated; "where?"</p>
<p>"Philippines," Laura said. "Government expedition. Shells and things. Starts Wednesday."</p>
<p>"I've wanted to go ever since I was a kid," Howard explained. "It's the Coast Survey, and I've been pulling legs all winter for a berth, and now I've got it. I came in to see you pipe your eye with grief at my departure."</p>
<p>"Grief? Good riddance! You lost me a client, taking me out to see those fool flats in Dawsonville. Have another cigarette. Lolly, how about you?"</p>
<p>"No," Laura sighed. "Billy-boy would have a fit if I smoked." She looked at Fred a little enviously. "I'm crazy to," she confessed.</p>
<pb n="108     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Oh, don't," Maitland said; "it isn't your style, Laura."</p>
<p>"Howard, do you really start Wednesday?" Fred said, soberly.</p>
<p>He nodded. "It's great luck."</p>
<p>"You'll have the time of your life," Laura assured him; "why do men have all the fun, Freddy?"</p>
<p>"Because we've been such fools to let 'em."</p>
<p>"Ladies wouldn't find it much fun--wading round in the mud," Howard protested.</p>
<p>"They ought to have the chance to wade round, if they want to!" Fred said--and paused: (was that Miss Carter, bringing Mortimore? Her breath caught with horror. She was sure she heard the lurching footsteps. No; all was silent in the upper hall).</p>
<p>Howard did not notice her preoccupation; he was pouring out his plans, Laura punctuating all he said with cries of admiration and envy. ("I'll <hi rend="italic">die</hi> if Morty comes in!" Frederica was saying to herself.)</p>
<p<"You've got to write to me, Fred," Maitland charged her; "I haven't any relations--'no one to love me.' Do write me the news once in a while."</p>
<p>"You're off day after to-morrow?" she repeated, vaguely; it came over her, in the midst of that tense listening for the shuffling step on the stairs, that she would not see him again--he would go away, and she would not have had a word alone with him! She felt, suddenly, that she could not bear it. For a moment she forgot Mortimore. "If you don't go up-stairs and say how-do-you-do to Mother, Laura," she said, abruptly, "you'll get your-
<pb n="109     THE RISING TIDE"/>
self disliked. And your mother is in the sitting-room, too." Even if Miss Carter and Morty appeared, she couldn't have Howard leave her like this!</p>
<p>Just for an instant, Laura's face changed; then she flung her head up, and said, "Oh, yes; I want to see Aunt Nelly. I'll be right back. (I'll give 'em a chance," she told herself, grimly.)</p>
<p>Up-stairs, she roamed about the sitting-room, sniffing at the hyacinths, and looking into the little, devout books, and even adding a piece or two to the picture puzzle on the table. Then she sympathized with Mrs. Payton's Christmas fatigue--"you oughtn't to give so many presents, Aunt Nelly!"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, it gets worse each year! People send me things, and of course I have to pay my debts. So tiresome."</p>
<p>"It's awful," said Laura; and straightened her mother's toque, and kissed her. "Darling, your hat is always crooked," she scolded, cuddling her cheek against her mother's. "Mama, we're going to have a suffrage parade, in April; will you carry a banner?"</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear!" Mrs. Payton protested. "One of those horrid parades here? I thought we would escape that!"</p>
<p>"Your father won't think of letting you walk in it, Laura," Mrs. Childs warned her, with amiably impersonal discouragement.</p>
<p>Laura's face sobered: "You make him let me, darling," she entreated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton looked at them enviously. Nobody hated those vulgar, muddy, unladylike parades more than she
<pb n="110     THE RISING TIDE"/>
did, but she knew, in the bottom of her heart, that if Freddy had snuggled against her, as Laura snuggled up to Bessie, she would almost have walked in one herself!</p>
<p>"Papa says those parades are perfect nonsense," Mrs. Childs said; "what good do they do, anyhow?"</p>
<p>"We stand up to be counted," Laura explained.</p>
<p>"Papa won't allow it," her mother repeated, placidly.</p>
<p>"I'm sure Mr. Weston will use his influence to prevent Freddy's doing it," said Mrs. Payton.</p>
<p>Then the two ladies exchanged their usual melancholy comments on the times, and Laura listened, making her own silent comments on one fallacy after another, but preserving always her sweet and cheerful indifference to their grievances. She looked at the clock once or twice--surely she had given Howard and Fred time enough! But she waited for still another ten minutes, then, coughing carefully on the staircase, went down to the parlor.</p>
<p>Her consideration was unnecessary. Howard, standing with his hands in his pockets, his back to the fire, had been telling Frederica that he was going in for conchology seriously. "I know you don't think shells are worth much," he ended, after giving her what he called a "spiel" as to why he was going and what he was going to do. "But to me conchology is like searching for buried treasure! I've been pawing round for a real job, and now I've got it. I don't have to earn money, so I can earn work! And I think research work means as much to the world as--as anything else. I wanted you to know it was a real thing to me," he ended, gravely.</p>
<p>"Shells aren't awfully vital to civilization," she said.</p>
<pb n="111     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>He made no effort to justify his choice; he had confessed the faith that was in him, but it was too intimate to discuss, even with so good a fellow as old Freddy. ("You can't expect a woman to understand that sort of thing," he told himself; "women don't catch on to science--except Laura. She sees the importance of it.") Then he broke out about Laura's hat. "Isn't it dinky?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Fred said, impatiently; they were talking like two strangers! "Howard, I hate to have you away in April. We're going to have our parade then, and I counted on you."</p>
<p>"What for?" he said, puzzled.</p>
<p>"To walk," she said, impatiently. His little start of astonishment annoyed her. "Perhaps you are glad to miss it?"</p>
<p>"I guess I am," he admitted, honestly. "I'm afraid I'd show the yellow streak."</p>
<p>She was plainly disappointed in him.</p>
<p>"'Course I believe in suffrage," he said, "but I hate to see a lot of ladies walking in the middle of the street."</p>
<p>"We're not 'ladies'; we're women."</p>
<p>"You're a lady, and you can't escape it. And I'd hate to see Laura do it," he added.</p>
<p>Fred had not a mean fiber in her, and jealousy is all meanness; but, somehow, she felt a stab of something like pain. She did not connect it with Laura; it was only because he was indifferent to what was so important to her--and to Laura, too. And because he was going away, and here they were, he and she, just being polite to each other!</p>
<pb n="112     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Laura and I don't enjoy the middle of the street," she said; "but I hope we won't funk it."</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">You</hi> won't," he said; "you are the best sport going!"</p>
<p>Her face reddened with pleasure. "Oh, I don't know," she disclaimed, modestly.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Laura's considerate delay ended. "I'm off!" she called, gaily, from the hall; "Howard needn't come until he is good and ready!"</p>
<p>He was ready in a flash. He gave Frederica's hand a hearty squeeze, then turned to help Laura down the front steps.</p>
<p>Fred closed the door upon them, and went back into the parlor. "<hi rend="italic">He is going away</hi>," she said to herself, blankly. Her knees felt queer, and she sat down. "Well, at any rate, Morty didn't butt in; I couldn't have borne that.". . .</p>
<p>Out in the wintry dusk, the other two were silent for a while. Then Maitland said, "How can she stand that house?"</p>
<p>"She's perfectly fine," Laura said, loyally.</p>
<p>"She's a stunner," the young man declared; "I never knew anybody just like her. Big, you know. Straight-forward. I take off my hat to Fred in everything!"</p>
<p>Laura gave him a swift look. ("Have they fixed it up?" she thought; "I gave 'em time enough!")</p>
<p>"But I wish she wouldn't mix up with Smith," he said.</p>
<p>"Smith believes in votes for women."</p>
<p>"What's that got to do with it? He's the worst kind
<pb n="113     THE RISING TIDE"/>
of a boss. As Arthur Weston says, to put Smith in to purify politics, is like casting out devils by Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, we stand by the people who stand by us!"</p>
<p>"She's dead wrong," Howard said, carelessly, "but I hope she'll write to me when I'm away. I shall want to hear that Smith has been snowed under."</p>
<p>"Of course she'll write to you," Laura encouraged him.("No, they can't have fixed it up. He wouldn't say that, if they were engaged.")</p>
<p>"Say, Laura, I suppose you--it would bore you to send me a postal once in a while? You might tell me how Fred's business is getting along."</p>
<p>"She can tell you herself. (Good gracious! She's turned him down! Poor old Howard!) I'm not very keen on writing letters, but I'll blow in a postal on you once in a while, to tell you that Fred is still in the market."</p>
<p>"I'd be awfully pleased if you would," he said, eagerly.</p>
<p>They were crossing Penn Park, and Laura, looking ahead, said, nervously: "See this dreadful person coming along the path! Is he drunk?"</p>
<p>"He certainly is," Howard said, laughing. She drew a little nearer to him--and instantly he had a friendly feeling for the lurching pedestrian!</p>
<p>"It frightens me to death to see a man like that," she said.</p>
<p>"He ought to be arrested," Howard said, joyfully--her shoulder was soft against his! "Not that he would hurt anybody--he's just happy."</p>
<p>"I'm not sandy, like Fred," she confessed.</p>
<pb n="114     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Oh, Fred would undertake to reform him," he agreed, laughing.</p>
<p>"Fred is--oh!" she broke off with a little shriek; the man, stumbling, had caught at her arm.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Excuse</hi> me, lady, I--" Howard's instant grip on his collar spun him around so suddenly that the rest of the hiccoughing apologies were lost in astonishment; he stood still, swaying in his tracks, and gaping at the receding pair. "The dude thought I was mashin' his girl," he said, with a giggle.</p>
<p>"Did he touch you?" Howard said, angrily. He had caught her to him as he swung the man aside, and just for an instant he felt the tremor all through her. "I ought to have choked him!"</p>
<p>But she was laughing--nervously, to be sure, but with gaiety: "Nonsense! Poor fellow--he stumbled! Of course he caught at my arm. Only just for a minute it frightened me--I'm such a goose!"</p>
<p>"You're not!" he said. But for the rest of the way to the Childses' house, he was very much upset. Laura had been scared, and it was his fault; he had taken the west path through the park, because that was the longest way home, and then he had bowled her right into that old soak! "I could kick myself for taking the west path," he reproached himself, again and again.</p>
<p>He hardly slept that night with worry over having made Laura Childs nervous. "She's the scariest little thing going!" he thought; "but she has sense." She had agreed with him in everything he said about the value of research work, and when he declared that science was
<pb n="115     THE RISING TIDE"/>
the religion of the man of intellect she had said, "Yes, indeed it is!" "That shows what kind of a mind she has," he thought; "but wasn't she cute about not smoking! Her 'father wouldn't let her.' Of course he wouldn't! A girl like that could no more smoke a cigarette than a--a rose could," he ended. This flight of fancy moved him so much that he made a memorandum to send Laura some roses the next day--"and old Fred, too; she's a stunning woman," he said, with real enthusiasm.</p>

<p>HOWARD MAITLAND'S departure in January for the Philippines surprised several people.</p>
<p>"Why should he take such a long journey?" Miss Mary Graham said to Miss Eliza--"unless it is that he discovered that Miss Payton is not the sort of girl to make any man happy, and simply left the country."</p>
<p>"I wager he carried a mitten with him!" Miss Eliza said.</p>
<p>"What! You think she refused him? Maria Spencer says she's only too anxious to get him. Meeting him in empty apartments! Perhaps that disgusted him. A gentleman does not like to be pursued.". . .</p>
<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>"Why has he gone away?" Mrs. Childs asked Laura, mildly interested.</p>
<p>"Because he wants to hunt for shells."</p>
<p>"But I thought he was so attentive to Freddy?"</p>
<p>"Maybe she turned him down."</p>
<p>"She'll get a crooked stick at last, if she doesn't look out," her father said, over the top of his newspaper.</p>
<p>Laura came and sat on the arm of his chair. "Fred doesn't need a stick, Billy-boy; she can walk alone."</p>
<p>"Every one of you needs a stick," Mr. William Childs assured her; "and I don't know that I would confine it
<pb n=" 117     THE RISING TIDE"/>
to the thickness of my thumb, either, as the English law does." He reached up a plump hand and pulled her ear. Afterward he told his wife that Lolly was down by the head: "What's the matter with her, Mother?" he said. His two sons might have failed in their various businesses, or taken to their beds with mumps or measles, and he would not have looked as anxious as he did when he heard the little flat note in Laura's voice. "Is she off her feed because I won't let her walk in that circus parade of Fred's?"</p>
<p>"Well, she's disappointed."</p>
<p>"I won't have a girl of mine tramping through the mud--"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it won't be muddy."</p>
<p>"It will! It always is. Anyway, I hope it will be. But if she is upset about it, I'll take her to St. Louis with me that week, so she won't feel she's backed out. Mother, you don't suppose <hi rend="italic">she's</hi> missing that Maitland chap, do you? Hey? What?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear me, no! Why, Mr. Maitland has been paying attention to Freddy for the last year."</p>
<p>"Why doesn't she take him, and stop all her nonsense? I hear she told those poor, silly strikers in Dean's rubber-factory to support Smith, the 'Woman's Candidate'! Much 'supporting' they can do! And the joke of it is, Smith himself owns the controlling stock. She had better be at home, darning her stockings."</p>
<p>"Oh, now, Father, you must remember it isn't as if Ellen didn't have plenty of servants to do things like that."</p>
<pb n="118     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I hear she's signed that petition to have certain kinds of diseases registered. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know what the world's coming to, that girls know about such things!"</p>
<p>"Well, of course, girls are more intelligent than they used to be."</p>
<p>"If she's so intelligent, I'll give her a book on Bacon-Shakespeare that will exercise her brains,--and she can stop concerning herself with matters that decent women know nothing about. Thank Heaven, our Laura is as ignorant as a baby! Or, if Fred is so bent on reforming things, let her have a Sunday-school class," said Mr. Childs, puffing and scowling. "Look here, Mother, if you have any influence over her, try and get her to take young Maitland. I should sleep more easily in my bed if I thought she had a man to keep her in order."</p>
<p>"But he has gone away," Mrs. Childs objected.</p>
<p>"That's because she has turned him down. Maybe he'll never think of her again; I wouldn't, if I were a young fellow! I'd want a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, not a man in petticoats. But if he does get on her track again, tell her to take him; tell her I say she'll get a crooked stick if she waits too long. You're sure Laura isn't blue about him?"</p>
<p>"Now, Father! You are the most foolish man about that child! . . ."</p>
<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>"Why has Maitland gone on that expedition, Fred?" said Mr. Weston.</p>
<p>"You can search me," said Miss Payton.</p>
<p>Arthur Weston's hands, concealed in his pockets, tightened. "She has refused him!" he said to himself. (Alas!
<pb n="119     THE RISING TIDE"/>
shooting ducks on the marshes had not helped him!) He had dropped in at 15 Payton Street, and Fred had taken him up to the flounced and flowery sitting-room.</p>
<p>"Mother'll be in pretty soon," she said; "so let's talk business, quick!" She was apparently absorbed in "business," which, as the winter thawed and drizzled into spring, flagged very much. "And the office rent goes right along, just the same," she told her trustee, ruefully. "I think, if I could have a little car to run around and look at places--"</p>
<p>"Maitland put that idea in your head!"</p>
<p>Frederica did not defend her absent adorer. Instead, she wailed over the rapacity of her landlord.</p>
<p>"You ought to have made your rent contingent on your customers," Mr. Weston teased her; and roared when she took it seriously and said she wished she had thought of it. "Give me some tea, Fred," he said; "these questions of high finance exhaust me." Then he asked the usual question, and Fred gave the usual answer. "But what do you hear from him?" Weston persisted. "I suppose you write to him occasionally? You mustn't be too cruel."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't hear much," she said. She took a letter out of her pocket and handed it to him.</p>
<p>When he had read it, he was silent for a while. ("If this is the sort of letter a blighted being writes," he reflected, "love has changed since my time.")</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Dear Fred</hi>," the letter ran, "<hi rend="italic">I'm having the time of my life. Tell Laura Childs I saw a shell necklace that she'd be perfectly crazy about. The dredging</hi>..."</p>
<pb n="120"/>
<p>Then followed two pages about shells, which Mr. Weston, raising a bored eyebrow, skipped.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Those books you sent were bully. They look very interesting. I haven't had time to read them yet. Tell Laura they use boa-constrictors here instead of cats; and tell her that the flowers are perfectly wonderful.</hi>"</p>
<p>Then came something about suffrage, ending with a ribald suggestion that the suffragists should get a Filipino candidate--"<hi rend="italic">He wouldn't cost so much as the chief of bosses, Mr. Smith; a Moro will root for 'votes for women' if you promise him a bottle of whisky</hi>."</p>
<p>"He is not losing sleep over being rejected," Arthur Weston thought, as he handed the letter back to her. . . He had lost some sleep himself, lately: "And there's no excuse for it," he told himself; "I didn't <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> in love, I strayed in--in spite of sign-posts on every corner! And now I'm in, I can't get out. Damn it, I will get out!" But each day it seemed as if he 'strayed' farther in. . . .</p>
<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>"Why has H. M. gone off?" Laura asked Frederica.</p>
<p>"Why, you know! Shells," Fred said, astonished at the question.</p>
<p>"Tell that to the marines. Freddy, you bounced him!"</p>
<p>"I did not."</p>
<p>"Well, then, if you didn't, what color are the bridesmaids' dresses to be?" Laura retorted.</p>
<p>"Get out!" said Frederica.</p>
<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>"Why has Mr. Maitland left town?" Mrs. Payton asked her daughter.</p>
<pb n="121     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Shells."</p>
<p>"Oh," Mrs. Payton said; "but I thought he--you-- I mean, I supposed. . .Freddy, he's a nice fellow. I wish--"</p>
<p>"Oh, nice enough," Fred admitted, carelessly.</p>
<p>"She's refused him," Mrs. Payton thought; and sighed.</p>
<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>Even Flora had to ask her question: "Mr. Maitland has gone away, they say, Miss Freddy?"</p>
<p>"So I hear."</p>
<p>"Men," said Flora, heavily, "is always going away! Why can't they stay in one place, same as ladies?"</p>
<p>"They are not so important as we are," Miss Freddy assured her.</p>
<p>"If they was all swep' out of the world, it would be just the same to me," said Flora, viciously.</p>
<p>Fred kept a severely straight face; all the household knew poor Flora had had another disappointment.</p>
<milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/>
<p>"Why?"--"Why?"--everybody asked. But Frederica only thought "why." Her first feeling when he went away had been a sort of blank astonishment. Of course, it was all right; there was no reason he shouldn't go, only--"Why?"</p>
<p>Every day, as she worked at her desk, or took a trolley-car to the suburbs to inspect some apartment, or sat in absorbed silence opposite her mother at the dinner-table, she was saying, <hi rend="italic">why?</hi> She was certain that he was fond of her. "Did he go because he thought I was so deep in business that I wouldn't bother with him? Or because
<pb n="122     THE RISING TIDE"/>
he wanted to show me he could put in really serious licks of work? Or because he was afraid I'd turn him down? Of course, I am awfully matter-of-fact," she admitted; "but all the same, he's blind if he think that!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, when her mother commented vaguely on the weather, or on Flora's indelicacy in being so daft about men, or Miss Carter's perfectly unreasonable wish to go to the theater once a week, besides her regular evening out--"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't go once a year," Mrs. Payton said--Frederica would start and say, "Beg your pardon? I didn't hear you." Nor would she hear her mother's dreary sigh.</p>
<p>"Freddy has nothing in common with me," Mrs. Payton used to think, and sigh again. It did not occur to her to say, "I have nothing in common with Freddy." Certainly, they had nothing of mutual interest to talk about. . . .Mrs. Payton was wondering dully whether she had not better take a grain of calomel; why they would not eat cold mutton in the kitchen; whether Flora wouldn't be a little more cheerful now, for Miss Carter said that the McKnights' chauffeur was making up to her. . . .Fred was wondering how soon her last letter would reach Howard Maitland; foreseeing his interest in its contents--the news that Smith had been beaten, but pledged to the support of suffrage in his next campaign; calculating as to the earliest possible date of his reply....Mrs. Payton was right; they had nothing in common. By and by, as the weeks passed, the mother and daughter, together only at meals, lapsed into almost complete silence.</p>
<p>"I love both my children <hi rend="italic">just</hi> the same, but Mortimore
<pb n="123     THE RISING TIDE"/>
is more of a companion than she is," Mrs. Payton thought, bitterly.</p>
<p>There was, however, one moment, in April, when Frederica did talk....Mrs. Holmes had come in to dinner, and somehow things started badly. Mrs. Payton had said, sighing, that she was pretty tired; "I really haven't got over the Christmas rush, yet," she complained. And Frederica, with a shrug, said that the Christmas debauch was getting worse each year. Then the suffrage parade was discussed. It had taken place the day before, in brilliant sunshine, and on perfectly dry streets, which greatly provoked Mrs. Holmes, who had prayed for rain. Naturally, she made vicious thrusts at the women who took their dry-shod part in it. She was thankful, she said, that William Childs had locked Laura up; anyhow, she hadn't disgraced the family!</p>
<p>"Do you call taking her to St. Louis 'locking her up'?" Fred inquired. "Laura gave in to Billy-boy, which was rather sandless in her. She is a dear, but she hasn't much sand."</p>
<p>"She has decency, which is better. To show yourselves off to a lot of coarse men--"</p>
<p>"Mr. Weston watched the procession."</p>
<p>"Only coarse women would do such a thing! And Arthur Weston might have had something better to do!"</p>
<p>Frederica held on to herself; she even refrained from quoting Mr. Weston's comment on the parade: "No doubt there were women in the procession who liked to be conspicuous; but there were others who marched with the consecration of martyrs and patriots!" But of course it
<pb n="124     THE RISING TIDE"/>
needed only a word to bring an explosion. The word was innocent enough:</p>
<p>"That Maitland boy," said Mrs. Holmes--"I've dropped my napkin, Flora; pick it up--why did he suddenly leave everything and go off?"</p>
<p>"Freddy says he's gone to dig shells," said Mrs. Payton.</p>
<p>"Dig what?" said Mrs. Holmes; "people mumble so nowadays, nobody can understand them! Oh, shells? Yes. Funny thing to do, but I believe it's quite the thing for rich young men to amuse themselves in some scientific way. I suppose it doesn't need brains, as business does."</p>
<p>"It isn't amusement," Frederica said; "it's work."</p>
<p>Upon which her grandmother retorted, shrewdly: "Anything you do because you want to, not because you have to, is an amusement, my dear. Like your real-estate business."</p>
<p>Frederica's lip hardened.</p>
<p>"However," Mrs. Holmes conceded, "to make his way in the world, a rich man, fortunately, doesn't need to be intelligent, any more than a pretty girl needs to be clever"--she gave her granddaughter a malicious glance; "all the same, young Maitland had better settle down and get married, and spend some of the Maitland money. (There goes my napkin again, Flora!)"</p>
<p>"I'd have no respect for him, if he did," Fred said. "He would be too much like this family--living on dead brains."</p>
<p>Her grandmother turned angry eyes on Mrs. Payton. "You may know what your daughter means, Ellen; I'm sure I don't!"</p>
<pb n="125     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I'll tell you what I mean," Frederica said, "you and Mother simply live on the money your husbands made and left you when they died. Since you were a girl, when you had to work because you were poor, you have never done a hand's turn to earn your living. Mother has never done anything. You are both parasites. Well, I am, too; but there's this difference between us: I am ashamed, and you are not. I am trying to do something for myself. But the only thing you two will do for yourselves will be to die." She looked at her speechless grandmother, appraisingly. "Yes, death will be a real thing to you, Grandmother. You can't get anybody else to do your dying for you."</p>
<p>"Ellen! <hi rend="italic">Really!</hi>" Mrs. Holmes gasped out.</p>
<p>"Freddy, stop!" her mother said, hysterically.</p>
<p>"Well, what have either of you ever done to earn what you are at this moment eating?" Fred inquired, calmly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton was speechless with displeasure, but Mrs. Holmes, shivering from the chill of that word Fred had used, helped herself wildly from a dish Flora had been holding, unnoticed, at her elbow. "Ellen, I simply will not come here, if you allow that girl to speak in this way--before a servant, too!" she added, as Flora retreated to the pantry.</p>
<p>"I merely told the truth," Fred said, with a bored look.</p>
<p>"Well," said her grandmother, "then <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will tell you the truth! You are a very unpleasant girl. And I don't wonder you are not married--no man would be such a fool as to ask you! A girl who cheapens herself by locking herself up in empty flats with any young man she
<pb n="126     THE RISING TIDE"/>
happens to meet, and signs indecent petitions, and rants in the public streets to a lot of strikers--why, you are not a <hi rend="italic">lady!</hi> You are as plain as a pike-staff; and you have no manners, and no sense, and no heart--you've nothing but cleverness, which is about as attractive to a man as a hair shirt! Maria Spencer told me she expected you would be ruined; but I said I would think better of you if you were capable of being ruined, or if anybody wanted to ruin you. You are not a woman; you are a suffragist! That's why you haven't any charm; not a particle!"</p>
<p>"Thank Heaven!" Frederica murmured.</p>
<p>"Well, unless men have changed since my day," Mrs. Holmes said, shrilly, "a man wants charm in a woman, more than he wants brains."</p>
<p>"It is a matter of indifference to me what men want, "Fred commented.</p>
<p>Her grandmother did not notice the interruption--"Though when <hi rend="italic">we</hi> were young, some of us had brains and charm, too! There! That's the truth, and how do you like it? Ellen, why do you have your napkins starched so stiffly--they won't stay on your lap a minute!"</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI</head>
<p>"I NEVER noticed her looks," Howard Maitland was saying, as he and another member of the Survey Expedition lounged against the railing of their tubby little vessel and looked idly down on an oily sea. They had been talking about women--or Woman, as Frederica Payton would have expressed it; and, naturally, she herself came in for comment.</p>
<p>"Pretty?" Thomas Leighton had asked, sleepily. It was very hot, and the flats smelt abominably; both men were muddy and dripping with perspiration.</p>
<p>Howard meditated: "I never noticed her looks. She keeps you hustling so to know what she's talking about, that looks don't count. She says things that make you sit up--but lots of girls do that."</p>
<p>"They do. Boring after the first shock. But they enjoy it. It draws attention to 'em. Our grandmothers used to faint all over the lot, for the same purpose."</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Howard said, grinning, "when they get going about sex, I don't know where to look!"</p>
<p>"Look at <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. That's what they want. And as most of 'em don't know what they're talking about, you needn't be uncomfortable. When they orate on Man's injustice to Woman--capital M and capital W--I get a little weary."</p>
<pb n="128     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I'm with 'em, there!" Maitland said.</p>
<p>The older man gave a grunt of impatience: "It isn't men who are unfair to women; it's Nature. But I don't see what can be done about it. Even the woman's vote won't be very successful in bucking Nature."</p>
<p>"I don't agree with you! Nature is perfectly impartial. Brain has no sex!"</p>
<p>"Nature impartial?"  Leighton repeated, grimly; "Maitland, when the time comes for you to sit outside your wife's room, and wait for your first-born, you will not call Nature impartial. Theories are all very pretty, but just try waiting outside that door--" his face twitched; and Howard, remembering vaguely that Mrs. Leighton had been an invalid since the birth of their only child, changed the subject:</p>
<p>"Miss Payton's just sent me a cartload of suffrage literature; came on the tug yesterday."</p>
<p>"Suffragist?--you, I mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes; aren't you? Let's get in the flap of that sail."</p>
<p>"Do I look like a suffragist?" the other man demanded.</p>
<p>Howard surveyed him. "I don't know the earmarks, but you show traces of intelligence, so I suppose you are."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you the earmarks--in the human male: amiable youth or doddering age."</p>
<p>"You're not guilty on the amiability charge, and you don't visibly dodder. So I suppose you're an anti."</p>
<p>"Not on your life! It's a case of a plague on both your houses."</p>
<p>They were silent for a while, looking across the lagoon at a low reef where, all day long, the palms bent and
<pb n="129     THE RISING TIDE"/>
rustled in the hot wind; then Leighton broke out: "For utter absence of logic I wouldn't know which party to put my money on."</p>
<p>"Play the antis," Howard advised.</p>
<p>But the other man demurred. "It's neck and neck. Some of the arguments of the antis indicate idiocy; but some of the suffs' arguments indicate mania--homicidal mania! It's a dead heat. It's queer," he ruminated; "each side has sound reasons for the faith that is in it, yet they both offer us such a lot of--<hi rend="italic">truck!</hi> One of the mysteries of the feminine mind, I suppose." He knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the deck-rail, and yawned. "As an example of 'truck,' I heard an anti say that for a woman to assume the functions of a man, and vote, was to 'revert to the amoeba.' Can you match that? But, on the other hand, look at the suffs! My own sister-in-law (a mighty fine woman) told me that men 'were of no use except to continue the race.'"</p>
<p>"That's going some!"</p>
<p>"But of course," the older man said, "it is ridiculous to make sex either a qualification or a disqualification for the ballot; and it's absurd that my wife shouldn't have a vote when that old Portuguese fool from Gloucester, Massachusetts, who guts our fish and can't speak English so that an American dog could understand him--has it."</p>
<p>"That's just it!" Howard said, surprised at his fairness.</p>
<p>"Why multiply him by two?" Leighton said, dryly.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't be a democracy if we discriminated against the uneducated!"</p>
<p>"I don't. I discriminate against the unintelligent.
<pb n="130     THE RISING TIDE"/>
You'll admit there's a difference? Also, allow me to remind you that democracy is not the ballot; it's a state of mind."</p>
<p>"Very well!" Maitland retorted. "Make intelligence the qualification: the women put it over us every time! They are far more intelligent than men."</p>
<p>"I'd like to hear you prove it."</p>
<p>"That's easy! Girls can stay in school longer than boys, so they are better educated."</p>
<p>"But I'm not talking about schooling!" Leighton broke in; "I mean just common sense as to functions of the ballot. Let women ask for an intelligence qualification, and I'll be the biggest kind of a suff! But while they don't know any more about what the ballot can and can't do, than to gas about its raising woman's wages--oh, Lord!" he ended, hopelessly.</p>
<p>"Suffrage in itself is educating," Howard instructed him.</p>
<p>Leighton nodded. "It ought to be. But I can't see that it has perceptibly educated our fish-gutter. Still, you'd like to meet his wife at the polls?"</p>
<p>The suffragist hesitated: "When women get the vote, they'll change the election laws, and weed out the unfit."</p>
<p>Leighton lifted despairing hands: "When you say things like that, I feel like putting my money on the suffs! Mait, get out of the cradle! Our grandfathers made a mess of it, by dealing out universal male suffrage; and our fathers made a worse mess in giving it to the male negro; now the women want to make asses of themselves, just as we did. They are always yapping about being our 'equals.' They <hi rend="italic">are!</hi> They are as big fools as we are.
<pb n="131     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Bigger, for they have the benefit of observing our blunders, and being able to avoid them--and they won't do it! Because Mr. Portugee has the ballot, Mrs. Portugee must have it, too. They say it wouldn't be 'fair' to leave her out. You'd think they were a parcel of schoolgirls! If women would ask for a limited suffrage, ask for the vote for my wife, so to speak--a vote for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> intelligent woman, cook or countess--I'd hold up both hands, and so would most men."</p>
<p>"It isn't practical."</p>
<p>"Practical enough, if we wanted to do it. And think what we could accomplish--the intelligent men, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the intelligent women! The people who buy and sell Mr. Portugee would be snowed under;--which is the reason the corrupt element in politics object to a limited suffrage for women! They need Mr. Portugee in their business, and rather than lose him, they'll take Mrs. P., too. So what's the use of talking? Votes for Women will come, in spite of all the antis in the land, for in this woman's scrimmage, though the antis have the charm, the suffragists have the brains; and brains always win, no matter how bad the cause! They'll get it--I'm betting that they'll get it in five years."</p>
<p>"You ought to hear Miss Payton talk about it," Maitland said; "she'd floor you every time. She's got a mighty pretty cousin," he rambled off; "<hi rend="italic">she</hi> has charm."</p>
<p>"Suffragist?"</p>
<p>"Laura Childs? You bet she is! And she has brains. Not like Miss Payton, of course. But--" he straightened up, and his eyes began to shine; his description of Laura was so explicit that his companion smiled.</p>
<pb n="132     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Oh, that's the lay of the land, is it?" he said.</p>
<p>To which Howard responded by telling him to go to thunder. "Trouble with Miss Childs," he said, "is that the fellows are standing in a queue up to her father's door-steps, waiting to get a chance at her."</p>
<p>"Why did you step out of line?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you the kind of a girl she is," Howard said, ignoring the question. "Of course, a man never would get stuck with Laura at a dance, but she's the kind, if she <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> he was stuck, would make some sort of excuse--say she wanted to speak to her mother--so as to shake him. No man ever wants to get clear of Laura, but she's that kind of girl. That's why men hang round so."</p>
<p>"You evidently didn't hang round?"</p>
<p>Howard yawned. "Did I show you the pearl I found yesterday?" he asked, and produced, after much rummaging in his various pockets, a twist of paper. Leigh-ton inspected the pearl without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Good so far as it goes. Hardly big enough for the ring."</p>
<p>Howard gave him a thrust in the ribs. "I'm going down to the cabin."</p>
<p>In his sweltering state-room he looked at his find, critically. "No, it isn't big enough," he decided. "Well, maybe I'll never have a chance to produce a ring," he added, dolefully; then he dropped the pearl into his collar-box, and mopped the perspiration from his frowning forehead. "Wonder if I shall ever be cool enough in this life to wear a collar?" he speculated. After all, why <hi rend="italic">had</hi> he stepped
<pb n="133     THE RISING TIDE"/>
out of the line? "I wish I'd prospected before I left home!" Yet he realized that he had not known how much Laura counted in his life until he got away from her. Out here, "digging for buried treasure" in the blazing sun, lying on deck through velvet, starlit nights, the recollection of that "queue" lining up at Billy-boy's front door-steps had become first an irritation, and by and by an uneasiness. He had had one card from her,--"<hi rend="italic">7&deg; above. Don't you wish you were as cold as we are?</hi>" The photograph on the back revealed a snowy mountain-side that was tantalizing to a man who had nothing to look at but blazing, palm-fringed reefs, and who, for weeks, had been sweating at 104. And it was not only the temperature that tantalized him--in the foreground of the picture were half a dozen of his set on skis. Laura, in a sweater and a woolly white toque, was putting a mittened hand into Jack McKnight's, to steady herself. Howard had not liked that card. "McKnight's got on his Montreal rig, all right," he thought, contemptuously; "he always dresses for the part!"</p>
<p>It was that postal which had aroused his uneasiness about the queue, and set him to counting the weeks until he could get into the line again. Also, it made him write rather promptly to Frederica Payton:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Hasn't Jack McKnight got any job? He's a pretty successful loafer if he can go off skiing all around the clock. Why doesn't Laura put an extinguisher on him? How is Laura? I suppose she and Jack are having the time of their young lives this winter.</hi>"</p>
<p>It was well on in July before Fred's reply to that par-
<pb n="134     THE RISING TIDE"/>
ticular letter reached him, and it made him tell Tom Leighton that Miss Payton--"You remember I told you about her?"--was the finest woman he had ever known. "No sentimental squash about Freddy Payton!" This tribute was given because Fred had said:</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Laura hasn't confided in me, but I'm betting that she'll turn Jack McKnight down. He's not good enough to black her boots, and nowadays women demand that men--"</hi></p>
<p>At this point Howard folded the letter and put it in his pocket. "Laura'll bounce him!" he said to himself; and for the next hour he expatiated to Mr. Leighton upon the charm of common sense in a woman--the woman being Miss Payton, of whom his hearer was getting just a little tired; but he was confused, too. At the end of an hour his gathering perplexity found words:</p>
<p>"But I thought it was the pretty cousin you were gone on?"</p>
<p>"You did, did you?" Howard said. "Digging shells has affected your brain, Tommy."</p>

<p>SPRING had sauntered very slowly up the Ohio Valley that year. During a cold and slushy April, Frederica paid her advertising bills, and was assured that the Misses Graham would want her to engage an apartment for them in the autumn. Also, she found a flat for a lady with strikingly golden hair, who later departed without paying her rent. This created a disgruntled landlord and instructed the real-estate agent in the range of adjectives disgruntled landlords can use. In May she was almost busy in finding houses on the lake and in the mountains for summer residents; but her traveling expenses to and from the various localities were so large that she had to apply to her man of business for an advance from her allowance.</p>
<p>"Look here, Fred," he said, "you can't live on your future commission from Cousin Eliza. Don't you think you've had about enough of this kind of thing?"</p>
<p>"I do not!" she said. "You can sponge my head between rounds, but you can't stop the mill. I don't pull off the gloves till I see it through. And I'm twenty-two dollars ahead of last month!"</p>

in Lakeville--the cheerfully vulgar suburb of Laketon where persons of her own sort played at farming. Lakeville was only a handful of flimsy frame houses scattered along under the trees close to the sedgy edge of the lake. Wooden piers ran out into deep water, and, when the season opened, collected joggling fleets of skiffs and canoes about their slimy piles. As yet, the houses were unoccupied, but the spirit of previous tenants, as indicated by names painted above the doors--"Bide-a-Wee," and "Herestoyou"--had been very social. Sentimental minds were confessed in "Rippling Waves," and "Sweet Homes" Fred's "bungalow," its shingled sides weathered to an inoffensive gray, was labeled, over its tiny piazza, "Sunrise Cottage."</p>
<p>"I think that's why I took it," she told Mr. Weston, when, having inspected its shoddy interior and paused on the porch to look at the far-off church spire of Laketon, they wandered down to a ledge of rock that jutted out into the lake; "women are going to raise the sun of freedom!"</p>
<p>"I hope they won't, accidentally, raise Cain," he murmured. "Fred, the lamp on your center-table almost put my eyes out! Do the Lakevillians really think that kind of junk beautiful?"</p>
<p>"They do. But don't be cocky; we thought it beautiful ourselves not so very long ago--if it was only expensive enough! Look at the parlor in Payton Street."</p>
<p>"That magenta shade with the autumn leaves on it is the most horrible thing I ever saw," he said, shuddering.</p>
<pb n="137     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I shall have lots of candles and a student's lamp to mitigate it," she comforted him.</p>
<p>They had settled down on the rock, Zip dozing against Fred's knee. It was an exquisite May afternoon. Everything was very still; once a bird fluted in the distance, and once, on the piazza of a boarded-up cottage, a chipmunk scurried through the drift of last year's leaves. A haze of heat lay on the water that crinkled sometimes under a cat's-paw of wind, and then lapped faintly in the sedges. The woods, crowding close to the shore, were showing the furry grayness of young oak leaves, and here and there a maple smoldered into flame. Frederica, absently poking a twig under patches of lichen and flaking them off into the water, was saying to herself that in about six months Howard Maitland would be at home.</p>
<p>"Lakeville is so unnecessarily hideous," Mr. Weston meditated; "I can't see why you should like it."</p>
<p>"Because my friends come here--people who <hi rend="italic">work</hi>! I'm going to start a suffrage club for them."</p>
<p>"How grateful they will be!" he said. His amiability when he was bored was very marked.</p>
<p>"But I had to cave," Fred said, "about having Flora here when I stay all night. The Childs family felt they would be compromised if people in Laketon knew that Billy-boy's niece flocked by herself in Lakeville. The Childses are personages in Laketon! Aunt Bessie is the treasurer of the antis, and runs a gambling-den on Thursday afternoons--she calls it her Bridge Club. And Billy-boy has a Baconian Club, Saturday nights. My, how useful they are! As my unconventionality would injure
<pb n="138     THE RISING TIDE"/>
their value to society, I said I would hold Flora's hand. How much use do you suppose Flora would be if thieves broke in to steal?"</p>
<p>"She would be another scream. And you'll like to have her wash the dishes for you."</p>
<p>"Flora is too much in love to wash dishes well," Fred said. "Besides, I don't mind washing 'em, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do it well. The idea that women who <hi rend="italic">think</hi> can't do things like that is silly. We do housework, or any other work, infinitely better than slaves."</p>
<p>"'Slaves' being your mothers and grandmothers?"</p>
<p>Frederica nodded, prying up a piece of moss and snapping the twig off short.</p>
<p>"Oh, Fred, you are very funny!"</p>
<p>"Glad I amuse you. Pitch me that little stick under your foot."</p>
<p>He handed it to her, and she began to dig industriously into the cracks and crevices of the old gray rock. "The idea of calling Mrs. Holmes a slave is delightful," he said.</p>
<p>"She is a slave to her environment! Do you think she would have dared to do the things I do?"</p>
<p>"She wouldn't have wanted to."</p>
<p>"You evade. Well, I suppose you belong to another generation." Arthur Weston winced. "Don't you think it's queer," she ruminated, "that a man like Howard Maitland is satisfied to fool around with shells?" Whenever she spoke of Howard, a dancing sense of happiness rose like a wave in her breast. "Why doesn't he get into politics, and do something!" she said. Her voice was disapproving, but her eyes smiled.</p>
<pb n="139     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Perhaps he likes to keep his hands clean."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, vehemently, "that's what I hate about men. The good ones, the decent ones, are so afraid of getting a speck of dirt on themselves! That's where women--not Grandmother's kind--are going to save the world. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> won't mind being smirched to save the race!"</p>
<p>"Frederica," her listener said, calmly, "when that time comes, may God have mercy on the race. Your grandmother (I speak generically) thought she saved the race by keeping clean."</p>
<p>"And letting men be--" she paused to find a sufficiently vehement word. "It's the double standard that has landed us where we are; it has made men vile and kept women weak. We'll go to smash unless we have one standard."</p>
<p>"Which one?" he asked; "yours or ours?"</p>
<p>"You know perfectly well," she said, for once affronted.</p>
<p>"I only asked for information. There's no denying that there are members of your sex who rather incline to our poor way of doing things. Oh, not that we are not a bad lot; only, to be our equals, it isn't necessary to sit in the gutter with us. Continue to be our sup--"</p>
<p>"Let's cut out bromides," she said. "You (I, also, speak generically)--"</p>
<p>"Thanks so much!"</p>
<p>"--have pulled enough of your 'superiors' down to share your gutter. It's time now for men to get out of the gutter and come up to us."</p>
<p>"You breathe such rarefied air," he objected. He really wished that on a day of such limpid loveliness she would
<pb n="140     THE RISING TIDE"/>
stop undressing life. He liked to be amused, but once in a while Frederica was just a little too amusing, and he was in the faintest degree bored, as one is bored by a delightful and obstreperous child. He gazed dreamily into the spring haze, watched a ripple spread over the lake, and noted a leaning willow dip its flowing fingers into the water.</p>
<p>"Did you see that fish jump?" he asked.</p>
<p>Frederica gave a disgusted grunt. "Men are all alike. You talk common sense to them and they go to sleep!"</p>
<p>"My dear Freddy," he confessed, "you have enunciated a deep truth. The average poor devil of a male creature, toiling and slaving and digging into common sense to make a living, isn't very keen on having it crammed down his throat on his afternoon out. Not that I am that kind of person. I find your 'common sense' very diverting."</p>
<p>A little patch of red burned in her cheeks. "That's what has kept women slaves--'diverting' men! I believe you prefer fools, every one of you."</p>
<p>"We like our own kind," he teased her.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, with sudden passion, "I am in earnest, and you won't be serious! This is a real thing to me, this emancipation of women. It means--a new world!"</p>
<p>"Yet this world," he began--the world before them, with its blue serenity of a gentle sky, its vitality of bursting buds and warm mists and cool, lapping water; the world of a woman's soul and body--was not this enough for any one? Why struggle for change? Why try to upset the existing order? And Frederica, speaking of such ugly things, was so very upsetting! As she spoke
<pb n="141     THE RISING TIDE"/>
she looked at him with the naked innocence which marks the mind of the reformer--that noble and ridiculous mind which, seeing but one thing, loses so completely its sense of proportion. The facts she flung at him he would have hidden from the eyes of girls. Yet he knew that they were facts. . . .He had protested that women should trust the chivalry of men, and she had burst out: "Thank you, I prefer to trust the ballot! 'Chivalry,' and women working twelve hours a day in laundries 'Chivalry,' and women cleaning spittoons in beer-saloons! 'Chivalry,' and prostitution! No, sir! unless his personal interests are concerned, man's '<hi rend="italic">chivalry</hi>' is a pretty rotten reed for women to lean on!"</p>
<p>The crude words in which she swept away his comfortable evasions made him cringe, but he could not deny their accuracy, nor avoid the deduction that one of the reasons there continued to be "ugly" things in the world was that until now the eyes of women had been holden that they should not see them. Men had done this. Men had created a code which made it a point of honor and decency to hide the truth from women; to shield them, not from the effect of facts, but from the knowledge of facts!</p>
<p>Frederica's knowledge was dismaying to Arthur Weston, both from tenderness for her and from his own esthetic sensitiveness; it was all so unlovely!</p>
<p>"How do other men take this sort of talk?" he asked; "the Childs boys, for instance?"</p>
<p>"Bobby and Payton? I would as soon talk to Zip as to them! They are like their father; they have chubby
<pb n="142     THE RISING TIDE"/>
minds. Laura is the only intelligent person in that family. She gave in to Billy-boy about the parade," Fred said, regretfully, "but she did go with me last week when I talked suffrage to the garment-workers. I tell you what--it took sand for Laura to do that! Uncle William was hopping--not at her, of course, but at wicked Freddy; and Bobby and Payton cursed me out for leading Laura into temptation."</p>
<p>"How about Maitland?" he asked. He had taken Frederica's hand and was examining her seal ring. She let her fingers lie in his as lightly as though his hand had been Zip's head, and he found himself wishing that she were less amiable.</p>
<p>"Howard?"--her eyes brimmed suddenly with sunshine; "oh, Howard doesn't belong on the same bench with the chubby Childses! He <hi rend="italic">thinks</hi>,--and he entirely agrees with me."</p>
<p>"Which proves that he thinks?"</p>
<p>She saw the malice of his question, and rather sharply drew her hand from his.</p>
<p>"When is he coming home?" Weston asked.</p>
<p>"November," she said, shortly, and gave a flake of lichen a vicious jab that tossed it out into the water.</p>
<p>"How's he getting along with his shells?"</p>
<p>"All right, I guess. I don't hear from him very often. He's left the region of mails. I've sent him a good many pamphlets and an abstract of a paper I'm writing for the annual meeting of the league. One of these days he'll stop puddling round with shells and do something, I hope. I won't let up on him till he does."</p>
<pb n="143     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Merely being a fairly decent fellow isn't enough for you?"</p>
<p>"Not <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> enough!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Fred, how young you are!" he sighed; then pulled Zip's tail and was snapped at.</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked her straight in the face. "Are you engaged to him?" he demanded, harshly.</p>
<p>"Heavens, no!" she said, laughing.</p>
<p>His hands tightened around his knees; he opened his lips, then closed them hard. "I <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> made a fool of myself," he told himself, afterward. However, his possibilities for folly were not visible to Frederica, who continued to lay down the law as to the work a man ought to do in the world. "When we get the vote," she said, "we'll show you what a citizen's responsibilities are."</p>
<p>"Thanks so much," he murmured. "You are going to do all the things we do, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Of course," she said, joyfully; "everything--and a lot you don't do because you are too lazy!"</p>
<p>"I suppose you will leave us the right to propose?"</p>
<p>"I'll share it with you," she said, and they both laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Fred," he said, "I must come back to the chestnut: you are our superiors, and we like you to be. I suppose that's because we are born hunters and are keen for the unattainable. We won't bag the game if it roosts on our fists."</p>
<p>"Well," she reassured him, springing to her feet, "<hi rend="italic">I'm</hi> not going to roost on your fist; don't be afraid!"</p>
<p>"Try me," he said, under his breath. But she did not hear him.</p>
<pb n="144     THE RISING TIDE"/>
"Come, Zippy, we must go home," she said, and extended a careless hand to Arthur Weston, as if to help him rise. He pretended not to see it.</p>
<p>("The next thing will be a wheeled chair!" he told himself, hotly.)</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
<p>ON the first of June Frederica transferred herself and a somewhat reluctant Flora from Payton Street to Lakeville.</p>
<p>"Flora think her beau won't go out there to see her," Miss Carter explained.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" Fred said. "If he wants to see her he'll come, and if he doesn't want to see her she'd better find it out now." But she was not entirely unsympathetic, and told Flora there would be a piano in the cottage so that the music lessons could be continued--which raised the cloud a little.</p>
<p>A day or two later Mrs. Holmes called at No. 15 to bid Mrs. Payton good-by for the summer, and the next week the Childses dropped in, in the evening, for the same purpose. They all made their annual remark: "How <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you stay in town in the hot weather?" And Mrs. Payton made her annual reply: "I hate summer resorts. I'm much more comfortable in my own house." Nobody asked the real question, "How can you stay here with Morty?" And Mrs. Payton never gave the real explanation: "My life is perfectly empty except for Mortimore; that's why I stay with him."</p>
<p>When they had all left town Mrs. Payton, who changed
<pb n="146     THE RISING TIDE"/>
her under-flannels and packed up her winter blankets by the calendar, put the stuffed furniture into linen covers, and told Anne to keep the shutters bowed all over the house--except in the ell; the sun was never shut out of the room with the iron bars over the windows. Then summer sleepiness took possession of the household. No one disturbed the quiet except when, occasionally, Arthur Weston, bored and kindly, dropped in to ask for a cup of tea. He told himself once, after a dull hour of drinking very hot tea and listening to plaintive details of Freddy's behavior, that he was going to leave directions in his will to have inscribed upon his tombstone, "<hi rend="italic">He seen his duty, and he done it</hi>." It occurred to him that he would not wait for the tombstone to suggest that same duty to Frederica. . . .</p>
<p>As the Payton house fell into somnolence, Payton Street woke up. The air, stagnant between sun-baked brick walls, was a medley of noises that sometimes sank to a rumbling diapason, or sometimes stabbed the ear in single discords: the jangle of mule-bells, the bumping of the car on the switch, the jolt of milk-wagons over the cobble-stones. In the provision-store all day long a parrot vociferated; from the livery-stable came the monotonous pounding of hoofs, or, when Mr. Baker sent out a hearse and some funeral hacks, the screech of grating wheels. Hand-organs came and went. Fruit-dealers cried their wares--"Strawberries! Strawberries! Strawb--" The ailanthus-shaded pavements swarmed with shrill-voiced children; they summoned one another to pull the parrot's tail or to look at the hearse; they assailed the ice-carts,
<pb n="147     THE RISING TIDE"/>
reveling in the drip from the tail-boards and sucking what bits of ice they could scrape up. Sometimes they squabbled raucously, sometimes wept; sometimes, hushing their betraying giggles, crept into Mrs. Payton's front yard and climbed up on the iron dog "to play circus"--until Mrs. Payton, always on the watch, discovered them and sent Miss Carter down to drive them away.</p>
<p>Except for skirmishes with the marauding children, Mrs. Payton's days were very placid. She worked out new puzzles and dozed through stories in the magazines. She wrote twice a week dutiful letters to her mother, pausing occasionally to think of something to say or to listen, absently, to the swish of the watering-cart along the street; she liked the wet smell of the watered cobble-stones mingling with the heavy odor of the blossoming ailanthus. There never seemed to be anything to tell Mrs Holmes, except that she had been dreadfully busy, and that the "accommodating" waitress didn't keep her sink clean, and that the barber's children were very trying. Every fine afternoon, sitting opposite Miss Carter and Morty, she drove out to the park and home again. Once she summoned up all her energy and went to Lakeville to spend a day with Fred. She thought that if she didn't go, Freddy would believe she preferred to stay with Morty. ("Oh, if I <hi rend="italic">only</hi> hadn't told her I loved him best!" she used to reproach herself.) It was a bitter thing to Mrs. Payton to pass through Laketon and see the place where a Payton girl ought to be, "instead of living with all kinds of people in Lakeville!" When Fred met her at the station and brought her to the ugly little cottage--its garish interior
<pb n="148     THE RISING TIDE"/>
vivid, now, with yellow pennons--she tried, for the sake of peace, to restrain her disapproval of everything she saw, but she couldn't help saying she wondered how Fred could stand the solferino lamp-shade.</p>
<p>"Hideous," Frederica said, carelessly, "so why look at it? I never look at our Iron Virgin."</p>
<p>"There is some difference in value," Mrs. Payton reproved her.</p>
<p>"No, only in cost," her daughter said; then saw the color mount into her mother's face, and gritted her teeth.("I needn't have said that--but it's true! Darn it, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> like him!") After that she tried to think of something pleasant to say, but what was there to talk about?--only the waitress, and the heat, and the barber's dirty children. Indeed, it would have been difficult to decide which found that visit to the bungalow the most trying, the mother or the daughter. Certainly it was a relief to both of them when it was over.</p>
<p>"Mother came out to the camp and I wasn't a bit nice to her," Fred bemoaned herself, one day, to Arthur Weston, when he met her entering No. 5 just as he was leaving it. He turned back and followed her into the parlor.</p>
<p>"And nobody can be so un-nice as you, when you put your mind on it," he said, genially.</p>
<p>She laughed. "You never talk through your hat to me; you're straight. That's why I like you."</p>
<p>"Then you'll like me more, for I'm going to be very straight," he warned her. He looked about for any kind of a cool seat, but subsided into a linen-covered feather-bed of a chair, close to the bust of Mr. Andrew Payton;
<pb n="149     THE RISING TIDE"/>
his eye-glasses on their black ribbon dangling in a thread of sunshine, sent faint lights back and forth on the ceiling. "Life is very dull for your mother," he said, fanning himself with his hat; "why don't you come in oftener?"</p>
<p>Frederica, on the piano-stool, struck a careless octave. "Life dull? Why, I think it's wildly exciting! As for coming in, I'm too busy."</p>
<p>"Reforming the world? You might begin the reformation by making things happier here. Happiness is a valuable reformatory agent. You could cheer Mrs. Payton up, but you prefer 'being busy.'"</p>
<p>Fred colored. He had spoken to her once before in this same peremptory way, and she had been angry; now she was embarrassed "I'm on my job. I've started a suffrage league--"</p>
<p>"There are other people who can start leagues. There is only one person who can make your mother happy."</p>
<p>"Mr. Weston, the relative value of picture puzzles and the emancipation of women--"</p>
<p>That made him really indignant; he stopped fanning himself and looked at her with hard eyes. "The doing of the immediate duty by each individual woman will emancipate the sex a good deal quicker than talking! You needn't stop your suffrage work to do your duty as a daughter. Did you ever hear anything about bearing one another's burdens?"</p>
<p>"Sounds like the Bible," Fred said.</p>
<p>"It is. I commend the book as a course in sociology."</p>
<p>"But," she defended herself, "I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> come home quite
<pb n="150     THE RISING TIDE"/>
often. I'm going to be here to-night. I'm going to a dinner dance at the Country Club, and I'm coming back here to stay all night."</p>
<p>"Yes, you will come for your own convenience, not your mother's pleasure. See here, Fred! You once asked me if you were like your father,"--involuntarily she raised her hand, as if to fend off a blow--"I had great respect for Mr. Payton in many ways, but he had the selfishness of power. <hi rend="italic">So have you</hi>. Whew!" he ended, rising, "I believe it's a hundred in the shade!"</p>
<p>Fred was silent.</p>
<p>"I am coming out to Lakeville in a day or two. Got my new car yesterday, and I am burning to display it."</p>
<p>Still she was silent. A watering-cart lumbered by and some children squealed in a sudden cold splash.</p>
<p>"Until now," he said, "I have believed that you were a good sport."</p>
<p>"And now you think I'm not?"</p>
<p>"You don't seem to know what the word Duty means;--which is another way of saying that you don't play the game."</p>
<p>"If the game is to make things pleasant for Mortimore, and put picture puzzles together, I don't care to play it," she said, cockily. She followed him to the front door and stood there as he went down the steps. But when he reached the gate she darted after him and clapped a frank hand on his shoulder. "<hi rend="italic">You're</hi> a dead game sport! I don't know any other man who'd have biffed me right in the face like that."</p>
<p>"I skinned my own knuckles," he admitted, with a
<pb n="151     THE RISING TIDE"/>
droll gesture of rubbing a bruised hand. "Still, I don't mind, if it does you good."</p>
<p>"Cheer up! Maybe it will," she said, and, laughing, threw a kiss to him and vanished into the house. He laughed, to--then frowned. "She wouldn't have kissed her hand to Maitland. I don't count," he thought. As he walked off, hugging the shady side of the street, he added, "I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> a fool!"</p>
<p>Frederica had not the slightest intention of becoming immediately domestic, but as she went up-stairs to dress she happened to glance down the little corridor in the ell, and there, outside Morty's door, was poor, faithful Miss Carter. Her one night off a week, when Mrs. Baker, from the livery-stable, took her place, did not suffice to lessen very much the burden of Morty's perpetual society, and that and the heat had obviously worn upon her.</p>
<p>"Miss Carter, why don't you go to the theater?" Frederica called to her, impulsively. "I'll stay with Morty to-night. I suppose we can't get Mrs. Baker on such short notice?"</p>
<p>"No, she can't come except on her regular night; and you are going to a dance, Miss Freddy," the tired woman objected, rather faintly.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I don't care about dancing. Go ahead. Get a ticket for 'Heels and Toes.' It's corking."</p>
<p>Her mother followed her into her room to thank her. "That's very sweet of you, Freddy. Not that Morty needs anybody when he once gets to sleep; so far as that goes, I don't need to go to the expense of having Mrs.
<pb n="152     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Baker here on Miss Carter's evenings out; but I like to feel there's some one near, you know."</p>
<p>"It's less lonely for you," Fred said, with unwonted insight.</p>
<p>"Yes," Mrs. Payton agreed, wistfully. "She's somebody to talk to. You needn't sit in Morty's room; outside the door will do. And I'll sit with you."</p>
<p>"I want to read, so I'll sit inside by the light."</p>
<p>"Well, don't be nervous. He won't stir."</p>
<p>"I'm not in the least nervous," Fred said; "I'm only--disgusted."</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton's chin quivered. "You ought not to speak so about your brother. Remember, even if he isn't--bright, he's a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, and the head of the family." Fred looked at her with genuine curiosity; how could she say a thing like that! "Besides," Mrs. Payton added, "Doctor Davis always said his intellect was there; it isn't <hi rend="italic">his</hi> fault that it is veiled."</p>
<p>"No, it isn't his fault," Frederica said, significantly. She took her book into the bare room, which could not be carpeted or curtained because of the poor, destroying hands that sometimes had to be tied for fear they would claw and snatch, even at Miss Carter's heavy chair or at the table, screwed down to the floor. There was a drop-light over the table, and Frederica turned it on and  opened her book; but she did not read much; the snoring breath from the bed disturbed her. Instead, she fell to thinking about Howard Maitland--sometimes she was impatient with herself for thinking of him so constantly! But the warm satisfaction that took possession of her
<pb n="153     THE RISING TIDE"/>
whenever he came into her mind, was an irresistible temptation. She did not often speculate upon his feeling for her. "He's fond of me," she told herself, once in awhile, contentedly. That some time he would tell her he was fond of her was a matter of course. Just now, she fell to calculating how soon her last letter would reach him. One from him, acknowledging the receipt of some suffrage literature, had come that morning. "I don't believe one woman in fifty has your brains," he had written. Fred smiled; when he came home in November she would show him those "brains"! Apparently, Mr. Arthur Weston did not take much stock in them--"He prefers the domestic virtues," she thought, with a flash of amusement. "I wonder if I'm domestic enough to suit him, to-night? I suppose he would think it was better to sit with an idiot than to try to move the world along!" But the next minute she was contrite. "He can't help being old. I suppose this is the sort of thing his generation calls 'Duty'!"</p>
<p>She might have reflected further upon the foolishness of the past generation, if just then Mrs. Payton had not come stealthily along the hall. She stood in the doorway, raising a cautioning finger.</p>
<p>"Oh, you can't wake him," Frederica said, in her natural voice. But Mrs. Payton spoke in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Freddy, isn't your cottage damp--so near the lake? There's no surer way to take cold than--"</p>
<p>"Not a bit damp!"</p>
<p>"Does Flora make good coffee for you?"</p>
<p>"Bully."</p>
<pb n="154     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"I hope she's more contented. Miss Carter says the whole trouble with Flora is she wants to get married, but she makes herself so cheap the men won't look at her."</p>
<p>Fred frowned. That word "cheap" always irritated her.</p>
<p>"Miss Carter is a good woman," Mrs. Payton went on, "but she's a little coarse once in a while."</p>
<p>"I suppose Flora wants a home of her own," Fred said, yawning; "when women have no brains they have to marry for homes."</p>
<p>"All women want homes, whether they have brains or not," said Mrs. Payton; "where would they have their babies if they didn't have homes? Freddy, it must be very lonely for you in Lakeville. Your Uncle William is really shocked about it. He says there are no people of our class there."</p>
<p>"Billy-boy is correct. I had two people of the better class in to supper last night--workers. Mother, one of the things the women's vote is going to do, besides giving the Floras of the world a chance to be independent of men, is to obliterate class lines."</p>
<p>"Then it will have to obliterate life," Mrs. Payton whispered. "Women need men to take care of them. And as for class, God makes a difference in people. You can't vote God down." It was so unusual for Mrs. Payton to set her opinion     against her daughter's that Frederica laughed, in spite of herself. Mrs. Payton laughed a little, too; then they both looked at the bed, but the heavy breathing went steadily on.</p>
<pb n="155     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Your grandmother thinks," Mrs. Payton said, impulsively, "that you would have more beaux if we lived up on the Hill."</p>
<p>"That's like her."</p>
<p>"Freddy dear, you know I have to stay here on account of Morty? Not that I'd do more for him than for you--I love you both just the same! But I couldn't take him up on the Hill."</p>
<p>"'Course you couldn't! Mother, for the Lord's sake, don't listen to Grandmother! She's one of the type that keeps the world back."</p>
<p>"She doesn't like change, that's all," Mrs. Payton explained. She came in and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>"Yes; she doesn't like change," Fred agreed. "If Nature had listened to Grandmother we'd all be protoplasm still. Probably the grandmother of the first worm that sprouted legs, kicked. No, she couldn't kick," Fred said, chuckling, "because she didn't have the legs she despised; she just said, 'It isn't <hi rend="italic">done!</hi>'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton looked perfectly blank.</p>
<p>"I'm going to use that idea in my paper," Fred said, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Do you think Howard Maitland likes you to write papers, dear?"</p>
<p>"Likes me to? Why shouldn't he? It wouldn't make a bit of difference to me whether he did or not, but as he has ordinary garden sense, I am sure he doesn't dislike it."</p>
<p>"Men," Mrs. Payton said, timidly, "don't like clever women."</p>
<pb n="156     THE RISING TIDE"/>
<p>"Clever men do."</p>
<p>"Your dear father was clever--but he married me."</p>
<p>The simplicity of that was touching, even to Frederica.</p>
<p>"You were a thousand times too good for him!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton was pleased, but she made the proper protest: "Oh, my <hi rend="italic">dear!</hi> I had a letter from your grandmother yesterday; she thinks it's shocking--your living in Lakeville alone."</p>
<p>"Go on!" Frederica said, contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Hush-sh!" Mrs. Payton cautioned her.</p>
<p>Fred shrugged her shoulders. "You can't wake--<hi rend="italic">That</hi>.Talk about being shocked-,-I suppose it never occurred toUncle William or Grandmother that their ideas of what is and isn't shocking, produced That?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Payton shrunk away as if her daughter had struck her; she murmured, chokingly, some wounded remonstrance, then tiptoed through the shadowy hall into the sitting-room. At the table, spread with an unfinished game of Canfield, she sat down, drearily. This was what always happened; they simply could not get along together! Whenever she held out empty hands, begging for love, they were slapped. She began to shuffle the cards, wondering painfully if it was because Freddy was still brooding over that thing she said about loving Mortimore best. "I'm afraid she's jealous," Mrs. Payton sighed.</p>
<p>Frederica, alone, reflected upon her mother's assertion that men disliked clever women. It annoyed her, not because there was any truth in it, but because it reminded her of Woman's cowardly acquiescence in Man's estimate of her intelligence. Of course it was all right about
<pb n="157     THE RISING TIDE"/>
Howard; Howard had sense! But men generally--did they really dislike clever women? If so, it merely meant that they were afraid of Truth. They wanted women to be timid, and pretty, and useless: to be slaves and play-things--so they fooled them into the belief that silliness was attractive, and that slavery and virtue were the same thing. It was men who had taught women to believe that awful thing her mother had said about Morty's being "the head of the family"; had taught them to believe that a man--not because he was good, or wise, or strong, but because he was a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>--was the one to rule!</p>
<p>"No wonder we are slaves; we've swallowed that lie since Adam. Well, there'll be none of it in mine" she said. What was going to be in "hers"? Business, to begin with. She was going to make a success of her business. Her books had shown a better month--they should show a still better month, if she wore her shoes out walking about town to please clients! Yes, Success! It was not a personal ambition: there was no self-seeking in Fred Payton; she wanted to succeed because her success would show what women could do; show that a woman was as able as a man--as wise, as good ("better! better!" she told herself); show that a woman could rule, could achieve, could be "the head of the family"! The thing that was to be "in hers" was work to free women from the shackles of the old ideals, from content in sex slavery, with all its ignorances and futilities, its slackness of purpose and shameful timidities, that a man-made world had called "duties." And Howard, who was not "afraid of clever women," would help her! A passion of consecration to
<pb n="158     THE RISING TIDE"/>
the woman's cause rose in her heart like a wave. For the next hour she walked up and down the dimly lighted room, planning what she was going to do for women.</p>
<p>It was nearly twelve when Miss Carter's ponderous step told her she was free. She laughed good-naturedly at the thanks the refreshed woman was eager to give, but just as she was leaving the room Miss Carter's last word caught her ear:</p>
<p>"I've had such a pleasant time, Miss Freddy. I'll do my work better for it."</p>
<p>'Do her work better.' . . . In her eagerness to do her own work Fred had never thought very much of other people's; but what a different world it would be if everybody did their work better! "If every woman did her best on her job, even if it were only taking care of Mortimores, it would help things along," she told herself. "It's slackness on the job that holds the world back." Looked at from that angle, then--the bettering of Miss Carter's work--perhaps it did count to make things pleasant at Payton Street? The idea put a new light on Mr. Weston's call-down. Bearing other people's burdens had seemed not in the least worth while; but if cheering people up helped them to do their work--work which, after all, had to be done, somehow--why, then there was sense in it. She saw no sense in "cheering" her mother, for hermother did nothing at all. Frederica had no dutiful illusions; Mrs. Payton was an absolutely useless human being--and her daughter was perfectly aware of it. "<hi rend="italic">She</hi> has no burden to bear," Fred thought, carelessly. "But to give old fat Carter a hand by just amusing her,--that
<pb n="159     THE RISING TIDE"/>
helps the doing of work; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> counts! I'll come in oftener," she decided.</p>
<p>So, in her own fashion, by a back door, so to speak, Frederica Payton entered into the old idea of <hi rend="italic">Duty</hi>.</p>

FRED was eager to impart to her man of business herwonderful discovery that visits to Payton Streetshould be made, not because of "duty," but because they were of value to the world."Your premises were wrong, but your deductions were correct," she instructed him, and he roared with laughter."Fred, you'll discover the Ten Commandments next.It's the same old result, only you call it by a differentname. But go ahead; run the universet I don't carewhat kind of oil you use, so long as the gears don't stick."Mr. Weston's metaphors confessed the fact that he hadachieved a motor so that he might go thirty miles for acup of tea. He used to come out to the camp two or threetimes a week, and, shading his eyes from the magenta lamp-shade, and the frieze of Japanese fans, and the yellow "Votes for Women" flags, listen dreamily to Fred'stheories for the running of the universe, and also to thatpaper on which she was so hard at work. She wanted hiscriticism, she said, but, of course, what she really wantedwas his praise. She got it-meagerly, and with so manyqualifications that, when all was said, it hardly seemed like praise at all.

Her arrogant and shallow certainties, onthe contrary, did occasionally irritate him, and, of course,they never brought him any conviction; but they didoblige him to be intellectually candid with himself, andhis candor brought him to the point of telling her that hethought her generation better than his, because it was notafraid of Truth. "So, perhaps you women may save civ-ilization," he said."Hoorayl" said Fred"Hold on," he told her, dryly; "cheers are premature.What I mean is that feminism, with its hideously badtaste and its demand for Truth, is here, whether we like itor notl It may make the world over, or it may send usall on the rocks.""Nonsense 1""The hope in it is your brand-new sense of social re-sponsibility.

"Because," he said, dryly, "they never suffer from any impediment in their speech."Yet he was not so much bored that he stayed away fromLakeville. The place itself seemed to him entirely funny.Its very respectable population was made up of hard-working, good-naturedly vulgar folk, whose taste was painful or amusing, as you might happen to look at it. Once Fred made him stay to supper, and afterward go to a party with her and Laura-whose presence had been secured by judicious pressure upon Billy-boy. This es- pecial festivity was called a "can-can" because the guests' idea of humor consisted in wearing a string of empty tincans over their shoulders, with a resultant noise when they danced which gave, it seemed, a peculiar joy.

It would boreme to death."They were on the little front porch of Sunrise Cottage-Laura lounging on the lowest step, looking up at thestars, and Arthur Weston sitting on the railing, sippingginger-ale. Frederica, standing up, began to expatiateon the woman's club she had organized. After the firstmeeting she had turned it into a suffrage league, underthe admiring eyes of ladies who whispered to each otherthat she was the Miss Payton-"you know? Society girl.Why, my husband says the Paytons could buy up everyhouse in Lakeville and not know they'd put their handsin their pockets!" Fred had constant afternoon teas forthese ladies -which would have been pleasanter if Flora,when waiting upon them, had been less haughty."She calls allour neighbors 'common people,' "Fred said.Laura laughed: "Wait til we get the vote and wellhave equality, won't we, Fred?""You bet we will!""You won't," Weston assured them, "because thereain't no such thing.

"Oh, well," she said, "of course, it's hard for people of your generation to keepup with the procession." If he flinched, nobody saw it. "You being the 'pro-cession,' I suppose?' he said, raising an amiable eye-brow-but he did not feel amiable. Then he looked athis watch and said he must start."Oh, don't go!" Fred entreated."You two girls ought to be in bed," he said.

"TheMcKnight chauffeur is very attentive," Fred said; "for-tunately for me, Jack's going off with the car for all ofAugust, or I'm afraid she'd leave me, so as to get back totown. Isn't it funny how crazy women in the lowerclasses are to get married?"Laura nodded, sleepily."Want me to read you Howard's last letter?" Fredsaid, and took it out of the pocket of her kimono.Laura, curled up on the bed, listened. "He's right,"she said, when Frederica, with due carelessness, readHoward's panegyrios on .her brains; "you are terriblyclever, Freddy.""Go offl" Fred said. "Laura, he's awfully down onJack McKnight.

"Of course, itdoesn't follow that a woman stands still when she marries.If she and the man are in absolute sympathy, intellectu-ally, she needn't vegetate. For my part, I expect tomarry,-I want children. But I shall go on with mywork.

CHAPTER XVE XCEPT for the Lakeville ladies, so looked down upon.by Flora, Fred had very few visitors that summer.Even Laura did not come very often, though Lakevillewas only five miles from Laketon. Perhaps she was afraidof being asked questions. In September both girls wereinvited by a school friend to come to the seashore for twoor three weeks, but Laura waited to know that Fred haddeclined the invitation ("I can't fool with Society. I'mon my job!" said Fred) before she, Laura, accepted it.There was, however, one formal call which gave Fred-erica great joy; her grandmother and Miss Eliza Grahamcame over from the Laurels to see her-and she never be-haved more outrageously! She told Mr. Weston after-ward that she had had the time of her life joshing Mrs.Holmes. He assured her that she was an imp, but thathe would gladly have paid the price of admission if hehad only known that the circus was going to take place.He asked his cousin about it afterward, but her descrip-tion of the scene was not so funny as Fred's. Indeed, itwas rather pathetic-poor Freddy, fighting her grand-mother, while Miss Eliza stood outside the ring, so to speak, and watched, pityingly."For there's nothing one can do for her, Arthur," MissI72

THE RISING TIDEEliza told him; "she's got to get some very hard knocksbefore she'll give up advising the Creator how to manageHis world."She and Mr. Weston had found a deserted spot on theveranda at the Laurels, and she told him what she thoughtof Freddy. "It's a sort of violent righteousness that pos-sesses the child," she said. "Where does she come from,Arthur? That motherl That grandmother! She mustbe a foundling."" Her father had power. His righteousness was not veryviolent, but his temper was.""She must make her mother very unhappy.""Yeast makes dough uncomfortable, I suppose," headmitted"She's an unscrupulous truth-teller," Miss Graham said,and repeated some of the impertinently accurate thingsthat Frederica, sitting in her ugly little living-room, withthe Japanese fans on the wall, and yellow "Votes forWomen" pennons over the doors, had flung at Mrs.Holmes. "Her grandmother said the 'women of to-daycheapenedl themselves'; to which she replied that 'thewomen of yesterday were dear at any price' ""She told me she had merely been truthful," Mr. Wes-ton said. "Justifying herself on the ground of Truth isFred's form of repentance.

"But the little matter of her notwanting me seems to be an obstacle."Miss Eliza, her old eagle head silhouetted against thedazzle of the lake, meditated; then she said, "Is she en-gaged to Mr. Maitland?""No, but she's going to be. Besides, dear lady, I am forty-seven and she is twenty-six. Youth calls to Youth!Please don't suggest that she might prefer to be an 'oldman's darling.'""You're not an old man.

He can't stop talking abouther brains for five minutes at a time!"Miss Eliza gave him a keen look. "Well, perhaps humannature has changed since my time. Then, a boy didn'tfall in love with a girl's brains, though a grown man some-times did. Cleverness in a girl is like playfulness in akitten; it amuses a middle-aged man.

THE RISING TIDE really gave it much thought, one way or the other, untilI went to an anti-suffrage meeting last year; that mademe a suffragist! I declare, the foolishness of some of theirarguments against voting went a long ways toward prov-ing that perhaps they really haven't the brains to vote Somebody said-Bessie Childs, I believe it was-that theballot would take woman out of the Home. I reflectedthat Bridge took Bessie out of her home, for three or fourhours once a week, and voting would take her out forthree or four minutes, once a year. But I kept quiet untilsomebody intimated that the 'hand that rocks the cradle'is not competent, if you please, to deposit a ballot! ThenI stood right up in meeting, and said, 'I'm only a poor old maid, but to my way of thinking, if the hand is as incom-petent as that, it is far more dangerous to trust a cradleto it than a ballot!'" "What did they say to that?""They said a cradle was every woman's first duty.'But it would be most improper in me to have a cradler I said. I know they thought me coarse.""So you are a suffragist?""Indeed I'm not! I went to a sufrage meeting, andreally, Arthur, I was ashamed of my sex; such violencelsuch conceit!  such shallowness! such impropriety!One of them said that any married woman whose husband did not believe in suffrage should leave him or else havebranded on her forehead a word-I cannot repeat to youthe word she used.

No; the thing that troubles me isn't suf-frage or non-sufrage; it's the fact that somehow womenseem to be fighting Nature. That worries me. I knowthat Nature can be depended upon to spank them intocommon sense when she gets hold of them, but, unfor-tunately, men won't help Nature out. They don't likegirls like Miss Payton-I mean, the young men don't.They don't like girls who are cleverer than they are; butno girl is cleverer than youl Do 'come out of the West,Lochinvar, come out of the West'!"He laughed and shook his head.

CHAPTER XVI BUT it was the middle of October that saw HowardMaitland back again in town. In spite of Frederica'sfriendly assurance that Jack McKnight hadn't a ghost ofa chance, that "queue" lining up at Mr. William Childs'sfront door-steps bothered him. So, with many large casesof specimens, and a mahogany tan on his lean face, hearrived, one morning, on the Western express.  He hardly waited to remove the evidences of several nightsin the sleeping-car, before reconnoitering the Childshouse. The queue was not visible, but neither was Laura.She was in Philadelphia, a maid told him, and would notbe back for another week. He went off rather crest-fallen."I'll go and see Freddy," he consoled himself.As he shot up in an elevator in the Sturtevant Building,whom should he run across but old Weston! "I'm on myway to the real-estate office," he said, grinning like thecub he was, at Fred's plaything.Mr. Weston did not grin. "I believe she's in her office.Thought you weren't to get home until next month?""Wasn't. But-well, I got kind of stale on shells, andI thought I'd like some smoke and soot for a change. So I came home. Oh-you get off here?"80o
<pb n="181"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Yes," Mr. Weston said, briefly, and stepped out intothe echoing corridor. In his private office he sat down,and, with his hands in his pockets, his legs stretched outin front of him, regarded his boots."Well, he's back," he said to himself.After a long time he got up, put on his hat, and, heed-less of the questioning young lady at the typewriter,slammed his office door behind him. "I'm hard hit," hetold himself, roughly, as he stepped into the descendingelevator. "It appears that I am capable of feeling some-thing more than 'amusemet.' I'll go and buy the wed-ding-present. The application of a check that I can'tafford may be curative."The cure would have seemed still more necessary if hecould have seen how Howard was welcomed in the real-estate office. Frederica's astonished pleasure was as frankas a man's."Good work!" she said, and struck her hand into his."But I didn't expect you far a month!""I couldn't stand it any longer," he told her, joyously."How's business? How's Laura?""Well, clients are not exactly blocking the corridors,"she said; "but I'm bursting with pride; I came outahead last month!""Gee!" he said, admiringly. "Well, tell us the news!""I've finished my paper," she said. She pushed anopen map aside so that she could sit on the edge of herbig office table, and looked at him delightedly. "I'm crazyto read it to you. Sit down and light up!" She strucka match on the sole of her shoe, and handed it to him.iz8

THE RISING TIDE"I'm crazy to hear it! Laura's skiddooed. I went toBilly-boy's"-he blew the match out and dropped it onthe floor;-"and got thrown down on the front steps.""Yes, she's playing around with the Mortons. I wasasked, but-there are so many more interesting thingshere! Howard, they are talking about abolishing thered-light district, and we're going to get that bill I wroteyou about, through the Legislature, if we bust" "What bill?""Registration. Health certificate-or no marriage li-cense! You've got to roll up your sleeves and get busy.""All right," he agreed, promptly. "She's not engaged,is she?""Who? Laura? Heavens, no! She has something elseto think of than your sex. Look here: why don't you comeout to my bungalow and we'll talk things out?" She ex-plained that though she had moved back to Payton Streetshe still used the camp when she had what she called a"night out." "I take Flora along for propriety. Isn't thatrich? I tell you what, I've been a boon to the whole con-nection. I've given 'em something to talk about!""What's the matter with going out in my car this after-noon?" he asked. But she put him off until the next day.She was thinking that she must brace the house up andarrange for a rattling good supper! "We'll have a bigfire," she thought, cozily, "and we'll sit up and talk tillall's blue. ... You'll stay all night?" she said. "I've avery decent little guest-room."For once she startled him, but her frank gaze madehim almost ashamed of his instinctive sense of fitness.I82
<pb n="183"/>
THE RISING TIDEHe said no, he wouldn't stay all night; he had to be onhand very early the next morning to look after a consign-ment of freight. "But I'll turn up at Payton Street inthe car to-morrow afternoon, about four. Is that right?""Just right," she said. She had decided quickly thatshe would send Flora out Friday morning with provi-sions. "I bet he'll take notice when I feed himl" shethought. "What kind of a salad shall I have? Not oneof those footling 'ladies' luncheon' things, all nuts andapples and stuffed truck. Men want just lettuce ortomatoes. No fancy doingsl"She was anxious to get rid of him and go home and makeher plans. It occurred to her to ask her mother what kindof cheese a man would like. But no, that would involveher in a lot of talk about "propriety." She nodded to himover her shoulder as he left the office, and the next minuteshe heard the elevator door clang behind him. Then, witha furtive glance about the room, as if to make sure she wasalone, she stooped and picked up that half-burnt matchwhich had lighted his cigarette. ... For a minute sheheld it in her hand, then laughed, shamefacedly, and putit in her pocket-book. Her face was vivid with happiness.She pulled down the top of her desk, then flung it up again,and scrawled on one of her business cards: "Closed untilMonday morning."   "I'll stick that in the door," shesaid; "I sha'n't be able to spare a minute for the office to-morrow." But, despite her haste, she stood for a dreamymoment smiling into space. Then she sat down in herrevolving chair and sunk her chin on her fist.He couldn't stand it any longerlz83
<pb n="184"/>
THE RISING TIDEThe words sang themselves in her heart. "Goosel Whydid he 'stand it' as long as he did? Well, he didn't loseany time getting to the Sturtevant Building!" She feltquite confident that he wouldn't "stand it" longer thanthe next night, then, alone before the fire in her littlehouse, he would-ask her.  The thought was like wine!But instantly another thought made her quiver. Whyshould he "ask," when she was so ready to give? Shewished that instead of "asking" her he would take thingsfor granted. She wished he would just say: "When shallwe be married, Fred?" And she would say, just as non-chalantly, "Oh, any old time!" And he would say, "To-morrow?" And she would say, "Oh, well, the familywouldn't like it if we didn't let 'em celebrate getting meoff their hands!"  She thought of Laura's anxiety aboutthe bridesmaids' dresses, and smiled. "I hate that kind offuss as much as men do, but it would be a sham  to dis-appoint Lolly." So she would say, " Call it a month fromnow." Then he would urge-that brought the otherthought again. Why should he urge?-when all shewanted was to give! Oh, how much she wanted to give!Her heart seemed to rise in her throat, and she said, aloud,"Why not? Why not?" A pang of happiness brought thetears to her eyes. It was not only love that stirred her-the simple, human instinct-it was the realization thatlove was seconded by an intellectual conviction, and thatshe could show by her own act that women and men areequals, not only in all the things for which she had beenfighting (they seemed so little nowl)-opinions, rights,privileges; but equals also in this supreme business ofI84

THE RISING TIDEloving. Yes, there was no reason why she should not bethe one to ask. No reason why she should not be thebeggarl The generosity of it made her glad from head tofoot. She stood up, her lips parted, her breath catching inher throat; she would give, before he could ask! It wasa sacramental instant; for with- the purpose of giving-"herself, her soul and body"-was that exalted realizationthat an opinion of the mind can be merged with an im-pulse of the body. She was profoundly shaken and sol-emn. Suddenly she put herhands over herface, and stoodmotionless: there were no words, but the gesture was aprayer. When a little later she left her office her face waswhit. She was happier than she had ever been in her life.She walked home, stopping, on a sudden impulse, tobuy a bunch of violets for her mother. At her own frontdoorshe met the postman, who gave her a card from Laura:"irm going on to Boston-to stay wth the Browns. Homenext week." Under the little scrawling signature, "L. C.,"was another line: "Why not write H. M. and tell him tobring home some Fiiino gause for the bridesmaids"dresses?"Frederica bit a joyous lip. "Impl Well," she thought,with a queer little matronly air of amusement, "she'll gether dress sooner than she expects." Then she thrust herkey into the lock and let herself into the hall; the lightin the red globe flickered in the draught of fresh air, and.Andy Payton's hat moved slightly. The shut-up stillnessof the house was full of a sickly fragrance: "Bay rum!"Fred said, resignedly. "She has a headache, I suppose."She ran up-stairs, the violets in her hand. "Finished.13                  85 'I

Butthe puzzle was still chaotic; Mrs. Payton was standingbefore a mirror, tying a handkerchief around her head."Too bad you have a headache!" Frederica said."Mother, I shall want Flora to-morrow. I'm going to thecamp for the night. Here are some violets for you."Mrs. Payton put out a languid hand and said, "Thankyou, dear."Then she sank into a pillowy chair and tried to dabsome more bay rum on her temples, but it ran down herface on to her dress, and had to be wiped off, feebly."I hope it won't stain my waist," she bemoaned her-self. "The violets are very nice, dear. I always used tosay when I was a young lady-'Give me violets!' As forFlora, she is simply impossible! She's been crying allday.""What on earth is the matter with her?""I'm sure I don't know. Some nonsense about notwanting to live. Rather different from the way servantstalked when I went to housekeeping. She said-" Mrs.Payton paused, and with closed eyes cautiously-tipped thebottle of bay rum on the bandage across her forehead,then hurriedly sopped her cheeks as it trickled down fromunder the handkerchief. "Oh, dear, it will stain my dresslShe said she had 'nothing to do.' I said, 'Nothing to do?I can find you enough to do.' She said she was tired ofhousework. I told her that was very wicked.

Not but what Flora isa good girl, only I should be so much more comfortable ifshe was contented. I wish I didn't feel my girls' moodsas I do. When they are cross, I feel it in my knees. I'mtoo sensitive. Freddy, dear, ask Miss Carter to bring mea, hot-water bag. Oh, wait a minute! I want to speak toyou. I-"Something in the next room fell with a thud against thedoor; Frederica fled.  Mrs. Payton sighed and shut hereyes, pressing the fresh fragrance of the violets against herhot face."Why does she mind him?" she thought, with languidresentment. "If she was only like Aunt Adelaidel Iwonder if she'll remember to tell Miss Carter to get myhot-water bag."Frederica did remember, butshe did not tell MissCarter: she never went into that room in the ell whenshe could help it. She filled the hot-water bag herself,brought it to Mrs. Payton, suggested bed instead ofthe big chair, and vanished into the welcome silence ofher own room.Later, in the dining-room, as she dreamed over her soli-tary dinner, she roused herself to tell Flora that she wasto go out to the bungalow the next day. "You've got toget up a bully supper for me, Flora. Mr. Maitland iscoming."187

THE RISING TIDEThere was no reply, and Frederica looked up. "What'sthe matter? You got a headache, too?""I was expecting a friend o' mine would call on me to- morrow night," Flora said, sullenly.Frederica was genuinely concerned. "I'm awfully sorry,but Mr. Maitland is coming to see me and I really mustbe out there. Can't you put your friend off? Who is he?"Flora looked coy."Ah, now, Flora," Miss Payton said, good-naturedly,"what's all this? I must look into this!" The teasingbanished the gloom for a minute or two. "Send him alittle note and tell him you'll be home Saturday night,"Fred suggested. She wasn't quite sure of kitchen eti-quette on such matters; but, after all, why shouldn'tFlora do just what her young mistress was doing?"Maybe he will come to-night," she said, encouragingly,and Flora, with a flicker of hope, said, "Maybe he will;if he does, I guess I'll invite him to go to a movie with menext week.""Perhaps he'll invite you," Fred said.But Flora's hopes did not rise to such a height. "Ifhe doesn't come in to-night, I'll send him a reg'ler writteninvitation to a movie," she said, happily.'.1

CHAPTER XVIIA      things turned out, Flora might have seen her"friend" in Payton Street Friday night, had de-votion prompted him to call, for the festivity at the campwas postponed for three days. The moring mail broughtFrederica a brief line from Howard Maitland; he hadfound, he said, after he left her office, that he had to runon to Phladelphia Back Monday morning. If her invi-tation held good, he'd come out to Lakeville for supperMonday night. The letter ended with some scratched-outwords, which looked like, "I may have something to tellyou-" The obliterated line made her glow! But thedelay was disappointing. Three whole days before shecould hear that "something" he wanted to tell her-andshe wanted to hear! Well, it would give her more timeto fix things up in the cottage. With this in view, she andZip and Flora went out to Lakeville Sunday morning, andFred had a silent day to keep an eye on the dusting, andwork on her suffrage paper, and jolly Flora, whose plain-tive dullness was beginning to be rather trying."You must brace up, Flora," she said; "you haven'thalf dusted the legs of the table!

He'll write to me, and I'll git it Monday," she said. But it wasevident that she had very little hope of an acceptance.All that pleasant, hazy Sunday Frederica followed theold, old example of her grandmother, the cave-dweller,and decked her little shelter. She went into the woodsand brought back an armful of maple leaves and, withFlora's melancholy assistance, fastened them against thewalls and over the doors, hiding, to some extent, thefrieze of fans and the yellow pennons of the Cause. Sheeven took down the muslin curtains and washed and ironedthem herself, and put them up again, crisp and dainty.The little room bloomed with her joy. When she sat downto "polish" her article she kept jumping up every fewminutes to move a bowl of flowers, or put an extra bookon the mantelpiece."I wonder," she thought, "if he can read the titles fromthat morris chair?" She had decided in what chair he wasto sit. She tried the visual possibilities of the chair her-self and, by screwing up her eyes, found she could justmake out the appallingly learned names on the backs ofsome of the books. " That will show him what I'm up tol"she said.It was the old Life Purpose-the eternal invitationlThe bird preens itself, the flower pours its perfume, thegirl's cheek curves like a shell.

Everything was beckoninglStanding up, warming his hands at the fire while Fredran out to the kitchen to make fresh tea for him, the callerread the names of the books lined up in a row between thelighted candles on the mantelpiece, and whistled."Is this your light reading?" he said, as she came backwith the cream-pitcher. "For Heaven's sake, lay in somefunny papers for the simple male mind!" Then he pulledZip's ears, took his tea, and said he wished he could everget enough sugar."I saw Maitland on Thursday," he said, reaching foranother lump. "Yes, he is on deck," Fred said.Her man of business made a hopeless, laughing gesture,as if he gave up trying to solve a puzzle. "Are they en-gaged, or aren't they?" he said to himself. Her way ofspeaking of the cub was certainly as indifferent as it wellcould be! "But that doesn't prove anything," he thought,drearily.I9g

He put a friendly-but shrinking-hand onher shoulder as she went with him to the front door, and aminute later waved good night from his car. As he drovehome in a bothering white fog from the lake, he was veryunhappy. "It hurts more than I supposed it could," hetold himself.

At last, in desperation, she put on herthings, called Zip, and went out into the mist to tramp foran hour under the dripping branches. When they cameback, Zip horribly muddy, Fred was as fresh as a rain-wet rose, and full of the joy of living. "Only four hoursnow!"In the kitchen she wiped Zippy's reluctant paws, andtold Flora, who was sitting motionless, her hands idle inher lap, to hang her sou'wester up to dry. "Now, Flora,come to life!" she said. "If you come into the living-roomI'll play for you."Flora shook her head. "There ain't no use listenin' tomusic. There ain't no use in anything.

She bal-anced it as well as she could on the back of her hand, thenreturned it to him hurriedly. "Pretty good?" he said."Fine!" she assured him. Then, resolutely, changed thesubject; there must be no talk about rings-yet!Howard, a little disappointed at her indifference, putthe pearl, in its wisp of tissue-paper, into his pocket, andlistened to the outpouring of her plans for the winter workof the league. In the midst of it, he kicked the logs to-gether in the fireplace, and, sitting down, smoked com-fortably. Once he said that one of her arguments wasbully, and once he called her attention to the way thesparks marched and countermarched in the soot on thechimney back; "I used to call 'em 'soldiers' when I wasa kid.""I meant to read you my paper," Fred was saying,"but I guess it will keep.

Her voice was a little breathless.Howard, looking dreamily at the "soldiers," said, a-sently, "You bet you havel""I want to tell you just what we're up to about turn-ing down the rotten fellows," Fred said. "I want to talkit out with you and get your advice. But not now, be-cause-because there are other things I want to say. Butsometime.""Any timel I've just been laying for a jaw with you,Fred. I don't know any other woman I can talk to justas I can to a man!"At that, she couldn't help a little proud movement ofher head, and to hide her pride she stooped down andstroked Zippy; as she did so the firelight fell on her face,smiling, and quivering a little. Her good gray eyesbrimmed with joy. "Yes, we are pretty good friends,"she said."You see," he said, "you mderstandl Why, those let-ters of yours-I can't tell you what they meant to me!"He paused and laughed: "That reminds me.

"Laura gave me that," heinterpolated; "Leighton said--"She leaned forward and laid her hand on his arm; thesuddenness of her grip made him drop the little pouch,and as he stooped to pick it up, she said:" I've missed you-awfully."He did not see that she was trembling.

Instinctively she wasdrawing away from him; the smilin offer was still inher eyes, but a frightened look lay behind it. He did nottry to hold the withdrawing hands."Fred, I care for you so much-" He was white withpain. Frederica was silent. "I care for you so terribly,I-I have to be-straight.

THE RISING TIDEHis confusion was agonizing. He was trying to thinkhow he could tell her what she meant to him; how herespected, admired-yes, loved her  Only not-not justin the way she meant. He tried to say this, then stopped,realizing, dazed as he was, that his explanations only madethings worse." I am not worthy of the friendship of a woman as nobleas you are!""Oh, nonsense!

And oh, bythe way, did you give 'Aunty Leighton' the pamphlet onthe New Zealand situation?" She pulled Zip up on herlap, and teased him, kissing him between his eyes, andsqueezing his little nose in her hand.Howard said, as casually as his breath permitted, thatTommy Leighton was a fine chap-"but no mind, youknow. One of those people you can't argue with on anyreally serious subject like suffrage. Opinions all run intomolds. Can't bend 'em."  Now that he had got startedtalking, he couldn't stop; he talked faster and faster; hetold her everything he had ever heard or surmised aboutMr. Leighton; "his ideas belong to the dark ages-""Believes in sex slavery, I suppose?"

Her instant acquiescence, inspringing to her feet, was at once a relief and a stab."Would you mind," she said, easily, "putting a basketinto your tonneau and leaving it at our house? Flora andI will have such a lot of things to carry in town to-morrow."As she spoke, she was listening with satisfaction to herown voice-calm, matter-of-fact, friendly.He said he would be delighted to take the basket-" oranything elsel Load me up, and I'll deliver the goods inPayton Street to-nightl""Oh, no; it's too late," she said, laughing; "but ifyoull take it around in the morning-""Of course I will; delighted!""I'l tell Flora to take it out to the car," she said; andwent into the kitchen: "Flo-" she began, and stopped.The kitchen was empty. "Floral" she called, looking atthe unwashed dishes in the sink, and at Flora's untastedsupper set out on the kitchen table in the midst of aclutter of cards. She said a sinle distracted word underher breath; went to the foot of the stairs and called upto the little cell under the eaves ... No answer. Sheran up and looked into each room ... No Flora."She seems to have vanished," she said, coming intothe living-room with a puzzled look. "She isn't in thehouse. Do you suppose she can be wandering about inthe woods at this time of the night?"

THE RISING TIDE she was bothered about Zippy's eyes; that made a mo- mentary diversion. Howard examined the little dog'seyes and said they were all right; then made desultory re-marks about dogs in China. He was trying, wildly, to findsomething-anythingl-to say. Both were listening in-tently for Flora's step.  "I'll see if I can find her now,"Frederica said.He followed her into the empty kitchen. "Bird flown?"he said. He, too, was pleased to find he could speak socasually. Frederica opened the back door and strainedher eyes into the mist."It's awfully funny," slie said; "why should she goout into the fog? Floral" she called loudly-and theyheld their breaths for an answering voice. But there wasonly the muffled lapping of the waves and an occasionaldrop falling from the big tree. They went back to theliving-room, and looked at each other, blankly."Can she have started to walk into town?" he asked."Thirty miles? Howard, I am sort of worried aboutherl Do you remember? the door slammed, and-" shestopped short, remembering just when she had heard thatslamming door. "Do you think she can have been ill, andgone out to one of the other houses for help? No," shecorrected herself. "She knows every house in Lakevilleis closed!"Again she ran up-stairs, calling and looking; then theyboth went out on the back porch, and called.Again the lake answered them, lapping-lapping.

I'll go out and look.""No; but light that lamp on the center-table-acandle might blow out."He went into the other room, and she heard himscratch a match and fumble with the lamp-chimney. Inthat minute, alone, listening all the while for Flora's re-turning step, her mind leaped back to that moment infront of the fire. His look-astounded, incredulous,shocked-was burned into her memory; his distressedwords rung in her ears. She was not conscious of anypain because he did not love her. She was simply stunnedby the jolt of suddenly and unexpectedly stepping downinto the old, irrational modesties.....Her face began to scorch. She went out on the porchand called again, mechanically; some water dripping fromthe eaves on her bare head ran down one blazing cheek;the coolness gave her an acute sense of relief that struggledthrough the medley of tearing emotions; she was sayingto herself: "Where can she be? She hasn't washed thedishesl (He refused me.)"Howard, holding the lamp over his head, came up be-hind her and went down the steps into the mist. Fredfollowed him, Zip lumbering along at her heels."She must have left the house this way; we knowthat," she said."Come down to the beach," he said."Yes; sometimes she used to sit on that big rock,"Frederica remembered.He walked ahead of her; the light, shining through the210

They went thus,all three, single file, along the path to the rickety woodenpier; at the end of it, they stood staring out into themist. Twice he called, loudly, "Florl" ..."Not a soundl" he said. "Is there any possible placein the house where she could have hidden herself? I mean,gone to sleep, or anything?""Not a place! I've looked everywhee. (He refusedme.)"They turned silently to go back.

I'll go and see-"He climbed down the little bluff and waded into thesedge. The swaying mass that had looked like a stoneuntil a larger wave stirred it, came in nearer the shore,caught on the shoaling beach, rolled, and was still. Fred-erica saw him bend over it, then try, frantically, to lift itin his arms. She put the lamp on the wharf. ("Don'ttouch it, Zip "), slid, catching at tufts of grass, and bendingbranches-down the crumbling bank, plunged into thewater up to her knee, and together, half pulling, halfcarrying that sodden bundle, they stumbled over the oozybottom and through the sedges.

THE RISING TIDE"We must get her into the house," Frederica panted.And, somehow or other, they did it, Howard taking theshoulders, and Fred the feet. They were gasping with thestrain of it when they laid her on the floor of the living-room."Is she dead?" he said.Frederica thrust her hand into the bosom of Flora'sdress-and held her breath."I can't tell; we mustn't stop to find outl You knowwhat to do? Pull her arms up, this wayl"They stood over her, Howard following Fred's short,sharp directions, and, even in the horror of the moment,conscious of a wondering admiration at her efficiency.But no quiver of life came into the still face."We ought to get a doctorl" Fred said, at last, panting."I'll go instantlyl""No, the quickest way will be to take her to a doctor,not bring a doctor to her I""But if she is dead we ought not to move herl That'sthe law.""Law?

Again, lifting andstraining, they carried her out, and got her into the ton-neau. Then Frederica saw the lamp down on the wharf,burning steadily in the mist."Put it outl Put it outl Hurryl" she commanded;212

THE RISING TIDEand while he ran to do it she darted back to blow out thecandles in the living-room and snap the lock of the frontdoor-"never mind about taking the lamp into the house.Leave it on the porch!" she said. Then she got in thecar and, sitting down, put an arm about the crumpling,sodden form. Zip, fearful of being left, jumped on thefront seat, and glanced wonderingly back at his mistress."Fred," Howard said, agitatedly,"I think she's-dead.""So do I; but hurry! Don't lose a minutel" Then,through the noise of the clutch, she screamed at him:"Doctor Emma Holtl InLaketon!" And the cr jerkedforward."But that's a woman doctor," he called, over hisshoulder.Just for a moment the habit of revolt asserted itself:"Why. ot?"  Then, "Hurryl Hurryl"Dr. Emma Holt was five miles away. "I felt," HowardMaitland used to say, afterward, "as if she were fiftymiles away!"The fog was so thick it was impossible to speed withsafety, so they sped without it, and tore bumping alongthrough the white smother. Twice he looked around, andsaw Fred sitting there, rigid, with that face, open-mouthed,open-eyed, gray under its brown skin, wabbling, and drip-ping on her shoulder."She is magnificent!" he thought. "I couldn't do it."The second time he looked, some reflection from thelamps, gleaming in the fog, flickered on that set face, and5t seemed as if the eyes closed, then opened again.

CHAPTER XX"0\F course," Dr. Holt said, when it was plain thatnothing more could be done, "you ought to haveleft her where she was.""But we didn't know whether she was alive-" they ex-cused themselves."Was there anything the matter with her?" the doctorsaid; she was beginning to think of the certificate shemust make out. "Was she low-spirited?""She was dreadfully disappointed because she didn'tget a letter she was expecting.""Love-letter?""I don't know," Frederica said.She and Howard had left the office, where the deadwoman lay on the doctor's lounge, and were standing inthe front hall, side by side, like two children who werebeing scolded. From above the hat-rack, a mountedstag's head watched them with faintly gleaming eyes.Dr. Holt, a woman with a strong, bad-tempered face,was plainly out of patience with them both."I've got to get the coroner," she said, frowning; "andit's nearly twelve o'clock." Then she asked a questionthat was like a little shock of electricity to the two who,in this last terrifying hour, had entirely forgotten them-selves. "Did she have any love-affair?"215
<pb n="216"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Yes," Frederica said, in a low voice. ("He refusedgtn.")"Tell me, please," Dr. Holt persisted."She was-in love.""I suppose she was all right? I mean, respectable?""Flora?" Fred said, with a recoil of anger, "of courseshe was respectable.""That's what I thought. Man desert her? You spokeof a letter-perhaps she was hoping to hear from him?""No, he didn't exactly desert her. I mean, she thoughtsomebody was in love with her, several times. But noneof the men seemed-" Frederica's hands clutched to-gether-"to want her. So she was unhappy.""Oh," said the doctor. "Yes. I understand. Quitefrequent in women of her age. She would have been allright if she hadn't been-respectable; or even if she'd gotreligion, good and hard. Religion," said Dr. Holt, writingrapidly in a memorandum-book, "is a safety-valve for theunmarried woman in the forties, whose work doesn't in-terest her.""Flora was as good as anybody could be!" Fred said,hotly."Oh, I didn't mean any reflection on her character,"said the doctor, kindly, "I merely meant that any womanwho hasn't either work, or religion, or marriage, generallygets out of kilter, mentally. Of course," she meditated,tapping her chin with her fountain-pen, "you two mustgo to the coroner's with me."In the next hour and a half, of driving about to find thecoroner, then the undertaker, then arranging what was216

THE RISING TIDEto be done with the body, the "two" had no time for theself-consciousness that the doctor's words had rekindled-except for just one moment: they had come back toDr. Holt's house, and again were standing in the entry,below the deer's head. In the office, the coroner was ques-tioning Dr. Holt. The office door was ajar."This man, Maitland; do you know anything abouthim? Is he all right? Of course, you never can tell-"At that, they couldn't help looking at each other, witha flash of what might have been, under other conditions,amusement."Why, he's Howard Maitlandl" they heard Dr. Holtsay; "you know? The Maitland Iron Worksl""Oh!" the coroner apologized, "I didn't get on to that!'Course he's all right."Then Dr. Holt: "It appears the poor woman triedto get married, but she couldn't find a husband. So shekilled herself."This time the two in the hall did not look at each other.Fred stared up at the stag's glistening eyes. Howardbuckled and unbuckled his driving-gauntlets. For therest of her life, Frederica never saw a mounted deer'shead without a stab of remembrance.It was nearly four o'clock in the morning when every-thing was attended to and Howard turned his car home-ward. "Do sit in front with me, Fred," he said; "youcan't sit back there in the tonneau.""All right," she said, absently, and, getting in, pulledZippy on to her lap. As she sat down, she suddenlyrealized that Howard's request implied that he felt an em-i5                  2I7

THE RISING TIDEbasrassment for her which she was not feeling for herself.She began to feel it soon enough! Embarrassment flowedin upon them both. Howard talked about Flora-thenfell silent: ("She 'tried to get married'!") Then Fredtalked about her-and fell silent. ("He needn't worry; Iwon't drown myself!")The ride into town was forever! The bleary Qctoberdawn had whitened in the mist like a dead face, beforethey drew up at I5 Payton Street, and for the last tenmiles they did not exchange a word. Fred was thinking,dazedly, of Flora; but every now and then would comethe stab: "He refused me."Howard was thinking only of Fred. "Stunningl" hewas saying to himself. "She's not a girl! She's a man-no, I don't know any man who would have done what shedid. I couldn't have, anyway. I take off my hat tocourage like that!"Not a girl? Fred, not a girl? . . .When at last that dreadful night was over, and he hadleft the terrified Payton household, Frederica-the wonder-ful, the superwoman (superman, even, compared withHoward himself!), Frederica had, in a flash, been somethingless than superwoman; she had been pitifully, stupidly,incredibly feminine.It was six o'clock in the morning when he closed Mrs.Payton's front door behind him and went out to get inhis car-giving a shuddering glance at that pool of wateron the floor of the tonneau. Just as he was throwing inhis clutch he heard the door open again, and Fred called218

THE RISING TIDEto him. He went back, quickly; she was standing on thetop step, haggard, ugly, dripping wet; a lock of hairhad blown across her cheek, which was twitching pain-fully. She put out her hand to him, in a blind sort ofgesture, but she did not look at him. -"I just wanted-to say," she said, and paused, for thejangle of the mules' bells and the clatter of a passing cardrowned her voice;--"I wanted to-to say," she beganagain, with a gasp, "don't-" she stopped, with a sobbinglaugh; "don't-tell Laura."Don't tell Oh, she was a girl all right f-so Howard's thoughts ranas he drove home in the mist that had thickened into rain;Fred was a girl-a trembling, ignorant, frightened femi-nine creature! Suppose she did support a dead woman inher arms during that dreadful ride in the fog; suppose shedid stand by, promptly obedient to the doctor's orders inthat frantic time of endeavor in the office; suppose shehad decided, quietly and wisely, exactly what was to bedone, when it was plain that Flora's poor, melancholylittle life had flown; suppose the coroner did say that hehad never seen such nerve; suppose all those things-yetshe had said those two pitiful words: "Don't tell." Yes,Fred Payton was a "girl"!"You can talk all you want to about the 'new woman,'"Howard said, "I guess human nature doesn't changemuch...."It changes so little, that at that revealing instant onthe Paytons' front steps, with the light of the Egyptian219

Who knows ibut what, if there had not been all those weeks of rockingabout on the mud flats, listening to the eternal dry rustleof the blowing palms, dredging for shells, and botheringabout Jack McKnight, he might not, then and there, inspite of the wonderfulness of her, and because of the weak-ness of her, have fallen in love with old Freddy? As itwas, when she said that piteous, feminine thing, the tears had stung in his eyes; he wrung her hand, stammering out:"Newer! Why, I-you-"    But the door closed in hisface, and he went back to climb into his motor and go off to his own house.That was at six o'clock; it was nine before Mr. andMrs. Childs-summoned, to Billy-boy's great annoyance,  |while he was shaving-reached No. iS. They found Mrs.Holmes there ahead of them, and met Mr. Weston on thedoor-step.In the parlor, watched by Andy Payton's sightless eyes,the court sat upon Freddy-for, of course, the whole dis-tressing affair was her fault-she had dragged poor, crazyFlora out to that shocking camp!

Flora was just a servant." Even Mr.Childs winced at that, and for once Arthur Weston's facewas candid."I suppose that will get into the newspapers, too,"said Mrs. Holmes-" 'A young society girl puts roses'". .and all the rest of the horrid vulgarity of it.""I don't think human kindness is ever vulgar," Mr.Weston said, "and I am sure there will be no improperpublicity.

Or doesgrandmother demand that Howard shall 'make an honestwoman' of me before the sun sets? I know what you'vebeen up againstl""You are perfectly ehausted" he said, tenderly; "goup-stairs; I'll fight it out.""No," she said, briefly.She went into the parlor, looked at her grandmother,shrugged her shoulders, and girded herself for battle: "I'lltell you the whole story. Poor Flora has been suffering,probably for a year or more, the doctor says, from somemental deterioration. She was restless and unhappy. Ofcourse, we knew that, because she did her work badly-which inconvenienced us. As far as she was concerned, itdidn't trouble us. She was restless, because she wanted tobe married and settle down. And nobody wanted her;which seemed to us just-funny. But when you come tothink of it, it isn't very funny not to be wanted....When she couldn't marry, she tried to get interested insomething-music, or anything. She wanted to do some-thing.""Do something? Well, I could have giv--""I tried to make things better for her," Fred went on,heavily, "but I suppose I didn't try hard enough.

The horror of the thing gripped her.Weston saw her face growing gray under its powder/ Butstill she listened, straining forward to hear distinctly.Frederica was telling them of those terrible twentyminutes in the car, of the hour in the doctor's office, ofithe search for the coroner, of the drive to the under-taker's-then, suddenly, a curious thing happened: Mrs.Holmes, her face rigid, her false teeth faintly chattering,came up to her granddaughter and tapped her sharply onthe shoulder."I could have done it, too, when I was a girl," she said,harshly; "but"-her voice broke into a whisper-"notnow. I would be afraid, now." Then loudly, "I'm proudof you!

CHAPTER XXIIT was extraordinary how much better Mrs. Payton wasin the next few weeks. Every day she sat in the entryoutside Mortimore's door, and hour after hour she andMiss Carter talked about Flora. Sometimes Mortimorewas troublesome, and laughed or bellowed-and then hismother retreated; when he quieted down, she returned,and took up the story just where it had been interrupted.After each detail had been recited, and they had finallyburied poor Flora, rehearsing every incident of the funeral,they would reach the question of the disposition of herpossessions. Miss Carter had packed them up, and knewjust how valueless they were-"except that lovely collaryou gave her. Now I think that is too good for the Sal-vation Army!"At this point the discussion was apt to become heated,Miss Carter contending that Flora's things should be sentto one of the negro schools in the South, and Mrs. Paytonstanding firmly for the Salvation Army. Frederica, askedto decide between them, said, briefly, "Burn 'em.""Wouldn't that be wasteful?" Mrs. Payton objected, gently..She was very gentle to Fred now. Her daughter's     ;statement about being "in love" had been a very great  ,228
<pb n="229"/>
THE RISING TIDEshock to her, not because of its "indelicacy," painful asthat was, but because it awoke in her an entirely newidea: Freddy was unhappy It had never occurred toMrs. Payton that Freddy could be unhappy about any-thing-Freddy, who was always so strong and self-sufficientl That she should suffer, made her motherfeel nearer to her than she had since Frederica was lit-tle, and had scarlet fever, and Mrs. Payton hadn't takenoff her clothes for four days and four nights. So, whenher daughter's drooping lip expressed what she thoughtof that endless gossiping about Death outside Mortimore'sdoor, Mrs. Payton was very gentle, and only said that itwould be wasteful to burn Flora's things. Then shetried to explain that she sat near Morty to cheer MissCarter. (Freddy must not think it was on Morty's ac-count! It would be too dreadful if now, "on top of every-thing else," she should be brooding over those impatientwords, repented of the minute they were spoken!)But Fred displayed no signs of brooding over anything.She took up her interest in Life just where it had pausedfor a moment at the touch of Love. But before she set-tled down into the commonplaces, of real estate, anddances, and league work, she had that Pause out withherself....She told her mother that she was going to the bungalowto put things to rights. (This was about five days afterFlora's death.) "Everything is just as we left it. Shehadn't even washed the dishes. And I left a few thingsthere that I must bring home.""Take Anne to help you."Aft

THE RISING TIDE"Anne would have a fit-she's so superstitious! No;I don't need anybody.""I'll go with you," Mrs. Payton ventured.Fred was frankly amused at the suggestion. "YoulNo; much obliged, but I don't want any one."Mrs. Payton did not urge; back in her mind there wasa dim memory of a time when she, too, had been alive-and suffered, and wanted to be alone. She said some-thing, hesitatingly, to this effect to Arthur Weston,who dropped in that morning to know how they weregetting along. "Freddy has gone out to that awful place, to pack up,"she said; "I'm sure it's very damp, and I'm terriblyafraid she'll take cold. But she would go. Sometimes aperson likes to be by themselves," she ended.He was surprised at such understanding; but he onlysaid, quietly, that he would drive out late in the after-noon and bring her home in his car. "She can have eighthours to herself," he said. (He had had some hours tohimself in the last few days; hours of pacing up and downhis library-saying over and over, "If Maitland isn't inlove with her, why shouldn't I at least tell her that I--?Nol I have no chance. But if she should forget him?No, no. I mustn't think of it!")For the eight hours alone Frederica had been thirsting:Solitude.Lapping-lapping-lappaing waterWind in the branches.Shadows traveling across distant hills.And no human face! No human soundl 230

THE RISING TIDESo, with Zip under her arm, she took the early trainto Lakeville.From the station she walked along the sandy roadwhere dead leaves had begun to fill the wheel-ruts, downto the huddle of boarded-up cottages on the shore. Thelast time she had gone over that road, how thick the foghad been! Now, the lake was a placid white shimmeragainst the horizon's brooding haze, and the glimmeringOctober sunshine lay like gilt on the frosted ferns andbrakes. She did not meet a single soul. Except for Zip,dashing along in front of her, or an occasional crow cawing,and flapping from one tree-top to another, there was onlythe wide silence of the sky. The sense of getting awayfrom people gave her a feeling of relief that was almostphysical.When she reached Lakeville the sight of Sunrise Cot-tage was like a blow; she stopped short, and caught her.breath. The lamp Howard had left outside the househad fallen over-perhaps a squirrel had upset it; the sol-ferino shade was in fragments; leaves had blown up onthe porch. But the flinching was only for a moment-then she turned the key in the lock.The bungalow, with its shut-up smell, was just as theyhad left it, except that, in some indescribable way, ithad lost the air of human habitation. Perhaps becauseDeath had been there. In the faint draught from the opendoor a sheet of music slipped from the piano to thefloor and some ashes blew out of the fireplace. The cot-tage was absolutely silent.Frederica felt cold between her shoulders. She did not23I
<pb n="232"/>
THE RISING TIDEwant to go in, she did not want to have to turn her backon the stairs that led up to the vacant rooms-Flora'sroom! She shivered; set her lips and entered-but sheleft the door open behind her into the living world.The emptiness of the house clamored in her ears. Shefound herself looking, with a sort of fascination, at thedisorder of the chairs-which stood just as Howard hadpushed them aside when they brought Flora in. On thearm of the morris chair was a brass plate heaped with cigarette-ashes.  For some obscure reason those ashesseemed to her unendurable-how they had glowed, andfaded, and glowed again, fillin the room with warm|and lazy smoke, while she and Howard-  She lifted thelittle tray and threw the ashes, almost with violence, intothe fireplace. The movement broke the spell that hadheld her there looking at things-at the learned books,filmed with dust, at the half-burned candles, at the with-ered roses on the table. Zip nosed about at that water-soaked spot on the rug, and she spoke to him sharply;then went over and closed the piano.After that, it was easier to go out to the kitchen,though there was still a tremor at the thought of thoseempty rooms overhead.  Spread out on the table werethe cards, just as Flora had left them. In the sink wasthe clutter of unwashed dishes.... Fred drew a longbreath, opened all the windows, lighted a fire in the stove,and went to work.Of course the exertion of packing and cleaning was arelief. There was a great deal to do. So much that shefelt at first that she should need another day to get232

THE RISING TIDEthrough with it. But her capability was never moremarked-by noon she began to see the end. She ate herluncheon walking about, holding a sandwich in one handand padcing books with the other. She had arrangedwith her landlord to send a van to the cottage for thepiano, and it was also to carry her things back to town;she had thought of every detail. It was the way she didall her work-drawing up leases, or talking to women'sclubs, or, of late, "making things pleasant" at PaytonStreet. Even now, shrinking from the work that must bedone up-stairs, where it was all so empty-so full ofFlora-she was efficient, methodical, thorough. Shescanted nothing. Yet no amount of busyness dulled theache of misery which had goaded her out here to be alone-but she was impatient at herself for feeling the ache.It was so unreasonable to be miserable!When everything was done-the kitchen tidied, booksand clothing and personal odds and ends packed, even thelittle white curtains in the empty rooms up-stairs, alllimp and stringy from the creeping October fogs, pressedand folded and put away-it was still early afternoon.But there was no train into town until five; she wouldgive herself up to the silence.She went out on the porch and sat down on the loweststep in the sunshine. Zip ran about, chased a squirrel,then, curling up on her skirt, went to sleep. Sometimesshe rubbed his ears, sometimes stared out over the lake-She had been refused. "I am hard hit," she admitted,and her face quivered. However, she could stand beinghit! She could take ier medicine, and not make faces.16                 233
<pb n="234"/>
THE RISING TIDEArthur Weston had said that about her, and she liked toremember it.Suddenly her mind veered away into all sorts of unre-lated things. Queer that Howard cared so much forshells. He had found that pearl in a shell; the pearl thatshe had thought-ok, what a fool she had been!-wasmeant for her. That old seed-pearl set of her mothers',pin and ear-rings, would make a dandy pendant. Shebelieved she'd ask her mother for it. Except on this shell-digging business, how entirely Howard and she agreedabout everything  Few men and girls were so in accord,mentally. Imagine Howard trying to talk to any ofthe girls of her set-even to Laura-as he talked to her!  iWhy, Laura would be dumb when he got on the thingsthat were worth-while. He had once said that he wouldrather talk to her than any girl he knew; no-it was to"any man" he knew. For a moment the old pride rose-then fell. She almost wished he had said to "anygirl." Well; no girl-or man, either-could have donebetter than she did on that poster scheme. Howardwould say so when she would tell him about it, and she wasgoing to tell him; she was going to talk to him just asshe had always talked-about everything on earth! Shemust; or else he would think that she was ... hard hit;and that she simply couldn't bear! The poster schemereminded her of some league work she had neglected inthese five days of tingling emptiness, and she frowned."Gracious! I must attend to that," she said. She didnot know it, but her bruised mind was fleeing for shelterinto trivialities. Suddenly she took her purse out of 234
<pb n="235"/>
THE RISING TIDEher pocket, thrust a thumb and figer into the place where she kept her visiting-cards, and took out a burntmatch. She looked at it for a moment with a grunt ofbitter laughter; then, finding a little stick, dug a holein the path, laid the match in, covered it, and steppedon it, hard."That is the end," she said.After a while she realized that she was cold, and wentback into the house and kindled a fie. She sat down ona hassock, and stretched out her hands to the blaze.The sunsine came through the uncurtained window andlaid a finger on the soot on the chimney back; its faintiridescece caught her eye. Was it only Monday nightthat she and Howard had sat here by the fire, and hehad kicked the logs together on the andirons, and thesparks had caught in the soot and spread and spread inmarching rosettes? Why, it seemed yearsl It was thenthat she had-asked him.She wasn't ashamed of it She had proposed and beenrefused. "He thought it was stunning in me to do it;he said sol He feels as I do about the equality of men andwomen in this kind of thing, as well as everything else.Of course, he may have said so just to-to make it easierfor me? If I thought tai-"The blood rushed into her face. She would not thinkthatl It would be unendurable to think he had not beensincere. "He felt it was perfectly all right for me to bethe one to speak. And it wasl"Of course it was. There was nothing for her to beashamed of. She herself had once refused an offer of235
<pb n="236"/>
THE RISING TIDEmarriage, and certainly the rejected suitor had not seemedto suffer any pangs of shamel He had displayed a rather mean anger: "He wanted my money, and he was hoppingmad when he couldn't get it. I didn't want to get any- thing. I only wanted to give! So why don't I brace up?I had a right to 'give."'She was quite certain that she had a right, so why wasshe so miserable? So-ashamed.In spite of herself she said the word. She had shiedaway from it, and refused to utter it, a dozen times; butat last, here, alone, she had to tell herself the truth.She was ashamed.It is only when Truth speaks to us, as in the cool ofthe day the Voice of God spoke in the Garden, that thehuman creature knows he is ashamed. Not to feel Shameis to be deaf to that Voice. Frederica was not deaf; butthe Voice was very faint, very wandering and indirect.She could hardly hear it. It spoke first in her vague wishthat Howard had said he would rather talk to her thanany "girl" he knew; and then it spoke in the wonderwhether a man does like to be "asked.""If he doesn't, it's just idiotic tradition. It belongs tothe days of slavery!"But how did the tradition grow up that a womanmustn't ask a man to marry her? She tried to remembersomething Arthur Weston once said about men being"born hunters." Her lip drooped, angrily; "Rot!" shesaid; "when it comes to love, a woman has as much atstake as a man. No, she has more at stake! She has thechild.  Queer," she thought, "the woman is always the 236
<pb n="237"/>
THE RISING TIDEone who sticks to the child." She wondered if that wasbecause women pay such a price for children? It occurredto her, with a sense of having made a discovery, that allthrough nature, the mother cares for her offspring just inproportion to what it costs her to bring it into the world.She rolled Zip over on his back and pulled his ears, hermind dwelling, with the ancient resentment of her sex,upon the unfairness of nature-for the father pays nopricel "I wonder if that explains desertion? I wonderif men desert girls, after they've got them into trouble,simply because the child costs them nothing? But howthe girls stick to the babies, poor things  They hardlyever go off on their own bat. And yet" (thus the Voicewas speaking!), "the child needs a father to take care ofit, as much as a mother, so the man and the woman oughtto keep together.... But he's the one who goes off! Itought to be tit for tat Women ought to do the deserting,"she said, passionately; but a moment later came the cyni-cal admission: "Men wouldn't mind being 'deserted.'They'd probably like it. They ought to be made to beconstant. When we get the vote, we'll make laws to stoptheir 'deserting'!"Then she wavered; as far as laws go, there were enoughnow. The fact was, men were naturally faithless! "Ihate men," she said, between her set teeth. Arthur Wes-ton was right, they were "hunters." They are constant-in pursuit. "We ought to keep them on the hot-foot,then they'd be more keen to stay with us!" In a flashcame the rest of Weston's comment: "They won't bagthe game, if it perches on their fists." Her face reddened237
<pb n="238"/>
THE RISING TIDE"violently. She had come, head on, against a biologicalfact, namely, that reluctance in the woman makes forpermanence in the man.Reluctance! ..                .Her mother's tiresome talk about "cheapness" was sud-denly intelligible. How foolish the word had sounded! Yet,perhaps, under its foolishness lay a primitive fact: that thewelfare of the child demands a permanent relation betweenthe father and the mother. But in proportion as she is"cheap," he is temporary, and the relationship is jeopar-dized!She did not put it into words, but she realized, amazed,that woman, whether she knows it or not, acts upon thisold race knowledge. For the child's sake, she tries, byevery sort of lure, to hold man to permanence which shewill herself acquire by the fierce welding of agony. Thesurest "lure" is based upon the fact that man pursues thatwhich flees; but all the lures spring from Nature's purposeto safeguard the child by giving it the care of two insteadof one. For the "child" is the most important thing inthe world!Fred was thinking hard. Sometimes she put a stick onthe fire, and once she got up and paced about the room.It came over her, with a rush of surprise, that all the talkof what girls must and mustn't do, "all the drivel about'propriety'!" was based on this same Race instinct.She saw that for a girl to love a man, unasked, isneither ignoble nor immodest. It is divine to love-al-ways! Such love is a jewel, worn unseen above a girl'sheart; to offer it, is to take it out of its white shelter and238

THE RISING TIDEfling it into hands that, not having sought it, will soon letit drop between indifferent fingers. She saw how thisRace instinct has gradually-and oh, so painfully, oh, sofoolishly, with failure, and agony, and tragic absurditiesof convention, taught women the value of the reticenceof modesty.Taught them that they must not be "cheap"!It came to her that it was the business of women likeherself-the "new" women, who are going to set Womanfree!-it was their business to discard the absurdities, butkeep the beauties and dignities; for beiaty and dignityare "lures," too. "They aract. I suppose that is whatGrandmother means by 'cham,"' she reflected; "she saidI hadn't any." Her face suddenly scorched; to discovera temperamental deficiency made her wince; it was likediscovering a physical blemish. She undersood, now,what Arthur Weston meant when he "rowed" about herbeing in the apartment alone with Howard. She hadbeen "cheap." She had "perched on his fist." He hadhad no inclination to bag the game....It was all very loose and incoherent thinking; shecaught at one fact, only to find it contradicted by anotherfact. But in all her mental confusion one anguished wishstood fast:"Oh, if I only hadn't asked himr!In her futile shame, her head fell on her knees andshe caught her breath in a sort of sob-then sat upright,listening intently: amotorl Howardf In spite of reason,a leap of hope made her gasp.She rose quickly, and stood, her hand over her lips-239

Then she saw the car, and her heart seemedto drop in her breast; it was only Arthur Weston.He came in, saying, cheerfully, he had heard she waspacking, and had come out to bring her back to town."We can load the tonneau with anything you want totake home," he said; "I suppose you haven't any tea fora wayfarer?" He was very matter-of-fact; he saw thetremor and heard the catch in the breath.There was some tea, she said-but no cream; she wouldboil some water.He sat down, and she waited on him, getting herself inhand, even to the extent of some pitiful little imperti-nences. Then, by and by, they carried her things out tothe auto. "My landlord is going to send for the piano," she said; "all I have to do is to close the shutters."He went about with her, helping her, teasing her, andscolding her because she was tired. When everything wasdone, and they were just leaving the house, she pausedabruptly, and her hands went up to her eyes."Poor Flora!"He was standing beside her, gentle and pitying, long-ing to draw those shaking hands down from her hiddenface: "You were always good to her," he said."No!" she said, in a smothered voice; "no." Then,suddenly, she turned toward him and sank against hisshoulder. He felt the sob that shook her from head tofoot. Instinctively, his arms went about her, and he heldher close to him; he was silent, but he trembled andthose passionate and sensitive eyebrows twitched withpain.

A fool.""We all have to be fools, Fred, before we can be wise."She had drawn away from him, with a broken laugh."You don't know anything about it! You don't knowwhat it's like to be a fool!""Don't I? I was a very big fool myself, once. ButI'm so wise now that I'm glad of all the blows my follygave me the. I'll tell you about it, one of these days."He told her as they drove back to town. "And," heended, "I can see that the best thing that ever happenedto me was to have Kate jilt me."

CHAPTER XXIIAFTER Fred had gone out into the wilderness, andlearned her lesson; after that long day in the cottage,when her mind had emptied itself of some of its own cer-tainties, so that deep, primitive knowledges could flowinto it, she took up life again in her own way. She wentto her office, she exercised Zip, she accepted every invi-tation that came to her; but she got thin. "Scrawny,"her grandmother called it. Also, she expended a good dealof money on a bridesmaid's dress-for something had hap-penedl Happened, curiously enough, on the very after-noon when she was studying that hard page of Nature'sbook, all alone, in the empty cottage by the lake. ...The very next morning Laura had burst into i5 Pay-ton Street. "Swear not to tell," she said; and whenFred had swar, the secret-glowing, wonderfull was toldin two words:"I'm engaged!"Then came an ecstatic recital, ending with "I've de-cided on daffodil yellow for your dresses. Rather farahead-for it isn't to be until the middle of December.But I think it's just as well to plan, don't you?""Of course it is," Fred agreed. ("Oh, if I only hadn'tasked him!")242

THE RISING TIDE"Billy-boy will juggle out enough money for the finestsatin going, for his only daughter; but you girls can haveperfectly sweet flowered voile, over yellow charmeuse.I've a corking idea far your hats." Then she lookedat Fred closely. "You're not a bit surprised; I believeyou knew what was going to happenI"Fred laughed noncommittally. Laura herself had beenso far from knowing what was going to happen, thatHoward Maitland had to fairly pound it into her that hewas in love with her! He had not meant to tell her sosoon  It wouldn't be decent, he thought, rememberingthat night in the cottage. He hadn't meant to speak forat least a month. He was going to mark time, and forgetthat there had ever been a minute when Fred Payton hadimagined she cared about him-"for, of course, that wasall it amounted to," he told himslf; "imagination!"There was more modesty than truth in his phrase, yet hisconviction was sincere enough-"A girl like Fred couldn'treally care for me. I'm not up to her !"It was characteristic of his simple soul, that he toldLaura the same thing, when he blundered into the pro-posal that he had meant to hold back for a month. It .was wrung from him by his despair at her misunder-standing his feeling about Fred. He was in full swingof haranguing her upon the wonderfulness of her cousin--"Of course; she's perfectly stunning," Laura had in-terrupted; "I know she's simply great. But why onearth you two don't announce your engagement I can'timagine! You make me a little tired," she said, good-naturedly, but rather obviously bored.243
<pb n="244"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Announce our whfa?""Engagement. Do you suppose we are all blind?"Howard Maitland actually whitened a little under hisPhilippine tan. "You are mistaken, Laura," he said,quietly. "If I have given you the impression that Fredhad the slightest feeling for me, I ought to be kicked."Laura turned an indignant face toward him: "Do youmean to tell me that Fred has only been flirting with you?I don't believe it! She's not that kind."They were in the Childses' parlor in the yellow dusk ofthe autumn afternoon. Laura had given her caller twocups of tea with four lumps of sugar in each cup, andHoward, between innumerable little cakes, had been tell-ing her again of Frederica's behavior that terrible nightat the camp. It was at least the third time that she hadheard the grim details, and each time she had shiveredand wished he would stop. To silence him, she hadcharged upon him for not announcing his engagement; itseemed flippant, but it would change the subject. Hisdismay made her forget Flora, in real bewilderment. Notengaged to Fredl Had Fred played with him?"If Fred's been just flirting, she ought to be ashamed,"'Laura said, hotly; "she knew you were perfectly goneon her.""Laura, you didn't suppose such a thing?""That you were gone on Fred? Of course I didl Iknew you were crazy about her, a year ago; and so didshe. Howard, I'm awfully sorry.""Sorry-for what?""For you."244
<pb n="245"/>
THE RISING TIDEHoward Maitland got on his feet, and walked the'length of the room, and back; he said something underhis breath. Then he drew up a chair beside her and tookher hand."I never thought of such a thing.""What !""You are the only girl I ever cared two cents for."She put her hand against her young breast, in astound-ed question: "I?""I should think you'd have seen it. You, and-andeverybody.""But Howard, it can't be-ne?" she protested, faintly."It's been you, always. When you accuse me of beingin -love with-with anybody else, and say everybodythought so, you just bowl me overt" His shocked aston-ishment left no doubt of his sincerity."But Freddy," Laura began-He broke in sharply: "Fred knows how tremendouslyI admire her. I've always said so, to you and to her, too.And I believe she likes me as much as she likes any of usfellows-but of course I'm not up to her, and she neverflirted with me in her life! She's not the kind of girlwho wants to collect scalps," he said, almost with anger."I never thought of-caring for her. Why, I-I couldn'tcare for Fredl""But you were always talking about her, and-""Of course I talked about her! Doesn't everybodytalk about her? But as for being in love with her-Laura,I tell you, you are the only girl in existence, so far as I'mconcerned. I suppose you don't care anything about me."245
<pb n="246"/>
THE RISING TIDELaura put her hands over her face, and laughed; thenstretched them out to him, and the tears brimmed over... ."Oh, Howard, you are such a goose!"There was a speechless moment; then he put his armsaround her, kissed the fluffy hair that brushed his lips,and said, "Oh, my little darling! my little love .. "After that they had to talk it all over, and there wereendless explanations. "You do believe I never thought of-anybody else?"he asked, again and again. And she said yes, she be-lieved it, but she didn't understand it. "Why, I was so sure you were in love with her, I usedto give you chances to be together. Do you rememberthat afternoon you went to say good-by to her, before youwent to the Philippines? I stayed up-stairs to give you achance to ask her.""Laural""I did.""How could you be so absurd?" "Everybody thought so."That silenced him. He was horribly ashamed. It washis fault, then, that night in the cottage? "Everybodythought so." So, naturally, Fred thought so-and shewas the noblest and most generous woman in the world!"It's my fault somehow, that she spoke," he told himself,in a passion of humiliationThat night he wrote to her. The engagement was notto "come out" for two or three weeks;-" only the familymust know," Laura said; but Howard had protested:"Fred-let's tell Fred?"246w 
<pb n="247"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Well," Laura consented, reluctantly,-"I' l go andsee her to-morrow morning and make her swear notto tell.""She can keep a secret," he said. He did not add thatFred should learn the secret before to-morrow morning."I'm the one to break it to her," he thought. Then men-tally kicked himself for saying "break it."When he sat down at his desk that night to write toher, his face was rigid at what was before him; it wasnearly dawn before the task was finished; letters-longletters, short letters, letters expressing his admiration forher, letters ignoring it, letters about Laura, about thePhilippines, about Flora-were written out, torn up,flung into the waste-basket. Then came the brief, blunttruth-telling: Laura had accepted him, and he knewthat she, his old pal, would wish them happiness. Ofcourse there was a postscript: she would be their verybest friend, because they both thought she was the finestwoman they knew.When the letter was addressed and sealed, he went outinto the four-o'clock-in-the-morning stillness, and walkedover to Payton Street to slip it into the letter-box of thesleeping house. He would not trust it to the mail; hewould run no risk of Laura's arriving before the first de-livery. Fred mustn't be caught off guard! Then hewalked home-glanced at a little suspiciously by an officeron his somnolent beat-about as uncomfortable a youngman as ever realized his own happiness in contrast tosome one else's unhappiness-for, in spite of his modestdisclaimer, he knew that Fred was unhappy: "How would247
<pb n="248"/>
THE RISING TIDEI feel if Laura had refused me? And, of course, Fred isharder hit than a man would be."But, no matter how hard hit she was, thanks to thatletter, the next morning, when Laura swore her to se-crecy, and said that the bridesmaids' hats would bedreamsl Fred's upper lip was smilingly stiff.It was just after that that Mrs. Holmes began to saythat her granddaughter was "scrawny."

CHAPTER XXIIIFTEN, in those weeks before Laura's wedding, Mrs.Payton, working out a puzzle, or playing Canfieldon the big rosewood table in the sitting-room, would stopand stare straight before her, with unseeing eyes....Like a needle working its way through nerveless fleshtoward some vital spot, a new emotion, anger, was pen-etrating the routine of her meaningless days.Laura had cut Freddy oudLove for Morty, the dam love, which is the habit ofthe body and has nothing to do with the intellect, waspushed aside by the new idea: Freddy was sufferingbecause Laura had stolen her lover."It was despicable in herI" Mrs. Payton said to her-self-and the needle-point of anger came a little nearerto that sleeping nerve of maternity, which, when it wasreached, would, in a pang of exquisite pain, make her loveFred as she had never loved anything in her life.Mrs. Payton put a black nine on a red eight; saw hermistake, frowned, and put out a mechanical hand to cor-rect it. "I wonder if she would drink a glass of maltedmilk at night, if I fixed it for her?" she thought; and un-covered an ace. "Laura hasn't half her brains!" she said,and put the card in the ace row; "how could Mr. Maitland17                 249

THE RISING TIDE                              |see anything to her-except looks? She is pretty. ButFreddy is worth a dozen of her, and he was head over earsin love with her! Yes; Laura simply took him from her!I shall never feel the same to Laura again;-and I supposeBessie and William expect me to give her a handsomewedding-present."  She wondered, with vague malice, whether there wasn't something in the house-the oldwonder of the reluctant giver of gifts!-that she could send Laura? Some family silver; the epergne, for in-stance, three silver squirrels holding a platter on theirheads. The question of the wedding-present was so irritatingto her, that in the afternoon, when Freddy came in, ratherlistlessly (this was in November-a month before thewedding), Mrs. Payton referred the matter to her-shift-ing her angry pain to Freddy's galled young shoulders.There was no wincing."What shall we give Laura?""Something bully! I was talking to her about it to-day, and asked her what she wanted. I think a rug isthe thing.""I wonder if some of the Payton silver-" Mrs. Paytonbegan-but Fred threw up horrified hands. "No! No second-hand goodsl And it's got to besomething first rate, too; (if it takes my last dollar!)" she added, under her breath.The rug did not take quite the last dollar, but it tookmore than she could afford, and Laura was perfectly de-lighted with it. Howard, standing on it, his hands in hispockets, dug an appreciative heel into its silky nap, and 
<pb n="251"/>
THE RISING TIDEmade his usual comment: "It's bullyl Fred's taste isgreat!"Sometimes, looking back on the night that Flora died,Howard wondered if it all (except the poor soul's suicide)was not a dream? For Fred was so "bully"! ... Enter-'ing into all Laura ecstasies and anxieties; crazy to knowwho would make the wedding-dress; perfectly wild overHoward's present to his bride; frantic because it was tooearly to get jonquils for the rope down each side of theaisle.... That astounding moment in the bungalowmust have been, Howard told himself, a dream! Twodreams-his and Fred's, for she evidently cared no morefor him than for old Weston.So the days passed (Howard thought they never wouldpass!) and the Day drew near. When it came, FredericaPayton's head was as high as any of the other youngheads. There were eight of them, in most marvelous andexpensive yellow hats, to follow the shimmering Lauraup the aisle. At the reception afterward, Frederica, in hervivid joyousness almost-so her Uncle William said-"took the shine off the bridel Remember Shakespeare(as you'd say)-"Bring in our daughterClothed like a bride . . See, where she comes,Appareled like the spring,"-Mr. Childs quoted, puffing happily--"but that frockyou've got on is spring-like, too-all yellow and white,like buttercups and daisies."251
<pb n="252"/>
THE RISING TIDE"I'm rather stuck on it, myself," Fred said, compla-cently; she was standing beside Arthur Weston, eatingice-cream with appetite."Well," her uncle said, chuckling, "I may tell you inconfidence- Hey, Howard!" he interrupted himself,clutching at the passing bridegroom, "I was just tellingFreddy that I was very much astonished when I learnedthat you were to be my son-in-law. I thought you weremaking up to her!""To mef" said Fred, incredulously; "he never knewI existed when Laura was around!""I'm just looking for Laura now," Howard said, with agasp; "she's deserted me!" he complained, laughing-and escaped."Oh," Mr. Childs said, clapping his niece on theshoulder so heartily that her ice-cream spilled over, "ofcourse I know, now, that it's always been Laural""Yes," Fred agreed, gaily, "he's been dead set forLolly for the last two years."So she got through with the Day.... When shereached home, and up in her own room took off the yellowhat, she took off that gallant smile, too; she had worn ituntil the muscles about her lips were stiff. She was pro-foundly fatigued; too fatigued to feel anything but reliefthat the wedding was over. Even the old ache of wishingshe "hadn't told him" was numbed. It was part of thegenerosity of her honest, sore young heart, that she felta faint satisfaction in the fact that, anyhow, he was happy;as for Laura-"how mean I am to-dislike herl Itwasn't her fault, and she's just the same old Lolly. I252
<pb n="253"/>
THE RISING TIDEwon't dislike her! I'll love her, just as I've always lovedher." When she went down to dinner that night she putthe smile on again, and was very airy and smart in hercomments to Mrs. Payton upon the Childs family, andthe company in general."Laura was perfectly sweetl But Aunt Bessie is toofat to wear such" tight clothes. Why do the fat fiftiesalways wear tight clothes? . . . Grandmother wasn'tshy on powder, was she? . . Billy-boy would talk aboutBacon at his own funeral . . . How many kinds of afool do you suppose that old hag, Maria Spencer, is? . . .I-I guess I'll go to bed. I was an idiot to eat icecream;it always makes my head ache."Perhaps her head ached too badly for sleep. At anyrate, hours later, when zS Payton Street had sunk intomidnight darkness, she heard a board creak under a care-ful step in the hall, and sat up in bed, saying, sharply,"Who's that?" "It's I, dear. Don't be frightened."  Mrs. Paytoncame feeling her way across the room to Fred's bedside."Is anything the matter? Is Mortimore-""No, no; nothingl Only, Freddy, my darling, I-I just want to tell you something." She sat down on theedge of the bed, and Frederica heard her draw in herbreath in a sob."Mother! Are you ill?""No-no. But Freddy, I-I didn't mean it when Isaid that about Mortimore.""Said what?" Fred said, frowning with anxiety; "here,let me light the gasl"53
<pb n="254"/>
THE RISING TIDE"No, don't!" Mrs. Payton put a restraining hand on her daughter's shoulder; "about-about loving him best.I don't, dear; truly I don't.""But, Motherl"-Fred put her arms about the soft,loose figure that tumbled into sobs against her-"I didn't know you said it, and if you did, I don't mind it in the .least!" She felt her mother's tears on her cheek, andgathered her up against her breast; "Why, Mother!   'It's all right-really it is. It's all right to love him best-""But I don't-I don'tl I love you best.""Why," Fred soothed her, "I didn't even rememberyou'd said it. You only told me I was like Father-andthat did me good.""No! I never said you were! And it isn't so. You'renot--not a bit! My little Freddy!"Frederica smiled grimly in the darkness, and she let thestatement pass; for suddenly something surged up in herbreast; something she had never felt in her life; some-thing that was actual pain; she had no name for it, butit made the tears sting in her eyes. "There, dear, there!"she comforted her cowering mother;  . .  . I understand,"she said, brokenly; "I understand!"It is a wonderful moment, this moment of "under-standing." It made Fred draw the foolish gray head downon her young breast, and caress and comfort it, as yearsago her own little head had been caressed and kissed.They were both "mothers" at that moment.So Laura's wedding-day was lived through. And byand by the weeks that followed were lived through. And254
<pb n="255"/>
THE RISING TIDEthen the months pushed in between Fred and that nightat the camp. She never spoke of Howard and Laura."I wonder if she's got over it," Mrs. Payton speculated,wistfully. She was glad, for her part, that the bride andbridegroom had gone abroad, and she did not have to seethem-"especially Laural" she used to say to herself, bit-terly. If Fred was bitter, she didn't show it; she wasabsorbed in league work, and a really growing real-estatebusiness; it was all she could dco to find time to listen whenher mother talked, and talked, and talked-or people, orpuzzles, or parlor-maids! But how could she fail to listen-no matter how dull and foolish the talk was-remember-ing that midnight of pity?"Freddy is getting very companionable," Mrs. Paytontold Arthur Weston. He had come upon Fred bendingover a puzzle spread out on the bigtable in the sitting-room, and trying to fit one wriggly piece of blue after an-other into a maliciously large expanse of unchartedsky; she had been obviously relieved at the chance to shiftthe entertainment of Mrs. Payton to his shoulders."I've got to go to a league meeting," she excused her-self. When she had gone and he was standing with hisback to the fire, sipping his tea and talking pleasantly ofthe weather, or the barber's children, or poor Flora's tend-ency to put too much starch in the table linen (raisinghis voice, in a matter-of-fact way, when there was a noisebehind the door of the other room), he agreed warmly withMrs. Payton's tribute to her daughter: "Freddy is gettingcompanionable.""Indeed she isl" he said, and added that she was remark-255
<pb n="256"/>
THE RISING TIDE ably clever about puzzleswhich pleased Mrs. Paytonvery much. This new sense of sympathy which held Freddown to picture puzzles, made her try to avoid topics onwhich she knew she and her mother could not agree. Asthe winter went on, the especial topic to be avoided was astrike among the rubber workers. Fred was passionately for the strikers, who were all girls. She went constantlyto Hazelton, where the factory was, to give what help shecould to the union women, and to admonish them thatthe way to cure industrial conditions, which all fair-minded people admitted were frightful, was by the ballot."Get the man's ballot, and you'll get the man's wages!"was her slogan-and she was quite fierce with her man ofbusiness when he pointed out the economic fallacy ofher words."The kingdom of God cometh not by the ballot," headmonished her. "I feel as if I were going to Sunday-schooll" "A little Sunday-school wouldn't hurt you. It neverseems to strike you," he ruminated, "that if 'laws,' whichyou are so anxious to have a hand in making, could settle supply and demand, the men, poor creatures, would havefeathered their own nests a little better."To which Miss Payton replied, concisely, "Rot!"-and continued to tell the strikers that suffrage was a cure-all.It was in March that one of the morning papers an-nounced, with snobbish detail, that Miss Freddy Payton,a "young society girl," had "patrolled" to keep off scabs.That evening, at dinner, Mrs. Payton, mortified to death256
<pb n="257"/>
THE RISING.TIDEat the notoriety, and encouraged by Arthur Weston'spresence at the table, ventured into controversy:"When I was a young lady-" she began, and instantlyFrederica's lance was in restl She did not mean to becruel-but she couldn't help being smart. Her mother'sinjured sense of propriety was batted back to her across thedinner-table, like a shuttlecock from a resounding battle-dore."You may say what you like," Mrs. Payton said, obsti-nately, "but I don't believe it would make a bit of dif-ference to give those perfectly uneducated Italian girls avote. It hasn't," she ended, with one of those flashes ofshrewdness so characteristic of dull women, "made anydifference in the men's wages. And, anyhow, I don'tunderstand why you like to mix vourself up with all sortsof persons.""The Founder of your religion mixed Himself with allsorts of persons," Frederica said, wickedly; "but, ofcourse, He would not be in societrto-day.""That is a very irreverent thing to say," Mrs. Paytonsaid, stiffly.("Now, why," Mr. Weston pondered, "why doesn't theatrocious taste of that sort of talk cure me? Because," heanswered himself, "it 'amuses' me! Oh, Cousin Eliza,you are a wise old woman!")As for Frederica, she was not conscious that her lackof taste was amusing; but she knew it was unkind, andfelt the instant stab of remorse. ("I'm just like Fatherl"she groaned to herself); then with resolution she began totalk about puzzles; she said she thought the reason her257
<pb n="258"/>
THE RISING TIDEmother couldn't work out that six-hundred-piece one wasbecause the people who made it had omitted some pieces,and it never could be got out."Try it a few days longer," Fred said, "and then, if youwant me to, I'll write to the people who manufactured itand ask them about it. Arthur Weston! I am going tostand by those girls in Hazelton until they win out!""When they do, their work will stop," he prophesied,mildly. "The factory hasn't paid a dividend for threeyears, and if wages go up, it will shut up. I happen toknow how they stand.""Laura's back," Fred said, abruptly; "they got homeyesterday. I asked her if she'd walk in the parade, andshe said, 'Howard wouldn't like itl' That sort of thingmakes me tired."
<pb n="259"/>
CHAPTER XXIVTHE invitation to walk in the parade had not beengiven easily. Fred had forced herself to ask Laura,for very shame at the ache of resentment which neitherreason, nor her old habit of affection for her cousin,could conquer. Laura's refusal gave her a sort of angrysatisfaction. "Of course! What could you expect? She'sa sweet little thing, but she has no mind to speak of. PoorHowardl She must bore him to death." As for Howard'snot liking parades,-well, that was queer. He never hadquite realized their value; probably because he hadn'treally thought about them. She would talk it over withhim sometime, and make him unerstand. She was notin the least annoyed with Howard, but it was all she coulddo to hide her contempt for Laura; "Why do women grovelso before men? It makes me perfectly sick!" Even whenLaura, with the old, puppy-like devotion, offered, onemorning, to go with her to Hazelton where Fred was toaddress the strikers, it was not easy to be cordial."I'll tag around after you, and clap," Laura said."Howard willing?" Fred said, sarcastically.Laura laughed: "I haven't asked him. He's in Cin-cinnati. Won't be home until this afternoon.""I suppose you wouldn't go if he wasn't?"259
<pb n="260"/>
THE RISING TIDE"I suppose I wouldn't," Laura said, simply.Fred's lip drooped. But she only said, good-naturedly,"Come along!" They went to Hazelton by trolley, Fredhaving vetoed Laura's limousine: "It's too much 'LadyBountiful.' Your gasolene for a week would pay a girl'sboard for a month."In the long ride, spinning and jouncing through thecountryside until they reached the squalid outskirts ofthe little town, Frederica listened to Laura's talk of Eu-rope-and Howard. Of Paris frocks-and Howard. Ofthe voyage home-and Howard."I won't be horrid, I won't I love her just exactly thesame-" Fred was saying to herself, staring out of thewindow at the flying landscape, at the woods where the leafless trees were showing the haze of swelling buds, atthe snow, melting in the frozen furrows. "Yes ....""No ...." "Really?" she would say, when sometimesLaura's chatter paused. ("Oh, how bored Howard mustbe by this sort of thing!" she thought. She couldn't helpremembering how differently she had talked to Howard-the big things, the real thingsl "Poor old Howard!")Once there was quite a long pause, and Fred stoppedwatching the racing landscape and looked at Laura. Itwas then that Laura softly told her a piece of news:  ,"Of course, Howard's awfully pleased. He wants agirl, but I want a boy."Frederica was silent for a moment: then, very gentle and tender, "I'm awfully glad," she said, and squeezedLaura's hand.Then the chatter began again, and Fred looked out of 26o
<pb n="261"/>
THE RISING TIDEthe window at the snow melting on slopes that faced thesun.The hall in Hazelton where the strikers were awaitingFrederica was terribly hot and stuffy, and packed withwomen crowding so closely about the melon-shaped ironstove that the air was stifling with the smell of scorchingclothes. It occurred to Laura, opening a window surrep-titiously, that the girls were here as much for the sake ofthe glowing stove as for the chance to hear Fred. Shewatched her cousin with shrinking admiration. What shesaid did not particularly interest her, but Frederica's in-timacy with the girls made her wonder. "She touchesthem!" Laura thought, with a quiver of disgust.When Fred had made her speech-which Laura vocif-erously applauded-they all trooped out into the street,but paused while Frederica (Laura skulking behind her)stood in the doorway for a further harangue. Unfortui-nately-because the knot of listening girls obstructed thesidewalk-a police officer, shoving them  out of theway, happened to show some rudeness to a little Italian,who, in return, jabbering shrilly, struck at the man'spatient and restraining arm, which caused him to gatherher two delicate wrists in one big, vise-like hand, and holdher, a little, kicking, struggling creature, who made aboutas much impression on his large blue bulk as a sparrowmight make upon a locomotive."There, now, keep quiet, sissy," he said, wearily.But Catalina kicked harder than ever, and the officer-shook her, gently. It was at that moment that Fred'seye fell upon him.261
<pb n="262"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Ill stop that!" she said, between shut teeth."Oh, Fred, don't do anything," Laura entreated,-butFred was at the man's side.Her anger disconcerted him. "It's against the law toobstruct the sidewalk," he explained."I had no hand in making the law, and therefore Ishall not obey itl"                                 ;"Better can that talk, and keep it for the Court," said :the man, beginning to get red in the face. To which Fred-erica retorted by telling him her opinion of men in generaland policemen in particular.A man can stand kicks from little feet, but "lip"--aftera certain point of forbearance has been reached, is anothermatter. Fred punctuated her remonstrances by puttingan abrupt hand on his arm, and instantly there was anunseemly scuffle, in which Laura, running out from theshelter of the doorway, tried to draw Fred away. Theresult was that before they really knew what had hap-pened, the little Italian, Miss Frederica Payton, and Mrs.Howard Maitland found themselves in a patrol-wagonrumbling and jouncing along over the icy Belgian blocks,a taciturn man in a blue coat sitting in the doorway ofthe van to prevent any possible leap to liberty.The whole thing was so sudden that the cousins wereperfectly bewildered. Even as they were being hustledinto the wagon, a crowd had gathered, springing up, ap-parently, out of the ground. There had been a sea of faces-good natured, amused, unoncerned faces; a medley ofvoices, jeering and hooting, or raucously sympathetic; avision of the striking girls-for whose cause they were262

THE RISING TIDEthere l-forsaking them, melting away, fleeing aroundcorers and up sidestreets; then, the jolting alongthrough the noon emptiness of the streets, toward thestation-house.Frederica, getting her breath, after the suddenness of itall, grew very much excited. She scented the fray-thecontest between man-made laws and unconsulted womanlIt occurred to her-though Laura said, in despairingtones, "Oh, Fred, please don't"-to fling some suffrageliterature into the street over the head of the officer; shedid it until he told her to "set still, you!" At whichCatalina, 'heaing her defender reproved, kicked him,causing him to turn around and grab her ankle; he heldit in one great paw, and whistled, absently.Fred was furious. "Don't touch that girl's anlrtde  shesaid."Shut up," he replied, calmly; and, oblivious of bothof them, still holding Catalina's little kicking feet, he be-gan to talk over his shoulder to the driver of the van aboutthe price of cucumber. "Here, you!" he interruptedhimself-"stop biting, sissy!  Gee! this chippy hasteeth-" and he poked Catalina, playfully, with his club.Frederica whitened with rage, but Catalina lapsed sud-denly into such abject fright that when they reached theirdestination she had to be lifted out of the wagon, andpushed-not too gently-up the steps into the station-house. Laura, who got out next, was shaking so that theofficer put a friendly han 4under her elbow to assist her.Frederica followed the other two, her head high withanger and interest.263

THE RISING TIDE                          iIn the station-house, the receiving-room, with its onedirt-incrusted window, was dark, even at one o'clock-per- .haps because, shoulder-high on the long-unwashed paint,was a dado of grime left by innumerable cringing backs.There was one back against it now; a drunken man, withwabbling head and glassy, half-shut eyes, was whining and 'sobbing, and trying to keep on his legs. When the ser-geant asked his name, he answered by a hiccough whichthe officer, as indifferent and efficient as a cog in someslowly revolving and crushing wheel, translated into"Thomas Coney." "Come, stop crying; be a perfect gentleman, Tommy, be a perfect gentleman!" he said,yawning. And, curiously enough, Tommy straightenedup and swallowed his sobs."Look at himl" Fred whispered to Laura; "he's get-ting hold of himselfl I suppose that's his idea of a perfectgentleman."Laura, rigid with misery, made no answer.  WhenThomas had been disposed of-watched by Frederica's in-tent eyes-she and Laura, whose knees were plainly shak-ing, and Catalina, who was sobbing and calling upon God,lined up in front of the sergeant's desk. Frederica an-swered the usual questions with brief directness; her atti-tude toward the big, bored officer was distinctly friendlyand confidential; as he closed the blotter, she began to tellhim that she had been urging the girls to demand the bal-Before she could finish the word, she found herself, to herangry amazement, being moved along toward the corridor."But-stop! I have not finished. And I want to tel- ephone, and-"264

THE RISING TIDE"What number?"Both girls spoke at aone, redeica giving Mr. Weston'snumber, and Laura, stamering with apprehension thatHoward might not go directly home from the train,naming her own house. "Ask Mr. Weston to hunt How-ard up," she implored her cousin. The telephoning wasfruitless, as neither gentleman could be found."You can try 'em again over at the House of Deten-tion,"themansaid, notunkindly. "Moveonl Moveon!"They moved on, in spite of themselves, assisted by theimpersonal pressure of an officer's hand on Fred's shoulder-Laura shivering all over, Fred's face red with displeasureat the affront of not being listened to, Catalina perfectlyhappy and inclined to giggle."You'll make Mr. Weston find Howard?" Laura said,in a frantic whisper, as they walked across the courtyardto the little jail back of the station-house. "Oh, I wasgoing to meet him,---and I am herel"Fred shrugged her shoulders: "Why did you come, ifyou mind it so? (Married women are awfully poor sports,"she thought.)"Do you think I'd funk and leave you?" Laura re-torted; and Fred's face softened."Howard will be so upset-" Laura said, quivering."Nonsense! He'll see the fun of it," Fred assured her.In matters of this kind, she understood Howard betterthan little Lolly ever could....Her face was glowing with excitement! This meantsomething to the Cause! An old phrase ran through hermind, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed,"-"I tellIs8                  65

THE RISING TIDEyou what, Laura," she said, under her breath, "this ridic-ulous business is the seed of a big thing; it has given mea great idea: let women refuse to obey the laws, until theyare allowed to make them""This way," said the officer, and herded them into thereceiving-room of the House of Detention. The next fewminutes stung even Fred's aplomb-they were searchedlThe indignity of hands passing down her figure-handsnot rough, not unkind, not insulting, merely mechanical,-made her unreasonably, but quite furiously, angry.Laura was a little shocked, but her dignity was simple and unshaken. Catalina, her dirty, streaky face puffedwith crying, laughed loudly with amusement."This is abominable!" Fred said, her voice shaking.The matron, making notes on a pad, paid no attention tothe protest. It was all in the day's work-human wreck-age washed up out of the gutter, rose in this bleak, stone-lined room every day; rose, flooded into the surroundingcells, where it vociferated, wept, pleaded, stood rigid withfury and shame, or else collapsed into sodden slumber.Then, by and by, it ebbed away. And the next day, andthe next, the same drift and ruin of humanity flooded inand drifted out.After further telephoning had been promised by thematron, the three girls were placed in a cell. Catalinaat once flung herself full length on the bench that ranalong two sides of it; Fred sat down and took out hernote-book. "I mustn't forget one incident," she told her-self. The experiene had penetrated below the theatricalconsciousness of martyrdom, and roused a primitive anger,266

THE RISING TIDEnot for herself, or the other two (of whom, to tell the truth,she thought very little), but against the wastefulness of asystem which permitted this wreckage to sweep in andsweep out-unchecked, unchnged, over and over. She Asaw, as she had never seen before, the righteousness of,woman's demand that she should have a hand in themaking and the administering of Law. She was impressed,not so much by the injustice of leaving the punishment ofwomen to men, as by the irrationality of it."There ought to have been a woman in that station-house," she said; "and there ought to be women policefficers and judges. Just wait till we get the vote, Laura-uw'i stop this idiocyl That's what it is: idiocy, notjustice ."Laura was not concerned about terms; she stood, tenseand trembling, gripping the iron bars of the door. "How-ard will be so upset, and Father will be dreadfully angryI"'Oh, yes," Fred agreed, carelessly, "Uncle William willhave a fit, of course. But I'11 bet on Howardl Motherwill almost die of it, I'm afraid," she said, her face sober-ing; "I'm sorry about that. But, of course, Laura, that'sthe penalty of progress. We-you and I and Howard-.are moving the world, and the old people have got to getout of the way or get run over!"Laura was silent."The thing that hits me hardest," sid Fredeica, "isthe way women won't stand together. Every one of thosegirs took to their heels.""Oh, when will Howard come?" said Laura, with asobbing breath. She was not sorry she had stood by Fred267

THE RISING TIDE when all the rest of them "took to their heels," only-"I1l die if he doesn't come soon!" she thought, shakingvery much. Once she glanced over her shoulder at Fred-erica, who was straining her eyes (the cell was lighted onlyfrom the hall) over her note-book, and she felt a faintthrill of admiration. Imagine, making notes at such amoment!The afternoon passed; hours-hours-hours."Oh, when will somebody come?" Laura said, in a whis-per. Frederica had put up her note-book, and seemed ab-sorbed in thought. Catalina was asleep.There came a sound of voices in the outer court, andagain Laura clutched at the iron bars. (She had beenat the grating ever since the lock was turned upon them.)"It's Howard!" Even Fred was moved to stand up and peer out intothe whitewashed corridor--then both girls shrank back;a drunken negress was being pulled along over the flag-stones of the passage to the receiving-room; a few min-utes later, she was pulled back again, and they heard theclang of a cell door; then yells, then evidently sickness;then cries upon God and the devil, and a torrent of un-speakably vile invective. Even Fred quailed before it,and Laura clung to her in such a paroxysm of fear thatthey neither of them heard the hurrying feet outside on the flagging-then the lock was flung out, and Howardcaught his wife in his arms."I just got word," he said, hoarsely; "Westo caughtme at the club. My darling!"The tears were in his eyes and his face was as white as268

Behind him, Arthur Weston looked grimly overhis head at Prederica."I had to chase him all around town," he said, "or we'dhave been here before And it's taken time to bail youout.""I'm sorry to have bothered you," Fred said; "but it'sbeen an awfully valuable experience to Laura and me.I wouldn't have missed it for anything "The matron, faintly interested, was standing by to seethe end of it. "Them swells will learn something," shewhispered, to her assistant; "I guess that thin one ain'tbad. I thought she was. Well, good-by, ma'am," shesaid, listlessly; and went back to work on a piece of dingyembroidery until the next dumping of human rubbishshould claim her attention.Out in the courtyard Frederica made a little delay.Where was Catalina to go? What was she to do? "Outon bail? Does that mean she's got to come back hereagain?"" It means that she's got to report at the municipal crim-inal court," Mr. Weston instructed her; "and so haveyou and Laura, unless I can patch things up.""Good!" Fred said, eagerly, "I wanted to know the endof this silly businessl"She got into the limousine, where Laura, still very white;had been placed by Howard, who put an unabashed armabout her.

It's all right. Mr.Weston will fix it up so you needn't go to court.""You see," Fred began, volubly, "it all happened be-cause of the policeman's rudeness to that poor littleCatalina; Laura and I had to protect her, and-""Look here"-Howard turned a fierce face upon her-"you can make a fool of yourself, all you want to, but I'llthank you not to drag my wife into your damned nonsense r' Frederica stared at him, open-mouthed."Maitland," the other man said, gravely, "I am sureyou will apologize for that."

As they went spinning along back to town, Howard gave himself up to whisper- ing to Laura Arthur Weston asked one or two questions,and Frederica told him, briefly, just what had causedthe disturbance that ended in the "interesting experi-ence." For the most part no one spoke.270
<pb n="271"/>
THE RISING TIDEAt the Maitland house, Howard almost lifted his littlewife out of the car; he was quivering with pain at herpain-at the thought that her ears had heard the moansof Life, that her eyes had seen its filth and horror; hewas.so angry at Freerica that he could not trust himselfeven to look at her. Of course he made no farewells. Hedosed the door of the limousine with a bang, and said,through the open window:".Mr.Weston, do anything,anything! sothat Laura won'tbe dragged into it. Any amount of money, of course!And the newspapers-good Lordl Can we fix them?""Ill see what can be done," Weston said; and the carspun away.Frederica turned a bewildered face upon him.

Butas they stood waiting for the door to be opened, Prederica,looking at him with miserable eyes, made a gesture offinality."I ever knew him," she said.As they heard the feet of the parlor-maid comingthrough the hall, she gripped his arm with her tremblinghand:"Arthur," she said, in a whisper; "just thinlk I asked-I asked him to marry me.

Fred's mother asked,distractedly.Mrs. Childs hesitated: "Nothing very sensible; in-deed, I don't know just what she meant. Something out;of the Bible-that they said Christ had a devil, too.Quite profane, I thought.""Fred isn't a devil!" Mrs. Payton said, angrily, hermaternal claws ready to scratch the "older one," whoseprotection of Frederica was understood only by ArthurWeston, who loved her for it, but warned her that unlessIBacon was the author of the phrase she had quoted itwould not soothe the Childs family.Certainly it did not soothe Bobby and Payton, who|told their respective wives that Freddy ought to be shutup! "Allendale is the place for her," Bob said, mention-ing a well-known inlsanesylu. They told their brother-in-law that Laura ought to be ashamed of herself-which.led to an in-law coolness that never quite thawed out."Of course I don't approve of it any more than you.do," Howard said  "If I'd been at home, Laura wouldn't.have gone with Fred. Trouble is, she's so sweet-temperedshe does whatever anybody wants-and Fred insisted, youknow. And when Laura was there she felt she had to.stand by Fred--""Stand by your grandmother " Payton Childs retorted."If Fred was my sister, I'd stand by her-with a whip!""Well, there'll be no more speechifying in ours," Howardsaid, grimly. "But I won't have Laura blamed. What273

THE RISING TIDEshe did, she did out of loyalty to Fred. When it comes to standing by, Laura is as decent as a man!"Miss Spencer was of the opinion that Mrs. Payton hadbetter take the girl to Europe-"under another name,perhaps; then she can't disgrace you.

"Her face, for instance, when she goes to jail." "It wasn't a jail," Mrs. Payton protested, whimper-ingly.Mrs. Holmes had her opinion, too; all Fred's didos,she said, were due to the fact that Mrs. Payton had not brought her up properly. She said this just as she wasleaving the parlor, teetering along on her high-heeledshoes; then her voice suddenly roughened; she turned and glared at her daughter through her white veil."The amount of it is," she said, "Fred is worth all the rest of us put together! That's why we are so provoked at her. We know we're on the shelf, and useless old fools,every one of us! Especially William Childs."Mrs. Payton was so astounded that she let her mothergo out to her carriage unattended. But the words werea comfort to her, for, poor woman, she was struck fromevery side.As for Fred, she listened listlessly to the jangle of criti-274
<pb n="275"/>
THE RISING TIDEcism, looking at her critics with curious eyes. How sillythey all were! So long as the experience of being arrestedhad not injured Laura, what difference did it make? Withher conception of the values of life, the momentary un-pleasantness of newspaper notoriety was not worth think-ing of. Fred was very listless now. Something hadtouched the garment of life, and energy and hope had goneout of it.She ceased to be young.The rebuff of unaccepted love she had faced gallantly;its accompanying knowledge of shame and pity and sym-pathy, had only steadied her; even her own irrationalitin disliking Laura (she had recognized with chagrin thatdislike was irrational, and she lated, she told herself, to bean idiot!)-all these emotional experiences had merelydeepened and humaized her. But the discovery that theHoward Maitland she thought she knew, had never lived,was a staggering blow. The other Howard-the realHoward-honest, sweet-hearted, simple, who had foundher conversation no end amusing and interesting, who hadbeen a patient receptacle for her opinions and an amiableecho of her volubility, who had swallowed many yawnsout of kindness as well as courtesy-the Howard beneathwhose charm of good manners lurked the primitive fierce-ness of the male who protects his woman at any cost,tht Howard had never made the slightest apeal to her.The jar of stepping down from the ideal man to the realman racked her, body and soul. The old pain of not beingloved had ceased as suddenly as a pulled tooth ceases toache. The new pain was only a sense of nothingness.275
<pb n="276"/>
THE RISING TIDEBut, curiously enough, it was then that the old affectionfor Laura began to flow back. "Not that I get much outof her," she thought, dully; "dear little Lolly! She hasn'tan idea beyond-him. She's a perfect slave to him. Well!I'm glad I'm a free woman  But she's a dear little thing."The soreness had all gone; she loved Lolly again-as oneloves a kitten. She used to go to see her, and look at thebaby clothes, and speculate as to whether it would be agirl or a boy. The softness, and silliness, and sweetness ofit all was to her tired mind what cushions are to a tiredbody.              '*When the baby was born, early in September, the lastbarrier between the cousins was swept away-but Fredstill made a point of not going to Laura's house at an hourwhen she was likely to find Howard at home. Laura'shusband was an entire stranger to her. When, by acci-dent, she did meet him, she used to say to herself, wonder-ingly, "How could I-?"All summer Frederica went regularly to her office. " Butbusiness isn't what you'd call booming," she told ArthurWeston. In the blind fumbling about of her stunned mindto discover a reality, he was the one person to whom sheturned. His calls at z5 Payton Street, whenever Fredwas in town, stirred even Mrs. Payton to speculation-although it was Miss Carter who put the idea into herhead:                        ,"He always comes when Miss Freddy is here; I think  ,  Ihe's taken with her.""I wish I could think so! There is nothing I should like276

THE RISING TIDEbetter," said Mrs Payton, sighing. But the mere hopeof such a thing-roused her to ask Mr. Weston to dinnerwhenever she knew that Fed was coming home for thenight. Miss Gham, getting wind of those dinners, gavehim, one day, a cousnly thrust in the ribs:"Tortoise! I do really believe you have some sense,after all!""I have sense enough to know that the race is off forthe tortoise, when the hare decides not to run," he said,dryly; "but that's no reason why I shouldn't dine withMrs. Payton."            -.Miss Eliza was spending the summer at The Laurels,and she had Freddy on her mind. She went over to Lake-ville to see her several times, and always, with elaboratecarelessness, said something in Arthur Weston's favor.But she had to admit that Fred was blind to the pursuitof the faithful tortoise."I love the child," she told her sister; "but, I declare,I could spank her! Just think what a husband dearArthur would makel""What kind of a wife would she make?" Miss Mary re-torted. "I don't thin  she would insure any man'shappiness.""The pitiful thing about her is that she has aged so,"said Miss Graham.That sense of lost youth touched her so much that shewas quite out of patience with dear Arthur. "Haven'tyou any heart?" she scolded. "The girl is unhappylCarry her off, and make her happy.""I'm too old to turn kidnapper," he defended himself.277
<pb n="278"/>
THE RISING TIDE"She is brooding over something," Miss Eliza said; "itcon't be because that foolish young man took her cousinwhen he could have got her? She has too much backbone for that !"Mr. Weston agreed that Fred was not laking back-bone, but he could not deny the brooding. So it came about that the dear old matchmaker was moved, one day,to go to Sunrise Cottage and put her finger in the pie. After she had drunk a cup of tea, and listened for half anhour to Fred's ideas as to how Laura should bring upthe baby, and the "slavery of mothers"--"LoUy hasn'ttime to read a linel" Fred said;-Miss Eliza suddenlytouched her on the shoulder:"My dear," she said, "you've got to live, whether youlikeit ornot. Make thebestof it!"Fred gave a gasp of astonishment; then she said, in alow voice, "How did you know I didn't like living?""Because when I didn't, I was just as careless aboutmy back hair as you are."Involuntarily Fred put her hand up to her head. "Is it untidy?""It's indifferent. And when you think how fond Arthur is of you, it's very selfish in you not to look as pretty as ':you can."She went away greatly pleased with herself. "It will touch her vanity to think he likes her to look pretty; and when a girl tries to look pretty for a man, the next step is to fall in love with him."Alasl Fred's vanity was not in the slightest degreeflattered. But her pride had felt the roweling of the spur278,.

THE RISING TIDEof Truth. She must brace up-because she had got tolive! The words were like a trumpet. "I've got to live--uwther I like it or not. I must get action on something," she told herself, grimly.That night she sat down on the little stool in front ofher fire, and stared a long time into the flames. Yes, shemust get busy. "I've been a pig. I've had a grouch on,just because I didn't get a stick of candy when I wantedit-and wouldn't I have been sick of my candy by thistime, if I'd got it! How ca Lolly stand him? What afool I was." . . Yes, she must "get busy"; why nottry and do something for those poor, wretched womenwho are sent to the House of Detention? What she hadseen and heard in that stonelined room had left a scarupon her mind. "I'll make Arthur tell me how to getat them," she thought. Suddenly she remembered Miss-Eliza's thrust: "It's selfish in you--hen he's so fondof you"She gave a little start: "Oh, but that's impossibelThat sort of thing is over for him.

.CHAPTER XXVIIT was late in September, when she asked ArthurWeston to tell her how she could help "those awfulwomen,"-as she called the poor creatures she had seenin jail. He had motored out to Lakeville for a cup of tea,and while they waited for the kettle to boil, they wanderedoff along the shore of the lake, and found a little inletwalled with willows, where they could sit on the beach andsee nothing but the wrinkling flash of waves and a serenestretch of sky. They sat there, talking idly, and watchingthe willow leaves turn all their silvery backs to a hesitatingbreeze.Weston listened silently to her plans for "getting busy"with prison reform-when she suddenly broke off:" I don't see that the vote will do much."He gave her an astonished look. "What  This fromyou?"She nodded. "Of course I'm for suffrage, first, last, andall the time! But I'm sort of discouraged about whatwe can accomplish. Life is so big." The old cocksurenesswas gone. The pathos of common sense in Freddy madehim wince. "But I've got to do something," she ended."Miss Eliza told me I was elfish."280
<pb n="281"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Look here! I won't let Cousin Eliza call you names!I reserve that for myself."She laughed. "You've done it, often enough."Arthur Weston tickled the sleeping Zip and whistled."What do you suppose Laura told me the other day?"Fred said. "She said that 'no woman really knew whatlife meant unless she had a baby.' She said having ababy was like coming out of prison-because 'self' isa prison. Rather tall talk for little Laua, wasn't it?""Any of the great human experiences are keys to ourprison-house," he said."True enough," she agreed; then, abruptly, her owngreat experience spoke: "Isn't it queer? I rather dislikeHoward.""It's unreasonable. He's the same old Howard--amighty decent chap.""He's not-what I supposed he was.""Well, that's your fault, not his. You dressed him upin your ideas; when he got into his own clothes, youdidn't like him. Howard never pretended to be any-thing he wasn't.""Yes! Yes, he didl" she said, with sudden agitation."He used to-listen to me.""Good heavens, don't hold that up against himl Don'tI listen to you?""Oh, but you never let me think you agree with melI always know you don't.""He agrees far more than I do.""No," she said, with a somber look. "He just let metalk. He didn't care. The things that were real to meint

THE RISING TIDEweren't real to him. His real things were-what's happen-ing now. The baby, and Laura. Is it so with all of you?Don't you ever care with your minds?"He stopped tickling Zip, and looked out over the lakewith narrowing eyes; after a while he said, gently:"I think the caring with the mind comes second. Whena man falls in love, the mind has nothing to do with it.Sometimes it reinforces the heart, so to speak; when thathappens, you have the perfect marriage-which isn't aw-fully common. It's apt to be just the heart; which getspretty dull after a while. But just the head is arid.""He would have found just my head,-arid?" shepondered.He looked straight at her, and said, quietly: "I thinkhe would."There was a long pause."Was it head, or heart, with you?" she said."It's both," he said.She gave him a puzzled look: "Why, you don't meanthat you care for that horrid Kate, still?"He smiled, and looked off over the water."You are very stupid, Fred."She was plainly perplexed. "I don't understand?""That's why I say you are stupid."His face was turned away from her; he was breakinga dead twig into inch-long pieces, and carefully arrangingthem in a precise fagot on his knee; she saw, with alittle shock of surprise, that his fingers were trembling." Why, Arthur I"bhe began,-and stopped short, the colorrising slowly to her forehead. He gave her a quick look.282
<pb n="283"/>
THE RISING TIDE"Whyr' she said again, faintly, "you don't mean--you're not-?"He laughed, opening his hands in a gesture of amusedand hopeless assent "I am," he said, and flung the tinyfagot out on the water.Fred dropped her chin on her fists and watched thetwigs dancing off over the waves. They were both silent;then she said, frowning, and pausing a little between herwords as if trying to take in their full meaning:-"Youare in love with me.""Has it just struck you?""How could it strie me-that you would care for agirl like met""Considering your intelligene, you ae stonishinglyobtuse, at times. I couldn't care for any other kind ofgirl. Or for any girl, except your'"      Miss El  said someting that made me wonder if ..But I couldn't believe it. I thought that sort of thingwasover for you. I never dreamed of-""Oh, well! don't dream of it now. Of course it doesn'tmake a particle of difference. I didn't mean to speak ofit; it sort of broke loose," he ended, in rueful onfession.Fred was silent.Arthur Weston, hiding the tremor that was tingling allthrough him, began to talk easily, of anything-Zip, theweather, whether Miss Carter could be induced to recon-sider her annual resignation; "It would be very hard onMrs. Payton to lose her," he said."Well," Frederica said, slowly, "I don't see any reasonwhy I shouldn't marry you."283
<pb n="284"/>
THE RISING TIDEHe caught his breath; then struck his hand on hers."You're a good sport! I take back my accusation thatyou weren't. I could name several reasons why youshouldn't marry me.""Name them.""Fred, look here; thisis a serious business with me. Ican't talk about it."" I want to talk about it. I'd like to know your reasons.""To begin with-age."She nodded. "In years you are older. But I'm notyoung any more."The water stung in his eyes; she was right-she wasnot "young" now. "The next reason," he went on, with-out looking at her, "is that you are not in love with me."She thought that over: "But I am fond of you.""That won't do for marriage.""It's more than just fondness with you?" she asked,doubtfully.He caught her hand, kissed it, and flung it from him."Come!" he said, harshly, "let's go home!" He rose, butshe did not move."Do you love me?" she insisted, looking up at him.He was silent. When he spoke his voice was rough withsuffering. "I love you as much ... as I can. But it'snot worth the taking. I know that. I wouldn't ask youto take it. You ought to have-fire and gold! I spentmy gold ten years ago; and the fire burned itself out.Don't talk about it. I feel like lead, sometimes, com-pared with you. But I'm not adamant."She got on her feet, and stood looking out over the284

Ican't imagine, now, how I ever thought I wasl""You will be in love with somebody else one of thesedays."She shook her head. "No; that's all over. There isno fire and gold in me, either. Something-was killed,I think.""It will come to life."She gave a little gasp: "No. It's dead. But what isleft is-well, it isn't bad, what's left. Sometimes," shesaid, with sudden sweet gaiety, "sometimes I think it'sbetter than what Howard and Laura havel""No, it isn't," he said, sadly."I wonder," she pondered, "if I could have been...like Laura? She hasn't a thought except for the babyand Howard. They are the center of Life to her,--whichis all right, I suppose. But they are it's crcumferene,too; which seems to me dreadfully cramping. I nevercould be like that."He smiled, in spite of himself. "Nature is a prettybig thing, Fred; when you hold your own child in yourarms-" he stopped short. "Life is bigger than theories,"he said, in a low voice.She nodded: "I know what you mean. But I nevercould be a fool, Arthur.""I think," he said, and again something in his voicemade her catch her breath; "I think you could be,-atmoments.""Better not count on it," she said; "but if you want285

But on the whole, I think-I'd like it."She smiled at him, and her eyes brimmed with affection."You see, we're friends; and you never bore me. Howardwould have bored me awfully. So-I will marry you,Arthur."He was silent. "Rather hard," she said, misciievously,"to have to offer myself tw-""Stop!" he said; "don't say things like thatr'"Well, then-" she began; but he lifted a silencinghand:"My dear, my dear, I love you too much to marryyou."Why, then," she said, simply "you love me, it seemsto me, enough to marry me. Don't you see?"He looked at her with hungry eyes. "I think I amman enough to save you from myself," he said; "but don't-don't tempt me too far!" ...

CHAPTER XXVIITHAT was in September. It was the first of Decemberwhen Howard Maitland came leaping up-stairs, twosteps at a time, and burst into the nursery, so chock-fullof news that he could hardly wait to see the way Betty'stoes would grip your finger if you put it on the sole ofher pink foot."Who do you suppose is engaged?""Jack McKnight," Laura said; "Howard, kiss herlittle neck, right under her ear."He kissed it, and said, "Nol Not McKnight. Youwouldn't guess in a hundred years!""Well, then, you'd better tell me. See, Father, she'ssmiling! Howard, I think she's really a very distinguised-looking baby; don't you?""She looks like her ma, so of course she is!""Nonsense! She's the image of you. What do youthink? When I went down to luncheon, Sarah says sheturned her head right around to watch me go out of theroom.""Goshl She'll be reading Browning nextI Laura-whydon't you rise about the engagement? You'll screamwhen I tell you.""Well, tell me."287

THE RISING TIDE"Fred Payton and-""What!""Hold on. I've not begun to holler yet. And-oldWeston.""What!""I thought you'd sit up.""Howard! I don't believe it.""It's true. I met Mrs. Payton, and she told me. Shekept me standing on the corner for a quarter of an hourwhile she explained that she was going to do up herChristmas presents now, so she could get the house inorder for the wedding. It's to be in January. The en-gagement comes out to-morrow. It's been cooking sinceSeptember, but they didn't really tie up until last week.I'm pledged to secrecy, but your Aunt Nelly said I could tell you.""I never was so astonished in my life!" Laura gasped."I was-surprised, myself," Howard said."Well," said Laura, "I'm glad poor old Fred is going tobe married-but how can she! Of course I know he'sbeen gone on her for ages; but I don't see how he daredto propose to her-he's old enough to be her father!Maybe she took pity on him and proposed to him," Laura declared, giggling."The baby has a double chin," her husband said, hur-riedly."Fred converted him to suffrage last summer," Laurasaid; "that showed which way the wind was blowing."Howard stopped tickling his daughter's neck, and frowned, as if trying to remember something. "Westona288

THE RISING TIDEa suffragist? That's interesting  Leighton-you remem-ber?-the man who went to the Philippines with me?"Laura nodded abstractedly."Well, he said that if a man was a suffragist it wasbecause he was either in the cradle or the grave. He saidthe man of affairs was bored to extinction by the wholehullabaloo business. He considered me in the cradle; soI suppose he'd say that Weston-""Mr. Weston may be in the grave, but you're not in*the cradle," Laura interrupted, affronted; "you are thefather of a family!""Well, to be candid, I'm not crazy about suffrage,"Howard confessed, and was pummeled by his baby's fists,carefully directed by the maternal hand."I'm ashamed of youl Betty and I are going to walkin the parade, and you shall carry a banner.""Thanks so much; I fear business will call me to Phila-delphia that day. Too badl""Freddy and Mr. Westonl" Laura repeated; "well,I do't understand it!""Neither do I," said her husband. He walked over tothe window and stood with his hands in his pockets,looking out into the rain; behind him he heard the nurserydoor open, and Laura's contented voice:"No, Sarah, I don't need you. I'm going to put her tobed myself. You go down and have your supper. Justput her little nightie on the fender before you go, so itwill be nice and warm." Then the door dosed again, andhe could hear Laura mumbling in the baby's neck:"Sweetyl Mother lovesl Put little hanny into the289

THE RISING TIDEsleeve. ... Oh, Howard, look at her! Did you ever seeanything so killing? Howard, just think! Fred told meonce that she was going to have a trained nurse for herchildren. Well, she'll know better when she has 'emlOoo-oo-seetyl--don't pull mother's hair " The firelitwarmth, the little night-gown scorching on the fender,Laura in the low chair, his child's head on her breast-the young man, staring out into the rain and darkness,felt something tighten in his throat. Life was so perfect!There, behind him, by the hearth, in warm security, werehis two Treasures-to be cared for, and guarded, andmade happy. He lived only to stand between them andFate. His very flesh and blood were theirs! "I wouldn'tlet the wind blow on them!" he thought, fiercely. ButFred Payton wouldn't let anybody stand between herand the gales of life. He couldn't imagine Arthur Westonprotecting Fred. Imagine any man trying to take careof Fred! "She'd be taking care of him, the first thinghe'd know!. Still, I take off my hat to her, every time.She's big."Down in the bottom of his heart was a queer uneasiness:he was not "big," himself; "I am satisfied just to be happy;Fred wants something more than that. She's more worth-while than I am," he thought, humbly. He turned andlooked at the two by the fire, then came over, and, kneel-ing down, took his World into his arms."Oh, Laura!" he said; he rested his head on his wife's shoulder, and felt the baby's silky hair against his lips.l"Laura, how perfect life is! I'm so happy, I'm frightenedl-and I don't deserve it. Fred Payton isworth six of me*" 290

THE RISING TIDELaura gave a little squeal. "As if any girl was as goodas you! Besides, poor, dear Freddy-nobody appreciatesher more than I do, but Howard, you know perfectly wellthat she is-I mean she isn'--I mean, well, you know?Poor Fred, she's perfectly fine, but nobody except some-body like Mr. Weston would want to marry her, becauseshe is awfully bossy. And a man doesn't like a bossywoman, now does her'"You bet he doesn't' Howard said. "But I take myhat off to Fred.""Oh, of course," said Laura."Thank God, she's got a man to keep her in order"said Mr. William Childs."What shall we give her for a wedding-present?" Mrs.Childs ruminated."Give Weston a switch!" said Billy-boy."I shall miss her terribly," said Mrs. Payton; "I don'tknow how I'm going to get along without her." Her liptrembled and she looked at her mother, who was runinga furtive, white-gloved finger across Mr. Andrew Payton'smarble toga. "Oh, yes; it isn't dusted," Mrs. Paytonsighed; "you can't get servants to dust anything now-adays""Fred will make 'em dust " Mrs. Holmes said, with sat-isfaction. "All Fred needs is to be married. MissEliza Graham told me that she had gumption. I saidhe had gumption, to get her!"201

THE RISING TIDE"I wonder if he knows about her affair with Laura'shusband," Miss Spencer ruminated. "Some one ought'to tell him, just out of kindness." (And the very next day an anonymous letter did tell him, for which he wasduly grateful.) "I hope she will make you happy," Miss Mary Grahamtold her cousin, sighing."Well, Arthur will make her happy," Miss Eliza said, decidedly; "and that's what he cares about! As for her imaking him happy, it will be his own fault if she doesn't.She'll interest you, Arthur-that's what a man like youwants.""I'm to be 'amused,' am I?" Arthur Weston said,grimly. "But suppose I don't 'amuse' her?" And asthe older sister went out to the door with him to say good-by, he added: "Am I a thief? Of course, I've gotthe best of the bargain."She did not contradict him. "I think," she said, herface full of pain and pity, "that Fred has got the very best'bargain that, being Fred, she could possibly get.""No!" he said, "you're wrong! But pray God she^never finds it out."He did not mean to let her find it out But that afternoon when he went into No. r5 for htea and for a chance to look at Frederica, and tease her'and feel her frank arm over his shoulder, he was very siletThey were in the sitting-room, Mrs. Payton havingfully withdrawn to the entry outside of Morty's room"When I was a young lady," she told Miss Carter,"2ga92

THE RISING TIDEused to receive Mr. Payton in the back parlor, and Mamaalways sat in the front parlor. But Mama was very old-fashioned-I believe in the new ideasl And then, afterall, Mr. Weston is so much older than Freddy-oh, dearmef What a blessing it was to have him fall in love withher!""Mother is going round," Fred told her lover, as shehanded him his tea, "saying, 'Now lettest thou thy ser-vant... I' She's so ecstatic over our engagement.""I'm rather ecstatic myself," he said; "Fred-I am ahighway robber.""Be still" she said; and gave him'another lump ofsugar."I love you," he said. "But you-no, it isn't fair; itisn't fair."She took his teacup from him and snuggled down be-side him; "I'm satisfied," she said.The sense.of her content stabbed him. She ought tohave so much more than content. He had told her sooften enough, in those two months of standing out againsthis own heart; he told her so when, at last, he yielded.But when he said it now, she would not listen. "I tellyou,rm satisfiedI" She dropped her head on his shoulder,and hummed a little to herself.How was a man to break through such content!"But I will!" he told himslf.THB END

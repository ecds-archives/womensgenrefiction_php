JOHN WARD, PREACHER
CHAPTER I
<p>THE evening before Helen Jeffrey's wedding day,
the whole household at the rectory  ame out into the garden.</p>
<p>"The fact is," said Dr. Howe, smiling good-
naturedly at his niece,"the importance of this occasion has made everybody so full of suppressed
excitement one can't breathe in the house."</p>
<p>And indeed a wedding in Ashurst had all the
charm of novelty. "Why, bless my soul," said the
rector, "let me see: it must be ten--no, twelve
years since Mary Drayton was married, and that
was our last wedding. Well, we couldn't stand
such dissipation oftener; it would wake us up."</p>
<p>But Ashurst rather prided itself upon being half
asleep. The rush and life of newer places had a
certain vulgarity; haste was undignified, it was almost ill bred, and
the most striking thing about the village, resting at the feet of its
low green hills, was its atmosphere of leisure and repose.</p>
<p>Its grassy road was nearly two miles long, so
that Ashurst seemed to cover a great deal of ground,
though there were really very few houses.  A lan,
<pb n="2 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
leading to the rectory, culed about the foot of
East Hill at one end of the road, and at the other
was the brick-walled garden of the Mises Wood-house.</p>
<p>Between these extremes the village had slowly
grown; but its first youth was so far past, no one
quite remembered it, and even the trying stage of
middle age was over, and its days of growth were
ended. This was perhaps because of its distance
from the county town, for Mercer was twelve miles
away, and there was no prospect of a railroad to, unite them. It had been talked of once; some of
the shopkeepers, as well as Mr. Lash, the carpenter,
.advocated it strenuously at Bulcher's grocery store
in the evenings, because, they said, they were at the mercy of Phibbs,
the package man, who brought their wares on his slow, creaking cart
over the dusty turnpike from Mercer. But others, looking into
the future, objected to a convenience which might
result in a diminution of what little trade they had.  Among the
families, however, who did not have to consider "trade" there was great unanimity, though
the Draytons murmured something about the increased value of the land; possibly not so much
with a view to the welfare of Ashurst as because
their property extended along the proposed line of the road.</p>
<p>The rector was very firm in his opinion.  "Why," said he, mopping his forehead with his big silk handkerchief, "what do we want with a railroad? My
grandfather never thought of such a thing, so I
think I can get along without it, and it is a great deal better for
the village not to have it."</p>
<pb n="3 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>It would have out off one ootner of his barn; and
though this could not have interfered with the material or spiritual
welfare of Ashurst, Dr. Howe's opinion never wavered.  And the rector but expressed the feelings of the other "families," so that
all Ashurst was conscious of relief when the projectors of the railroad went no further than to makea cut at one end of the Drayton pastures; and that
was so long ago that now the earth, which had
shown a ragged yellow wound across the soft greenness of the meadows, was sown by sweet clover and
wild roses, and gave no sign of ever having been
gashed by picks and shovels.</p>
<p>The Misses Woodhouse's little orchard of gnarled
and wrinkled apple-trees came to the edge of the
cut on one side, and then sloped down to the kitchen
garden and back door of their old house, which in
front was shut off from the road by a high brick
wall, gray with lichens, and crumbling in places
where the mortar had rotted under the creepers and
ivy, which hung in heavy festoons over the coping. The tall iron gates had not been closed for
years, and, rusting on their hinges, had pressed
back against the inner wall, and were almost hidden
by the tangle of vines, that were woven in and out
of the bars, and waved about in the sunshine from
their tops.</p>
<p>The square garden which the wall inclosed was
full of cool, green darkness; the trees were the
growth of three generations, and the syringas and
lilacs were so thick and close they had scarcely
light enough for blossoming.  The box borders,
<pb n="4 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
which edged the straight prim walks, had grown, inspite of clippings,
to be almost hedges, so that the
paths between them were damp, and the black, hard
earth had a film of moes over it. Old-fashioned
flowers grew just where their ancestors had stood
fift years before. "I could find the bed of white
violets with my eyes shut," said Miss Ruth Wood-house; and she knew how far the lilies of the valleyspread each spring, and how much it would be
necessary to clip, every other year, the big arbor
vitae, so that the sunshie might fall upon her
bunch of sweet-williams.</p>
<p>Miss Ruth was always very generous with her flowers but now that
there was to be a wedding at the rectory she meant to strip the garden of every
blossom she oould find, and her nephew was to take them to the church the first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Gifford Woodhouse had lately returned from Europe, and his three years' travel had not prepared his aunts to treat him as anything but the boy he
seemed to them when he left the law school.  They
still "sent dear Giff" here, or "brought him"
there, and arranged his plans for him, in entire unconsciousnees that
he might have a will of his own.  Perhaps the big fellow's silence rater helped the
impression, for so long as he did not remonstrate when they bade him
do this or that, it was not of so much consequence that, in the end,
he did exactly as he pleased. This was not often at variance with
the  desires of the two sister, for the wordless influence of his will
so enveloped them that his wishes were apt to be theirs. But no oe could have been
<pb n="5 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
more surprised than the litle ladies, had they been
told that their nephew's intention of practicing law
in the lumber town of Lockhaven had been his own
idea.</p>
<p>They had cordially agreed with him when he observed that anather
lawyer in Ashurst, beside Mr.Denner, would have no other occupation than to
his own will; and they had nodded approvingly the young man added that
it would seem scarcely gracious to  settle in Mercer while Mr. Denner
still hoped to find clients there, and sat once a week, for an hour,
in a dingy back office waiting for them. True, they never came; but Gifford had
once read law with Mr. Denner, and knew and
loved the little gentleman, so he could not do a
thing which might appear discourteous. And when
he further remarked that there seemed to be a good opening in Lockhaven, which was a growing place,
and that it would  be very jolly to have Helen Jeffrey she became Mrs. Ward, the two
Misses Woodhouse smiled, and said firmly that they
approved of it, and that they would send him to
Lockhaven in the spring, and they were glad they had
thought of it.</p>
<p>On this June night, they had begged him to take
a message to the rectory about the flowers for the
wedding. "He is glad enough to go, poor child,"
said Miss Deborah, sighing, when she saw the alacity with which he
started; "he feels her marriage very much, though he is so young."</p>
<p>"Are you sure, dear Deborah?" asked Miss Ruth,
doubtfully. "I never really felt quite certain that he
was interested in her."</p>
<pb n="6 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Certainly I am," answered Miss Deborah, sharply. "I've always maintained they were made for
each other."<p>
<p>But Gifford Woodhouse's pleasant gray eyes, under straight brown brows, showed none of the despair of an unsuccessful lover; on the contrary, he
whistled softly through his blonde moustache, as he
came along the rectory lane, and then walked down
the path to join the party in the garden.</p>
<p>The four people who had gathered at the foot of
the lawn were very silent; Dr. Howe, whose cigar
glowed and faded like a larger firefly than those
which were beginning to spangle the darkness, was
the only one ready to talk. " Well," he said, knocking off his cigar ashes on the arm of his chair,"everything ready for tomorrow, girls? Trunks
packed and gowns trimmed? We'11 have to keep
you, Helen, to see that the house is put in order
after all this turmoil; don't you think so, Lois?"</p>
<p>Here the rector yawned secretly.</p>
<p>"You need n't worry about <hi rend="italic">order</hi>, father," Lois
said, lifting her head from her cousin's shoulder, her
red lower lip pouting a little, "but I wish we could
keep Helen."</p>
<p>"Do you hear that, Mr. Ward?" the rector said.
"Yes, we're all going to miss the child very much. Gifford Woodhouse
was saying to-day Ashurst wouldlose a great deal when she
went. There's a compliment for you, Helen! How that fellow has changed
in these three years abroad! He's quite a man, now.
Why, how old is he?   It's hard for us elders to
realize that children grow up."</p>
<pb n="7 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Giff is twenty-six" Lois said.</p>
<p>"Why, to be sure," said Dr. Howe, "so he is!
Of course, I might have known it: he was born the
year your brother was, Lois, and he would have been
twenty-six if he'd lived. Nice fellow, Gifford is. I'm
sorry he's not going to practice in Mercer. He has
a feeling that it might interfere with Denner in some way.
But dear me, Denner never had a case outside Ashurst in his life. Still, it shows good feeling in
the boy; and I'm glad he's going to be in Lockhaven. He'll keep an eye on Helen, and let us
know if she behaves with proper dignity. I think
you'11 like him, Mr. Ward,--I would say John,--my dear fellow!"</p>
<p>There was a lack of sympathy on the part of the
rector for the man at his side, which made it difficult for him to
drop the formal address, and think of him as one of the family. "I respect Ward,"
he said once to his sister,--"I can't help respecting
him; but bless my soul, I wish he was more like other
people!" There was something about the younger man, Dr. Howe did not
know just what, which irritated him. Ward's earnestness was positively
aggressive, he said, and there seemed a sort of undress of the mind in
his entire openness and frankness; his truthfulness, which ignored the courteous deceits
of social life, was a kind of impropriety.</p>
<p>But John Ward had not noticed either the apology or the omission;
no one answered the rector, so he went on talking, for mere occupation.</p>
<p>"I always liked Gifford as a boy," he said; "he was such a manly fellow, and no blatherskite, talking
<pb n="8 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
his elders to death. He never had much to say, and
when he did talk it was to the point. I remember
otee seeing him--why, let me see, he could n't have
been more than fifteen--breaking a colt in the west
pasture. It was one of Bet's fillies, and as black as a
coal: you remember her, don't you, Lois ? - a beauty I
I was coming home from the village early in the
morning; somebody was sick,--let me see, was n't
it old Mrs.Drayton? yes,--and I'd been sent for;
it must have been about six, -and there was Gifford
struggling with that young mare in the west pasture. He had thrown off his coat, and caught her
by the mane and a rope bridle, and he was trying to
ride her. That blonde head of his was right against
her neck, and when she reared he clung to her till
she lifted him off his feet. He got the best of her,
though, and the first thing she knew he was on her
back. Jove! how she did plunge! but he mastered
her; he sat superbly. I felt Gifford had the making
of a man in him, after that. He inherits his father's
pluck. You know Woodhouse made a record at
Lookout Mountain; he was killed the third day."</p>
<p>"Gifford used to say," said Helen, "that he
wished he had been born in time to go into the
army."</p>
<p>"There's a good deal of fight in the boy," said
the rector, chuckling. "His aunts were always begging him not to get into rows with the village boys.
I even had to caution him myself.  'Never fight,
sir,' I'd say; 'but if you do 'fight, whip 'em!'
Yes, it's a pity he could n't have been in the
army."</p>
<pb n="9 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Well," said Lois, impatiently, "Giff would have fought, I know,
but he's so contradictory! I've heard himsy the Southerners couldn't
help fighting for seccession; it was a principle to them, and there
was no moral wrong about it, he said."</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense!" cried the rector; "these young men, who have n't
borne the burden and heat of the day, pretend to instruct us, do
they? No moral wrong? I thought Gifford had some sense! They were
condemned by God and man."</p>
<p>"But, uncle Archie," Helen siad, slowly, "if they thought they
were right, you can't say there was a moral wrong?"</p>
<p>"Oh, come, come," said Dr. Howe, with an indignant splutter, "you
don't understand these things my dear--you're young yet, Helen.
They were wrong through and through; so do n't be absurd." Then
turning half apologetically to John Ward, he added, "You'll have to
keep this child's ideas in order; I am sure she never heard such
sentiments from me.  Mr. Ward will think you have n't been well
brought up, Helen.  Pinciple? Twaddle! their pockets were what they
thought of.  All this talk of principle is rubbish."</p>
<p>The rector's face was flushed, and he brought his fist down with
emphais upon the arm of his chair.</p>
<p>"And yet," said John Ward, lifting this thoughtful dark eyes to
Dr. Howe's handsome face, "I have always sympathized with a mistaken
idea of duty, and I am sure that many southerners felt they were only
doing their duty in fighting for secession and to the perpetuatuin of slavery."</p>
<pb n="10 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"I don't agree with you, sir," said Dr. Howe whose ideas of hospitality forbade more vigorous
speech, but his bushy gray eyebrows were drawn into a frown.</p>
<p>"I think you are unfair not to admit that,"
John continued with gentle persistence, while the
rector looked at him in silent astonishment, and
the two young women smiled at each other in the
darkness. ("The idea of contradicting father!" Lois
whispered.) "They felt," he went on, "that they
had found authority for slavery in the Bible, so what
else could they do but insist upon it?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense," said Dr. Howe, forgetting himself,
"the Bible never taught any such wicked thing.
They believed in states rights, and they wanted
slavery."</p>
<p>"But," John said, "if they did believe the Bible
permitted slavery, what else could they do? Knowing that it is the inspired wead of God, and that
every action of life is to be decided by it, they had
to fight for an institution which they believed
saered, even if their own judgment and inclination
did not concede that it was right. If you thought
the Bible taught that slavery was right, what could
you do?"</p>
<p>"I never could think, aything so absurd," the
rector answered, a shade of contempt in his good-natured voice.</p>
<p>"But if you did," John insisted, "even if you
were unable to see that it was right,--if the Bible
taught it, inculcated it?"</p>
<p>Dr.Howe laughed impatiently, and flung the end
<pb n="11 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
if his cigar down into the bushes, where it glowed
for a moment like an angry eye. "I--I? Oh, I'd
read some other part of the book," he said. " But I
refuse to think such a crisis possible; you can always
find some other meaning in a text, you know."</p>
<p>"But, uncle Archie," Helen said, "if one did
think the Bible taught something to which one's
conscience or one's reason could not assent, it seems
to me there could be only one thing to do,--give up the Bible!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said Dr. Howe, "don't be so extreme,
Helen. There would be many things to do; leave
the consideration of slavery, or whatever the supposed wrong was, until you'd mastered all the virtues of the Bible: time enough to think of an alternative then,-eh, Ward? Well, thank Heaven, the
war's over, or we'd have you a rank copperhead.  Come! it's time to go into the house. I don't want
any heavy eyes for tomorrow."</p>
<p>"What a speech for a minister's wife, Helen!"
Lois cried, as they rose. "What would people say
if they heard you announce that you would give up the Bible'?"</p>
<p>"I hope no one will ever hear her say anything
so foolish," said Dr. Howe, but John Ward looked
at Lois in honest surprise.</p>
<p>"Would it make any difference what people
said?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I was n't speaking very seriously," Lois
answered, laughing, "but still, one does not like to
say anything which is unusual, you know, about
such things. And of course Helen does n't really,
mean that she'd give up the Bible."</p>
<pb n="12 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<P>"But I do," Helen interrupted, smiling; and she
might have said more, for she could not see John's
troubled look in the darkness, but Gifford Wood-house came down the path to meet them and give
Miss Ruth's messae.</p>
<p>"Just in time, young man," sid the rector, as
Gifford silently took some of John's burden of
shawls and cushions, and turned and walked beside
him. "Here's Helen giving Ward an awful idea of
her orthodoxy; come and vouch for the teaching you
get at St. Michael's."</p>
<p>Gifford laughed. "What is orthodoxy, doctor ?"
he said. "I'm sure I don't know I"</p>
"'The hungry sheep look up and are not fed,'"
qodted the rector in a burlesque despair. "Why,
what we believe, boy, - what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> believe I The rest
of my flock know better, Mr. Ward, I assure you."</p>
<p>"I don't think we know what we do believe,
uncle," Helen said lightly.</p>
<p>"This grows worse and worse," said the rector.
"Come, Helen, when an intelligent young woman, I
might say a bright young woman, makes a commonplace speech, it is a
mental yawn, and denotes exhaustion.  You and Lois are tired; run up-stairs.
Vanish! I say.  Good night deer hild, and God bless you!"</p>

CHAPTER II
ASHURST Rectory, in a green seclusion of vines and creepers, stood
close to the lane,--Strawberry Lane it was called, because of a tradition that wild
strawberries grew there. The richness of the garden was scarcely kept
in bounds by its high fence; the tops of the bushes looked over it, and climbing
roses shed their petals on the path below, and cherries, blossoms, and fruit were picked by the passer
by. "There is enough for us inside," said the
rector.</p>
<p>The house itself was of gray stone, which seemed
to have caught, where it was not hidden by Virginia
creepers and wistaria, the mellow coloring of the
siuget light, which flooded it from a gap in the
western hills. Its dormer-windows, their roofs like
brown caps bent about their ears, had lattices opening outward; and from one of these Lois Howe,
on the evening of Helen's wedding day, had seen
her father wandering about the garden, with the
red setter at his heels, and had gone down to join
him.</p>
<p>"I wonder," she said, as she wound her round
young arm in his, which was behind him, and held
his stick, "if John Ward has a garden? I hope
so; Helen is so fond of flowers. But he never said
anything bout it; he just went around as though he
<pb n="14 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
was in a dream. He was perfectly happy if he could
only look at Helen!"</p>
<p>"Well, that's right," said the rector; "that's
proper. What else would you have? The fact is,
Lois, you don't like Ward. Now, he is a good fellow; yes, good is just the word for him. Bless
my soul, there's a pitch of virtue about him that
is exhausting. But that's our fault," he added
candidly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'l1 like him," Lois said quickly, "if he
will just make Helen happy."</p>
<p>The rector shook his head.  "I know how you
feel," he said, "and I acknowledge he is odd; that
talk of his last night about slavery being a righteous
institution "--</p>
<p>"Oh, he didn't say that, father," Lois interrupted.</p>
<p>--"was preposterous," continued Dr. Howe, not
noticing her; " but he's earnest, he's sincere, and I
have a great deal of respect for earnestness. And
look here, Lois, you must not let anybody see you
are not in sympathy with Helen's choice; be careful
of that tongue of yours, child. It 's bad taste to make
one's private disappointments public.  I wouldn't
speak of it even to your aunt Deely, if I were you."</p>
<p>He stooped down to pull some matted grass from
about the roots of a laburnum-tree, whose dark
leaves wero lighted by golden loops of blossoms.
"Thirty-eight years ago," he said, "your mother
and I planted this; we had just come home from our
wedding journey, and she had brought this slip from
her mother's garda it Virginia. But dear me, I
<pb n="15 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
suppose I've told you that a dozen times.  What? How to-day brings
back that trip of ours!  We came through Lockhaven,  but it was by stage-coach.
I remember we thought we were so fortunate because the other two passengers got out there, and
we had the coach to ourselves. Your mother had a stripped ribbon, or gauze,--I don't know what you
call it,--on her bonnet, and it kept blowing out of
of the windom of the coach, like a little flag. You
young people can go further in less time, when you
travel, but you will ne ver know the charm of staging it through the
mountains. I declare, I have n't
thought of it for years, but to-day brings it all back to me!"</p>
<p>They had reached the rectory porch, and Dr. Howe settled himself in
his wicker chair and lighted
his cigar, while Lois sat down on the steps, and began to dig small
holes in the gravel with the stick her father had resigned to her.</p>
<p>The flood of the soft lamplight from  the open hall door threw the
portly figure of the rector into full relief, and touching Lois's
head, as she sat in the shadow at the foot of the steps, with a faint
aureole, fell in a broad bright square on the lawn in front of the
house.  They had begun to speak again of the wedding, when the click
of the gate latch and the swinging glimmer of a lantern through the
lilacs and syringas warned them that some one was coming, and in
another moment the Misses Woodhouse and their nephew stepped across
the square of light.</p>
<p>Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth were quite unconscious that they gave
the impression of carrying Gif-
<pb n="16 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
ford about with them, rather than of being supported by him, for each little lady had passed a
determined arm through one of his, and instead of
letting her small hand, incased in its black silk mitt,
rest upon his sleeve, pressed it firmly to her breast.</p>
<p>Ashurst was a place where friendships grew in
simplicity as well as strength with the years, and
because these three people had been most of the
morning at the rectory, arranging flowers, or moving furniture about, or helping with some dainty
cooking, and then had gone to the church at noon
for the wedding, they saw no reason why they
should not come again in the evening. So the sisters had put on their second-best black silks, and,
summoning Gifford, had walked through the twilight
to the rectory.  Miss Deborah Woodhouse had a
genius for economy, which gave her great pleasure
and involved but slight extra expense to the household, and she would have felt it a shocking extravagance to have kept on the dress she had worn to
the wedding. Miss Ruth, who was an artist, the
sisters said, and fond of pretty things, reluctantly
followed her example.</p>
<p>They sat down now on the rectory porch, and
began to talk, in their eager, delicate little voices, of
the day's doings. They scarcely noticed that their
nephew and Lois had gone into the fragrant dusk
of the garden. It did not interest them that the
young people should wish to see, as Gifford had
said, how the sunset light lingered behind the hills;
and when they had exhausted the subject of the
wedding, Miss Ruth was anxious to ask the rector
<pb n="17 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
about his greenhouse and the relative value of leaf
mould and bone dressing, so they gave no thought to the two who still delayed among the flowers.</p>
<p>This was not surprising. Gifford and Lois had
known each other all their lives. They had quarreled and made up with
kisses, but they had always felt themselves the most cordial and
simple friends.  Then had come the time when Gifford must go to college, and Lois had only seen him
in his short vacations; and these gradually became
far from pleasant.  "Gifford has changed," she said
petulantly. "He is so polite to me," she complained
to Helen; not that Gifford had ever been rude, but
he had been brotherly.</p>
<p>He once asked her for a rose from a bunch she had fastened in her idress. "Why don't you pick
one yourself, Giff?" she said simply; and afterwards,
with a sparkle of indignant tears in her eyes and
with a quick impatience which made her an amusing
copy of her father, she siad to Helen, "I suppose he meant to treat me
as though I was some fine young lady.  
Why can't he be just the old Giff?" And
when he cam back from Europe, she declared he was still worse.</p>
Yet even their estrangement they united in devotion
to Helen. It was to Helen they appealed
in all their differences, which were many, and her
judgment was final;  Lois never doubted it, even
though Helen generally thought Gifford was in the
right. So now, when her cousin had left her, she
at least sure of the young man's sympathy.</p>
<pb n="18 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>She was glad that he was going to practice in
Lockhaven; he would be near Helen, and make the
new place less lonely for her, she said, once. And
Helen had smiled, as though she could be lonely
where John was!</p>
<p>They walked now between the borders, where old-
fashioned flowers crowded together, towards the
stone bench. This was a slab of sandstone, worn
and flaked by weather, and set on two low posts;
it leaned a little against the trunk of a silver-poplar
tree, which served for a back, and it looked like an
altar ready for the sacrifice. The thick blossoming
grass, which the mower's scythe had been unable to
reach, grew high about the corners; three or four
stone steps led up to it, but they had been laid so
long ago they were sunken at one side or the other,
and almost hidden by moss and wild violets. Quite
close to the bench a spring bubbled out of the hillside, and ran singing through a hollowed locust log,
which was mossy green where the water had over
flowed, with a musical drip, upon the grass underneath.</p>
<p>They stood a moment looking towards the west,
where a golden dust seemed blown across the sky,
up into the darkness; then Lois took her seat upon
the bench. "When do you think you will get off,
Giff?" she said.</p>
"I'm not quite sure," he answered; he was sit.
ting on one of the lower steps, and leaning on his
elbow in the grass, so that he might see her face.
"I suppose it will take a fortnight to arrange
everything."</p>
<pb n="19 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>              
<p>"I'm sorry for that," Lois said, disappointedly.
"I thought you would go in a few days."</p>
<p>Gifford was silent, and began to pick three long
stems of grass and braid them together. Lois sat
absently twisting the fringe on one end of the soft
scarf of yellow crepe, which was knotted across her
bosom, and fell almost to the hem of her white
dress.</p>
"I mean," she said, "I'm sorry Helen won't
have you in Lockhaven.    Of course Ashurst will miss you. Oh, dear! how horrid it will be not to
have Helen here!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Gifford sympathetically, "you'll be
awfully lonely."</p>
<p>They were silent for a little while. Some white
phlox in the girl's bosom glimmered faintly, and its
heavy fragrance stole out upon the warm air. She
pulled off a cluster of the star-like blossoms, and
held them absently against her lips.  "You don't
seem at all to get away from Ashurst, Giff" she said.  Oh, If I had been you, I should have
gone to Lockhaven a month ago; everything is so
sleepy here. Oh, if I were a man, would n't I just go out into the world!"</p>
"Well, Lockhaven can scarcely be called the
world," Gifford answered in his slow way.</p>
"But I should think you would want to go because it will be such a pleasure to Helen to have you
there," she said.</p>
<p>Gifford smiled; he had twisted his braid of grass
into a ring, ana had pushed it on the smallest of
his big fingers, and was turning it thoughtfully
<pb n="20 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
about. "I don't believe," he said, "that it will
make the slightest difference to Helen whether I am
there or not. She has Mr.Ward."</p>
<p>"Oh," Lois said, "I hardly think even Mr.Ward
can take the place of father, and the rectory, and
me. I know it will make Helen happier to have
somebody from home near her."</p>
<p>"No," the young man said, with a quiet persist-
ence, " it won't make the slightest difference, Lois.
She '11 have the person she loves best in the world;
and with the person one loves best one could be con-
tent in the desert of Sahara."</p>
<p>"You seem to have a very high opinion of John
Ward," Lois said, a thread of anger in her voice.</p>
<p>"I have," said Gifford; "but that is n't what
I mean. It's love, not John Ward, which means
content. But you don't have a very high opinion of
him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I have," Lois said quickly; "only he
is n't good enough for Helen. I supppse, though,
I'd say that of anybody. And he irritates me, he
is so different from other people. I don't think I
do--adore him!"</p>
<p>Gifford did not speak; he took another strand of
grass, and began to weave it round and round his
little ring, to make it smaller.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I ought not to say that," she added;
"of course I would n't to any one but you."
"You ought not to say it to me, Lois," he said.
"Why ? Is n't it true ?" she said. "I don't think
it is wrong to say he's different; it's certainly true!"
Gifford was silent. "Do you?" she demanded.</p>
<pb n="21 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Yes," Gifford answered quietly; "and somehow it does n't seem fair, don't you know, to say
anything about them, they are so happy; it seems
as though we ought not even to speak of them."</p>
<p>Lois was divided between indignation at being
found fault with and admiration for the sentiment.
"Well," she said, rather meekly for her, "I won't
say anything more; no doubt I '11 like him when
I know him better."</p>
<p>"See if that fits your finger, Lois," her companion said, sitting up, and handing her the little
grass ring. She took it, smiling, and tried it on.
Gifford watched her with an intentness which made
him frown; her bending head was like a shadowy
silhouette against the pale sky, and the little curls
caught the light in soft mist around her forehead.</p>
<p>"But I 'm glad for my own part, then," she went
on, "to think of you with Helen. You must tell
me everything about her and about her life, when
you write; she won't do it herself."</p>
<p>"I will," he answered, " if you let me write to
you."</p>
<p>Lois opened her eyes with surprise; here was this
annoying formality again, which Gifford's fault-finding seemed to have banished. "Let you write?"
she said impatiently. "Why, you know I depended
on your writing, Giff, and you must tell me every-
thing you can Ahink of. What's the good of having
a friend in Lockhaven, if you don't?"</p>
<p>She had clasped her hands lightly on her knees,
and tas leaning forward a little, looking at him; for
he had turned away from her, and was pulling at a
<pb n="22 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
bunch of violets. "I tell you what it is, Lois," he
said; "I cannot go away, and write to you, and
not--and not tell you. I suppose I'm a fool to tell
you, but I can't help it."</p>
<p>"Tell me what?" Lois asked, bewildered.
"Oh," Gifford burst out, rising, and standing
beside her, his big figure looming up in the dark-
ness," it's this talk of friendship, Lois, that I cannot stand. You see, I love you."</p>
<p>There was silence for one long moment. It was
so still they could hear the bubbling of the spring,
like a soft voice, complaining in the darkness. Then
Lois said, under her breath, "Oh, Gifford!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," he went on, desperately. "I know
you've never thought of such a thing; somehow, I
could not seem to make you see it,--you would n't
see it; but I do love you, and--and, Lois--if you
could care, just a little? I've loved you so long."</p>
<p>Lois shrank back against the silver-poplar tree,
and put her hands up to her face. In a moment
tenderness made the young man forget his anxiety.
"Did I startle you?" he said, sitting down beside
her; but he did not take her hand, as he might have
done in their old frank friendship. "I'm so sorry,
but I could n't help telling you. I know you've
been unconscious of it, but how could a fellow help
loving you, Lois?  And I could n't go away to
Lockhaven and not know if there was any chance
for me. Can you care, a--little?"</p>
<p>She did not speak until he said again, his voice
trembling with a sudden hope, "Won't you say
nme word, Lois?"</p>
<pb n="23 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Why, Giff," she said, sitting up very straight,
and looking at him, her wet eyes shining in the darkness, "you know I
care--I've always cared, but not that way--and--and--you don't, Giff,
you don't really--it's just a fancy."</p>
<p>"It is not a fancy," he answered quietly. "I
knew I loved you that first time I came home from
college.  But you were too young; it would not
have been right. And then before I went abroad, I
tried to tell you once; but I thought from the way
you spoke you did not care. So I did n't say anything more; but I love you, and I always shall."</p>
<p>"Oh, Gifford," Lois cried, with a voice full of distress, "you <hi
rend="italic">must n't!</hi> Why, don't you see ? You're just like my brother. Oh, do please let us forget all
this, and let's be just as we used to be."</p>
<p>"We cannot," he said gently.   "But I won't
make you unhappy; I won't speak if you tell me to
be' silent."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I do tell you to be silent," she said, in a
relieved tone. "I--could not, Giff. So we'11 just
forget it. Promise me you will forget it?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, with a slow smile. "You
must fort it, if it will make you any happier;
but yot cannot ask'me to forget. I am happier to
remember. I shall always love you, Lois."</p>
<p>"But you must n't!" she cried again. " Why can't
we have just the old friendship? Indeed--indeed,
it never could be anything else; and," with a sudden
break of tenderness in her voice, "I--I really am
so fond of you, Giff!"</p>
<p>Here the young man smiled a little bitterly.
<pb n="24 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
Friendship separated them as inexorably as though
it had been hate!</p>
<p>"And," the girl went on, gaining confidence as
she spoke, for argument cleared the air of sentiment,
in which she felt as awkward as she was unkind,
"and you know there are a good many things you
don't like in me; you think I have lots of faults,--you know you do."</p>
<p>"I suppose I do, in a way," he acknowledged;
"but if I did n't love you so much, Lois, I would
not notice them."</p>
<p>Lois held her head a little higher, but did not
speak. He watched her twist her fingers nervously
together; she had forgotten to take off the little
ring of braided grass.</p>
<p>"I m so sorry, Giff," she said, to break the silence,--"oh, so sorry. I--I can't forgive myself."</p>
<p>"There is nothing to forgive," he answered gently; "and you must not distress yourself by thinking that I am unhappy. I am better, Lois, yes, and 
happier, because I love you. It shall be an inspiration to me all my life, even if you should forget all
about me. But I want you to make me one promise,
will you?"</p>
<p>She hesitated. "If I can, Giff;" and then, with
sudden trustfulness, she added, "Yes, I will. What
is it?"</p>
<p>She had risen, and was standing on the step above
him. He looked at her nervous little hands a moment, but did not touch them, and then he said,
"If the time ever comes when you can love me, tell
<pb n="25 JOHN WARD, PREACBER"/>           
me so. I ask you this, Lois, because I cannot bear
to distress you again by speaking words of love you do not to hear, and yet I can't help hoping;
and I shall always love you, but it shall be in silence.
So if the day ever does come when you can love me,
promise to tell me."</p>
"Oh, yes," she siad,  glad to grapt something.
"But, Gifford, dear, it will never come; I must say that now."</p>
<p>"But you promise?"<p>
<p>"Yes", she answered, soberly. "I promise."
<p>He looked at her steadily a moment. "God bless
you, dear," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, Gifford!" cried the girl, and with a sudden
impulse stopped and kissed his forehead; then,
half frightened at what she had done, but not yet 
regretting it, she brushed past him, and went swiftly
up the path to the rectory.</p>
<p>The young man stood quite still a moment, with
reverent head bent as though he had received a benediction
and then turned and followed her.</p>
<pb n="26 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
CHAPTER III.
<p>LOIS HOWE'S mind was in a strange tumult that
night; the subtile thrill, which is neither pain nor
pride, and yet seems both, with which a young
woman hears for the first time that she is loved,
stung through all her consciousness of grief at having wounded her old friend. Tears came into her
eyes once, and yet she did not know why; perhaps
it was anger. How could Gifford have been so foolish
as to talk that way, and make her have to say what
she did? The old friendship was what she wanted.
And then more tears came; and for the first time
in her simple girlish life, Lois could not understand
her own heart.</p>
<p>It was because Helen had gone away, she said to
herself, and she was tired; and that gave her the
right to cry with all her heart, which was a great
relief.</p>
<p>But Lois was young. The next morning, when
she gushed back her windows, she felt joy bubble
up in her soul as unrestrainedly as though she
had never said a word to Gifford which could make
his heart ache. The resistance and spring of the
climbing roses made her lean out to fasten her lattices back, and a shower of dew sprinkled her hair
and bosom; and at the sudden clear song of the
robin under the eaves, she stood breathless a mo-
<pb n="27 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
-ment to listen, with that simple gladness of living
which is perhaps a supreme unselfishness in its entire unconsciousness
of individual joy.</p>
<p>But like the rest of the world, Lois found that
euch moments do not last; the remembrance of the
night before forced itself upon her, and she turned
to go down-stairs, with a troubled face.</p>
Of course there is plenty to do the day after a wedding, and Lois was glad to have the occupation;
it was a relief to be busy.</p>
<p>Ashurst ladies always washed the breakfast things
themselves; no length of service made it seem proper
to trust the old blue china and the delicate glass to
the servants. So Lois wiped her cups and saucers,
and then, standing on a chair in the china-closet, put
the dessert plates with the fine gilt pattern borders,
which had been used yesterday, on the very back the top shelf, in such
a quick, decided way Jean trembled for their safety.</p>
<p>The rectory dining-room was low-studded, and lighted by one wide
latticed window which had a cushioned seat, with a full valance of flowered chintz;
the dimity curtains were always pushed back, for
Dr.Howe wass fond of sunshine. In the open fireplace,
between the brasses, stood a blue jug filled
with white lilacs, and the big punch-bowl on the
sideboard was crowded with roses. There were antlers over the doors, and the pictures on the walls
were of game and fish, and on the floor was a bearskin,
which was one of the rector's trophies.</p>
<p>Lois stood by a side-table which held a great pan
of hot water; she had a long-handled mop in her
<pb n="28 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
hand and a soft towel over her arm, and she washed
and wiped some wine-glasses with slender twisted
stems and sparkling bowls, and then put them on
their shelves in the corner closet, where they gleamed
and glittered in the sunshine, pouring through the
open window.</p>
<p>She did not work as fast now, for things were
nearly in order, and she dreaded having nothing to
do; her aunt, Mrs. Dale, would have said she was
dawdling, but Miss Deborah Woodhouse, who had
come over to the rectory early to see if she could
be of use, said haste was not genteel, and it was a
pleasure to see a young person who was deliberate
in her movements.</p>
<p>"But you must let me help you, my dear," she
added, taking off her gloves, and pulling the fingers
straight and smooth.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Miss Deborah, there is nothing more to
do," Lois answered, smiling, as she closed the brass-
hinged doors of the corner closet.</p>
<p>"Dear me!" said the other absently, "I do trust
dear Gifford's china-closet will be kept in proper
order. Your shelves do credit to Jean's housekeep-
ing; indeed they do! And I hope he'11 have a maid
who knows how to put the lavender among the linen;
there's always a right and a wrong way. I have
written out directions for her, of course, but if
there was time I would write and ask Helen to see
to it."</p>
<p>"Why, Giff says he won't get off for a fort-
night," Lois said, with sudden surprise.</p>
<p>"I thought so," responded Miss Deborah, shaking
<pb n="29 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
her head,  so that the little gray curls just above her
ears trembled,--"I thought so, too; but last night
he said he was going at once. At least," stopping
to correet herself, "dear Ruth and I think it best
him to go. I have everything ready for him, so
doubt he'11 get off tomorrow."</p>
<p>Lois was silent.</p>
"The fact is," said Miss Deborah, lowering her
I, "Gifford does not seem perfectly happy. Of
course you would n't be apt to observe it; but those
things don't escape my eyes. He's been depressed
for some time."</p>
<p>"I had n't noticed it," said Lois faintly.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, certainly not," answered Miss Deborah;
"it would be scarcely proper that you should, considering the reason: but it's no surprise to me. I
always thought that when they grew old enough, dear Giff and Helen would care for one another;
and so I don't, wonder that he has been feeling some
disapointment since he eame home, though I had
written him she was engaged--Much too young
she was, too, in my judgment."</p>
<p>Lois's astonishment was so great that she dropped
her mop, and Miss Deborah looked at her reprovingly over her glasses. "Oh, yes, there's no doubt
Gifford felt it," she said, "but he'11 get over it. Those things do not last with men. You know I
would n't speak of this to any one but you, but he's
just like a brother to you."</p>
<p>"Yes, exactly like a brother," Lois said hurziedly," and I think I should have known it if it
had been--had been that way."</p>
<pb n="30 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>         .
<p>"No," said Miss Deborah, putting down the last
glass, "I think not.  I only guessed it myself last
night; it is all over now; those things never last.
And very likely he'11 meet some nice girl in Lockhaven who will make him happy; indeed, I should n't
wonder if we heard he was taken with somebody at
once; hearts are often caught on the rebound! I
don't know," Miss Deborah added candidly, "how
lasting an attachment formed on a previous disappointment might be; and dear me! he does feel her
marriage very much."</p>
<p>Here Sally came in to take away the pan and
mop, and Lois looked about to see if there was anything more to do. She was very anxious to bring
Miss Deborah's conversation to an end, and grateful
that Jean should come and ask her to take some
silver, borrowed for yesterday's festivities, back to
Mrs. Dale.</p>
<p>"It's these spoons," the old woman explained to
Miss Deborah. "Mrs. Dale, she lent us a dozen.  I've counted 'em all myself; I would n't trust 'em to
that Sally. If there was a hair's difference, Mrs.
Dale would know it 'fore she set eyes on them, let
alone havin' one of our spoons 'stead of hers."</p>
<p>Miss Deborah nodded her head. "Very likely,
Jean," she said; "I've not a doubt of it. I'm going now, and Miss Lois will walk along with me.
Yes, Mrs. Dale would see if anything was wrong,
you can depend upon it."</p>
<p>They set out together, Lois listening absently to
Miss Deborah's chatter about the wedding, and
vaguely glad when, at the gate of her aunt's house,
<pb n="31 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
she could leave her, with a pretty bow, which was half a courtesy.</p>
<p>There was a depressing stateliness about Dale
house, which was felt as soon as the stone gateway,
with its frowning sphinxes, was passed. The long
shutters on either side of the front door were always solemnly bowed,
for Mrs. Dale did not approve of faded carpets, and the roof of the veranda, supported by great white pillars, darkened the second-story windows. There was no tangle of vines about
its blank walls of cream-colored brick with white 
trimmings, nor even trees to soften the stare with
which it surveyed the dusty highway; and the formal precision of the place was unrelieved by flowers,
except for a stiff design in foliage plants on the perfectly kept lawn.</p>
<p>On the eastern side of the house, about the deep
windows of Mr. Dale's sanctum, ivy had been permitted to grow, and there were a few larch and beech
trees, and a hedge to hide the stables; but these
were special concessions to Mr. Dale.</p>
<p>"I do dislike," said Mrs. Dale,--"I do dislike untidy gardens; flowers, and vines, and trees, all
crowded together, and weeds too, if the truth's told.  I never could understand how the Woodhouse girls
could endure that forlorn old place of theirs. But
then, a woman never does make a really good manager unless she's married."</p>
<p>Lois found her aunt in the long parlor, playing
Patience. She was sitting in a straight-backed chair,--for Mrs. Dale scorned the weakness of a rocking-
chair,--before a spindle-legged table, covered with
<pb n="32 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>         
green baize and with a cherry-wood rim inlaid with
mother-of-pearl and ivory.  On it were thirteen
groups of cards, arranged with geometrical exactness
at intervals of half an inch.</p>
<p>"Well, Lois," she said, as her niece entered.
"Oh, you have brought the spoons back?" But she
interrupted herself, her eyebrows knitted and her
lower lip thrust out, to lift a card slowly, and decide
if she should move it. Then she glanced at the girl
Over her glasses. "I'm just waiting here because I
must go into the kitchen soon, and look at my cake.
That Betty of mine must needs go and see her sick
mother to-day, and I have to look after things. But
I cannot be idle. I declare, there is something mali-
cious in the way in which the relatives of servants
fall ill!"</p>
<p>She stopped here long enough to count the spoons,
and then began her game again. She was able, however, to talk while
she played, and pointed out various things which did not "go quite
right" at the wedding.</p>
<p>The parlor at Dale house was as exact and dreary
as the garden. The whole room suggested to Lois,
watching her aunt play solitaire, and the motes
dancing in the narrow streaks of sunshine which
fell between the bowed shutters, and across the drab
carpet to the white wainscoting on the other side,
the pictures in the Harry and Lucy books, or the
parlor where, on its high mantel shelf, Rosamond
kept her purple jar.</p>
<p>She wondered vaguely, as Mrs. Dale moved her
cards carefully about, whether her aunt had ever
<pb n="33 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
been "bothered" about anything.  Helen's marriage seemed only an incident to Mrs. Dale; the
Vdding and the weather, the dresses and the presents, which had been a breathless interest to Lois,
were apparently of no more importance to the older
woman than the building up a suit.</p>
<p>"Well," Mrs. Dale said, when she had exhausted
the subject of the wedding, "I'm sure I hope it
turn out well, but I really can't say. Ever
since I've seen this Mr.Ward I've somehow felt
than it was an experiment. In the first place, he's
it of weak will,--I'm sure of that, because he
perfectly ready to give way to Helen in everything; and that is n't as it ought to be,--the man
should rule! And then, besides that, whoever heard 
of his people? Came from the South somewhere, I
believe, but he could n't tell me the first name of his
great-grandfather. I doubt if he ever had any, between ourselves.
Still, I hope for the best. And
I'm sure I trust," she added, with an uneasy recollection. "she won't have
trouble with servants.  I declare, the happiness of married life is in
the hands of your cook. If Betty
had not gone off this morning, I should have come
over to the rectory to help you. There's so much
to do after a wedding."</p>
"Oh, you're very kind," said Lois, "but I think
Jean and I can see to things. Miss Deborah came
to help me, but we were really quite in order."</p>
<p>"Miss Deborah! said Mrs. Dale. "Well, I'm
if she could be of any use; she really is so unpractical.  But it's
lucky you have Jean. Just 
<pb n="34 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
wait till you get a house of your own, young lady,
and then you'll understand what the troubles of
housekeeping are."</p>
<p>"I'm in no haste for a house of my own," said
the girl, smiling.</p>
<p>"That's because you're a foolish child," returned
Mrs. Dale promptly. "You'd be a great deal happier if you were married and settled. Though I
must say there is very little chance of it, unless you
go away to make a visit, as Helen did. There is
only one young man ini Ashurst; and now he's
going. But for that matter, Gifford Woodhouse
and you are just like brother and sister. Yes, Lois,
I must say, I wish I could see you in a home of
your own. No woman is really happy unless she 's
married."</p>
<p>"I think I'm the best judge of that," Lois an-
swered. "No girl could be happier than I am; to
hear father call me his--Tyrant?  I don't wants
anything better than that."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Dale decidedly. "If you
had a husband to call you <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Tyrant, it would be a
thousand times better. I declare, I always think,
when we pray for 'all who are destitute and oppressed,' it means the old maids. I'm sure the
'fatherless children and widows' are thought of,
and why not the poor, forlorn, unmarried women?
Indeed, I think Archibald is almost selfish to keep
you at home as he does. My girls would never have
been settled if I had let them stay in Ashurst. I've
a great mind to tell your father he is n't doing his
duty. You ought to have a winter in town."</p>
<pb n="35 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Indeed, I hope you won't tell him anything of
the sort!" cried Lois. "I would n't leave Ashurst
for the world, and I'm perfectly happy, I assure
you!"</p>
<p>"Don't be so silly," said Mrs. Dale calmly, "or
think that no one loves your father but yourself.  He was my brother for thirty-four years before he
was your father. I only spoke for your good, and
his too, for of course he would be happier if you
were."</p>
<p>She stopped here to gather her cards up, and deal
them out again in little piles, and also to reprove
Lois, who had made an impatient gesture at her
words.</p>
<p>"These little restless ways you have are very
unpleasant," she said; "my girls never did such things. I don't know where you get your unlady-
like habits; not from your father, I'm sure. I suppose it's because you don't go out at all; you never
see anybody. There, that reminds me. I have had
a letter from Arabella Forsythe. I don't know
whether you remember the Forsythes; they used to
visit here; let me see, fifteen years ago was the last
time, I think. Well, they are going to take the empty
house near us for the summer. She was a Robinson;
not really Ashurst people, you know, not born here,
but quite respectable. Her father was a button
manufacturer, and he left her a great deal of money.
She married a person called Forsythe, who has since
died. She has one boy, about your age, who '11 be
immensely rich one of these days; he is not married. Heaven knows when Ashurst will see an
<pb n="36 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
eligible young man again," she added; and then,
absently, "Eight on a nine, and there's a two-spot
for my clubs!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if I remember Mrs. Forsythe? "Lois
said, wrinkling her pretty forehead in a puzzled
way. "Was n't she a tall, thin lady, with a pleasant face?"</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Dale, nodding her sleek
head, "yes, <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> pleasant, but melancholy. And
no wonder, talking about her aches and pains all the
time! But that 's where the button manufacturer
showed. She was devoted to that boy of hers, and
a very nice child he was, too."  She looked sharply
at her niece as she spoke.</p>
<p>"I remember him," Lois said. "I saw Gifford
shake him once; 'he was too little to lick,' he said."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid Gifford is very rough and unmannerly sometimes," Mrs. Dale said. "But then, those
Woodhouse girls could n't be expected to know how
to bring up a big boy."</p>
<p>"I don't think Giff is unmannerly," cried Lois.</p>
<p>"Well, not exactly," Mrs. Dale admitted; "but
of course he is n't like Mr. Forsythe. Gifford
has n't had the opportunities, or the money, you
know."</p>
<p>"I don't think money is of much importance,"
said Lois. "I don't think money has anything to
do with manners."</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't know anything about it!" cried
Mrs. Dale. "There! you made me make a mistake, and lose my game. Pray do not be silly, Lois,
and talk in that emphatic way; have a little more
<pb n="37 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
repose. I mean this young man is--he is very different from
anybody you have ever seen in Ashurst.
But there is no use trying to tell you anything; you
always keep your own opinion. You are exactly like
a bag of feathers. You punch it and think you've, made an impression,
and it comes out just where it went in."</p>
<p>Lois laughed, and rose to go.</p>
<p>"Tell your father what I said about a winter in
town," Mrs.Dale called after her; and then, gathering
her cards up, and rapping them on the table to
get the edges straight, she said to herself, "But
perhaps it won't be necessary to have a winter in
town!" And there was a grim sort of smile on her
face when, a moment later, Mr.Dale, in a hesitating
way, pushed the door open, and entered.</p>
He wore his flowered cashmere dressing-gown, tied about the waist
with a heavy silk handkerchief was spread over his white hair to
protect his head from possible draughts in the long hall.  Just now
one finger was between the pages of "A Sentimental Journey."</p>
<p>"She was here," said Mrs. Dale, still smiling.
"I was telling her the Forsythes were coming. It
is an excellent thing; nothing could be better."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Dale.</p>
"Mean" his wife. " What should I be apt
to mean? You have no sense about such things, Henry."
<pb n="38 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
"Oh," said her husband meekly, "you want
them to fall in love?"</p>
<p>"Well, really," she answered, leaning back in
her chair, and tapping her foot impatiently, "I do
not see how my husband can be so silly. One would
think I was a matchmaker, and no one detests anything of that sort as I do,--no one! Fall in love,
indeed! I think the expression is positively indelicate, Henry. Of course, if Lois should be well
married, I should be grateful; and if it should be
Mr.Forsythe, I should only feel I had done my
duty in urging Arabella to take a house in Ashurst."</p>
<p>"Oh, you urged her?"</p>
<p>"I wrote her Ashurst was very pleasant," Mrs.
Dale acknowledged," and it was considered healthy.
(I understand Arabella!) I knew her son was going abroad later in the summer, but I thought, if he
once got here"--</p>
<p>"Ah," responded Mr. Dale.</p>

CHAPTER IV.
JOHN and Helen had not gone at once to Lockhaven; they spent a fortnight in wandering about
through the mountains on horseback. The sweet
June weather, the crystal freshness of the air, and
the melodious stillness of the woods and fields
wrapped those first heavenly days of entire possession in a mist of
joy. Afterwards, John Ward felt that it had blinded the eyes of his soul, and drifted
between him and his highest duty; he had not been
able to turn away from the gladness of living in her presence to
think of what had been, during all their engagement, an anxiety and
grief, and, he had promised himself, should be his earliest thought
when she became his wife:--the unsaved condition of her soul.</p>
<p>When he had first seen her, before he knew he
loved her, he had realized with distress and terror
how far she was from what he called truth; how indifferent to what was the most important thing in
the whole world to him,--spiritual knowledge. He
listened to what she said of her uncle's little Episcpal church in Ashurst, and heard her laugh good-naturedly about the rector's sermons, and then
thought of the doctrines which were preached from his own pulpit in Lockhaven.</p> 
<p>Helen had never listened to sermons full of the
<pb n="40 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
hopelessness of predestination; she frankly said she
did not believe that Adam was her federal head and
representative, and that she, therefore, was born in
sin. "I'm a sinner," she said, smiling; "we're
all miserable sinners, you know, Mr.Ward, and
perhaps we all sin in original ways; but I don't
believe in original sin."</p>
<p>When he spoke of eternal punishment, she looked
at him with grave surprise in her calm brown eyes.
"How can you think such a thing ?" she asked.
"It seems to me a libel upon the goodness of God."</p>
<p>"But justice, Miss Jeffrey,"--he said anxiously;
"surely we must acknowledge the righteousness and
justice of God's judgments."</p>
<p>"If you mean that God would send a soul to hell
forever, if you call that his judgment, it seems to
me unrighteous and unjust. Truly, I can think of
no greater heresy, Mr.Ward, than to deny the love
of God; and is not that what you do when you say
he is more cruel than even men could be?"</p>
<p>"But the Bible says" - he began, when she interrupted him.</p>
<p>"It does not seem worth while to say, 'the Bible
says,'" she said, smiling a little as she looked into
his troubled face. "The Bible was the history, and
poetry, and politics of the Jews, as well as their code
of ethics and their liturgy; so that, unless we are
prepared to believe in its verbal inspiration, I don't
see how we can say, as an argument, 'the Bible
says.'"</p>
<p>"And you do not believe in its verbal inspiration?" he said slowly.</p>
<pb n="41 JOHN WARD, PREACEHER"/>
<p>"No," Helen answered, "I could not."</p>
<p>It was not for John Ward to ask how she had
been taught, or to criticise another minister's influence, but as he walked home, with anxious, downcast
eyes, he wondered what Dr. Howe's belief could be,
and how it had been possible for her soul to have
been so neglected.  This woman, whose gracious,
teiautiful nature stirred him with profound admiration, was in the darkness of unbelief; she had never
taught the truth.</p>
<p>As he said this to himself, John Ward knew, with
sudden, passionate tenderness, that he loved her.
Yet it was months before he came and told her.
What rught had he to love her? he said to himself,
when he knelt and prayed for her soul's salvation:
she was an unbeliever; she had never come to Christ,
she would have known the truth. His duty to
his people confronted him with its uncompromising
claim that the woman whom he should bring to help him in his labors
among them should be a Christian, and struggles to tear this love out
of his heart.</p>
<p>John Ward's was an intellect which could not hold a belief subject
to the mutations of time or circumtances.  Once acknowledged by his
soul, its growth was ended; it ahrdened into a creed, in which he
rested in complete satisfaction.  It was not that he did not desire
more light; it was simply that he could not conceive that there might
be more light.  And granting his premise that the Bible was directly
inspired by God, he was not illogical in holding with a pathetic and
patient faith to the doctrines of the Presbyterian Church.</p>
<pb n="42 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>Helen's belief was as different as was her mode
of thought. It was perhaps a development of her
own nature, rather than the result of her uncle's
teaching, though she had been guided by him spiritually ever since he had taken her to his own home,
on the death of her parents, when she was a little
child. "Be a good girl, my dear," Dr. Howe would
say. So she learned her catechism, and was con-
firmed just before she went to boarding-school, as
was the custom, with Ashurst young women, and
sung in the choir, while Mr.Denner drew wonderful chords from the organ, and she was a very well-
bred and modest young woman, taking her belief
for granted, and giving no more thought to the problems of theology than girls usually do.</p>
<p>But this was before she met John Ward. After
those first anxious questions of his, Helen began to
understand how slight was her hold upon religion.
But she did not talk about her frame of mind, nor
dignify the questions which began to come by calling them doubts; how could they be doubts, when
she had never known what she had believed? So,
by degrees, she built up a belief for herself.<p>
<p>Love of good was really love of God, in her mind.
Heaven meant righteousness, and hell an absence
from what was best and truest; but Helen did not
feel that a soul must wait for death before it was
overtaken by hell. It was very simple and very
short, this creed of hers; yet it was the doorway
through which grief and patience were to come,--
the sorrow of the world, the mystery of sin, and the
hope of that far-off divine event.</p>
<pb n="43 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>There was no detail of religious thought with
Heln Jeffrey; ideas presented themselves to her
mind with a comprehensiveness and simplicity which
woul have been impossible to Mr. Ward. But at
this time he knew nothing of the mental processes
that were leading her out of the calm, unreasoning
content of childhood into a mist of doubt, which,
as she looked into the future, seemed to darken into
night. He was struggling with his conscience, and asking himself if he had any right to seek her love.</p>
<p>"Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers," he said to himself. To his mind, Helen's
lack of belief in certain doctrines--for it had
hardly crystallized into unbelief--was sin; and sin
was punishable by eternal death. Here was his
escape from conscience. Should this sweet soul,
that he loved more than his own, be lost?  No;
surely, it was a sacred right and duty to win her
heart and marry her, that he might take her away
from the atmosphere of religious indifference in
which she lived, and guide her to light and life.</p>
<p>Love won the day. "I will save her soul" he
said to himself; and with this purpose always before
him to hide a shadow, which whispered,--so he
thought,--" This is a sin," he asked her to be his
wife.</p>
<p>He did not have to plead long. "I think I have
always loved you," Helen said, looking up into his
eyes; and John was so happy that every thought
of anxiety for her soul was swallowed up in gratitude to God for her love.</p>
<p>It was one midsummer afternoon that he reached
<pb n="44 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
Ashurst; he went at once to the rectory, though
with no thought of asking Dr. Howe's permission to
address his niece. It seemed to John as thdtgh
there were only their two souls in the great sunny
world that day, and his love-making was as simple
and candid as his life.</p>
<p>"I've come to tell you I love you," he said, with
no preface, except to take her hands in his.</p>
<p>He did not see her often during their engagement,
nor did he write her of his fears and hopes for her;
he would wait until she was quite away from
Ashurst carelessness, he thought; and beside, his
letters were so full of love, there was no room for
theology. But he justified silence by saying when
they were in their own home he would show her the
beauty of revealed religion; she should understand
the majesty of the truth; and their little house,
which was to be sacred as the shrine of human love, should become the very gate of heaven.</p>
<p>It was a very little house, this parsonage. Its
sharp pitch roof was pulled well down over its eyes,
which were four square, shining windows, divided
into twenty-four small panes of glass, so full of
bubbles and dimples that they made the passer-by
seem sadly distorted, and the spire of the church
opposite have a strange bend in it.</p>
<p>John Ward's study had not a great many books.
He could not afford them, for one reason; but, with
a row of Edwards, and some of Dr. Samuel Hopkins'
sermons, and pamphlets by Dr.Emmons, he could
spare all but one or two volumes of Hodge and
Shedd, who, after all, but reiterate, in a form suited
<pb n="45 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
to a weaker age, the teachings of Dr.Jonathan
Edwards.</p>
<p>The dim Turkey carpet was worn down to the
nap in a little path in front of his book-shelves,
where he used to stand absorbed in reading, or where
he walked back and forth, thinking out his dark and
threatening sermons For before his marriage John
preached the law rather than the gospel.</p>
<p>"So I am going to hear you preach on Sunday?"
Helen said, the Saturday morning after their return. "It's odd that I've never heard you, and we
have known each other more than a year."</p>
<p>He was at his desk, and she rested her hand
lightly on his shoulder. He put down his pen, and
turned to look up into her face. "Perhaps you will
not like my sermons;" there was a little wistfulness
in his dark eyes as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I shall," she said, with smiling certainty. "Sermons are pretty much alike, don't you
think? I know some of uncle Archie's almost by
heart. Really, there is only one thing to say, and
you have to keep saying it over and over."</p>
<p>"We cannot say it too often," John answered.
"The choice between eternal life and eternal death
should sound in the ears of unconverted men every
day of their lives."</p>
<p>Helen shook her head.  "I didn't mean that,
John. I was thinking of the beauty of holiness."
And then she added, with a smile, "I hope you
don't preach any awful doctrines?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes the truth is terrible, dear," he said
gently.</p>
<pb n="46 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
But when she had left him to write his sermon,
he sat a long while thinking. Surely she was not
ready yet to hear such words as he had meant to
speak.  He would put this sermon away for some
future Sunday, when the truth would be less of as
shock to her. "She must come to the knowledge of
God slowly," he thought. "It must not burst upon her; it might only drive her further from the light
to hear of justice as well as mercy.  She is not
able to bear it yet."</p>
<p>So he took some fresh paper, and wrote, instead of
his lurid text from Hebrews, "Ye shall be my sons
and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."</p>
<p>"But when Helen went out of the study, she thought
very little of sermons or doctrines. John filled her
mind, and she had no room for wondering about his
beliefs; he could believe anything he chose; he was
hers,--that was enough.</p>
<p>She went into her small kitchen, the smile still
lingering upon her lips, and through its open door-way saw her little maid, Alfaretta, out in the sunny
garden at the back of the house. She had armful of fresh white tea-towels, which had been put out
to dry on the row of gooseberry bushes at the end
of the garden, and was coming up the path, singing
cheerily, with all the force of her strong young
lungs. Helen caught the wrds as she drew near:-</p>
<p>"My thoughts on awful subjets roll,
Damnation and the dead.
What horrs  e the guilty  soul,
Upon the dying bed!</p>

<p>"Where endless crowds of sinners lie,
And darkneass makes their chains,
<pb n="47 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
Tortured with keen despair they cry,
Yey wait for fiercer pains!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Alfaretta!" her mistreaa cried, in indignant astonishment.  "How
can you say such terrible words!"  Alfaretta stood still, in
open-mouthed amazement, an injured look in her good-natured blue
eyes. The incongruity of this rosey-faced, happy girl, standing in
the sunshine, with all the scents and sounds of a July day about her,
and singing in her cheerful voice these hopeless words, almost made
Helen smile; but she added gravely, "I hope you will not sing that
agian.  I do not like it."</p>  
<p>"But ma'am--but Mrs. Ward," said the girl, plainly hurt at the
reproof, "I was practicing.  I belong to the choir."</p>
<p>Alfaretta had dropped the tea-towel, hot with sunshine and
smelling of clover-blossoms, upon her well-scoured dresser, and then
turned and looked at her mistress reproachfully.  "I don't know what
I am going to do if I can't practice," she said.</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say you sing that in church?" cried Helen.
"Where do you go?"</p>
<p>"Why, I go to your church," said the still injured Alfaretta,--"to
Mr. Ward's.  We're to have that hymn on Sabbath"--</p>
<p>"Oh, there must be some mistake," remonstrated Helen.  "I'm sure
Mr.Ward did not notice that verse."</p>
<p>"But it's all like that; it says"--</p>
<p>"Don't tell me any more," Helen said.  "I've heard enough.  I had
no idea such awful words were written." Then she stopped abruptly,
feeling her
<pb n="48 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
position as the preacher's wife in a way of which
she had never thought.</p>
<p>Alfaretta's father was an elder in John's church,
which gave her a certain ease in speaking to her
mistress that did not mean the slightest disrespect.</p>
<p>"Is it the words of it you don't like?" said Alfa-
retta, rather relieved, since her singing had not been
criticised.</p>
<p>"Yes," Helen answered, "it is the words. Don't
you see how dreadful they are?"</p>
<p>Alfaretta stood with her plump red hands on her
hips, and regarded Mrs. Ward with interest. "I
had n't ever thought of 'em," she said. "Yes, ma'am.
I suppose they are awful bad," and swinging back
and forth on her heels, her eyes fixed meditatively
on the ceiling, she said,--</p>
<p>"'Then swift and dreadful she descends
Down to the fiery coast,
Amongst abominable fiends'--</p>
<p>Yes, that does sound dreadful. Worst of it is, you
get used to 'em, and don't notice 'em much. Why,
I've sung that hymn dozens of times in church,
and never thought of the meanin'. And there's
Tom Davis: he drinks most of the time, but he has
sung once or twice in the choir (though he ain't
been ever converted yet, and he is really terrible
wicked; don't do nothin' but swear and drink).
But I don't suppose he noticed the words of this
hymn,--though I know he sung it,--for he keeps
right on in his sin; and he could n't, you know, Mrs.
Ward, if that hymn was true to him."</p>
<p>Helen left Alfaretta to reflect upon the hymn, and
<pb n="49 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
went back to the study; but the door was shut, and
she heard the scratching of her husband's pen. She
turned away, for she had lived in a minister's household, and had been brought up to know that nothing must disturb a man who was writing a sermon.
But John had hurriedly opened the door.</p>
<p>"Did you want to speak to me, dearest?" he
said, standing at the foot of the stairs, his pen still
between his fingers. "I heard your step."</p>
<p>"But I must not interrupt you," she answered,
smiling at him over the balusters.</p>
<p>"You never could interrupt me. Come into the
study and tell me what it is."</p>
<p>"Only to ask you about a hymn which Alfaretta
says is to be sung on Sunday," Helen said. "Of
course there is some mistake about it, but Alfaretta
says the choir has been practicing it, and I know
you would not want it."</p>
<p>"Do you remember what it was, dear?"
"I can't quote it," Helen answered, "bitt it began
something about ' damnation and the dead.'"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know;" and then he added, slowly,
"Why don't you like it, Helen?"</p>
<p>She looked at him in astonishment. "Why, it's
absurd; it's horrible."</p>
<p>John was silent for a few moments, and then he
sighed: "We will not sing it, dear."</p>
<p>"But, John," she cried, "how could such a hymn
ever have been printed?  Of course I know people
used to think such things, but I had no idea anybody thought of hell in that literal way to-day, or
that hell itself was a real belief to very many people;
<pb n="50 JOHN WARD, PBEACHER"/>
however, I suppose, if such hymns are printed, the 
doctrine is still taught?"</p>
<p>"Yes," John said, "it is as real to-day as God
himself,--as it always has been and must be; and
it is believed by Christians as earnestly as ever. 
We cannot help it, Helen."</p>
<p>Helen looked at him thoughtfully. "It is very
terrible; but oh, John, what sublime faith, to be
able to believe God capable of such awful cruelty,
and yet to love and trust Him!"</p>
<p>John's face grew suddenly bright. "'Though He
slay me, yet will I trust Him,'" he said, with the
simplicity of assurance.  But when he went back
again to his sermon, he was convinced that he had
been wise to put off for a little while the instruction in dotrine of which his wife's soul stood insuch sore need.</p>
<p>"I was right," he thought; "the Light must come
gradually, the blaze of truth at once would blind
her to the perfection of justice. She would.,not be
able to understand there was mercy, too."</p>
<p>So the choir was told the hyma would be "Welcome, sweet day of
rest," which aftr all, was much
better suited to the sermon.</p>
<pb n="51 CHAPTER V"/>
<p>WHY the Misses Woodhouse, and Mr.Dale, and
Mr.Denuer should go to the rectory for their Saturday night games of whist was never very clear to any
of them. The rector did not understand the game, he
said, and it was perhaps to learn that he watched
every play so closely. Lois, of course, had no part
in it, for Mrs. Dale was always ready to take a
hand, if one of the usual four failed. Mrs.Dale
was too impatient to play whist from choice, but
she enjoyed the consciousness of doing a favor.</p>
<p>Lois's only occupation was to be useful. Ashurst
was strangely behind the times in thinking that it
was a privilege, as it ought to be a pleasure, for
young people to wait upon their elders and betters.</p>
<p>True, Mr. Denner, with old-fashioned politeness,
always offered his services when Lois went for the
wine and cake at lose of the rubber; but the little
gentleman would have been conscious of distinct sur-
prise had she accepted them, for Lois, in his eyes,
was still a little girl. This was perhaps because Mr.
Denner, at sixty-two, did not realize that he had
ceased to be, as he would have expressed it," a gentleman in middle life." He had no landmarks of
great emotions to show him how far the sleepy years
had carried him from his youth; and life in Ashurst
was very placid. There were no eases to try; prop--
<pb n="52 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>         
erty rarely went out of families which had held it
when Mr. Denner's father wrote their wills and drew
up their deeds in the same brick office which his
son occupied now, and it was a point of decency and
honor that wills should not be disputed.</p>
<p>Yet Mr.Denner felt that his life was full of occupation. He had his practicing in the dim organloft of St. Michael's and All Angels; and every day
when dinner was over, his little nephew slipped from
his chair, and stood with his hands behind him to
recite his rego regere; then there were always his
flies and rods to keep in order against the season
when he and the rector started on long fishing
tramps; and in the evenings, when Willie had gone
to bed, and his cook was reading "The Death Beds
of Eminent Saints" by the kitchen fire, Mr. Denner
worked out chess problems by himself in his library,
or read Cavendish and thought of next Saturday;
and besides all this, he went once a week to Mercer,
and sat waiting for clients in a dark back office,
while he studied his weekly paper.</p>
<p>But though there seemed plenty to do, sometimes
Mr. Denner would sigh, and say to himself that it
was somewhat lonely, and Mary was certainly severe.
He supposed that was because she had no mistress
to keep an eye on her.</p>
<p>hese weekly games of whist were a great pleasure
to him. The library at the rectory was cheerful,
and there was a feeling of importance in playing a
game at which the rector and Mrs.Dale only looked
on. It was understood that the gentlemen might
smoke, though the formality of asking permission of
<pb n="53 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
the ladies, and being urged by them, always took
place. Mr.Denner's weekly remark to the Misses
Woodhouse in this connection, as he stood ready to
strike a match on the hearth of the big fireplace, was
well known. "When ladies," he would say, bowing to
each sister in turn, with his little heels close together
and his toes turned well out,--"when ladies are so
charitable to our vices, we will not reform, lest we
lose the pleasure of being forgiven." Mr. Denner
smoked a cigar, but Mr. Dale always drew from
his pocket a quaint silver pipe, very long and slender, and with an odd suggestion of its owner about
it; for he was tall and frail, and his thin white hair,
combed back from his mild face, had a silvery gleam
in the lamplight. Often the pipe would be between
the pages of a book, from the leaves of which Lois
would have to shake the loose ashes before putting
it back in his pocket.</p>
<p>The whist party sat in high-backed chairs about a
square mahogany table, whose shining top betokened
much muscle on the part of Sally. At each corner was a candle in a tall silver candlestick, because Miss Deborah objected to a shadow on the
board, which would have been cast by a hanging
lamp. The August night was hot, and doors and
windows were open for any breath of air that might
be stirring in the dark garden. Max had retreated
to the empty fireplace, finding the bricks cooler than
the carpeted floor. All was very still, save when
the emphatic sweep of a trump card made the candle flames flicker. But the deals were a diversion.
Then the rector, who had tiptoed about, to look over
<pb n="54 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
the shoulder of each player, might say, "You did n't
answer Miss Ruth's call, Denner;" or, "Bless my
soul, Dale, what made you play a ten-spot on that
second hand round? You ought not to send a boy
to take a trick, sir!"</p>                  
<p>It was in one of these pauses that Mrs.Dale,
drawing a shining knitting-needle out of her work,
said, "I suppose you got my message this morning,
brother, that Arabella Forsythe did n't feel well
enough to come to-night? I told her she should
have Henry's place, but she said she was n't equal
to the excitement." Mrs.Dale gave a careful laugh;
she did not wish to make Mrs.Forsythe absurd in
the eyes of one person present.</p>
<p>"You offered her my place, my dear?" Mr.Dale
asked, turning his blue eyes upon her. "I did n't
know that, but it was quite right."</p>
<p>"Of course it was," replied Mrs.Dale decidedly,
while the rector said, "Yes, young Forsythe said
you sent him to say so."</p>
<p>Mrs.Dale glanced at Lois, sitting in one of the
deep window-seats, reading, with the lamplight shin.
ing on her pretty face.</p>
<p>"I asked him to come," continued the rector,
"but he said he must not leave his mother; she was
not feeling well."</p>
<p>"Quite right, very proper," murmured the rest
of the party; but Mrs.Dale added, "As there's no
conversation, I'm afraid it would have been very
stupid; I guess he knew that. And I certainly
should not have allowed Henry to give up his seat
to him." As she said this, she looked at Mr. Denner,
<pb n="55 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
who felt, under that clear, relentless eye, his would
have been the seat vacated, if Dick Forsythe had
come. Mr.Denner sighed; he had no one to pro-
tect him, as Dale had.</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Miss Deborah, who was sorting
her cards, and putting all the trumps at the right
side, "what decided Mr. Forsythe to spend the.
summer here? I understood that his mother took
the house in Ashurst just because he was going to
be abroad."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dale nodded her head until her glasses glis.
tened, and looked at Lois, but the girl's eyes were
fastened upon her book.</p>
<p>"I think," remarked Mr. Dale, hesitating, and
then glancing at his wife, " he is rather a changeable young man. He has one view in the morning,
and another in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"Don't be so foolish, Henry," said his wife
sharply. "I hope there 's nothing wrong in the
young man finding his own country more attractive
than Europe? To change his mind in that way is
very sensible."  But this was in a hushed voice, for
Mr. Denner had led, and the room was silent
again.</p>
<p>At the next deal, Miss Deborah looked sympathetically at Mr. Dale. "I think he is changeable,"
she said; "his own mother told me that she was con.
stantly afraid he 'd marry some unsuitable young
woman, and the only safety was that he would see
a new one before it became too serious. She said
it really told upon her health. Dear me, I should
think it might."</p>
<pb n="56 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>Mrs. Dale tossed her head, and her knitting-needies clicked viciously; then she told Lois that this
was the rubber, and she had better see to the tray.
The young girl must have heard every word they
said, though she had not lifted her bright eyeb from
her book, but she did not seem disturbed by the
charge of fickleness on the part of Mr. Forsythe.
He had not confided to her his reasons for not
going abroad; all she knew was that the summer
was the merriest one she had ever spent. "I feel
so young," little Lois said; and indeed she had
caught a certain careless gayety from her almost
daily companion, which did not belong to Ashurst.
But she gave no thought to his reason for staying,
though her father and Mrs. Dale did, and with
great satisfaction.</p>
<p>"What do you hear from Helen, brother ?" Mrs.
Dale asked, as Lois rose to do her bidding. Mrs.
Dale was determined to leave the subject of Dick
Forsythe, "for Henry has so little sense," she
thought, " there is no knowing what he '11 say next,
or Deborah Woodhouse either. But then, one could
n't expect anything else of her."</p>
<p>"Ah,--she's all right," said Dr. Howe, frowning at Miss Ruth's hand, and then glancing at Mr.
Dale's, and thrusting out his lower lip, while his
bushy eyebrows gathered in a frown.</p>
<p>"What is Ward?" asked Mr. Dale, sorting his
cards. "Old or new school?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know the difference," said Dr.
Howe; "he's a blue Presbyterian, though, through
and through. He did n't have much to say for him-
<pb n="57 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
self, but what he did say made me believe he was
consistent; he does n't stop short where his creed
ceases to be agreeable, and you know that is unusual."</p>
<p>"Well," remarked the older man, "he might be
consistent and belong to either school. I am told
the difference consists merely in the fact that the
old school have cold roast beef on the Sabbath, and
the new school have hot roast beef on Sunday. But doubtless both unite on hell for other sects."</p><p>The rector's quick laugh was silenced by the
game, but at the next pause he hastened to tell them
what John Ward had said of slavery. "Fancy such
a speech!" he cried, his face growing red at the re-
membrance. "Under the circumstances, I could n't
tell him what I thought of him; but I had my opinion. I wgnder," he went on, rattling a bunch of
keys in his pocket, "what would be the attitude of
a mind like his in politics? Conservative to the
most ridiculous degree, I imagine. Of course, to a
certain extent, it is proper to be conservative. I
am conservative myself; I don't like to see the
younger generation rushing into things because they
are new, like Gifford, - calling himself a Democrat.
I beg your pardon, Miss Deborah, for finding fault
with the boy."</p>
<p>"Ah, doctor, ladies don't understand politics,"
answered Miss Deborah politely.</p>
<p>"But really," said the rector, "for a boy whose
father died for the Union, it's absurd, you know,
perfectly absurd. But WardI one can't imagine
that he would ever change in anything, and that 
sort of conservatism can be carried too far."</p>
<pb n="58 JOHN WARD, PRBACHER"/>
"Well, now," said Mr. Denner, "I should say, I
should be inclined to think, it would be just the opposite,
quite--quite the contrary. From what you say, doctor, it seems to me more likely that he
might be an anarchist, as it were. Yes, not at all
a conservative."
"How so?" asked the rector. "A man who would
say such a thing as that the Bible, his interpretation
of it, was to decide all questions of duty (a pretty
dangerous thing that, for a man must have inclinations of his own,
which would be sure to color his interpretation! What?), and who would bring all
his actions down to its literal teachings without regard to more modern needs? No, Denner; you are
wrong there."</p>
<p>"Not altogether," Mr. Dale demurred in his gentle
voice. "Ward would believe in a party oily so long
as it agreed with his eonsoienoe, I should suppose,
and his conscience might make him--anything.</p>
<p>And certainly the Bible test would not leave him content with
democracy, doctor. Communism is literal Christianity. I can fancy he would leave any party,
if he thought its teachings were not supported by
the Bible. But I scarely know him; my opinion is
very superfeial"</p>
<p>"Why do you express it, then ?" said Mrs. Dale.</p>
<p>"Don't you ee Deborah has led? You are keeping the whole table waiting!"</p>
<p>They began to play.   Mr. Denner, who was
facing the open door, could see the square hall, and
with the moon and tars about its face, the clock
<pb n="59 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
stood; it was just five minutes to nine. This made
the lawyer nervous; he played a low thump, in spite
of the rector's mutter of, "Look out, Denner!"
and thus lost the trick, which meant the rubber, so
he threw down his cards in despair. He had scarcely
finished explaining that he meant to play the king,
but threw the knave by mistake, when Lois entered,
followed by Sally with the big tray, which always
carried exactly the same things: a little fat decanter, with a silver collar jingling about its neck,
marked, Sherry, '39; a plate of ratifia cakes, and
another of plum-cake for the rector's especial delectation; and a silver wire basket full of home-made
candy for Mr. Dale, who had two weaknesses, candy
and novels. Of late Mrs. Dale had ceased to in-
veigh against these tastes, feeling that it was hopeless to look for reformation in a man nearly seventy
years old. "It is bad manners," she said, "to do
foolish things if they make you coespiuous, . But
then! it is easier to change a man's creed than his
manners."</p>
<p>The candles stood in a gleaming row on the mantel-
piece, where Lois had placed them to make room for
the tray on the whist-table; for it was useless to think
of putting anything on the rector's writing-table, with
its litter of church papers, and sporting journals,
and numbers of Bell's "Life," besides unanswered
letters. The ladies, still sitting in the high-backed
chairs, spread white doilies over their laps, and then
took their small glasses of wine and delicate little
cakes, but the gentlemen ate and drank standing, and they all discussed the last game very ear-
<pb n="60 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
nestly.  Only Lois, waiting by the tray, ready to hand the cake, was
silent.   It was a peculiarity of Ashurst that even after childhood
had passed yound people were still expected to be seen, and not heard;
so her silence would only have been thought decorous had any one
noticed it.  By and by, when she saw she was not needed, she slipped
out to the front porch, and sat down on the steps.  Max followed her,
and thrust his cold nose under the hand.</p>
<p> She propped herchin upon her little fist, and began to think of
what had been said of Ashurst's visitors.  With a thrill ofsbtile
satisfaction, she remembered how pleased Mrs. Forsythe always was to
see her.  "She won't haveany anxiety this summer which will injure her
health!"  And then she tried to disguise her thought by saying to
herself that there was no girls in Ashurst who were not "suitable".</p>
<p>"Good-evening," some one said gayly.  It was Mr. Forsythe who had
come so quietly along the path, dark with its arching laburnums and
syrings, she had not heard him.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, with a little start of surprise, "I did not know we
were to see you to-night.  Is your mother"--</p>
<p>"I'm like the man in the Bible," he interrupted, laughing.   "He
said he would n't, then he did!" He had followed her to the library,
and stood. smiling, with a hand on each side of the doorway.  "I
started for a walk, doctor, and somehow I found myself here.   No
cake, thank you,--yes, I guess I'lll have sherry.   Oh, the whist is over?"
<pb n="61 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
Who is to be congratulated, Mrs. Dale? For my
part, I never could understand the fascination of
the game. Euchre is heavy enough for me. May
I have some of Mr. Dale's candy, Miss Lois?"</p>
<p>Except Mrs. Dale, the little party of older people
spmed stunned by the quick way in which he talked.
His airy manner and flimsy wit impressed them with
a sense of his knowledge of life. He represented
the world to them, the World with a capital W,
and they were all more or less conscious of a certain
awe in his presence. His utter disregard.of the
little observances and forms which were expected
from Ashurst young people gave them a series of
shocks, that were rather pleasant than otherwise.</p>
<p>Mr. Dale looked confused, and handed him the
candy with such nervous haste, some of it fell to the
floor, which gave the young man a chance for his
frequent light laugh. Miss Deborah began in an
agitated way to 'pick up the crumbs of cake from
her lap, and ask her sister if she did not think
Sarah had come for them.   Mr. Denner stopped
talking about a new sort of fly for trout, and said
he thought--yes, he really thought, he had better
be going, but he waited to listen with open-mouthed
admiration to the ease with which the young fellow
talked.</p>
<p>Mr. Forsythe's conversation was directed to Mrs.
Dale, but it was for Lois; nor did he seem aware
of the silence which fell on the rest of the company.
Mrs. Dale enjoyed it. She answered by nods, and
small chuckles of approval, and frequent glances
about at the others, as much as to say, "Do you
<pb n="62 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
hear that? Isn't that bright?" and a certain air
of proprietorship, which meant that she thoroughly
approved of Mr. Forsythe, and regarded him as her
own discovery.</p>
<p>"This is the time we miss Gifford," said Miss Deborah, who had gone out into the hall to put on
her overshoes. "He was such a useful child." Lois
came to help her, for Mr. Denner was far too timid
to offer assistance, and the rector too stout, and
Mr. Dale too absent-minded. As for Mr. Forsythe,
he did not notice how Miss Deborah was occupied,
until Lois had joined her; and then his offer was not
accepted, for Miss Deborah felt shy about putting
out her foot in its black kid slipper, tied about the
ankle with a black ribbon, in the presence of this
young man, who was, she was sure, very genteel.</p>
<p>Mr. Forsythe's call was necessarily a short one, for, charming as he was, Ashurst custom would not
have permitted him to stay when the party had
broken up. However, he meant to walk along with the Dales, and hear her aunt talk about Lois.</p>
<p>The Misses Woodhouse's maid was waiting for
them, her lantern swinging in her hand. Mr. Denner had secretly hoped for a chance of "seeing them
home," but dared not offer his unneesry services
in Sarah's presence.</p>
<p>Dr. Howe and his daughter went as far as the
gate with their guests, and then stood watching
them down the lane, until a turn in the road hid the
glimmer of the lantern and the dark figures be.
side it.</p>
<p>"Bless my soul!" said the rector, as they turned
<pb n="63 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
to go back to the house. "This gayety has made
me almost forget my sermon. I must not put it off
so, next week."</p>
<p>This remark of Dr. Howe's was almost as regular
as the whist party itself.</p>
<p>Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth trotted behind
Sarah, whose determined stride kept them a little
ahead of the others; Dick Forsythe had joined Mrs.
Dale at once, so Mr. Dale and Mr. Denner walked
together. They were only far enough behind to
have the zest one feels in talking about his neigh-
bors when there is danger of being overheard.</p>
<p>"He is a very fine conversationalist," said Mr.
Denner, nodding his head in Dick's direction; "he
talks very well."</p>
<p>"He talks a great deal," observed Mr. Dale.</p>
<p>"He seems to feel," Mr.Denner continued, "no
--ah, if I can so express it--timidity."</p>
<p>"None," responded Mr.Dale.</p>
<p>"And I judge he has seen a great deal of the
world," said Mr.Denner; "yet he appears to be sat.
isfied with Ashurst, and I have sometimes thought,
Henry, that Ashurst is not, as it were, gay." As he
said this, a certain jauntiness came into his step, as
though he did not include himself among those who
were not "gay."   "Yet he seems to be content.
I've known him come down to the church when Lois
was singing, and sit a whole hour, apparently meditating. He is no doubt a very thoughtful young
man."</p>
<p>"Bah I" answered Mr.Dale, "he comes to hear
Lois sing."</p>
<pb n="64 JOHNY WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>Mr. Denner gave a little start. "Oh," he said--
"ah--I had not thought of that."   But when he
left Mr.Dale, and slipped into the shadows of the
Lombardy poplars on either side of his white gateposts, Mr. Denner thought much of it,--more with
a sort of envy of Mr. Forsythe's future than of
Lois. "He will marry, some time (perhaps little
Lois), and then he will have a comfortable home."
Mr.Denner sat down on the steps outside of his
big white front door, which had a brass knocker and
knob that Mary had polished until the paint had
worn away around them. Mr.Denner's house was
of rough brick, laid with great waste of mortar, so
that it looked as though covered with many small
white seams. Some ivy grew about the western
windows of the library, but on the north and east
sides it had stretched across the closed white shutters, for these rooms had scarcely been entered since
little Willie Denner's mother died, five years ago.
She had kept house for her brother-in-law, and had
brought some brightness into his life; but since her
death, his one servant had had matters in her own
hands, and the house grew more lonely and cheerless
each year. Mr.Denner's office was in his garden,
and was of brick, like his house, but nearer the
road, and without the softening touch of ivy; it was
damp and mildewed, and one felt instinctively that
the ancient law books must have a film of mould
on their battered covers.</p>
<p>The lawyer's little face had a pinched, wistful
look; the curls of his brown wig were hidden by a
tall beaver hat, with the old bell crown and straight
<pb n="65 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
brim; it was rarely smooth, except on Sundays, when
Mary brushed it before he went to church. He took
it off now, and passed his hand thoughtfully over
his high, mild forehead, and sighed; then he looked
through one of the narrow windows on either side of
the front door, where the leaded glass was cut into
crescents and circles, and fastened with small brass
rosettes; he could see the lamp Mary had left for
him, burning dimly on the hall table, under a dark
portrait of some Denner, long since dead. But he'
still sat upon what he called his "doorstones;" the
August starlight, and the Lombardy poplars stirring
in the soft wind, and the cricket chirping in the
grass, offered more companionship, he thought, than
he would find in his dark, silent library.</p>
<p>The little gentleman's mind wandered off to the
different homes he knew; they were so pleasant and
cheerful.  There was always something bright about
the rectory, and how small and cosy Henry Dale's
study was. And how pretty the Woodhouse girls'
parlor looked  Mr. Denner was as slow to recognize the fact that Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth were
no longer young as they were themselves. Just now
he thought only of the home-life in their old house,
and the comfort, and the peace. What quiet, pleasant voices the sisters had, and how well Miss Deborah managed, and how delightfully Miss Ruth
painted! How different his own life would have
been if Gertrude Drayton--Ah, well! The little
gentleman sighed again, and then, drawing his big
key from his pocket, let himself into the silent hall,
and crept quietly upstairs.</p>
<pb n="[66]"/>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>IT did not take Gifford Woodhouse very long to
get settled in Lockhaven. His office and bedroom
constituted his household, and Miss Deborah never
knew that her bags of lavender were not even
taken out of the trunk, and that the hard-featured
Irishwoman who "came in by the day" never saw
the paper of directions, written, that she might be
able to read it easily, in Miss Deborah's small, neat
hand.</p>
<p>But Miss Deborah was right in thinking Helen
would look after his comfort, and Gifford soon felt
that his real "home" in Lockhaven was at the parsonage, though he had not time to drop in half as
often as the master and mistress urged him to do.</p>
<p>He did not tell Helen of that talk with Lois,
which had brought a soberer look to his face than
she had ever seen there. But she had noticed it,
and wondered at it, and she felt his reserve, too, in
speaking of her cousin; she even asked herself if
he could have cared for Lois? But the thought
was too absurd.  "Probably they've quarreled
again," she said regretfully; she never had been
able to understand her cousin's impatience with
him.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gifford thought that she had an intuitive
knowledge of the ache there was in his heart when
<pb n="67 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
she talked of Lois, for he was comforted in a vague
way by the sympathetic look which was always on
Helen's face when she spoke to any one who seemed
troubled. So he was glad to come to the parsonage
as often as he could, and hear the Ashurst news,
and have a cup of tea with the preacher and his
wife.</p>
<p>John and Helen often walked home with him,
though his rooms were quite at the other end of the
town, near the river and the mills; and one night,
as they stood on the shaking bridge, and looked
down at the brown water rushing and plunging
against the rotten wooden piers, Helen began to ask
him about Mr. Forsythe.</p>
<p>"Tell me about him," she said. "You have seen
him since he left college. I only just remember
him in Ashurst, though I recall Mrs. Forsythe perfectly: a tall, sick-looking lady, with an amiably
melancholy face, and three puffs of hair on each
side of it."</p>
<p>"Except that the puffs are white now, she is just
the same," Gifford answered. "As for her son, I
don't know anything about him. I believe we were
not very good friends when we were boys, but now
-well, he has the manners of a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Does n't that go without saying ?" said Helen,
laughing. "From the letters I've had, I fancy he is
a good deal at the rectory."</p>
<p>"Yes," Gifford admitted. "But he is one of
those people who make you feel that though they
may have good manners, their grandfathers did not,
don't you know?"</p>
<pb n="68 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"But what difference does that make," John
asked, "if he is a good man?"</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, no difference," Gifford replied
with an impatient laugh.</p>
<p>"But what is the attraction in Ashurst, Giff?"
Helen said. "How can he stay there all summer?
I should not think he could leave his business."</p>
<p>"Oh, he is rich."</p>
<p>"Why, you don't like him!" said Helen, surprised at his tone.</p>
<p>"I don't know anything about the fellow," the
young man answered. "I have n't seen enough of
him to have an opinion one way or the other. Judging from aunt Ruth's letters, though, I should say
Lois liked him, so I don't think he will be anxious
for my approval, or anybody else's."</p>
<p>Helen looked at him with sudden questioning in her eyes, but they had reached his house, and John
began to speak to him of his plans and of Lockhaven.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you will have only too much to do,"
he said.  There is a great deal of quarreling among
the mill-owners, and constant disagreements between
the hands."</p>
<p>"Well," Gifford answered, smiling, and straightening his broad
shoulders, "if there is work to do,
I am glad I am here to do it. But I'm not hopeless
for the life it indicates, when you say there's much
to be done. The struggle for personal rights and
advantages is really, you know, the desire for the
best, and a factor in civilization. A generation or
two hence, the children of these pushing, aggressive
fathers will be fine men."</p>
<pb n="69 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>John shook his head sadly. "Ah, but the present
evil?"</p>
<p>But Gifford answered cheerfully, " Oh, well, the
present evil is one stage of development; to live
up to the best one knows is morality, and the preservation of self is the best some of these people
know; ,we can only wait hopefully for the future."</p>
<p>"Morality is not enough," John said gently.
"Morality never saved a soul, Mr. Woodhouse."</p>
<p>But Helen laughed gayly: "John, dear, Gifford
does n't understand your awful Presbyterian doctrines, and there is no use trying to convert him."</p>
<p>Gifford smiled, and owned good-naturedly that he
was a heathen. "But I think," he said, "the thing
which keeps the town back most is liquor."</p>
<p>"It is, indeed," John answered, eagerly. "If it
could be banished!"</p>
<p>"High license is, the only practipal remedy,"
said Gifford, his face full of interest; but John's fell.</p>
<p>"No, no, not that; no compromise with sin will
help us. I would have it impossible to find a drop
of liquor in Lockhaven."</p>
<p>"What would you do in case of sickness?" Gifford asked curiously.</p>
<p>"I would n't have it used."</p>
<p>"Oh, John, dear," Helen protested, " don't you
think that's rather extreme? You know it's life
or death sometimes: a stimulant has to be used, or
a person would die. Suppose I had to have it?"</p>
<p>His face flushed painfully. "Death is better
than sin," he said slowly and gently; "and you, if
<pb n="70 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
you--I don't know, Helen; no one knows his weakness until temptation comes."  His tone was so full
of trouble, Gifford, feeling the sudden tenderness of
his own strength, said good-naturedly, "What do
you think of us poor fellows who confess to a glass
of claret at dinner?"</p>
<p>"And what must he have thought of the dinner-
table at the rectory?" Helen added.</p>
<p>"I don't think I noticed it," John said simply.
"You were there."</p>
<p>"There, Helen, that's enough to make you sign
the pledge!" said Gifford.</p>
<p>He watched them walking down the street, under
the arching ailantus, their footsteps muffled by the
carpet of the fallen blossoms; and there was a
thoughtful look on his face when he went into his
office, and, lighting his lamp, sat down to look over
some papers. "How is that going to come out?"
he said to himself. "Neither of those people will
amend an opinion, and Ward is not the man to
be satisfied if his wife holds a belief he thinks
wrong." But researches into the case of McHenry 
v. Coggswell put things so impractical as religious
beliefs out of his mind.</p>
<p>As for John and Helen, they walked toward the
parsonage, and Gifford, and his future, and his
views of high license were forgotten, as well as the
sudden pain with which John had heard his wife's
careless words about his "awful doctrines."</p>
<p>"It is very pleasant to see him so often," John
said, "but how good it is to have you all to my.
self"</p>
<pb n="71 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>Helen gave him a swift, glad look; then their
talk drifted into those sweet remembrances which
happy husbands and wives know by heart: what he
thought when he first saw her, how she wondered
if he would speak to her. "And oh, Helen," he
said, "I recollect the dress you wore,--how soft
and silky it was, but it never rustled, or gleamed;
it rested my eyes just to look at it."</p>
<p>A little figure was coming towards them down the
deserted street, with a jug clasped in two small
grimy hands.</p>
<p>"Preacher!" cried achildish voice eagerly, " good-
evenin', preacher."</p>
<p>John stopped and bent down to see who it was,
for a tangle of yellow hair almost hid the little
face.</p>
<p>"Why, it is Molly," he said, in his pleasant
voice. "Where have you been, my child? Oh, yes,
I see,--for dad's beer?"</p>
<p>Molly was smiling at him, proud to be noticed.
"Yes, preacher," she answered, wagging her head.
"Good-night, preacher." But they had gone only
a few steps when there was a wail. Turning her
head to watch him out of sight, Molly had tripped,
and now all that was left of the beer was a yellow
scum of froth on the dry ground. The jug was
unbroken, but the child could find no comfort in
that.</p>            
<p>"I've spilt dad's beer," she said, sobbing, and
sinking down in a forlorn heap on the ground.</p>
<p>John knelt beside her, and tried to comfort her.
"Never mind; we'll go and tell dad it was an accident."</p>
<pb n="72 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>But Molly only shook her head. "No," she said,
catching her breath, as she tried to speak, "'t won't
do no good. He'll beat me. He's getting over a
drunk, so he wanted his beer, and he'11 lick me."</p>
<p>John looked down sadly at the child for a moment. "I will take you home, Helen, and then I
will go back with Molly."</p>
<p>"Oh," Helen answered quickly, "let me go with
you?"</p>
<p>"No," John replied, "no, dear. You heard what
Molly said?  I--I cannot bear that your eyes
should see--what must be seen in Tom Davis's
house to-night. We will go to the parsonage now,
and then Molly and I will tell dad about the beer."
He lifted the child gently in his arms, and stooped
again for the pitcher. "Come, Helen," he said,
and they went towards the parsonage. Helen entered reluctantly, but without a protest, and then
stood watching them down the street. The little
yellow head had fallen on John's shoulder, and
Molly was almost asleep.</p>
<p>Tom Davis's house was one of a row near the
river. They had been built on piles, so as to be out
of the way of the spring "rise," but the jar and
shock of the great cakes of ice floating under them
when the river opened up had given them an un-
steady look, and they leaned and stumbled so that
the stained plastering had broken on the walls, and
there were large cracks by the window frames. The
broken steps of Molly's home led up to a partly open
door. One panel had been crushed in in a fight, and
the knob was gone, and the door-posts were dirty
<pb n="73 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
and greasy.  The narrow windows were without
shutters, and only a dingy green paper shade hid the
room within.</p>
<p>Molly opened her sleepy eyes long enough to say,
"Don't let dad lick me! "</p>
<p>"No, little Molly," John said, as he went into the
small entry, and knocked at the inner door. "Don't
be afraid."</p>
<p>"Come in," a woman's voice answered.</p>
<p>Mrs. Davis was sitting by the fireless stove, on
which she had placed her small lamp, and she was.
trying by its feeble light to do some mending. Her
face had that indifference to its own hopelessness
which forbids all hope for it. She looked up as
they entered.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's the preacher," she said, with a flickering smile about
her fretful lips; and she rose, brushing 
some lifeless strands of hair behind her ears,and pulling down her sleeves, which were rolled above her thin elbows.</p>
<p>"Molly has had an accident, Mrs. Davis," Johnexplained, putting the
child gently down, and steady-ing her on her uncertain little feet,
until her eyeswere fairly opened. "So I came home with her tosay how
it happened."</p><p>"She spilt the beer, I reckon," said Mrs. Davis,
glancing at the empty jug John had put on the table. "Well, 't ain't
no great loss. He's asleep,and won't know nothing about it. He'll have
forgot he sent her by mornin'."  She jerked her headtowards one side
of the room, where her husbandwas lying upon the floor. "Go get the
preacher a
<pb n="74 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>chair, Molly. Not that one; it's got a
leg broke. 'Oh, you need n't speak low," she added, as Johnthanked the
child softly; "he won't hear nothing before to-morrow."</p><p>The
lumberman lay in the sodden sleep withwhich he ended a spree. He had
rolled up his coat for a pillow, and had thrown one arm across his
purple; bloated face. Only the weak, helpless, openmouth could be
seen.  His muscular hands were relaxed, and the whole prostrate figure
was pathetic in its unconsciousness of will and grotesque
unhumanness. Fate had been too strong for Tom Davis. His birth and all
the circumstances of his useless life had brought him with resistless
certaintyto this level, and his progress in the future couldonly be an
ever-hastening plunge downward.</p><p>But the preacher did not
consider fate when he turned and looked at the drunken man. A
sternlook crept over the face which had smiled at Mollybut a moment
before.</p><p>"This is the third time," he said, "that this has
happened since Tom came and told me he would tryto keep sober. I had
hoped the Spirit of God had touched him."</p><p>"I know," the woman
answered, turning the coatshe was mending, and moving the lamp a
little to get a better light; "and it's awful hard on me, soit is;
that's where all our money goes. I can't getshoes for the children's
feet, let alone a decent rag to if? put on my back to wear of a
Sabbath, and cometo church. It's hard on me, now, I tell you,
Mr.Ward."</p>
<pb n="75 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"It is harder on him," John
replied. "Think of his immortal soul. Oh, Mrs. Davis, do you point out
to him the future he is preparing for himself?"</p><p>"Yes," she said,
"I'm tellin' him he'll go to hell all the time; but it don't do no
good. Tom's afraid of hell, though; it's the only thing as ever did
keep him straight. After one o'them sermons of yours, I've known him
swear off as long as two months. I ain't been to church this longtime,
till last Sabbath; and I was hopin' I'd hear one of that kind, all
about hell, Mr. Ward, so I could tell Tom, but you did n't preach that way.Not but what it was good, though," she added, withan evident wish to be polite.</p><p>John's face suddenly flushed. "I--I know Idid not, but the love of God must constrain us, Mrs.Davis, as well as the fear of hell."</p><p>Mrs. Davis sighed. Tom's spiritual condition,which had roused a momentary interest, was forgotten in the thought
ofher own misery. "Well, it's awful hard on me," she repeated with a
little tremor in her weak chin.</p><p>John looked at her with infinite
pity in his eyes."Yes," he said, "hard on you, because of the eternal
suffering which may come to your husband. Nothing can be more
frightful than to think of such athing for one we love. Let us try to
save him; pray always, pray without ceasing for his immortal soul,
that he may not slight the day of salvation, and repent when it is too
late to find the mercy of God.Oh, the horror of knowing that the day
of grace
<pb n="76 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
has gone forever! 'For my spirit shall not always strive with man.'"</p>
<p>He went over to the drunken man, and, kneeling down beside him,
took one of the helpless bands inhis. Mrs. Davis put down her sewing,
and watched him.</p><p>Perhaps the preacher prayed, as he knelt there,
though she could not hear him; but when he rose and said good-night, she could see his sad eyes fullof trouble which she could not understand, a pitybeyond her comprehension.</p><p>Molly came sidling up to her protector, as hestood a moment in the doorway, and, taking his handin hers, stroked it softly.</p><p>"I love you, preacher," she said, "'cause you're good."</p><p>John's face brightened with a sudden smile; thelove of little children was a great joy to him, andthe touch of these small hands gave him the indefinable comfort of hope. God, who had made thesweetness of childhood, would be merciful to his ownchildren. He would give them time, He would not withdraw the day of grace; surely Tom Davis'ssoul would yet be saved. There was a subtlethought below this of hope that for Helen, too, theday of grace might be prolonged, but he did notrealize this himself; he did not know that he fearedfor one moment that she might not soon accept thetruth. He was confident, he thought, of her, andyet more confident of the constraining power of thetruth itself.</p><p>He looked down at Molly, and put his hand<pb n="77 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>gently on her yellow lead. "Be a good girl, mylittle Molly;" then, with a quiet blessing upon thedreary home, he turned away.</p>
<p>But what Mrs. Davis had said of going to churchto hear a sermon on hell, and her evident disappointment, aid not
leave his mind. He walked slowly towards the parsonage, his head bent and his handsclasped behind him, and a questioning anxiety in hisface. "I will use every chance to speak of the certain punishment of the wicked when I visit my people," he said, "but not in the pulpit. Not whereHelen would hear it--yet. In her frame of mind,treating the whole question somewhat lightly, notrealizing its awful importance, it would be productive of no good. I
will try, little by little, to show her what to believe, and turn her thoughts to truth.For the present that is enough, that is wisest."And then his heart went back to her, and howhappy they were. He stopped a moment, lookingup at the stars, and saying, with a breathless awe inhis voice, "My God, how good Thou art, howhappy I am!"</p><pb n="[78] CHAPTER VII"/><p>THE little stir which the arrival of the Forsythesmade in Ashurst was delightful.</p><p>"Of course," as Mrs. Dale said, "Arabella Forsythe had not been born there, and could not be expected to be just like Ashurst people; but it was
something to have a new person to talk to, even ifyou had to talk about medicines most of the time."</p><p>Lois Howe enjoyed it, for there were very fewyoung people in Ashurst that summer; the twoDrayton girls had gone away to visit a marriedbrother, and there were no young men now Giffordhad gone. So it was pleasant to have a person ofher own age to talk to, and sometimes to walk with,though the rector never felt quite sure what his sister would say to
that. However, Mrs. Dale had nothing to say; she shut her eyes to any
impropri-ety, and even remarked severely to Miss DeborahWoodhouse that
those old-fashioned ideas of a girl'sbeing always under her mother's
eye, were prim andold maidish; "and beside, Lois's' mother is
dead,"she added, with a sort of triumph in her voice.</p><p>As for
Lois, she almost forgot that she hadthought Ashurst lonely when Helen
had gone, andGifford; for of course, in so small a place, every
onecounted. She had won dered, sometimes, before theForsythes came, with a self-consciouness which was<pb n="79 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>a new experience, if any one thought she missed Gifford. But her
anxiety was groundless,--Ashurst imagination never rose to any such height; and certainly, if the letters the young man wrote to hercould have been seen, such a thought would not havebeen suggested. They were pleasant and friendly;very short, and not very frequent; mostly of Helenand what she did; there was almost nothing of himself, and the past,
at least as far as a certain night in June was concerned, was never mentioned. Atfirst this was a relief to Lois, but by and by camea feeling too negative to be called pique, or evenmortification at having been forgotten; it was ratheran intangible soreness in her memory of him.</p><p>"It is just as Miss Deborah says," she said to herself: "Young men
always forget those things. And it is better that they do. Gifford never thinks ofwhat he said to me, and I'm sure I'm glad hedoes n't--but still!" And then that absurd suggestion of Miss Deborah's about Helen would creepWite her mind; she might banish it, because it wassilly and impossible, yet she did not utterly forgetit. However, she really thought very little about it;the presence of Mrs. Forsythe and her son gave herplenty of occupation. There was the round of teasand dinners which Ashurst felt it incumbent to give to a new arrival, and Lois was to have two newgowns in consequence of so much gayety.</p><p>She spent a good deal of time with Mrs. Forsythe,for the elder lady needed her, she said. It was notaltogether the companionship which fascinated Lois:the sunny drawing-room of the house the Forsythes<pb n="80 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>had hired was filled with dainty things, and light, graceful
furniture, and many harmlessly silly novels; there was a general air about it of belonging to alifelshe had never seen which made it a pleasure tocome into it. The parlors in Ashurst had such heavy,serious chairs and tables, she said to herself, andthe pictures were all so dark and ugly, and she wasso tired of the carpets.</p><p>So she was very glad when Mrs. Forsythe begged her to come and read aloud, or fix her flowers, oreven stroke her soft white hair when she had a headache. "Dick may be at home, my dear," Mrs. Forsythe would say in her deprecating voice, "butyou won't mind him?"  And soon Lois did not mind him at all.</p><p>At first she was very shy in the presence of thislight-hearted young fellow, whose indifference toAshurst opinion was very impressive; but by andby that wore off, and Mrs. Forsythe's drawing-roomechoed with their young laughter. Lois began tofeel with Dick the freedom and friendliness whichhad once been only for Gifford. "Why could n'tGiff have been like this?" she thought; yet shedid not say that she and Mr. Forsythe were like"brother and sister," for she was always consciousof a possibility in their friendship; but it was enoughthat Mr.Forsythe was very interesting, and thatthat summer, life was very delightful.</p><p>After all, love is frequently a matter of propinquity.</p><p>Dick found himself going often to the rectory,nad Lois fell into the habit of making her plans<pb n="81 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>with the reservation, "In case Mr. Forsythe calls;"and it generally happened that he did call.  "Mothersends her love, and will Miss Lois come and readto her a little while this afternoon, if she is not toobusy?" or, "Mother returns this dish, and begsme to thank you for the jelly, and to tell Jean howgood it was."</p><p>It was easy for Dick to manufacture errands likethese Dr.Howe began to think young Forsythespent the greater part of his time at the rectory.But this did not trouble him at all; in fact it was asatisfaction that this lively young man liked the rectory so
much. Dr.Howe did not go very far into the future in his thoughts; he was distinctly lattered inthe present.  Of course, if anything came of it (forthe rector was not entirely unworldly), why, it wouldbe all for the best. So he was quite patient if Loiswas not on hand to hunt up a book for him or tofetch his slippers, and he fell into the habit of spending much time
in Mr. Denner's office, lookingover "Field" and talking of their next hunting trip.He was not even irritated when, one morning,wishing to read a letter to his daughter, he had goneall over the house looking for her, and then hadcaught a glimpse of her through the trees, down inthe sunny garden, with Dick Forsythe. "I'll justlet that letter wait," he said, and went and stretchedhimself comfortably on the slippery, leather-coveredsofa in the shaded library, with a paper in his handand a satisfied smile on his lips.</p><p>The garden was ablaze with color, and full of allsorts of delicious scents and sounds. The gay old-<pb n="82 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>fashioned flowers poured a flood of blossoms throughall the borders: hollyhocks stood like rockets againstthe sky; sweet-peas and scarlet runners scrambledover the box hedges and about the rose-bushes;mallows and sweet-williams, asters and zinias andphlox, crowded close together with a riotous richness of tint; scarlet and yellow nasturtiums streamedover the ground like molten sunshine; and, sparkling and glinting through the air, butterflies chasedup and down like blossoms that had escaped fromtheir stems.</p><p>Lois had eome out to pick some flowers for thenumerous vases and bowls which it was her delightto keep filled all summer long. She was bareheaded,iand the wind had rumpled the curls around her forehead; the front of her light blue dress--she worelight blue in a manner whieh might have beencalled daring had it implied the slightest thought--was caught up to hold her lapful of flowers; asheaf of roses rested on her shoulder, and somefeathery vines trailed almost to the ground, while inher left hand, their stems taller than her own head,were two stately sunflowers, which were to brightenthe hall<p>Mr.Forsythe caught sight of her as he closed thegate, and hurried down the path to help her carryher fragrant load. He had, as usual, a message todeliver. "Mother sends her love, Miss Lois, andsays she is n't well enough to go and drive this afternoon; but she'll be glad to go to-morrow, ifyou'll take her?"</p><p>"Oh, yes, indeed I" Lois cried, in her impetuousvoice. "But I'm sorry she's ill to-day."</p><pb n="83 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>Dick gave the slightest possible shrug of his squareshoulders. "Oh, I guess she's all right," he said."It amuses her. But won't you give me some flowersto take home to her?"</p><p>Of course Lois was delighted to do it, but Dickinsisted that she should first put those she had already gathered in water, and then get some freshones for his mother. "You see I'm very particularthat she should have the best;" then they both laughed. Now mutual laughter at small jokes bringsabout a very friendly feeling.</p><p>They went up to the side porch, where it was shady, and Lois and Sally brought out all the vasesand dishes which could be made to hold flowers,and put them in a row on the top step. Then Dickbrought a big pitcher of fresh, cold water from thespring, and Lois went for the garden scissors toclip off the long stems; and at last they were readyto go to work, the sweet confusion of flowers on thesteps between them, and Max sitting gravely atLois's elbow as chaperon.</p><p>The rector heard their voices and the frequentshouts of laughter, and began to think he mustbestir himself; Mr.Forsythe should see that Ashurst young women were
under the constant oversight of their parents; but he yawned once or
twice, and thought how comfortable the cool leather ofthe lounge was, and had another little doze beforehe went out to the porch with the open letter in hishand.</p><p>Dick had his hat full of white, and pink, and wine-colored hollyhocks, which he had stripped from their<pb n="84 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>stems, and was about to put in a shallow dish, so hedid not rise, but said "Hello!" in answer to the reotor's "Good-morning," and smiled brightly up athim. It was the charm of this smile which made the older people in Ashurst forget that he treatedthem with very little reverence.</p><p>"Lois," her father said, "I have a letter fromHelen; do you want to send any message when Ianswer it? Mr.Forsythe will excuse you if youread it."</p><p>"Why, of course," Dick replied.  "I feel almostas though I knew Mrs.Ward, Miss Lois has talkedso much about her."</p><p>"How funny to hear her called 'Mrs. Ward!'"Lois said, taking the letter from her father's hand.</p><p>"I should think she'd hate Lockhaven," Dickwent on. "I was there once for a day or two. Itis a poor little place; lots of poverty among thehands. And it is awfully unpleasant to see thatsort of thing. I've heard fellows say they enjoyeda good dinner more if they saw some poor beggar going without. Now, I don't feel that way. I don't like to see such things; they distress me, and I don'tforget them."</p><p>Lois, reading Helen's letter, which was full ofgrief for the helpless trouble she saw in Lockhaven,thought that Mr. Forsythe had a very tender heart. Helen was questioning the meaning of the suffering about her; already theproblem as old as life itself confronted her, and she asked, Why?</p><p>Dr.Howe had noticed this tendency in some ofher later letters, and  scarcely knew whether to be<pb n="85 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
annoyed or amused by it. "Now what in theworld," he said, as Lois handed back the letter,--"what in the world does the child mean by askingme if I don't think--stay, where is that sentence?"The rector fumbled for his glasses, and, with hislower lip thrust out, and his gray eyebrows gatheredinto a frown, glanced up and down the pages. "Ah,yes, here: 'Do you not think,' she says, 'that thepresence in the world, of suffering which cannot produce character, irresponsible suffering, so to speak,makes it hard to believe in the personal care ofGod?' It's perfect nonsense for Helen to talk inthat way! What does she know about 'character'and'irresponsible suffering'? I shall tell her tomend her husband's stockings, and not bother herlittle head with theological questions that are toobig for her."</p><p>"Yes, sir," Lois answered, carefully snipping offthe thorns on the stem of a rose before she plungedit down into the water in the big punch-bowl; "butpeople cannot help just wondering sometimes."</p><p>"Now, Lois, don't you begin to talk that way,"the rector cried impatiently; "one in a family isenough!"</p><p>"Well," said Dick Forsythe gayly, "what's thegood of bothering about things you can't under-stand?"</p><p>"Exactly," the rector answered. "Be good! ifwe occupy our minds with conduct, we won't haveroom for speculation, which never made a soul betteror happier, anyhow. Yes, it's all nonsense, and Ishall tell Helen so; there is too much tendency<pb n="86 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>among young people to talk about things they don'tunderstand, and it results in a superficial, skin-deepsort of skepticism that I despise! Besides," headded, laughing and knocking his glasses off, "whatis the good of having a minister for a husband? Sheought to ask him her theological questions."</p><p>"Well, now, you know, father," Lois said, "Helenis n't the sort of woman to be content just to stepinto the print her husband's foot has made. She'llchoose what she thinks is solid ground for herself.And she is n't superficial."</p><p>"Oh, no, of course not," the rector began, relent.ing. "I did n't mean to be hard on the child. Butshe must n't be foolish. I don't want her to makeherself unhappy by getting unsettled in her belief,and that is what this sort of questioning results in.But I did n't come out to scold Helen; it just occurred to me that it
might be a good thing to send her that twenty-five dollars I meant to give todomestic missions, and let her use it for some ofher poor people. What?"</p><p>"Oh, yes, do I" Lois replied.</p><p>"Let me send twenty-five dollars, tool" Dickcried, whipping out a check-book.</p><p>Dr. Howe protested, but Mr. Forsythe insistedthat it was a great pleasure. "Don't you see," heexplained, smiling, "if Mrs. Ward will spend somemoney for me, it will make my conscience easy fora month; for, to tell you the truth, doctor, I don'tthink about poor people any more than I can help;it's too unpleasant. I'm afraid I'm very selfish."</p><p>This was said with such a good-natured look, Dr.
<pb n="87 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>Howe oould only smile indulgently. "Ah, well,you're young, and I'm sure your twenty-five dollars for Helen's poor people will cover a multitudeof sins. I fancy you are not quite so bad as youwould have us believe."</p><p>Lois watched him draw his check, and was di-vided between admiration and an undefined dissatisfaction with herself for feeling admiration forwhiat really meant so little.</p><p>"Thank you very much," the rector said heartily.</p><p>"Oh, you're welcome, I'm sure," answered theother.</p><p>Dr.Howe folded the check away in a batteredleather pocket-book, shiny on the sides and raggedabout the corners, and overflowing with odds andends of memoranda and newspaper clippings; arow of fish-hooks was fastened into the flap, and hestopped to adjust these before he went into thehouse to answer Helen's letter.</p><p>He snubbed her good-naturedly, telling her not toworry about things too great for her, but beneathhis consciousness there lurked a little discomfort, oreven irritation. Duties which seem dead and buried, and forgotten, are avenged by the sting ofmemory. In the rector's days at the theologicalschool, he had himself known those doubts whichmay lead to despair, or to a wider and unflinching'gaze into the mysteries of light. But ArchibaldHowe reached neither one condition nor the other.He questioned many things; he even knew theheartache which the very fear of losing faith gives.But the way was too hard, and the toil and anguish<pb n="88 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>of the soul too great; he'turned back into the familiar paths of the religion he knew and loved; anddoubt grew vague, not in assured belief, but in theplain duties of life. After a little while, he almostforgot that he ever had doubted. Only now andthen, when some questioning soul came to him,would he realize that he could not help it by his ownexperience, only by a formula,--a text-book spirituality; then he would remember, and promise himself that the day should come when he would faceuncertainty and know what he believed. But it wascontinually eluding him, and being put off; he couldnot bear to run the risk of disturbing the faith ofothers; life was too full; he had not the time forstudy and research,-- and perhaps it would all endit deeper darkness. Better be content with whatlight he had. So duty was neglected, and his easy,tranquil life flowed on.</p><p>Writing his careless rebuke to Helen brought thispast unpleasantly before his mind; he was glad when he had sanded his paper and thrust the foldedletter into its envelope, and could forget once more.</p><p>Dick Forsythe had prolonged his call by beingvery careful what flowers were picked for hismother, and he and Lois wandered over the wholeEarden, searching for the most perfect roses, beforehe acknowledged that he was content. When theyparted at the iron gate, he was more in love thanever, and Lois walked back to the rectory, thinking.With a vague
dissatisfaction how much she would miss the Forsythes when they left Ashurst.</p><p>But Mr.Forsythe's wa not the ort of love which<pb n="89 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>demanded solitude or silence, so that when he sawMr.Dale coming from Mr.Denner's little law office,he made haste to join him. Conversation of anysort, and with any person, was a necessity to thisyoung man, and Mr.Dale was better than no one.</p><p>"I've just been to the rectory," he said, as hereached the older man's side.</p>"I suppose so," Mr. Dale answered shortly. Perhaps he was the only person in Ashurst who was notblinded by the glamour of that World which Mr.Forsythe represented, and who realized the natureof the young man himself. Dick's superficiality wasa constant irritation to Mr.Dale, who missed in himthat deference for the opinions of older peoplewhich has its roots in the past, in the training offathers and mothers in courtesy and gentleness, andwhich blossoms in perfection in the third or fourthgeneration.</p><p>There was nothing in his voice to encourage Dickto talk about Lois Howe, so he wisely turned theconversatlon, but wished he had a more congenialcompanion. Mr.Dale walked with hands behindhim and shoulders bent forward; his wide-brimmedfelt hat was pulled down over his long soft locks ofwhite hair, and hid the expression of his face.</p><p>So Dick rattled on in his light, happy voice, talking of everything
or nothing, as his hearer might happen to consider it, until suddenly
Mr.Dale's attention was caught: Dick began to speak of John Ward. "I
thought I'd seen him," he was saying.  "The name was familiar, and then when Miss Loisdescribed his looks, and told me where he studied<pb n="90 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>for the ministry, I felt sure of it. If it is the sameman, he must be a queer fellow."</p><p>"Why?" asked Mr.Dale. He did not know JohnWard very well, and had no particular feeling abouthim one way or the other; but people interested Mr.Dale, and he had meant some time to study this manwith the same impersonal and kindly curiosity withwhich he would have examined a new bug in his collection.</p><p>"Because, if he's the man I think he is,--andI guess there is no doubt about it--thin, dark, andabstracted-looking, named Ward, and studying atthe Western Theological Seminary that year,--Isaw him do a thing--well, I never knew any otherman who would have done it!"</p><p>"What was it, sir?" said Mr. Dale, turning hismild blue eyes upon the young man, and regardinghim with an unusual amount of interest.</p><p>Dick laughed. "Why," he answered, "I saw thatman,--there were a lot of us fellows standing on thesteps of one of the hotels; it was the busiest streetand the busiest time of the day, and there was awoman coming along, drunk as lord. Jove! youought to have seen her walk I She could n't walk,--that was about the truth of it; and she had a miserable yelling brat in her arms. It seemed as thoughshe'd fall half a dozen times. Well, while we werestanding there, I saw that man coming down thestreet. I did n't know him then,--somebody toldme his name, afterwards. I give you my word, sir,when he saw that woman, he stood still one minute,as though he was thunderstruck by the sight of her,--not hesitating, you know, but just amazed to see<pb n="91 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>a woman looking like that,--and then he went rightup to her, and took that dirty, screeching child outof her arms; and then, I'm damned if he did n'tgive her his arm and walk down the street with her!"</p><p>Mr.Dale felt the shock of it. "Ah I" he said,with a quick indrawn breath.</p><p>"Yes," continued Dick, who enjoyed telling agood story, "he walked down that crowded streetwith that drunken, painted creature on his arm. Isuppose he thought she'd fall, and hurt herself andthe child. Naturally everybody looked at him, butI don't believe he even saw them. We stood thereand watched them out of sight--and--but ofcourse you know how fellows talk I Though so longas he was a <hi rend="italic">minister</hi>"--Dick grinned significantly,and looked at Mr. Dale for an answer; but therewas none.</p><p>Suddenly the old man stood still and gravely liftedhis hat: "He's a good man," he said, and thentrudged on again, with his head bent and his handsclasped behind him.</p><p>Mr.Forsythe looked at him, and whistled."Jove" he exclaimed, "it does n't strike you as itdid Dr.Howe. I told him, and he said, 'Bless mysoul, had n't the man sense enough to call a police.man?'"</p><p>But Mr.Dale had nothing more to say. Thepicture of John Ward, walking through the crowdedstreet with the woman who was a sinner upheld byhis strong and tender arm, was not forgotten; andwhen Dick had left him, and he had lighted hisslender silver pipe in the quiet of his basementstudy, he said again, "He's a good man."</p><pb n="[92] CHAPTER VIII"/><p>IT was one of those deliciously cold evenings inearly autumn. All day long the sparkling sunshine-scented air had held an exhilaration like wine, butnow night had folded a thin mist across the hills,though the cear darkness of the upper sky wasfilled with the keen white light of innuerablestars.</p><p>A fire in the open grate in John Ward's studywas pure luxury, for the room did not really needthe warmth. It was of that soft coal which peoplein the Middle States burn in happy indifference toits dust-making qualities, because of its charm ofsudden-puffing flames, which burst from the bubbling blackness with a singing noise, like the explosion of an oak-gall stepped on unawares in thewoods.</p><p>It had been a busy 4y ifor Joh. ending with theweekly prayer-meeting; and to sit now in front ofthe glowing fire, with Helen beside him, was a well-earned rest.</p><p>In the afternoon he had taken a dozen of the village children to
find a swamp whose borders were fringed with gentians, which seemed to have caughtthe color of the wind-swept October skies.  Hewould not let Helen go. "The walk would tireyou," he said; but he himself seemed to know no<pb n="93 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>weariness, though most of the time he carried oneof the children, and was continually lifting themover rough places, and picking their flowers andferns for them.</p><p>Helen had seen them start, and watched them asthey tramped over the short, risp grass of an upland pasture, and she could just distingsh thewords of a hymn they sung, John's deep, sweet tenorleading their quavering treble:--</p><p>"His loving kindness, loving kindness,His loving kindness, oh, how free!"</p><p>After they had gathered gentians to their hearts'content, they crowded about John and begged for astory, for that was always the crowning bliss of anafternoon with the preacher. But, though prefacedwith the remark that they must remember it wasonly a story and not at all true, their enjoyment ofgnomes and fairies, of wondrous palaes built of wondrous palaces built
of shining white clouds, with stars for lamps, was neverlessened. True, there was generally a moral, but inhis great desire to make it attractive John oftenconcealed it, and was never quite sure that hisstories did the good he intended. But they didgood in another way; the children loved him, asmost of them loved nothing else in their meagre,hungry little lives. And he loved them; they stirredthe depths of tenderness in him. What did thefuture hold for them? Misery, perhaps, and surelysin, for what hope was there of purity and holinessin such homes as theirs? And the horror of thatfurther future, the sure eternity which follows sin,cast a dreary shadow over them, and lent a sup-<pb n="94 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>pressed passion to the fervor with which he tried towin their love, that he might lead them to righteous.ness.</p><p>But it was his gentleness, and a childlike sim-plicity which they themselves must early lose, whichattracted and charmed the children, and made themhappy and contented if they could but be with thepreacher.</p><p>They had left him reluctantly at the parsonagegate, clamoring for another afternoon, which wasgladly promised. Then John had had a quiet halfhour for further thought upon his evening talk tohis people, which had been prepared the day before. Helen had laughed at the amount of studygiven to every address. "I wish you could see howuncle Archie manages his sermons."</p><p>"He has not the sort of people I have," Johnsaid, with kindly excuse. "Yet think of the importance of speaking to
any one in Christ's name! We preach for eternity, Helen,--for eternity."</p><p>She looked at him gravely. "John," she answered, "you take these
things too much to heart.  It is not wise, dear"</p>
<p>He hesitated, and then said gently, "These arethe only things to take to heart. We only live toprepare for that other life. Can we be too earnestdear, when eternity hangs upon the use we make oftime? That thought is a continual spur to makeme eager for my duty to my people."</p><p>"Oh, I know it," Helen responded, laying herhead upon his shoulder; "but don't work too hard."</p><p>He put his arms about her, and the impulse which<pb n="95 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>had been strong a moment before to speak to her ofher own soul was forgotten.</p><p>These prayer-meetings were trials to Helen Ward.She missed the stately Liturgy of her own church."I don't like to hear Elder Dean give the Almightyso much miscellaneous information," she said, halflaughing, yet quite in earnest. But she alwayswent, for at least there was the pleasure of walkinghome with John. Beside, practice had made itpossible for her to hear without heeding, and in thatway she escaped a great deal of annoyance.</p><p>This especial Wednesday evening, however, shehad not been able to close her ears to all that wassaid. She had grown restless, and looked about thenarrow whitewashed room where the lecture wasgiven, and longed for the reverence of the starlitsilence outside.</p><p>John had begun the meeting by a short prayer,simple, and direct as a child's request to his father,and after a hymn he said a few words on the text he had chosen. Then
the meeting was open, and to some of the things said, Helen listened with indignantdisapproval. As they walked home, rejoicing in thefresh cold air and the sound of their quick foot-steps on the frosty ground, she made up her mindwhat she meant to do, but she did not speak of ituntil they were by their own fireside.</p><p>The room was full of soft half-darkness; shadowsleaped out of the corners, and chased the gleams offirelight; the tall clock ticked slowly in the corner,and on the hearts of these two fell that contentwith life and each other which is best expressed bysilence.</p><pb n="96 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>John sat at his wife's feet; his tired head wasupon her knee, and he could look up into her rest-ful face, while be held one of her hands across hislips. It was a good face to see: her clear browneyes were large and full, with heavy lids whichdrooped a little at the outer corners, giving a lookof questioning sincerity, which does not often out.last childhood. Her bronze-brown hair was knottedlow.on her neck, and rippled a little over a smoothwhite forehead.</p><p>John had begun to stroke her hand softly, holding it up to shield
his eyes from the firelight, and twisting the plain band of her
wedding ring about.</p><p>"What a dear hand," he said; "how strong
andfirm it is I"</p><p>"It is large, at least," she answered,
smiling.He measured it against his own gaunt thin hand,which always
had a nervous thrill in the pale fingers. "You see, they are about the
same size, butmine is certainly much whiter. Just look at
thatink-stain; that means you write too much. I don't'like you to be
so tired in the evenings, John."</p><p>"You rest me," he said, looking
up into her face."It is a rest even to sit here beside you. Do you know, Helen," he went on, after a moment's pause,"if I were in any pain, I mean any physical extremity, I would have
strength to bear it if I could hold your hand; it is so strong and steady."</p><p>She lifted her hand, and looked at it with amusedcuriosity, turning it about, "to get the best lightupon it."</p><p>"I am in earnest," John said, smiling. "It is the<pb n="97 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>visible expression of the strength you are to me.With your help I could endure any pain. I wonder,"he went on, in a lower voice, as though thinkingaloud, "if this strength of yours could inspire meto bear the worst pain there could be for me,--Imean if I had to make you suffer in any way?"</p><p>Helen looked down at him, surprised, not quiteunderstanding.</p><p>"Suppose," he said,--" of course one can supposeanything,--that for your best good I had to makeyou suffer:could I, do you think?"</p><p>"I hope so," she answered gravely; "I hope Ishould give you strength to do it."</p><p>They fell again into their contented silence, watching the
firelight, and thinking tenderly each of the other. But at last Helen roused herself from herreverie with a long, pleasant sigh of entire peaceand comfort.</p><p>"John, do you know, I have reached a conclu-sion? I 'm not going to prayer-meeting any more."John started. "Why, Helen I" he said, a thrillof pain in his voice.</p><p>But Helen was not at all troubled. "No, dear.Feeling deeply as I do about certain things, it isworse than useless for me to go and hear ElderDean or old Mr. Smith; they either annoy me oramuse me, and I don't know which is worse. I haveheard Mr. Smith thank the Lord that we are notamong the pale and sheeted nations of the dead,ever since I came to Lockhaven. And Elder Dean'spictures of the eternal torments of the damned,'souls wreathing in sulphurous flames' (those were<pb n="98 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/> 
his words to-night, John!), and then praising Godfor his justice (his justice!) right afterwards,--Icannot stand it, dear. I do not believe in hell,such a hell, and so it is absurd to go and listenfo such things. But I won't miss my walk withyou," she added, "for I will come and meet youevery Wednesday evening, and we'll come home to.gether."</p><p>John had risen as she talked, and stood leaningagainst the mantel, his face hidden by his hand.Her lightly spoken words had come with such ashock, the blood leaped back to his heart, and for amoment he could not speak. He had never allowedhimself to realize that her indifference to doctrinewas positive unbelief; had his neglect encouragedher ignorance to grow into this?</p><p>At last he said very gently, "But, dearest, I believe in hell."</p><p>"I know it," she answered, no longer carelessly,but still smiling, "but never mind. I mean, it doesnot make any difference to me what you believe. Iwould n't care if you were a Mohammedan, John, if ithelped you to be good and happy. I think thatdifferent people have different religious necessities.One man is born a Roman Catholic, for instance,though his father and mother may be the sternestProtestants. He cannot help it; it is his nature IAnd you" - she looked up at him with infinite tenderness in her brown eyes,- "you were born aPresbyterian, dear; you can't help it. Perhaps youneed the sternness and the horror of some of thedOotrines as a balance for your gentleness. I neverknew any one as gentle as you, John."</p><pb n="99 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>He came and knelt down beside her, holding herface between his hands, and looking into her cleareyes. "Helen," he said, "I have wanted to speakto you of this; I have wanted to show you thetruth. You will not say you cannot believe in hell(in justice, Helen) when I prove"--</p><p>"Don't prove," she interrupted him, putting herhand softly across his lips, "don't let us argue. Oh,a theological argument seems to me sacrilege, anddogma can never be an antidote for doubt, John. Imust believe what my own soul asserts, or I am untrue to myself. I
must begin with that truth, even if it keeps me on the outskirts of the great Truth.Don't you think so, dear? And I do not believe inhell. Now that is final, John."</p><p>She smiled brightly into his troubled face, and,seeing his anxiety, hastened to save him further painin the future.  Do not let us ever discuss thbethings.  After al, dootrine is of so little importanre, and argument never can result in convictionto either of us, for belief is a matter of tempera-ment, and I do so dislike it. It really distressesme, John."</p><p>"But, dearest," he said, "to deliberately turnaway from the search for truth is spiritual suicide."</p><p>"Oh, you misunderstand me," she replied quickly."Of course one's soul always seeks for truth, but toargue, to discuss details, which after all are of nopossible importance, no more part of the eternal verities than a
man's--buttons are of his character! Now, remember," with smiling severity, "neveragain I" She laid her head down on his shoulder.</p><pb n="100 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>"We are so happy, John, so happy; why should wedisturb the peace of life? Never mind what we.think on such matters; we have each other, dear!"</p><p>He was silenced; with her clinging arm abouthim, and her tender eyes looking into his, he couldnot argue; he was the lover, not the preacher.</p><p>He kissed her between her level brows; it waseasy to forget his duty! Yet his conscience protested faintly. "If you would only let me tell you"</p><p>"Not just now," she said, and Helen's voice wasa caress. "Do you remember how, that first timewe saw each other, you talked of belief?" It wasso natural to drift into reminiscence, kneeling therein the firelight by her side, John almost forgot howthe talk had begun, and neither of them gave athought to the lateness of the hour, until they wereroused by a quick step on the path, and heard thelittle gate pushed hurriedly open, shutting againwith a bang.</p><p>"Why, that's Gifford Woodhouse," John said,leaning forward to give the fire that inevitable pokewih which the eoaing guest is welcomed.</p><p>"No, it can't be Giff," Helen answered, listening;"he always whistles."</p><p>But it was Gifford. The quick-leaping flamelighted his face as he entered, and Helen saw that,instead of its usual tranquil good-nature, there wasa worried look.</p><p>"I'm afraid I'm disturbing you," he said, as theyboth rose to welcome him, and there was the littleconfusion of lighting the lamp and drawing up achair. "Have n't I interrupted you?"</p><pb n="101 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"Yes," John replied simply, "but it is well youdid. I have some writing I must do to-night, and Ihad forgotten it. You and Helen will excuse meif I leave you a little while?"</p><p>Both the others protested: Gifford that he wasdriving Mr. Ward from his own fireside, and Helenthat it was too late for work.</p><p>"No, you are not driving me away. My papersare up-stairs. I will see you again," he added, turning to Gifford; and then he closed the door, andthey heard his step in the room above.</p><p>The interruption had brought him back to reallife. He left the joy which befogged his conscience,and felt again that chill and shock which Helen'swords had given him, and that sudden pang of remorse for a neglected duty; he wanted to be alone,and to face his own thoughts. His writing did notdetain him long, and afterwards he paced the chillyroom, strggling to see his duty through his love.But in that half hour up-stairs he reached no newconclusion. Helen's antipathy to doctrine was somarked, it was, as she said, useless to begin discussion; and it would
be worse than useless to urge herto come to prayer-meeting, if she did not want to; itwould only make her antagonistic to the truth. Shewas not ready for the strong meat of the Word,which was certainly what his elders fed to hungrysouls at prayer-meetings. John did not know thatthere was any reluctance in his own mind to disturbtheir harmony and peace by argument; he simplyfailed to recognize his own motives; the reasons hegave himself were all secondary.</p><pb n="102 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"I ought not to have come so late," Gifford said,"and it is a shame to disturb Mr. Ward, but I didwant to see you so much, Helen I"</p><p>Helen's thoughts were following her husband, andit was an effort to bring them back to Gifford andhis interests, but she turned her tranquil face to himwith a gracious gentleness which never left her."He will come back again," she said, "and he willbe glad to have this writing off his mind to-night. Iwas only afraid he might take cold; you know hehas a stubborn little cough. Why did you want tosee me, Giff?"</p><p>She took some knitting from her work-table, and,shaking out its fleecy softness, began to work, thebig wooden needles making a velvety sound as theyrubbed together. Gifford was opposite her, his handsthrust moodily into his pockets, his feet stretchedstraight out, and his head sunk on his breast. Buthe did not look as though he were resting; an intentanxiety seemed to pervade his big frame, and Helencould not fail to observe it. She glanced at him, ashea sat frowning into the fire, but he did not noticeher.</p><p>"Something troubles you, Gifford"</p><p>He started. "Yes," he said. He changed hisposition, leaning his elbows on his knees, and propping his chin on
his fists, and still scowling at thefire. "Yes, I came to speak to you about it."</p><p>"I wish you would," Helen answered. But Gifford found it difficult to begin.</p><p>"I've had a letter from aunt Ruth to-day," hesaid at last, "and it has bothered me. I don't know<pb n="103 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>how to tell you, exactly; you will think it's none ofmy business."</p><p>"Is there anything wrong at the rectory?" Helenasked, putting down her work, and drawing a quickbreath.</p><p>"Oh, no, no, of course not," answered Gifford,"nothing like that. The fact is, Helen--the factis--well plainly, aunt Ruth thinks that that youngForsythe is in love with Lois."</p><p>Gifford's manner, as he spoke, told Helen whatshe had only surmised before, and she was betrayedinto an involuntary expression of sympathy.</p><p>"Oh," cried the young man, with an impatientgesture and a sudden flush tingling across his face,"you misunderstand me. I have n't come to whineabout myself, or anything like that. I'm not jealous; for Heaven's
sake, don't think I am such a curas to be jealous! If that man--worthy
of Lois, I--why I'd be the first one to rejoice that she was happy. I
want Lois to be happy, from my soul! Ihope you believe me, Helen?"</p><p>"I believe anything you tell me," she answeredgently, "but I don't quite understand how you feelabout Mr. Forsythe; every one speaks so highly ofhim. Even aunt Deely has only pleasant things tosay of 'young Forsythe; as she calls him."</p><p>Gifford left his chair, and began to walk aboutthe room, his hands grasping the lapels of his coat,and his head thrown back in a troubled sort of impatience. "That's
just it," he said; "in this very letter aunt Ruth is enthusiastic, and I can't tell youanything. tangible against him, only I don't like<pb n="104 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>him, Helen. He's a puppy,--that's the amountof it. And I thought--I just thought--I'd comeand ask you if you supposed--if you--of courseI've no business to ask any question--but if youthought"--</p>
<p>But Helen had understood his vague inquiry."I should think," she said "you would know thatif he is what you call a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi> Lois could n't carefor him."</p><p>Gifford sat down,--and took her ball of wool, begining nervously to
unwind it, and then wind it up again.</p><p>"Perhaps she would n't see it," he said tentatively.</p><p>"Ah, you don't trust her!" Helen cried brightly,"or you would not say that. (Don't tie my worstedinto knots!) When you write to Lois, why don'tyou frankly say what you think of him?"</p><p>"Oh, I could not," he responded quickly. "Don't you see, Helen, I
'm a young fellow myself, and--and you know Lois did not care for me
when I--told her.  And if I said anything now, it would onlymean. that I was jealbou, that I wanted her myelf.Whereas, I give you my word," striking his fistsharply on his knee, "if he was fit for her, I'd rejoice; yes, I--I
love her so much that if I saw her happy with any other man (who was worthy ofher!) I'd be glad!"</p><p>Helen looked doubtful, but did not discuss that;she ran her hand along her needle, and gave herelastic work a pull. "Tell me more about him,"she said.</p><pb n="105 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>But Gifford had not much to tell; it was only hisvague distrust of the man, which it was difficult toput into words. "A good out-and-out sinner onecan stand," he ended; "but all I saw of this Forsythe at the club and about town only made me sethim down as a small man, a--a puppy, as I saidAnd I thought I'd talk to you about it, because,when you write to Lois, you might just hint, youknow."</p><p>But Helen shook her head. "No, Gifford, thatnever does any good at all. And I do not believeit is needed. The only thing to do now is totrust Lois. I have no anxiety about her; if he iswhat you say, her own ideal will protect her. Ah,Giff, I'm disappointed in you. I should n't havethought you could doubt Lois."</p><p>"I don't" he cried, "only I am so afraid!"</p><p>"But you should n't--be afraid," Helen said, smiling; "a girl like
Lois could not love a man who wasnot good and noble. Perhps, Gifford," she ventured, after a moment's pause,--"perhaps it willbe all right for you, some time."</p><p>"No, no," he answered, "I don't dare to thinkof it."</p><p>Helen might have given him more courage, butJohn came in, and Gifford realized that it was verylate. "Helen has scolded me, Mr. Ward," he said,"and it has done me good."</p><p>John turned and looked at her. "Can shescold?" he said. And when Gifford glanced back,as he went down the street, he saw them still standing in the doorway in the starlight; Helen leaning
<pb n="106 JOHN  WARD, PREACHER"/>back a, little against John's arm, so that she mightsee his face. The clear warm pallor of her cheekglowed faintly in the frosty air.</p><p>Gifford sighed as he walked on. "They are veryhappy," he thought. "Well, that sort of happinessmay never be for me, but it is something to love agood woman. I have got that in my life, anyhow."</p><p>Helen's confidence in her cousin's instinct mightperhaps have been shaken had she known whatpleasure Lois found in the companionship of Mr.Forsythe, and how that pleasure was encouraged byall her friends. That very evening, while Giffordwas pouring his anxieties into her ear, Lois waslistening to Dick's pictures of the gayeties of sociallife; the "jolly times," as he expressed it, whichshe had never known.</p><p>Dr.Howe was reading, with an indignant exclamation occasionally, a scathing review of an action ofhis political candidate, and his big newspaper hid thetwo young people by the fire, so that he quite forgotthem. Max seemed to feel that the responsibility ofpropriety rested upon him, and he sat with his headoin Lois's knee, and his drowsy eyes blinking at Mr.Forsythe. His mistress pulled his silky ears gently,or knotted them behind his head, giving him a curiously astonished and grieved look, as though he feltshe trifled with his dignity; yet he did not movehis head, but watched, with no affection in his softbrown eyes, the young man who talked so eagerly toLois.</p><p>"That brute hates me," said Mr.Forsythe, "andyet I took the trouble to bring him a biscuit to-day.
<pb n="107 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>Talk of gratitude and affection in animals. Theydon't know what it means I"</p><p>"Max loves me," Lois answered, taking the setter's head between her hands.</p><p>"Ah, well, that 's different," cried Forsythe; "ofcourse he does. I'd like to know how he couldhelp it. He would n't be fit to live, if he did n't."</p><p>Lois raised the hand-screen she held, so thatDick could only see the curls about her foreheadand one small curve of her ear. "How hot the fireis!" she said.</p><p>Dr.Howe folded his newspaper with much crackling and widely opened arms. "Don't sit so near it.In my young days, the children were never allowedto come any nearer the fireplace than the outside ofthe hearth-rug." Then he began to read again, muttering, "Confound that reporter!"</p><p>Dick glanced at him, and then he said, in a low voiee, Max loves you because you are so kind tohim, MissLois; it is worth while to be a dog to haveyou"</p><p>"Give him bones?" Lois cried hurriedly. "Yes,it is too hot in here, father; don't you think so;don't you want me to open the window?"</p><p>Dr. Howe looked up, surprised. "If you want to,child," he said. "Dear me, I'm afraid I have notbeen very entertaining, Mr. Forsythe. What do youthink of this attack on our candidate? Contemptible,is n't it? What? I have no respect for any onewho can think it anything but abominable and outrageous."</p><p>"It's scandalous!" Dick answered,--and then<pb n="108 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>in a smiling whisper to Lois, he added, "I'm afraidto tell the doctor I'm a Democrat."</p>
<p>But when Lois was quite alone that night, shefound herself smiling in the darkness, and a thrill ofpride made her cheeks hotter than the fire haddone.</p>
<pb n="109 CHAPTER IX"/><p>"YES," said Miss Deborah Woodhouae, as shestood in the doorway of Miss Ruth's studio, "yes,we must give a dinner party, sister. It is certainlythe proper thing to do, now that the Forsythes aregoing back to the city. It is to be expected of us,sister."</p><p>"Well, I don't know that it is expected of us,"said Miss Ruth, who never agreed too readily to any
suggestion of Miss Deborah's; "but I think we ought tdo it. I meant to
have spoken to you about it"</p><p>Miss Ruth was washing some beushes, a task her soul abhorred, for
it was almost impossible to avoid some stain upon her apron or her hands; thoughto guard against the latter, she wore gloves. Thecorners of Miss Ruth's mouth were drawn downand her eyebrows lifted up, and her whole face wasa protest against her work. On her easel was acanvas, where she had begun a sketch purporting tobe apple-blossoms.</p><p>The studio was dark, for a mist of November rainblurred all the low gray sky. The wide southwestwindow, which ran the length of the woodshed (thispart of which was devoted to art), was streamingwith water, and though the dotted muslin curtainwas pushed as far back as it would go, very little<pb n="110 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>light straggled into the room. The dim engravingsof nymphs and satyrs, in tarnished frames, whichhad been hung here to make room in the house forMiss Ruth's own productions, could scarcely be distinguished in the gloom, and though the artist woreher glasses she could not see to work.</p><p>So she had pushed back her easel, and began tomake things tidy for Sunday. Any sign of disorderwould have greatly distressed Miss Ruth. Evenher paint-tubes were kept scrupulously bright andolean, and nothing was ever out of place. Perhaps this made the room in the woodshed a littledreary, certainly it looked so now to Miss Deborah,standing in the doorway, and seeing the gaunt white-washed walls, the bare rafters, and the sweepingrain against the window.</p><p>"Do, sister," she entreated, "come into the house,and let us arrange about the dinner."</p><p>"No," said Miss Ruth, sighing, "I must washthese brushes."</p><p>"Why not let Sarah do it?" asked the other,dtepping over a little stream of water which hadforoed itself under the threshold.</p><p>"Now, surely, sister," said Miss Ruth pettishly,"you know Sarah would get the color on the handles. But there! I suppose you don't know howartistic people feel about such things." She stoppedlong enough to take off her gloves and tie the stringsof her long white apron a little tighter about hertrim waist; then she went to work again.</p><p>"No, I suppose I don't understand," Miss Deb.orah acknowledged; "but never mind, we can talk<pb n="111 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>here, only it is a little damp. What do you thinkof asking them for Thursday? It is a good dayfor a dinner party. You are well over the washingand ironing, you know, and you have Wednesdayfor the jellies and creams, besides a good two hoursin the afternoon to get out the best china and seeto the silver. Friday is for cleaning up and puttingiings away, because Saturday one is always busygetting ready for Sunday."</p><p>Miss Ruth demurred. "I should rather have iton a Friday."</p><p>"Well, you don't know anything about the house-keeping part of it," said Miss Deborah, promptly."And I don't believe William Denner would wantto come then; you know he is quite superstitiousabout Friday. Beside, it is not convenient for me,"she added, settling the. matter once for all.</p><p>"Oh, I've no objection to Thursday" said MissRuth.  I don't know but that I prefer it.  Yes,we will have it on Thursday."  Having thus asserted herself, Miss Ruth began to put away herpaints and cover her canvas.</p><p>"It is a pity the whist was put off to-night,"said Miss Deborah; "we could have arranged it atthe rectory. But if I see Adele Dale to-morrow,I'll tell her."</p><p>"I beg," said Miss Ruth quickly, "that you'lldo nothing of the sort."</p><p>"What!" exclaimed Miss Deborah.</p><p>"We will write the invitations, if you please,"said Miss Ruth loftily.</p>"Fiddlesticks!" retorted the other.  "We'll
<pb n="112 JOHN WARD, PREACHER."/>write the Forsythes, of course, but the people at therectory and Adele Dale?--nonsense!"</p><p>"It is not nonsense," Miss Ruth answered; "it is<hi rend="italic">proper</hi>, and it must be done. I understand thesethings, Deborah; you are so taken up with yourcooking, you cannot really be expected to know.When you invite city people to a formal dinner,everything must be done decently and in order. Itis not like asking the rector and Adele to drop into te awwy time."</p><p>"Fudge I" responded Miss Deborah.</p><p>A faint color began to show in Miss Ruth's fadedcheek, and she set her lips firmly. "The invitations should be written," she said.</p><p>It was settled, as usual, by each sister doing exactly as she
pleased. Miss Deborah gave her invitations by word of mouth the next
day, standing in the rain, under a dripping umbrella, by the churchporch, while on Monday each of the desired guestsreceived a formal note in Miss Ruth's precise anddelicate hand, containing the compliments of theMisses Woodhouse, and a request for the honor oftheir company at dinner on Thurday, November12th, at half past six o'clock.</p><p>A compromise had been effected about the hour.Miss Ruth had insisted that it should be at eight,while Miss Deborah contended that as they dined,like all the rest of Ashurst, at noon, it was absurdto make it later than  ix, and Miss Ruth's utmost persuasion had only brought it to half past.</p><p>During these days of preparation Miss Ruth couldonly flutter upon the outskirts of the kitchen, which<pb n="113 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>just now was a solemn place, and her suggestionswere scarcely noticed, and never heeded. It washard to have no share in those long conversationsbetween Sarah and her sister, and not to know theresult of the mysterious researches among the receipts which had been written out on blue foolscap
and bound in marbledarteboard before Mis Deborah was born.</p><p>Her time, however, came. Miss Deborah ownedthat no one could arrange a table like Miss Ruth.The tall silver candlesticks with twisted arms, thefruit in the open-work china baskets, the slender-stemmed glasses for the wines, the decanters in thequeer oldecoasters, and the great bunch of chrysanthemums in the silver punch-bowl in the centre,--Bo one could plae them so perfectly as her sister.</p><p>"Ruth," she afirmed, "has a touch," and she contemplated the board
with great satisfaction.</p>
"Pray," said Miss Ruth, as she quietly put back in its place a fruit dish which Miss Deborah had"straightened," "pray where are Mr. Dale's comfits? They must be on the tray to be taken intothe parlor."</p><p>"Sarah will fetch them," answered Miss Deborah;and at that moment Sarah entered with the candyand a stately and elaborate dish, which she placedupon the sideboard.</p><p>"Poor, dear man," said Miss Ruth. "I supposehe never gets all the candy he wishes at home. Itrust there is plenty for to-night, sister ? But whatis that Sarah just brought in?"</p><p>"Well," Miss Deborah replied, with anxous pride<pb n="114 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>in her tone, "it is not Easter, I know, but it doeslook so well I thought I'd make it, anyhow. It isSic itur ad astra."</p>
<p>This dish had been "composed" by Miss Deborahmany years ago, and was considered by all herfriends her greatest triumph. Dr. Howe had christened it, declaring that it was of a semi-religiousnature, but in Miss Deborah's pronunciation theLatin was no longer recognizable.</p><p>It consisted of an arrangement of strips of candied orange and lemon peel, intended to represent anest of straw. Oh it were placed jellied creams indifferent colors, which had been run into egg-shellsto stiffen. The whole was intended to suggest anest of new-laid eggs.  The housekeeper will atonce recognize the trouble and expense of such adish, as the shells which served for moulds had firstto be emptied of their contents through a small holein one end, hopelessly mixing the whites and yolks,and leaving them useless for fine cookery.</p><p>No wonder, then, that Miss Deborah's face beamedwith pride  But Miss Ruth's showed nothing butcontempt. "That--that--barn-door dish!" sheejaculated.</p><p>"Barn-door?" faltered Miss Deborah.</p><p>"Barn-yard, I mean," said her sister sternly. The idea of having such a thing I Easter is theonly excuse for it. It is undignified,--it is absurd,--it is--it is preposterous!"</p><p>"It is good," Miss Deborah maintained stoutly.</p><p>"I don't deny that," said Miss Ruth, thinkingthey would have it for dinner the next day, and per-<pb n="115 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>haps the next also,--for it takes more than one dayfor a family of two to eat up the remnants of adinner party,--"but you must see it is out of placeat a formal dinner. It must not appear."</p><p>Discussion was useless. Each was determined,for each felt her particular province had been invaded. And each
carried her point.  The dish didnot appear on the table, yet every guest was askedif he or she would have some "Sicituradastra"--forto the housemaid it was one word--which was onthe sideboard.</p><p>But the anxieties of the dinner were not overeven when the table was as beautiful and stately ascould be desired, and Miss Deborah was consciousthat every dish was perfect. The two little ladies,tired, but satisfied, had yet to dress. Sarah had putthe best black silks on the bed in each room, but forthe lighter touches of the toilette the sisters weretheir own judge Miss Deborah must decide whatlaces she should wear, and long did Miss Ruthstand at her dressing-table, wondering whether topin the pale lavender ribbon at her throat or the silver-gray one.</p><p>Miss Deborah was dressed first. She wore a miniature of her great-grandfather as a pin, and herlittle fingers were covered with rings, in strange old-fashioned settings. Her small figure had an unusualdignity in the lustrous silk, which was turned awayat the neck, and filled with point-lace that lookedlike frosted cobwebs. The sleeves of her gown werefull, and gathered into a wristband over point-laceraffies which almost hid her little hands, folded<pb n="116 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>primly in front of her. "Little bishops" MissDeborah called these sleeves, and she was apt to saythat, for her part, she thought a closely fitting sleevewas hardly modest. Her full skirt rustled, as, holding herself very straight, she came into her sister'sroom, that they might go down together.</p><p>Miss Ruth was still in her gray linsey-woolseypetticoat, short enough to show her trim ankles intheir black open-worked silk stockings. She stoodwith one hand resting on the open drawer of herbureau, and in the other the two soft bits of ribbon,that held the faint fragrance of rose leaves whichclung to all her possessions. Miss Ruth would neverhave confessed it, but she was thinking that Mr.Forsythe was a very genteel young man, and shewished she knew which ribbon would be more becoming.</p><p>"Ruth!" said Miss Deborah, in majestic disapproval.</p><p>The younger sister gave a little jump of fright,and dropped the ribbons hastily, as though shefeared Miss Deborah had detected her thoughts. "I--I'll be ready directly, sister."</p><p>"I hope so, indeed," said Miss Deborah severely,and moved with deliberate dignity from the room,while Miss Ruth, much fluttered, took her dress fromthe high bedstead, which had four cherry-wood posts,carved in alternate balloons and disks, and a stripeddimity valance.</p><p>She still realized the importance of the rightribbon, and the responsibility of choice oppressedher; but it was too late for any further thought.<pb n="117 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
She shut her eyes tight, and, with a trembling littlehand, picked up the first one she touched. Satisfied,since Fate so decided it, that gray was the rightcolor, she pinned it at her throat with an old broochof chased and twisted gold, and gave a last glanceat her swinging glass before joining her sister in theparlor. The excitement had brought a faint flushinto her soft cheek, and her eyes were bright, andthe gray ribbon had a pretty gleam in it. MissRuth gave her hair a little pat over each ear, andfelt a thrill of forgotten vanity.</p><p>"It's high time you were down, Ruth," criedMiss Deborah, who stood on the rug in front of theblazing fire, rubbing her hands nervously together,--"high time I"</p><p>"Why, they won't be here for a quarter of anhour yet, sister," protested Miss Ruth.</p><p>"Well, you should be here I do hope they won't be late; the vension is to be taken out of thetin kitchen precisely at five minutes of seven. Do,pray, sister, step into the hall and see what o'clockit is. I really am afraid they are late."</p><p>Miss Ruth went, but had scarcely crossed thethreshold when Miss Deborah cried, "Come back,come back, Ruth! You must be here when theycome," and then bustled away herself to fetch thehousemaid to be ready to open the door, though, asMiss Ruth had said, it was a good quarter of an hourbefore the most impatient guest might be expected.</p><p>Miss Ruth went about, straightening a chair, orpulling an antimacassar to one side or the other, orputting an ornament in a better ligh  and then stop<pb n="118 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>ping to snuff the candles in the brass sconces oneither side of the old piano. This and her anxietyabout the venison fretted Miss Deborah so much, itwas a great relief to hear the first carriage, andcatch a glimpse of Mrs. Dale hurrying across thehall and up the stairs, her well-known brown satintucked up to avoid a speck of mud or dust.</p><p>Miss Deborah plucked Miss Ruth's sleeve, and,settling the lace at her own throat and wrists, badeher sister stand beside her on the rug. "And do,dear Ruth, try and have more repose of manner,"she said, breathing quite quickly with excitement.</p><p>When Mrs.Dale entered, rustling in her shinysatin, with Mr. Dale shambling along behind her,the sisters greeted her with that stately affectionwhich was part of the occasion.</p><p>"So glad to see you, dear Adele," said Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth in turn; and Mrs. Dale re-sponded with equal graciousness, and no apparentrecollection that they had almost quarreled thatvery morning at the post-office, when Mrs.Dale saidthat the first cloth to be removed at a dinner shouldbe folded in fours, and Miss Deborah that it shouldbe folded in threes.</p><p>Mr.Denner was the next to arrive, and while hewas still making his bow the Forsythes came in;Dick looking over the heads of the little ladies, asthough in search of some one else, and his motherlanguidly acknowledging that it was an effort tocome out in the evening. Lois and the rector camewith Colonel Drayton, and Miss Deborah breathed asigh of relief that the venison would not be keptwaiting.</p><pb n="119 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>Then Miss Deborah took Mrs.Forsythe's arm,while Miss Ruth and Dick closed the little procession, and they marched into the dining-room, andtook their places about the table, glittering with silver and glass, and lighted by gleaming wax tapers.It had not occurred to the little ladies to place Dicknear Lois. Mrs. Drayton was the lady upon hisright and Lois was between such unimportant people as Mr. Denner and Mr. Dale.</p><p>Dick was the lion of the dinner, and all that hesaid was listened to with deference and even awe.But it was a relief to Lois not to have to talk tohim. She sat now at Mr. Denner's side, listening tothe small stream of words bubbling along in a cheerful monotony, with scarcely a period for her answers.She was glad it was so; for though her apple-blossom face was drooped a little, and her gray eyeswere not ofteu lifted, and she looked the embodimentof maiden innocence and unworldliness, Lois wasthinking the thoughts which occupied her much oflate; weighing, and judging, struggling to reachsome knowledge of herself, yet always in the sameperplexity. Did she love Dick Forsythe? Therewas no doubt in her mind that she loved the life herepresented; but further than this she could not go.Yet he was so kind, she thought, and loved her somuch. If, then and there, Dick could have whis.pered the question which was trembling on his lips,Lois was near enough to love to have said Yes.</p><p>Dinner was nearly over; that last desultory conversation had begun, which was to be ended by abow from Miss Deborah to Mrs. Forsythe, and the<pb n="120 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>ladies wete dipping their nuts in their wine, halflistening, and half watching for the signal to rise.</p><p>"How much we miss Gifford on such an occasion!" said Mr.Dale to Miss Ruth.</p><p>"Yes," replied the little lady, "dear Giff I HowI wish he were here I He would so enjoy meetingMr.Forsythe"</p><p>Lois smiled involuntarily, and the current of herthoughts suddenly turned. She saw again the fragrant dusk of the rectory garden, and heard theind i the silver poplar and the tremble in a strongvoice at her side.</p><p>She was as perplexed as ever when the ladieswent back to the parlor. Mrs.Forsythe came toher, as they passed through the hall, and took theyoung girl's hand in hers.</p><p>"I shall miss you very much this winter, Lois,"she said, in her mildly complaining voice. "Youhave been very good to me; no daughter could havebeen more thoughtful. And I could not have loveda daughter of my own more." She gently pattedthe hand she held. "Dick is not very happy, mydear."</p><p>"I'm sorry," faltered Lois.</p><p>They had reached the parlor door, and Mrs. Forsythe bent her head towards the girl's ear. "I hope--I trust--he will be, before we leave Ashurst."</p><p>Lois turned away abruptly; how could she grievethis gentle invalid!</p><p>"She'll find out what Arabella Forsythe is, oneof these days," Mrs.Dale thought, "but it's just aswell she should love her for the present." Nor did<pb n="121 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>she lose the opportunity of using her influence tobring about the desired consummation.</p><p>Lois had gone, at Miss Deborah's request, to thepiano, and begun to sing, in her sweet girlish voice,some old-fashioned songs which the sisters liked.</p><p>"Jamie's on the stormy sea!" sang Lois, buther voice trembled, and she missed  note, for Mrs.Dale had left the group of ladies about the fire, andbent over her shoulder.</p><p>"You know they go on Saturday, Lois," she said."Do, now, I beg of you, be a sensible girl. I neversaw a man so much in love. You will be perfectlyhappy, if you will only be sensible I I hope youwill be at home alone to-morrow."</p><p>When the gentlemen entered, Dick Forsythe wasquick to make his way to Lois, sitting in the glim-mer of the wax-lights in the sconces, at the oldpiano.</p><p>She stopped, and let her hands fall with a softcrash on the yellow keys.</p><p>"Do go on," he pleaded.</p><p>"No," she said, "it is too cold over here; letus come to the fire," and she slipped away to herfather's side. After that she was silent until it wastime to say good-night, for no one expected her tospeak, although Dick was the centre of the group,and did most of the talking. Later in the eveningthey had some whist, and after that, just before theparty broke up, Mr.Denuer was asked to sing.</p><p>He rose, coughed deprecatingly, and glanced side-wise at Mr.Forsythe; he feared he was out of tune.</p><p>But Miss Deborah insisted with great politeness<pb n="122 JORN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"If Miss Ruth would be so good as to accompanyme," said Mr. Denner, "I might at least make theattempt."</p><p>Miss Ruth was shy about playing in public, butMr.Denner encouraged her. "You must overcomeyour timidity, my dear Miss Ruth," he said. "I--Iam aware that it is quite painful; but one ought notto allow it to become a habit, as it were. It shouldbe conquered in early life."</p><p>So Miss Ruth allowed him to lead her to thepiano. There was a little stir about finding themusic, before they were ready to begin; then Mr.Denner ran his fingers through his brown wig, and,placing his small lean hands on his hips, rockedback and forth on his little heels, while he sang ina sweet but somewhat light and uncertain voice,--</p><p>"Lassie wi' the lint-white looks,Bonnie lassie! artless lassie!Will ye wi' me tent the flocks,Will ye be my dearie, O?"</p><p>This was received with great applause; then everyone said good-night, assuring each sister that it hadbeen a delightful evening; and finally the last carriage rolled off into the darkness, and the MissesWoodhouse were left, triumphantly exhausted, todiscuss the dinner and the guests.</p><p>The rector walked home with Mr. Denner, whowas still flushed with the praise of his singing, soLois had the carriage all to herself, and tried tostruggle against the fresh impulse of irresolutionwhich Mrs.Forsythe's whispered "Good-night, Lois;be good to my boy I" had given her.</p><pb n="123 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>She went into the library at the rectory, and, throwing off her wrap, sat down on the hearth-rug, anddetermined to make up her mind. But first she hadto put a fresh log on the andirons, and then workaway with the wheezy old bellows, until a leapingflame lighted the shadowy room. The log was green,and, instead of deciding, she found herslf listeningto the soft bubbling noise of the sap, and thinkingthat it was the little singing ghosts of the summerbirds. Max came and put his head on her knee, tobe petted, and Lois's thoughts wandered off to thedinner party, and Mr.Denner's singing, and whatgood things Miss Deborah cooked, and how muchhis aunts must miss Gifford; so that she did noteven hear the front door open, or know that DickForsythe had entered, until she heard Max snarl,and some one said, in a tone which lacked its usual assurance, "I--I hope I'm not disturbing you, Miss Lois?"</p><p>She was on her feet before he had a chance tohelp her rise, and looked at him with the frankestastonishment and dismay.</p><p>What would aunt Deely say, what would MissDeborah think! A young woman receiving a gentleman alone after ten at night! "Father is not homeyet," she said hastily, so confused and startled shescarcely knew what she was saying. "How dark itis in here I The fire has dazzled my eyes. I'll geta light."</p><p>"Oh, don't," he said; "I like the firelight."But she had gone, and came back again with Sally,who carried the lamps, and looked very much sur-<pb n="124 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>   
prised, for Sally knew Ashurst ways better thanMr.Forsythe did: her young man always went homeat nine.</p><p>"How pleasant it was at Miss Deborah's!" Loisbegan, when Sally had gone out, and she was leftalone to see the anxiety in Dick's face. "Nobody hassuch nice dinners as Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth."Lois's voice was not altogether firm, yet, to her ownsurprise, she began to feel quite calm, and almostindieeon; she knew why Dick had come, but shedid'not even then kow what her answer would be.</p><p>"Yes--no--I don't, know," he answered. " Thefact is, I only seemed to live, Miss Lois, until I couldget here to see you to-night. I heard your fathersay he was going home with Denner, and I thoughtyou'd be alone. So I came. I could not stand anymore suspense!" he added, with something like asob in his voice.</p><p>Lois's heart gave one jump of fright, and thenwas quiet. She thought, vaguely, that she was gladhe had rushed into it at once, so that she need notkeep up that terrible fencing, but she did not speak.,She had been sitting in a corner of the leather-covered sofa, and his excitement, as he id lookingat her, made her rise.</p><p>He grasped her hands in his, wringing them.sharply as he spoke, not even noticing her little cryof pain, or her efforts to release herself. "Youknow I love you,--you know it I Why have n't youlet me tell you so? Oh, Lois, how lovely you areto-night,--how happy we shall be!"</p><p>He kissed one of her hands with a sudden savage<pb n="125 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>passion that frightened her. "Oh--don't," shesaid, shrinking back, and pulling her hands awayfrom him.</p><p>He looked at her blankly a moment, but when hespoke again it was gently. "Did I frighten you?,I did n't mean to; but you know I love you. Thathas n't startled you? Tell me you car for me, Lois."</p>
<p>"But-but"--said Lois, sorry and ashamed,I--don't!"</p><p>The eager boyish face, so near her own, flushedwith sudden anger. "You don't? You must! Why--why, I love you. It cannot be that you reallydon't--tell me?"</p><p>But there was no doubt in Lois's mind now. "Indeed, Mr. Forsythe," she said, "indeed, I amso sorry, but I don't--I can't"</p><p>A sullen look clouded his handsome face.  "Icannot believe it," be said, at length.  "You haveknown that I loved you all summer; you cannot beso cruel as to trifle with me now. You will nottreat me so. Oh, I love you!" There was almosta wail in his voice, and he threw himself down in achair and covered his face with his hands.</p><p>Lois did not speak. Her lip curled a little, butit was partly with contempt for herself and her pastuncertainty. "I am so sorry, so grieved," she began.But he scarcely heard her, or at least he did notgrasp the significance of her words.</p><p>He began to plead and protest. "We will be sohappy if you will only care for me. Just think howdiferent your life will be; you shall have everythingin this world you want, Lois."</p>      
<pb n="126 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>She could not check his torrent of words, and when at last he stopped he had almost convincedhimself that she loved him.</p><p>But she shook her head. "I cannot tell you howdistressed I am, but I do not love you."</p><p>He was silent, as though trying to understand.</p><p>"Won't you try and forget it?

Is that thereason?"</p><p>"That has nothing to do with it," Lois cried,hotly, "but I don't."</p><p>"Then," said Dick eagerly, "you must love me,only you don't recognize it, not having been in lovebefore. Of course it's different with a girl whodoes n't know what love is. Oh, say you do!"</p><p>Lois, with quick compunction for her anger, wasgentle enough now. "I cannot say so. I wish youwould forget me, and forgive me if you can. I'msorry to have grieved you,--truly I am."</p><p>There was silence for a few minutes, only brokenby a yawn from Max and the snapping of the fire.</p><p>"I tell you I cannot forget," the young man said,at last. "You have ruined my life for me. Do youthink I'll be apt to forget the woman that's donethat? I'll love you always, but life is practicallyover for me. Remember that, the next time youamuse yourself, Miss Howe!" Then, without another word, he turned on his heel and left her.</p><p>Lois drew a long breath as she heard him slamthe front door behind him, and then she sat down onthe rug again. She was too angry to cry, thoughher hands shook with nervousness. But under allher excitement was the sting of mortification andremorse.</p><p>Max, with that strange understanding which ani-<pb n="128 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>mals sometimes show, suddenly turned and licked her face, and then looked at her, all his love speaking in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>"Oh, Max, dear," Lois cried, flinging her armsremorse.</p><p>Max, with that strange understanding which ani-<pb n="128 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>mals sometimes show, suddenly turned and lickedher face, and then looked at her, all his love speaking in his soft brown eyes.</p><p>"Oh, Max, dear," Lois cried, flinging her arms

<p>DR. HOWE, with no thought of Mr.Forsythe'shead, "what a comfort you are I How much nicerdogs are than men!"</p><pb n="[129] CHAPTER X"/><p>DR.HOWE, with no thought of Mr. Forsythe'sunceremonious call at the rectory, had gone homewith Mr.Denner. "One needs a walk," he said,"after one of Miss Deborah's dinners. Bless mysoul, what a housekeeper that woman is I"</p><p>"Just so," said Mr.Denner, hurrying along athis side,--"just so. Ah--it has often occurredto me."</p><p>And when the rector had left him at his whitegateway between the Lombardy poplars, Mr.Dennersoul, what a housekeeper that woman is!"</p><p>"Just so," said Mr. Denner, hurrying along athis side,--"just so.

Itwas very lonely. Willie Denner, of course, had<pb n="130 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>long ago gone to bed, and unless the lawyer choseto go into the kitchen for company, where Mary wasreading her one work of fiction, "The Accounts ofthe Death Beds of Eminent Saints," he had no oneto speak to. Many a time before had he sat thus,pondering on the solitude of his life, and contrastinghis house with other Ashurst homes. He glancedabout his cold bare room, and thought of the parlorof the Misses Woodhouse. How pleasant it was,how bright, and full of pretty feminine devices whereas his library--Mary had been a hard mistress. One by one the domestic decorations of thelate lady of the house had disappeared. She couldwhereas his library--Mary had been a hard mistress. One by one the domestic decorations of the late lady of the house had disappeared. She couldnot "have things round a-trapin' dust," Mary said,and her word was law.</p><p>"If my little sister had lived," he said, crouchingnearer the fire, and watching a spark catch in thesoot and spread over the chimney-back like a littlemarching regiment, that wheeled and manoeuvred,and then suddenly vanished, "it would have beendifferent. She would have made things brighter.Perhaps she would have painted, like Miss Ruth;and I have no doubt she would have been an excellent housekeeper. We should have just livedquietly here, she and I, and I need never havethought"--Mr.Denner flushed faintly in the fire-light--"of marriage."</p><p>Mr.Denner's mind had often traveled as far asand I have no doubt she would have been an excellent housekeeper. We should havejust lived quietly here, she and I, and I need never havethought"--Mr. Denner flushed faintly in the fire-light--" of marriage."</p><p>Mr. Denner's mind had often traveled as far asthis; he had even gone to the point of saying tohimself that he wished one of the Misses Woodhousewould regard him with sentiments of affection, andhe and Willie, free from Mary, could have a home<pb n="131 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>of their own, instead of forlornly envying the rectorand Henry Dale.</p><p>But Mr. Denner had never said which Miss Woodhouse; he had always thought of them, as he wouldhave expressed it, "collectively," nor could he havetold which one he most admired,--he called it byno warmer name, even to hiself.</p><p>But as he sat here alone, and remembered the pleasant evening he had had, and watched his firesmoulder and die, and heard the soft sigh of the rising wind, he reached a tremendous conclusion. Hewould make up his mind. He would decide whichof the Misses Woodhouse possessed his deeper regard. "Yes," he said, as he lifted first one footand then the other over the fender, and, pulling his little coat-tails forward under his arms, stood withhis back to the fireplace,--"yes, I will make upmy mind; I will make it up to-morrow. I cannotgo on in this uncertain way. I cannot allow myselfto think of Miss Ruth, and how she would painther pictures, and play my accompaniments, and thenfind my mind on Miss Deborah's dinners. It is impracticable; it is almost improper. To-morrow Iwill decide."</p><p>To have reached this conclusion was to have accomplished a great deal.</p><p>Mr.Denner went to bed much cheered; but he
dreamed of walking about Miss Ruth's studio, andadmiring her pictures, when, to his dismay, he foundMary had followed him, and was saying she could n'tbear things all of a clutter.</p><p>The next morning he ate his breakfast in solemn<pb n="132 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>haste; it was to be an important day for him. Hewatched Mary as she walked about, handing himdishes with a sternness which had always awed himinto eating anything she placed before him, andwondered what she would think when she heard--He trembled a little at the thought of breaking it toher; and then he remembered Miss Ruth's kindheart, and he had a vision of a pension for Mary,which was checked instantly by the recollection ofMiss Deborah's prudent economy.</p><p>"Ah, well," he thought, "I shall know to-night.Economy is a good thing,--Miss Ruth herself wouldnot deny that."</p><p>He went out to his office, and weighed and balanced his
inclinations until dinner-time, and again inthe afternoon, but with no result. Night found him hopelessly confused, with the added grievance thathe had not kept his word to himself.</p><p>This went on for more than a week; by and bythe uncertainty began to wear greatly upon him.</p><p>"Dear me!" he sighed one morning, as he sat in his office, his little gaitered feet upon the rusty topof his air-tight stove, and his brierwood pipe at his lips--it had gone out, leaving a bowl of cheerlesswhite ashes,--" dear me! I no sooner decide that ithad better be Miss Deborah-for how satisfying my linen would be if she had an eye on the laundry,and I know she would not have bubble-and-squeakfor dinner as often as Mary does-than Miss Ruthcomes into my mind. What taste she has, and
what an ear! No one notices the points in my singing as she does; and how she did turn that carpetin Gifford's room; dear me!"</p>
<pb n="133 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>He sat clutching his extinguished pipe for many minutes, when suddenly a gleam came into his face,and the anxious look began to disappear.</p><p>He rose, and laid his pipe upon the mantelpiece,first carefully knocking the ashes into the wood-boxwhich stood beside the stove. Then, standing withhis left foot wrapped about his right ankle and hisface full of suppressed eagerness, he felt in eachpocket of his waistcoat, and produced first a knife,then a tape measure, a pincushion, a bunch of keys,and last a large, worn copper cent. It was smoothwith age, but its almost obliterated date still showedthat it had been struck the year of Mr.Denner'sbirth.</p><p>Next, he spread his pocket handkerchief smoothly
upon the floor, and then, a little stiffly, knelt uponit. He rubbed the cent upon the cuff of his coat
to make it shine, and held it up a moment in the stream of wintry
sunshine that poured through the office window and lay in a golden square on thebare floor.</p><p>"Heads," said Mr.Denner,--"heads shall beto make it shine, and held it up a moment in thestream of wintry sunshine that poured through the,office window and lay in a golden square on thebare floor.</p><p>As he said this, he pitched the coin with a tremulous hand, and
then leaned forward, breathlessly watching it fall, waver from side to
side, and roll slowly under the bookcase. Too much excited torise from his knees, he crept towards it, and, pressing his cheek
against the dusty floor, he peered under the unwieldy piece of
furniture, to catch a glimpse of his penny and learn his fate.</p><pb n="134 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>At such a critical moment it was not surprisig
that he did not hear Willie Denner come into theoffice. The little boy stood still, surprised at hisuncle's attitude. "Have you lost something, sir?"he said, but without waiting for an answer, he fellon his knees and looked also.</p><p>"Oh, I see,--your lucky penny; I'll get it foryou in a minute."</p> 
<p>And stretching out flat upon his stomach, hewriggled almost under the bookcase, while Mr.Denner rose and furtively brshed the dukt from hisknees.</p><p>"Here it is, uncle William," Willie said, emerging from the shadow
of the bookcase; "it was clear against the wall, and 'most down in a crack."</p><p>Mr. Denner took the penny from the child, andrubbed it nervously between his hands.</p><p>"I suppose," he inquired with great hesitation,"you did not chance to observe, William, which--ah--which side was up?"</p><p>"No, sir," answered Willie, with amazement written on his little
freckled face; "it had n't fallen, you know, uncle; it was just
leaning against the wall. I came in to bring my Latin exercise," hewent on. "I'll run back to school now, sir."</p><p>He was off like a flash, saying to himself in amystified way, "I wonder if uncle William playsheads and tails all alone in the offiee?"</p><p>Mr. Denner stood holding the penny, and gazingblankly at it, unconscious of the dust upon hischeek.</p><p>"That did not decide it," he murmured. "I musttry something else."</p>
<pb n="135 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>For Mr. Denner had some small superstitions,and it is doubtful if he would have questioned fateagain in the same way, even if he had not been interrupted at that moment by the rector.</p>
<p>Dr. Howe came into the office beating his handsto warm them, his face ruddy and bis breath shortfrom a walk in the cold wind. He had come to seethe lawyer about selling a bit of church land; Mr.Denner hastily slipped his penny into his pocket,and felt his face grow hot as he thought in what aposture the rector would have found him had hecome a few minutes sooner.</p><p>"Bless my soul, Denner," Dr. Howe said, when,the business over, he rose to go, "this den of yoursis cold!" He stooped to shake the logs in the smallstove, hoping to start a blaze. The rector wouldhave resented any man's meddling with his fire, butall Mr. Denner's friends felt a sort of responsibilityfor him, which he accepted as a matter of course.</p><p>"Ah, yes," replied Mr. Denner, "it is chilly here.It had not occurred to me, but it is chilly. Somepeople manage to keep their houses very comfortablein weather like this. It is always warm at the rectory, I notice, and at Henry Dale's, or--ah--the Misses Woodhouse's,--always warm."</p><p>The rector, taking up a great deal of room in thesmall office, was on his knees, puffing at the fireuntil his face was scarlet. "Yes, I don't believethat woman of yours half looks after your comfort, Denner. Can't be a good housekeeper, or she would not let this stove get so choked with ashes."</p><p>"No," Mr. Denner acknowledged--"ah--I am<pb n="136 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>inclined to agree with you, doctor. Not perhaps areally good housekeeper. But few women are,--very few. You do not find a woman like MissDeborah Woodhouse often, you know."</p><p>"True enough," said Dr.Howe, pulling on hisbig fur gloves. "That salad of hers, the othernight, was something to live for. What is that ?--'plunge his fingers in the salad bowl'--'tempt the dying anchorite to eat,'--I can't remember thelines, but that is how I feel about Miss Deborah'ssalad." The rector laughed in a quick, breezy bass,beat his hands together, and was ready to start.</p><p>"Yes," said Mr.Denner, "just so,--quite so.But Miss Deboralr is a remarkable woman, an estimable woman. One scarcely knows which is themore admirable, Miss Deborah or Miss Ruth. Whicshould you--ah--which do you most admire?"</p><p>The rector turned, with one hand on the doorknob, and looked at the lawyer, with a sudden gleamin his keen eyes. "Well, I am sure I don't know.I never thought of comparing them. They are both,as you say, estimable ladies."</p><p>"Oh, yes, yes, just so," aid Mr.Denner hurriedly. "I only mentioned it beause--it wasmerely in the most general way; I--I--did notmean to compare--oh, not at all--of course Ishould never discuss a lady's worth, as it were. Ispoke in confidence; I merely wondered what youropinion might be--not"--cried Mr. Denner,bursting into a cold perspiration of fright to see howfar his embarrassment had betrayed him--"notthat I really care to know! Oh, not at all!"</p><pb n="137 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>The rector flung his head back, and his rollickinglaugh jarred the very papers on Mr. Denner's desk.</p><p>"It is just as well you don't, for I am sure Icould not say. I respect them both immensely. Ihave from boyhood," he added, with a droll look.Mr. Denner coughed nervously.</p><p>"It is not of the slightest consequenoe," he explained,--"not the slightest. I spoke thoughtlessly; ah--unadvisedly."</p><p>"Of course, of course; I understand," cried therector, and forbore to add a good-natured jest at Mr.Denner's embarrassment, which was really painful.But when he was well out of hearing, he couldnot restrain a series of chuckles.</p><p>"By Jove!" he cried, clapping his thigh, "Denner I--Denner and Miss Deborah! Bless my soul,--Denner!"</p><p>His mirth, however, did not last long; some immediate annoyances
of his own forced themselves into his mind.</p><p>Before he went to the lawyer's office, he had hada talk with Mrs. Dale, which had not been pleasant;then a letter from Helen had come; and now ananxious wrinkle showed itself under his fur cap, ashe walked back to the rectory.</p><p>He had gone over to show Mr. Dale a somewhathighly seasoned sketch in "Bell's Life;" in themidst of their enjoyment of it, they were interruptedby Mrs. Dale.</p><p>"I want to speak to you about Lois, brother.Ach I how this room smells of smoke!" she said."Why, what has the child done now?" said Dr. Howe.<pb n="138 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>"You needn't say ' What has she done now?' asthough I was always finding fault," Mrs. Dale answered, "though I do try to do my Christian dutyif I see any one making a mistake."</p><p>"Adele," remarked the rector, with a franknesswhich was entirely that of a brother, and had nobearing upon his office, "you are always readyenough with that duty of fault-finding." Mr. Dalelooked admiringly at his brother-in-law. "Whydon't you think of the duty of praise, once in awhile? Praise is a Christian grace too much neglected. Don't you think so, Hery?"</p><p>But Mrs. Dale answered instead: "I am readyenough to praise when there is occasion for it, butyou can't expect me to praise Lois for her behaviorto young Forsythe. Arabella says the poor youth iscompletely prostrated by the blow."</p><p>"Bah!" murmured Mr. Dale under his breath;but Dr. Howe said impatiently,--</p><p>"What do you mean? What blow?"</p><p>"Why, Lois has refused him" cried Mrs. Dale."What else?"</p><p>"I did not know she had refused him!" the rectoranswered lowly. "Well, the child is the best judge,after all."</p><p>"I am glad of it," said Mr. Dale,--"I am gladof it. He was no husband for little Lois,--no, mydear, pray let me speak,--no husband for Lois. Ihave had some conversation with him, and I playedeuchre with him once. He played too well for a gentleman, Archibald."</p><p>"He beat you, did he ? " said the rector.<pb n="139 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"That had nothing to do with it!" cried Mr.Dale. "I should have said the same thing had Ibeen his partner"</p>
<p>"Fudge!" Mrs. Dale interrupted, "as thoughit made the slightest difference how a man playeda silly game! Don't be foolish, Henry. Lois hasmade a great mistake, but I suppose there is nothingto be done, unless young Forsythe should try again.I hope he will, and I hope she will have moresense."</p><p>The rector was silent. He could not deny thathe was disappointed, and as he went towards thepost-office, he almost wished he had offered a wordof advice to Lois. "Still, a girl needs her motherfor that sort of thing, and, after all, perhaps it isbest. For really, I should be very dull at the rectory without her." Thus he comforted himself forwhat was only a disappointment to his vanity, andwas quite cheerful when he opened Helen's letter.</p><p>The postoffice was in that part of the drug-storewhere the herbs were kept, and the letters alwayshad a faint smell of pennyroyal or wormwood aboutthem. The rector read his letter, leaning againstthe counter, and crumpling some bay leaves betweenhis fingers; and though he was interrupted half adozen times by people coming for their mail, andstopping to gossip about the weather or the church,he gained a very uncomfortable sense of its contents.</p><p>"More of this talk about belief," he grumbled, ashe folded the last sheet, covered with the clear heavywriting, and struck it impatiently across his handbefore he thrust it down into his pocket. "What<pb n="140 JOHN WORD, PREACHER"/>
in the world is John Ward thinking of to let herbother her head with such questions?"</p><p>"I am surprised," Helen wrote, "to see how narrowness and intolerance seem to belong to intensebelief. Some of these elders in John's church, especially a man called Dean (the father of my Alfa.retta), believe in their horrible doctrines with alltheir hearts, and their absolute conviction make themblind to any possibility of good in any creed whichdoes not agree with theirs. Apparently, they thinkthey have reached the ultimate truth, and never evenlook for new light. That is the strangest thing tome. Now, for my part, I would not sign a creedtolday which I had written myself, because one livesprogressively in religion as in everything else. But,after all, as I said to Gifford the other day, the <hi rend="italic">form</p>of belief is of so little consequence. The main thingis to have the realization of God in one's own soul;it would be enough to have that, I should think.But to some of us God is only another name for thepower of good,--or, one might as well say force,and that is blind and impersonal; there is nothingcomforting or tendr in the thought of force. Howdo you suppose the conviction of the personality ofGod is reached?"</p><p>"All nonsense," said the rector, as he went home,striking out with his cane at the stalks of golden-rod standing stiff with frost at the roadside. "Ishall tell ifford he ought to know better than tohave these sdiesions with her. Women don't understand such tbgs; they go off at half cock, andthink themselves skeptics.  All nonsense"</p><pb n="141 JOBN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>But the rector need not have felt any immediateanxiety about his niece. As yet such questions wereonly a sort of intellectual exercise; the time had notcome when they should be intensely real, and sheshould seek for an answer with all the force of herlife, and know the anguish of despair which comeswhen a soul feels itself adrift upon a sea of unbelief.They were not of enough importance to talk of toJohn, even if she had not known they would troublehim; she and Gifford had merely spoken of them asspeculations of general interest; yet all the whilethey were shaping and moulding her mind for thefuture.</p><p>But the letter brought a cloud on Dr. Howe's face;he wanted to forget it, he was impatient to shakeoff the unpleasant remembrances it roused, and soengaged was he in this that by the time he hadreached the rectory Mr. Denner and his perplexitieswere quit. out of his mind tough the lawyer's facewas still tingling with mortification.</p><p>Mr. Denner could not keep his thoughts from hispuzzle. Supper-time came, and he was still struggling to reach a
conclusion. He carved the cold mutton with more than usual precision, and ate it inanxious abstraction. The room was chilly; draughtsfrom the narrow windows made the lamp flare, andthe wind from under the closed door raised the carpet in swells along the floor. He did not noticeWillie, who kept his hands in his pockets for warmth, and also because he had nothing for themto do.</p><p>When Mr. Denner rang for Mary, the boy said
<pb n="142 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>with anxious politeness, "Was--was the muttongood, sir?"</p><p>Willie had been well brought up,--he was not tospeak unless spoken to ; but under the press of hunger nature rebelled, for his uncle, in his absorption,had forgotten to help him to anything.</p><p>Mr. Denner carved some meat for the child, andthen sat and watched him with such gloomy eyes,that Willie was glad to finish and push his chairback for prayers.</p><p>The table was cleared,--and then Mary put theBible in front of Mr. Denner, and Jay's "Morningand Evening Exercises," open at the proper day.Two candles in massive candlesticks on either sideof his book gave an unsteady light, and when theyflickered threw strange shadows on the ceiling. Theframes which held the paintings of Mr. Denner'sgrandparents loomed up dark and forbidding, andMary, who always sat with her arms rolled in herapron and her head bowed upon her ample breast,made a grotesque shadow, which danced and bobbedabout on the door of the pantry. Mary generallyslept through prayes, while for Willie it was a timeof nervous dread. The room was so dark, and hisuncle's voice so strange and rolling, the little fellowfeared to kneel down and turn his back to the longtable with its ghastly white cloth; his imaginationpictured fearful things stealing upon him from themysterious space beneath it, and his heart beat sohe could scarcely hear the words of the prayer. ButMr. Denner enjoyed it. Not, however, becauseprayer was the expression of his soul; family prayer<pb n="143 JOHNp WARD, PREACHER"/>was merely a dignified and proper observance. Mr.Denner would not have omitted it any more than hewould have neglected Sunday morning service; buthe was scarcely more aware of the words than Wil-lie or Mary were. It was the reading which gaveMr. Denner so much pleasure.</p><p>Perhaps the cases he had never pleaded, the dramatic force which he secretly longed to exert, expended themselves in the sonorous chapters of Isaiah or in the wail of Jeremiah. Indeed, the thoughthad more than once occurred to Mr. Denner thatthe rector, who read the service with cheerful haste,might improve in his own delivery, could he listento the eloquence under which Mary and little Williesat every evening.</p><p>To-night it was the victory of Jephtha. The reading proceeded as usual: Mary slumbered tranquillyat her end of the room; Willie counted the numberof panes of glass in the window opposite him, andwondered what he should do if suddenly a whiteface should peer in at him out of the darkness; Mr.Denner had reached the vow that whatsoever shouldfirst meet Jephtha,--when, with his hand extended,his eyebrows drawn together, and his whole attitudeexpressing the anxiety and fear of the conqueror, hestopped abruptly. Here was an inspiration!</p><p>Mary woke with a start. "Is it a stroke? " sheexclaimed. But Willie, with one frightened look at the window and the long table, slipped from hischair to kneel, thinking the reading was over. Thesound of his little copper-toed boots upon the floorMr. Denner; he frowned portentously. "<hi rend="italic">So
<pb n="144 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>Jephtha passed over unto the children of Ammon,"</p>he read on,<hi rend="italic">"to fight against them, and the Lorddelivered them into his hands."</hi></p><p>When prayers were ended, however, and he wassitting in his library alone, he said with a subduedglee, "That is the way to do it,--the one I see first!"And Mr. Denner went to bed with a quiet mind,and the peace which follows the decision of a momentous question.</p><pb n="[145] CHAPTER XI"/><p>THE cold that winter was moe persitent and severe in the mountains than down in Ashurst.</p><p>At Lockhaven the river had been frozen over fora month, even above the bridge and the mills, wherethe current was swiftest. Long lines of sawdust,which had been coiling and whirling in the eddies,or stretching across the black seething water, werecaught in the ice, or blown about with the powderedsnow over its surface.</p><p>Rafts could not come down the river, so the millshad no work to do, for the logs on hand at the be-ginning of the cold snap had been sawed into longrough planks, and piled in the lumber-yards, readyto be rafted as soon as the thaw came. The cold,still air was sweet with the fragrance of fresh pineboards, and the ground about the mills was coveredwith sawdust, so that footsteps fell as silently asthough on velvet, instead of ringing sharp againstthe frozen ground.</p><p>John Ward, walking wearily home from a longvisit to a sick woman, came, as he crossed the lumber-yards, upon a
group of raftsmen; they had not heard his approach, and were talking loudly, withfrequent bursts of'drunken laughter.</p><p>It was towards evening; the sky had been threatening all day, and when the clouds lifted suddenly in<pb n="146 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>the west, blown aside like tumultuous folds of a graycurtain, the red sun sent a flood of color across thewintry landscape; the bare branches of the treeswere touched with light, and the pools of black, clearice gleamed with frosty fire. John's face had caughtthe radiance.</p><p>He had come up to the men so silently that hehad been standing beside them a moment beforethey noticed him, and then Tom Davis, with a startof drunken fear, tried to hide the bottle which heheld.</p><p>"Damn you, mate, you're spillin' it I" cried oneof the others, making an unsteady lunge forward toseize the bottle.</p><p>"Let up, let up," said Tom thickly. "Don't yesee the preacher?" Though Davis was not one ofhis flock, he had the same reverence for the preacherwhich his congregation felt. All Lockhaven lovedand feared John Ward.</p><p>John had not spoken, even though a little boy,building block houses on a heap of sawdust near themen, had come up and taken his hand with a lookof confident affection.</p><p>The man who had saved the whiskey stumbled tohis feet, and leaning against a pile of lumber stoodopen--mouthed, waiting for the preacher's rebuke;but Davis hung his head, and began to fumble for apipe in his sagging coat pocket; with clumsy fingers,scattering the tobacco from his little bag, he triedto fill it.</p><p>"Tom," the preacher said, at last, "I want youto come home with me, now. And Jim, you willgive me that bottle."</p><pb n="147 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"I can't go home, preacher. I've got to buysome things. She said I was to buy some thingsfor the brats."</p><p>"Have you bought them?" John asked. Tomgave a silly laugh.</p><p>"Not yet, preacher, not yet."</p><p>"Listen, men," John said, with sudden sternness. "You have let this child see you on theroad to hell. If he can remember this sight, it willsave his soul."</p><p>Tom Davis shrank as the preacher said "hell."He gave a maudlin cry, and almost whimpered, " No,sir, no, preacher, I am agoin' to reform." John hadknown what note to touch in this debased nature.Not love, nor hope, nor shame, would move TomDavis, but fear stung him into a semblance of so-briety. "I'll come along wi' you," he went on,swaying back and forth, and steadying himself witha hand on the lumber against which he had beenleaning. "This is the last time, preacher.  Youwon't see me this way no more."</p><p>Here he hiccoughed, and then laughed, but remembering himself instantly, drew his forehead intoa scowl.</p>
<p>The other men slunk away, for the minister hadtaken the bottle, and Tom Davis was following himthrough the narrow passages between the great pilesof boards, towards his house.</p><p>The boy had gone back to his block house; thepile of sawdust in the sheltered corner was morecomfortable and not more cheerless than his ownhome.</p><pb n="148 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>John left Davis at his door. The man lookedeowed, but there was no shame in his face, and nosense of sin. It was unpleasant to be caught bythe preacher, and he was frightened by that awfulword, which it was the constant effort of his numb,helpless brain to forget.</p><p>John went on alone. He walked slowly, with hiseyes fixed absently on the ground, thinking. "PoorDavis," he said, "poor fellow!"  The man's futureseemed quite hopeless to the preacher, and, thinkingof it, he recalled Mrs. Davis's regret that he had notspoken of hell in his sermon.</p><p>John sighed. His grief at Helen's unbelief wasgrowing in his silence; yet he realized the inconsistency of his love in hiding his sorrow from her.</p><p>"It is robbing her, not to let her share it," hethought, "but I dare not speak to her yet."</p><p>More than once during the winter he had tried toshow her the truth and the beauty of various doctrines, generally that of reprobation, but she hadalways evaded discussion; sometimes lightly, for itseemed such a small matter to her, but always firmly.</p><p>The preacher loitred, stopping to look at theriver and the gaunt line of mills against the sky.He left the path, and went down to the edge of thewhite ice, so full of air bubbles, it seemed like solidsnow, and listened to the gurgle of the hurryingwater underneath.</p><p>A shed was built cose to the stream, to sheltera hand fire-engine. It had not been used for solong that the row of buckets beside it, which werefor dipping up water to fill it, were warped and<pb n="149 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
cracked, their iron bands rusty, and out of one ortwo the bottom had fallen. The door of the shedereaked on its one hinge, and John looked up surprised to see how dark it had grown, then he turnedtowards home.</p><p>"Yes," he said to himself, "I must show her herdanger. It will grieve her to force an argumentupon her, and I don't think she has had one unhappy hour since we were married; but even if itwere not for her own soul's sake, I must not let mypeople starve for the bread of life, to spare her.I must not be silent concerning the danger of thesinner. But it will trouble her,--it will troubleher."</p><p>John had dallied with temptation so long, that ithad grown, bold, and did not always hide under theplea of wisdom, but openly dared him to inflict thepain of grieving his wife upon himself.  He still delayed, yet there
were moments when he knew himself a coward, and had to summon every argument of the past to his defense.  But before hereached the parsonage door he had lapsed into suchtender thoughts of Helen that he said again, "Notquite yet; it seems to annoy her so to argue uponsuch things. I must leave it until I win her to truthby the force of its own constraining beauty. Littleby little I will draw her attention to it. And Imust gradually make my sermons more emphatic."</p><p>Helen met him at the door, and drew him intothe house. "You are so late," she said, pressinghis chill fingers against her warm cheek, and chafing them between her hands.</p><pb n="150 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>He stopped to kiss her before he took his coat off,smiling at her happiness and his own.</p><p>"How raw and cold it is!" she said; "Come intothe study; I have a beautiful fire for you. Is itgoing to snow, do you think? How is your sickwoman?"</p><p>"Better," he answered, as he followed her intothe room. "Oh, Helen, it is good to be at home.I have not seen you since noon."</p><p>She laughed, and then insisted that he should sitstill, and let her bring his supper into the study, andeat it there by the fire. He watched her with a delicious luxury of rest and content; for he was verytired and very happy.</p><p>She put a little table beside him, covered with alarge napkin; and then she brought a loaf of brownbread and some honey, with a mould of yellowbutter, and last a little covered dish of chicken.</p><p>"I broiled that for you myself," she explainedproudly; and I did not mean to give you coffee,but what do you think ?--the whole canister of teahas disappeared. When Alfaretta went to get itfor my supper, it had gone."</p><p>"Oh," John said, smiling, while Helen began topour some cream into his coffee from a flat littlesilver jug, "I forgot to mention it: the fact is, Itook that tea with me this afternoon,--I thoughtprobably they had none in the house; and I wishyou could have seen the woman's joy at the sight ofit. I cooked some for her,--she told me how," hesaid deprecatingly, for Helen laughed; "and shesaid it was very good, too," he added.</p><pb n="151 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>But Helen refused to believe that possible. "Itwas politeness, John," she cried gayly, "and because, I suppose, you presented her with my lacequered canister."</p><p>"I did leave it," John   admitted; "I neverthought of it." But he forgot even to ask forgiveness, as she bent towards him, resting her hand onhis hbeilder while she put his cup beside him.</p>
<p>"The fire has flushed your cheek," he said, touching it softly, the lover's awe shining in his eyes;with John it had never been lost in the assured possession of the
husband. Helen looked at him, smiling a little, but she did not
speak. Silence with her told sometimes more than words.</p><p>"It has been such a long afternoon," he said."I was glad to hurry home; perhaps that is thereason I forgot the canister."</p><p>"Shall I send you back for it?"  She put herlips for a moment against his hand, and then, glan-cing out at the night for sheer joy at the warmthand light within, she added, "Why, what is thatglow, John? It looks like fire."</p><p>He turned, and then pushed back his chair andwent to the window.</p><p>"It does look like fire," he said anxiously.</p><p>Helen had followed him, and they watched to.gether a strange light, rising and falling, and thenbrightening again all along the sky. Even as they looked the upper heavens began to pulsate and throbwith faint crimson.</p><p>"It is fire!" John exclaimed. "Let me get my coat. I must go."</p><pb n="152 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"Oh, not now," Helen said. "You must finishyour supper; and you are so tired, John!"</p><p>But he was already at the door and reaching forhis hat.</p><p>"It must be the lumber-yards, and the river isfrozen"</p><p>"Wait!" Helen cried. "Let me get my cloak.I will go if you do," and a moment later the parsonage door banged behind them, and they hurriedout into the darkness.</p><p>The street which led to the lumber-yards bed beensilent and deserted when John passed through ithalf an hour before, but now all Lookhaven seemedto throng it.</p><p>The preacher and his wife could hear the snapping and crackling of flames even before they turnedthe last corner and saw the blaze, which, sweepingup into the cold air, began to mutter before it brokewith a savage roar. They caught sight of Gifford'sbroad shoulders in the crowd, which stood, fascinated and appalled, watching the destruction of whatto most of them meant work and wages.</p><p>"Oh, Gif!" Helen said when they reached hisside, "why don't they do something? Have theytried to put it out?"</p><p>"It's no use to try now," Gifford answered. "Theydid n't discover it in time. It has made such headway, that the only thing to do is to see that it burnsout,without setting fire to any of the houses. Fortunately the wind is towards the river."</p><p>John shook his head; he was too breathless tospeak for a moment; then he said," Something mustbe done."</p><pb n="153 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"There is no use, Mr. Ward," Gifford explained.But John scarcely heard him; his people's comfort,their morality almost,--for poverty meant deepersin to most of them,--was burning up in those greatsquare piles of planks.</p><p>"Men," he shouted, "men, the engine! To theriver! Run! run"</p><p>Nothing can be done," Gifford said, as thecrowd broke, following the preacher, who was farahead of all; but he too started, as though to jointhem, and then checked himself, and went back intothe deserted street, walking-up and down, a self-con-stituted patrol.</p><p>Almost every man had gone to the river. TomDavis, however, with Molly beside him, stood lollingagainst a tree, sobered, indeed, by the shock of thefire, but scarcely steady enough on his legs to run.Another, who was a cripple, swaying to and fro onhis crutches with excitement, broke into a storm ofoaths because his companion did not do the workfor which he was himself too helpless. But Tomonly gazed with bleared eyes at the fire, and triedto stand up straight.</p><p>The little crowd of women about Helen had beensilenced at first by the tumult and glare, but nowbroke into wild lamentations, and entreaties thatHeaven would send the engine soon, wringing theirhands, and sobbing, and frightening the childrenthat clung about their skirts even more than the fireitself.</p><p>"How did it start ?" Helen said, turning to theWoman next to her, who, shivering with excitement,<pb n="154 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>held a baby in her arms, who gazed at the fire withwide, tranquil eyes, as though it had been gotten upfor his entertainment.</p><p>"They say," answered the woman, tossing herhead in the direction of Tom Davis,--"they sayhim and some other fellows was in 'mong the lumber this afternoon, drinkin', you know, and smokin'.Most likely a match dropped, or ashes from theirpipes. Drunken men ain't reasonable about themthings," she added, with the simplicity of experience."They don't stop to think they're brnin' up money,an' whiskey too; for Dobbs' don't trust 'em, now themill is shut down."</p><p>"Yes," said another woman who stood by, "themmen! what do they care? You,"she shouted, shak-ing her fist at Tom,-"you'll starve us all, willye? an' your poor wife, just up from her sick bed !I do' know as she'll be much worse off, though,when he is out of work," she added, turning toHelen--"fer every blessed copper he has goes tothe saloon."</p><p>"Yer man's as bad as me," Tom protested, stungby her taunts and the jeers of the cripple.</p><p>"An' who is it as leads him on?" screamed thewoman. "An' if he does take a drop sometimes, itwasn't him as was in the lumber-yard this afternoon, a-settin' fire to the boards, an' burnin' up thefood and comfort o' the whole town!"</p><p>Tom hurled a torrent of profanity at the womanand the cripple collectively, and then stumbled towards the road with the crowd, for the fire was ap-proaching the side of the yard where they stood,and beating them back into the village street.</p><pb n="155 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>The air was filled with the appalling roar andscream of the flames; showers of sparks were flungup against the black sky, as with a tremendous crashthe inside of one of the piles would collapse; andstill the engine did not come.</p><p>"Hurry! hurry!" the women shouted with hoarse,terrified voices, and some ran to the edge of the bluffand looked down at the river.</p><p>The men were hurrying; but as they drew thelong-unused engine from its shed, an axle broke,and with stiff fingers they tried to mend it. Somehad had to run for axes to break the ice, and thentby pushed and jostled each other about the squarehole they had cut, to dip up the dark, swift waterunderneath; and all the while the sky behind themgrew a fiercer red, and the very ice glared with theleaping flames. At last, pulling and pushing, theybrought the little engine up the slope, and then witha great shout dragged it into the oatskrts of theyard. They pumped furiously, and a small jet ofwater was played upon the nearest pile of boards.A hissing cloud of steam almost hid the volunteerfiremen, but the flames leaped and tossed againstthe sky, and the sparks were sucked up into the coldair, and whirled in sheets across the river.</p><p>John Ward came breathlessly towards his wife."Are you all right, Helen? You seemed too near;come back a little further." Then, suddenly seeingthe woman beside her with the baby in her arms,he stopped, and looked about. "Where's your boy,Mrs. Nevins?" he said. The woman glanced aroundher.</p><pb n="156 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"I--I'm not just sure, preacher."</p><p>"Have you seen him since six o'clock?"</p><p>"No--I--I ain't," the woman answered. Therewas something in John's face which terrified her,though the mere absence of her son gave her no uneasiness.</p><p>"Go back, Helen," he said, quickly,--"go as faras that second house, or I shall not feel sure you aresafe.  Mrs. Nevins, we must look for Charley. Iam afraid--he was in the lumber-yard this afternoon"--</p><p>John did not wait to hear the womn's shriek; heturned and ran from group to group, looking for theboy whom he had seen building block houses on thepile of sawdust; but the mother, pushing her babyinto a neighbor's arms, ran up and down like a madwoman.</p><p>"My boy!" she cried; "Charley! Charley! He'sin the fire,--my boy's in the fire!"</p><p>Tom Davis had heard the hurried words of thepreacher, and the mother's cries roused all the manhood drink had left. He hesitated a moment, andthen pushing Molly towards the cripple whose tauntsstill rung in his ears, "Take care of the brat!" hesaid, and pulling off his coat, which he wrappedabout his head to guard himself from the fallingboards, he stooped almost double, and with his leftarm bent before his face, and his right extended tofeel his way, he ran towards the fire, and disappearedin the blinding smoke.</p><p>Even Mrs. Nevins was silenced for a moment ofshuddering suspense; and when she tossed her arms<pb n="157 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>  
into the air again, and shrieked, it was because JohnWard came towards her with Charley trotting athis side.</p><p>"You should have looked after the child," thepreacher said sternly. "I found him on the otherside of the yard, near the fire-engine."</p><p>Mrs. Nevins caught the boy in her arm in aparoxysm of rage and joy; and then she thought ofTom.</p><p>"Oh, preacher," she cried, "preacher! he's runin after him, Tom Davis has!"</p>"<hi rend="italic">There?</hi>" John said, pointing to the fire. "Godhelp him"</p><p>There was no human help possible. Tom had rundown between two long piles of boards, not yet inflames, but already a sheet of fire swept madlyacross the open space. They could only look ateach other, dumb with their own helplessess, andwait. How long this horror of expeetatin lastedno one knew, but at last, as if from the very mouthof hell, Tom Davis came, staggering and swaying,--his singed coat still rolled about his head, and hishands stretched blindly out.</p><p>John Ward ran towards him, and even the cripple pressed forward to take his hand. But with unseeing eyes he stood a moment, and then fell forward on his face. They lifted him, and carried himback into the street, away from the glare of light;there were plenty of kindly hands and pitying words,for most of the crowd had gathered about him; eventhe men who had brought the engine followed, fortheir efforts to subdue the fire were perfectly futile.</p><pb n="158 JONN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>They laid him down on the stiff frozen grass bythe roadside; but Molly clung so tightly about hisneck, that the preacher could scarcely move her toput his hand upon Tom's heart; Helen lifted thelittle girl, and laid her own wet cheek against thechild's.</p><p>The group of men and women stood awed andsilent about the prostrate form, waiting for John toraise his head from the broad, still breast; when helifted it, they knew all was over.</p><p>Whether the shock of the heat and tumult, comig upona the stupor of intoxication, and paralyzingthe action of the heart, or whether a blow from aburning plank, had killed him, no one could know.The poor sodden, bloated body was suddenly investedwith the dignity of death; and how death had comewas for a little while a secondary thought.</p><p>"He is dead," John said. "He has died like abrave man!"</p><p>He stood looking down at the body for some moments, and no one spoke. Then, as there was a stiramong those who stood near, and some one whispered that Mrs. Davis must be told, the preacherlooked away from the dead man's face.</p><p>"Poor soul," he said, "poor soul!"</p><p>A few light flakes of snow were beginning to fallin that still, uncertain way which heralds a storm;some touchedge dead face with pure white fingers,as though they would hide the degraded body fromany eyes less kind than God's.</p><p>Helen, who had gone further back into the streetthat Molly might not look again at her father, cameto John's side.</p><pb n="159 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"I will take Molly home with me," she said; "tellMrs. Davis where she is."</p><p>"Gifford is here to go with you?" John asked,with that quick tenderness which never left him.Then he turned away to help in carrying the deadman to his home.</p><p>The silent procession, with its awful burden, wentback through the streets, lighted yet by the pulsingglare of the fire. John walked beside the still figure with his head bent upon his breast. That firstimpulse of human exultation in a brave deed wasgone; there was a horror of pity instead. Just before they reached Tom's home, he stopped, by agesture, the men who bore the body.</p><p>"Oh, my people," he said, his hands stretched outto them, the snow falling softly on his bared head,"God speaks to you from the lips of this dead man.Listen to his words: the day or the hour knoweth noman; and are you ready to face the judgment-seatof Christ? Oh, be not deceived, be not deceived IWhatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."</p><p>It was long past midnight when the knot of menabout Tom Davis's door dispersed; the excitementof the fire faded before that frank interest in death,which such people have no hesitation in expressing.Society veils it with decent reserve, and calls it morbid and vulgar, yet it is ineradicably human, andcircumstances alone decide whether it shall be confessed.</p><p>But when the preacher came out of the house, allwas quiet and deserted. The snow, driving in whitesheets down the mountains, was tinged with a faint<pb n="160 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>glow, where, in a blinding mist it whirled across theyards; it had come too late to save the lumber, butit had checked and deadened the flames, so that thefew unburned planks only smouldered slowly intoashes.</p><p>John had told Mrs. Davis of her loss with thatwonderful gentleness which characterized all hisdealings with sorrow. He found her trying to quiether baby, when he went in, leaving outside in thesoftly falling snow that ghastly burden which themen bore. She looked up with startled, questioningeyes as he entered. He took the child, out of herarms, and hushed it upon his breast, and then, withone of her shaking hands held firm in his, he toldher.</p><p>Afterwards, it seemed to her that the sorrow in hisface had told her, and that she knew his messagebefore he spoke.</p><p>Mrs. Davis had not broken into loud weepingwhen she heard her husband's fate, and she wasvery calm, when John saw her again, after all hadbeen done which was needful for the dead; only moving nervously about, trying to put the room into anunusual order. John could not bear to leave her;knowing what love is, his sympathy for her griefwas almost grief itself; yet he had said all that hecould say to comfort her, all that he could of Tom'sbravery in rushing into the fire, and it seemed useless to stay. But as he rose to go, putting the child,who had fallen asleep in his arms, down on the bed,Mrs. Davis stopped him.</p><p>She stood straightening the sheet which covered<pb n="161 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>Tom's face, creasing its folds between her fingers,pulling it a little on this side or that.</p><p>"Mr. Ward," she said, "he was drunk, Tom was."</p><p>"I know it," he answered gently.</p><p>"He went out with some money this forenoon,"she went on; "he was to buy some things for theyoung ones. He did n't mean to drink; he didn'tlean to go near the saloon. I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it. Mrs. Shea,she came in a bit after he went, and she said shedeen him comin' out of the saloon, drunk. But hen't mean it. Then you brought him home. But,bein' started, preacher, he could not help it, an'he'dbeen round to Dobbs's again, 'fore he seen the fire."</p><p>"Yes," John said.</p><p>Still smoothing the straight whiteness of thesheet, she said, with a tremor in her voice:--</p><p>"If he didn't want to, preacher--if he didn'tmean to--perhaps it was n't a sin? and him dyingit!"</p><p>Her voice broke, and she knelt down and hid herin the dead man's breast. She did not thinkof him now as the man that beat her when he wask,and starved the children; he was the youngagain. The dull, brutal man and the fretful,woman had been boy and girl once, and hadtheir little romance, like happier husbands anddid not answer her, but a mist of tearsed in his eyes.</p><p>Davis raised her head and looked at him."Tell me, you don't think it will be counted a sin to<pb n="162 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>him, do you? You don't think he died in sin?"she asked almost fiercely.</p><p>"I wish I could say I did not," he answered.</p><p>She threw her hands up over her head with ashrill cry.</p><p>"You don't think he's lost? Say you don't,preacher,--say you don't!"</p><p>John took her hands in his. "Try and think,"he said gently, "how brave Tom was, how nobly hefaced death to save Charley. Leave the judgmentsof God to God; they are not for us to think of."</p><p>But she would not be put of in that way. Tooweak to kneel, she had sunk upon the floor, leaning still against the bed, with one thin, gaunt armthrown across her husband's body.</p><p>"You think," she demanded, "that my Tom'slost because he was drunk to-night?"</p><p>"No," he said, "I do not think that, Mrs. Davis."</p><p>"Is he saved? " she cried, her voice shrill witheagerness.</p><p>John was silent. She clutched his arm with herthin fingers, and shook it in her excitement; herpinched, terrified face was close to his.</p><p>"He was n't never converted,--I know that,--but would the Lord have cut him off, sudden-like,in his sin, if He was n't goin' to save him?"</p><p>"We can only trust his wisdom and his goodness."</p><p>"But you think he was cut, off in his sins--youthink--my Tom's lost!"</p><p>The preacher did not speak, but the passionatepity in his eyes told her. She put her hands up to<pb n="163 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>her throat as though she were suffocating, and herface grew ghastly.</p><p>"Remember, God knows what is best for hischildren," John said. "He sends this grief, ofTom's death to you in his infinite wisdom. Heloves you,--He knows best."</p><p>"Do you mean," asked the woman slowly, "thatit was best fer Tom he should die?"</p><p>"I mean this sorrow may be best for you," he answered tenderly. "God knows what you need. Hesends sorrow to draw our souls nearer to Him."</p><p>"Oh," she exclaimed, her voice broken andhoarse, "I don't want no good fer me, if Tom hasto die fer it. An' why should He love me insteado' Tom? Oh, I don't want his love, as would n'tgive Tom another chance! He might 'a' been converted this next revival, fer you would 'a' preachedhell,--I know you would, then. No, I don't wantno good as comes--that way. Oh, preacher, youain't going to say you think my Tom's burning inhell this night, and me living to be made better byit? Oh, no, no, no!" She crawled to his feet, andclasped his knees with her shaking arms. "Say heis n't,--say he is n't!"</p><p>But the presence of that dead man asserted thehopelessness of John's creed; no human pity coulddim his faith, and he had no words of comfort forthe distracted woman who clung to him. He couldonly lift her apd try to soothe her, but she did notseem to hear him until he put her baby in her arms;at the touch of its little soft face against-her drawncheek, she trembled violently, and then came the<pb n="164 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>merciful relief of tears. She did not ask the preacheragain to say that her husband was not lost; she hadno hope that he would tell her anything but whatshe already knew. "The soul that sinneth, it shalldie." She tried, poor thing, to find some comfort inthe words he spoke of God's love for her; listeningwith a pathetic silence which wrung his heart.</p><p>When John left her, beating his way homethrough the blinding snow, his face was as haggardas her own. He could not escape from the ultimateconclusion of his creed,--"He that believeth notshall be damned." Yet he loved and trusted completely. His confidence in God's justice could notbe shaken; but it was with almost a groan that hesaid, "0 my God, my God, justice and judgment arethe habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth shallgo before thy face! But justice with mercy,--justice first!"</p><pb n="[165] CHAPTER XII"/><p>THE snow fell all that night, but the day brokeexquisitely clear upon a white and shining world.The sky was blue and sparkling, and the keen northwind had carved the drifts into wonderful over-hanging curves, like the curling crests of breakers.</p><p>John Ward went early to Mrs. Davis's. The sharpagony of the night before was over; there was evena momentary complacency at the importance ofdeath, for the room was full of neighbors, whosenoisy sympathy drove her despair of her husband'sfate from her mind. But when she saw John, herterror came back, and she began to be silent, andnot so ready to tell the story of the deadman's bravery to each one that entered. But with the peoplewho were not immediately affected, the excitementof Tom's death could scarcely last.</p><p>By the afternoon his widow was for the most partalone. Helen had thought it would be so, andwaited until then to go and see her. But first shewent into her kitchen, and she and Alfaretta packeda little basket with cold meat, and sweet, snowybread, and some jam, for the children.</p><p>"They do say," Alfaretta said, as she tucked thecorners of the napkin under the wicker cover,--"they do say Tom Davis went straight to the badplace, last night. He was n't never converted, you<pb n="166 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>know; but somehow, seein' as he really thought hewas going to save that Charley, seein' as he died forhim, as you might say, it don't seem like as if it wasjust"--Alfaretta lowered her voice a little - "asif it was just--fair. Do you think he went there,Mrs. Ward?"</p><p>"I know he did not," Helen answered promptly."I don't think about hell quite as you do, Alfaretta.I cannot believe God punishes people eternally; forif He is good, He could not be so cruel Why, nohuman being would be so cruel as that, and do youthink we ought to believe that men are better andkinder than God?"</p><p>Alfaretta looked confused. "Well, but justice?""Justice!" Helen said. "Would it be just if Iput a little child where it was certain to fall down,and then punish it for falling? The child did notask to be put there. So God puts us here, wherewe must sin; would it be just to punish us eter-nally for his own work?"</p><p>Alfaretta shook her head, and sighed. "Well, Idon't know but yer right, though the preacher don'tsay so."</p><p>Helen did not speak for a moment, and then saidquietly, "Perhaps not,--not yet; but he will say sosome day. He is so good himself, you know, Alfaretta, he cannot bear to think every. one else doesnot love and serve God, too; and it seems to himas though they ought to be punished if they don't."</p><p>This was a very lame explanation, but it closedthe discussion, and she hurried away from the honest,searching eyes of her servant, which she felt must<pb n="167 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
see through the flimsy excuse. Her eyes burnedwith sudden tears that blurred the white landscape;it hurt her to excuse her husband's belief even toherself, and gave her a feeling of disloyalty to him;for a moment she weakly longed to creep into theshelter of the monstrous error in which she felt helived, that they might be one there, as in everythingelse. "Yet it does not matter," she said to herself,smiling a little. "We love each other. We knowwe don't think alike on doctrinal points, but we loveeach other."</p><p>She stopped a moment at the lumber-yard. Theghastly blackness of the ruin glared against thesnow-covered hills and the dazzling blue of the sky;here and there a puff of steam showed where themelting snow on the cooler beams dripped on thehot embers below. Some scattered groups of lumbermen and their forlorn wives braved the cold,and stood talking the fire over, for, after all, it wasthe immediate interest; death would not come tothem for years, perhaps, but where were they goingto get money for their families during the spring?There could be no rafting down the river until afterthe loggers had brought their rafts from up in themountains, to be sawed into planks.</p><p>Alfaretta's father, who stood contemplating theruins, and moralizing when any one would stop tolisten to him, had pointed this out. Mr. Dean wasa carpenter, and kept a grocery store as well, so hecould pity the lumbermen from the shelter of comparative affluence. When he saw the preacher'swife,--he came over to speak to her.</p><pb n="168 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>"Well, ma'am," he said, "the dispensations ofProvidence is indeed mysterious,--that the rivershould have been froze last night!"</p><p>Mr. Dean had a habit of holding his mouth opena moment before he spoke, and looking as thoughhe felt that his listener was impatient for his words,which were always pronounced with great deliberation. Helen had very little patience with him, andused to answer his slowly uttered remarks with aquickness which confused him.</p><p>"It would be more mysterious if it were not frozen,at this time of year," she replied, almost before hehad finished speaking. She was in haste to reachMrs. Davis, and she had no time. to hear ElderDean's platitudes.</p><p>He began to open his beak-like mouth in an astonished way, when a by-stander interrupted him:"I suppose this here sudden death in our midst"(it was easy to fall into pious phraseology in thepresence of Elder Dean) "will be made the sub-ject of the prayer-meeting to-night?"</p><p>"It will," said Mr. Dean solemnly,--"it will.It is an awful example to unbelievers. An' it is alesson to the owners not to allow smoking in theyards." Then, with a sharp look at Helen out ofhis narrow eyes, he added, "I have n't seen you atprayer-meeting, lately, Mrs. Ward. It is a blessedplace, a blessed place: the Lord touches sinners'hearts with a live coal from off his altar; souls havebeen taught to walk in the light, in the light ofGod."  Mr. Dean prolonged the last word in anunctuous way, which he reserved for public prayerand admonition.</p><pb n="169 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/><p>Helen did not answer.</p><p>But the elder was not rebuffed. "I hope we willsee you soon," he said. "A solemn season of revival is approaching. Why have you stayed awayso long, Mrs. Ward?"</p><p>Annoyed at the impertinence of his questions,Helen's face flushed a little.</p><p>"I do not like the prayer-meeting," she answeredquietly; but before the elder could recover from theshock of such a statement, Mrs. Nevins had come upto speak to him.</p><p>"Have you seen Mrs. Davis yet, Mr. Dean?"she said. "She took on awful, last night; the neighbors heard her. 'T was after twelve 'fore she wasquiet."</p><p>"Yes, I saw her," responded the elder, shakinghis head in a pompous way.  I went to administerconsolation. I'm just coming from there now. Itis an awful judgment on that man: no chance forrepentance, overtook by hell, as I told Mrs. Davis,in a moment! But the Lord must be praised forhis justice: that ought to comfort her."</p><p>"Good heavens!" cried Helen, "you did nottell that poor woman her husband was overtaken byhell?"</p><p>"Ma'am," said Mr. Dean, fairly stuttering withastonishment at the condemnation of her tone--" I--I--did."</p><p>"Oh, shame!" Helen said, heedless of the listen.era around them.  "How dared you say such athing? How dared you libel the goodness of God? Tom Davis is not in hell. A man who died to save<pb n="170 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>another's life? Who would want the heaven of sucha God? Oh, that poor wife I How could youhave had the heart to make her think God was socruel?"</p><p>There was a dead silence; Elder Dean was toodumfounded to speak, and the others, looking atHelen's eyes flashing through her tears of passionatepain, were almost persuaded that she was right.They waited to hear more, but she turned and hurried away, her breath quick, and a tightened feelingin her throat.</p><p>The elder was the first to break the spell of herwords, but he opened his lps twice before a soundcame. "May the Lord forgive her I Tom Davisnot in hell? Why, where's the good of a hell atall, then ?"</p><p>Helen's heart was burning with sympathy for thesorrow which had been so cruelly wounded. Shehad forgotten the reserve which respect for her husband's opinions always enforced. "It is wicked tohave said such a thing I" she thought, as she walkedrapidly along over the creaking snow. "I will tellher it is not true,--it never could be true."</p><p>The path through the ragged, unkempt garden infront of the tenement house was so trodden that thesnow was packed and hard. The gate swung backwith a jar and clatter, and two limp frosted hensflew shrieking out from the shelter of the ash-heapbehind it. The door was open, and Helen could seethe square of the entry, papered, where the plasterhad not been broken away, with pale green castlesembowered in livid trees. On either side was the<pb n="171 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>entrance to a tenement; a sagging nail in one of thedoor-posts held a coat and a singed and battered hat.Here Helen knocked.</p><p>Mrs. Davis was in the small inner room, but cameout as her visitor entered, wiping the soapsuds fromher bare arms on her dingy gingham apron. On theother side of the room, opposite the door, was thatawful Presence, which silenced even the voices of thechildren.</p><p>"I'm washing," the woman said, as she gave herhand to Helen.  "It is Tom's best shirt,--fer tomorrow."</p><p>Helen took the hand, wrinkled and bleached withthe work it had done, and stroked it gently; she didnot know what to say. This was not the grief shehad thought of,--a woman working calmly at her wash-tub, while her husband lay dead in the nextroom. Helen could see the tub, with the mist ofsteam about it, and the wash-board, and the bar ofyellow soap.</p><p>She followed Mrs. Davis back to her work, andsat down on a bench, out of the way of a little stream of water which had dripped from the leaking tub,and trickled across the floor.  She asked about the
children, and said she had brought some food forthem; she knew it was
so hard to have to think ofhousekeeping at such a time.</p><p>But the
widow scarcely listened; she stood lifting the shirt from the water,
and rubbing it gentlybetween her hard hands, then dipping it back
intothe suds again. Once she stopped, and drew the back of her wet
hand across her eyes, and once<pb n="172 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>Helen
heard her sigh; yet she did not speak of hersorrow, nor of Elder
Dean's cruel words. For a littlewhile the two women were
silent.</p><p>"Mrs. Davis," Helen said, at last, "I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>It was a very simple thing to say, but it caughtthe woman's ear; it
was different from any of the sympathy to which, in a dull, hopeless
way, she had listened all that morning. The neighbors had sighed and
groaned, and told her it was "awful hard on her," and had pitied Tom
for his terrible death; and then Mr. Dean had come, with fearful talk
of justice, and of hell.</p>
<p>A big tear rolled down her face, and droppedinto the tub. "Thank
you, ma'am," she said.</p>
<p>She made a pretense of turning towards the light of the one small
window to see if the shirt was quiteclean; then she began to wring it
out, wrapping thetwist of wet linen about her wrist. When she
spokeagain, her voice was steady.</p>
<p>"Elder Dean 'lows I ought n't to be
sorry; he says I'd ought to be resigned to God's justice. He says good
folks ought to be glad when sinners go tothe bad place, even if
they're belonging to them.  He 'lows I 'd ought n't to be sorry."</p>
<p>"I am sure you have a right to be sorry Tom is dead," Helen said, - the
woman's composure madeher calm, too, - "but I do not believe he is in
anyplace now that need make you sorry. I do notbelieve what Elder Dean
saic about - hell."</p>
<p>Mrs. Davis looked at her, a faint surprise
dawningin her tired eyes, and shook her head. "Oh, I'm not sayin' that
he ain't right. I'm not sayin' Tom <
<pb n="173 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
ain't in the bad place, ner that it ain't
justice. I'm a Christian woman. I was convicted and converted when I was
n't but twelve years old, and I know my religion. Tom--he wasn't no
Christian, he did n't ever experience a change of heart: it was
always like as if he was just going to be converted, when he was n't in
drink; fer he was good in his heart, Tom was. But he was n't no
Christian, an' I'm not say-in' he is n't lost. I'm only sayin',"- this
with asudden passion, and knotting her tremulous handshard together,
-" I'm only sayin' I can't love Godno more! Him havin' all the power -
and then lookat Tom an' me"</p>
<p>Helen tried to speak, but Mrs. Davis would
notlisten. "No," she cried, "yer the preacher's wife,bit I must say
it. He never give Tom a chance,an'how am I gpin'to love Him now?
Tom,"--she pointed a shaking finger at the coffin in the next
room,--"born as you might say, drinkin'. His father died in a drunken fit, and his
mother give it to her baby with her milk. Then, what schoolin' did
heget? Nothin', 'less it was his mother lickin' him.Tom 's often told
me that. He hadn't no tradelearned, neither,--just rafted with men as
bad as him. Is it any wonder he was n't converted ?"</p>
<p>"I know all that," Helen began to say gently, butt Mrs. Davis could not check the torrent
of her despairing grief.</p>
<p>"He did n't have no chance; an' he did n't ask
toe born, neither. God put him here, an' look atway He made him live;
look at this house; see the floor, how the water runs down into that
corner;
<pb n="174 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
an' leanin' - the whole thing is rotten -look at that one window, up
against the wall; not aray of sunshine ever struck it. An' here's
whereGod's made us live. Six of us, now the baby's come.Children was
the only thing we was rich in, and wedid n't have food enough to put
in their mouths, ordecent clothes to cover 'em. Look at the
people'round us here - livin' in this here row of tenements- drinkin',
lyin' swearin'. What chance had Tom ?God never give him any, but He
could of, if He 'dhad a mind to. So I can't love Him, Mrs. Ward,-I
can't love Him; Him havin' all the power, and yetlettin' Tom's soul go
down to hell; fer Tom couldn'thelp it, and him livin' so. I ain't
denyin' religion,ner anything like that-I'm a Christian woman,an' a
member- but I can't love Him, so there's nouse talkin' -I can't love
Him."</p>
<p>She turned away and shook the shirt out, hanging it over the back
of a chair in front of the stove, to dry. Helen had followed her, and
put her arm across the thin, bent shoulders, her eyes full of
tears,though the widow's were hard and bright.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mrs. Davis," she
cried," of course you could not love a God who would never give Tom a
chance and then punish him; of course you could not love Him! But he is
not punished by being sent to hell; indeed, indeed, he is not. If God
is good, He could not be so cruel as to give a soul no chance, and
then send it to hell. Don't ever think that Tom, brave fellow, is there
I Oh, believe what I say to you!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Davis seemed stupefied; she
looked up intothose beautiful distressed brown eyes, and her drylips
moved.</p>
<pb n="175 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"You don't think," she said, in a hoarse, hurried whisper--"you're not
saying--<hi rend="italic">Tom isn't in, hell?</hi>""I know he is not, I know it!
Justice? it would be the most frightful injustice, because, don't
you see," she went on eagerly, "it is just as you said,--Tom had no
chance; so God could not punish him eternally for being what he had to
be, born as he was, and living as he did. I don't know anything about
people's souls when they die,--I mean aboutgoing to heaven,--but I
do know this: as long as a soul lives it has a chance for goodness,
a chance to turn to God.    There is no such place as hell!"</p>
<p>"But--but--the widow faltered, "he was cut off in his sins.  The preacher would
n't say but he_was lost!" Her words were a wail despair.</p>
<p>Helen groaned; she was cpnfronted by her loyalty to John, yet the
suffering of his hopeless soul! "Listen," she siad, taking
Mrs. Davis's hands in hers, and speaking slowly and tenderly, while
she held the weak, shifiting eyes by her own steady look, "listen. I
do not know what the preacher would say, but it is not true that
Tom is lost; it is not truethat God is cruel and wicked; it is not
true that while Tom's soul lives, he cannot grow good."</p>
<p>The rigid look in
the woman's face began to disappear; her hopeless belief was shaken, not
through any  argument, but by the mere force of the intense conviction shining
in Helen's eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said appealingly, and beginning to tremble,"are you true
with me, ma'am ? "</p>
<p>"I am true, indeed I am " Helen
answered, un-
<pb n="176 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
conscious that her own tears fell upon Mrs. Davis's hands; the woman looked at
her, and suddenly her face began to flush that painful red which comes
before violent weeping.</p>
<p>"If you're true, if you're right, then I can
be sorry. I wouldn't let myself be sorry while I could n't have no
hope. Oh, I can be that sorry it turns me glad I "The hardness was all
gone now; she broke into a storm of tears, saying between her sobs, "
Oh, I'm so glad--I 'm so glad!"</p>
<p>A long time the two women sat together,
the widow still shaken by gusts of weeping, yet listeninghungrily to
Helen's words, and sometimes even smiling through her tears. The
hardship of loss to herself and her children was not even thought
of; there was only intense relief from horrible fear; she did not even
stop to pity Tom for the pain of death; coming out of that nightmare of
hell, she could only rejoice.</p>
<p>The early sunset flashed a sudden ruddy
light through the window in the front room, making a gleaming bar on the
bare white washed wall, and startling Helen with the lateness of the
hour.<p>
<p>"I must go now," she said, rising. " I will come again
to-morrow."</p>
<p>Mrs. Davis rose, too, lifting her tear-stained face,with
its trembling smile, towards her deliverer. "Won't you come in the
other room a minute?" she said. "I want to show you the coffin. I got
the best I could, but I didn't have no pride in it. It seems different
now."</p>
<pb n="177 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
They went in together, Mrs. Davis crying quietly.  Tom's face was hidden, and a fine
instinct of possession, which came with the strange uplifting of
themoment, made his wife shrink from uncovering it.</p>
<p>She stroked the
varnished lid of the coffin, with her rough hands, as tenderly as
though the poor bruised body within could feel her touch.</p>
"How do you
like it ?" she asked anxiously. "I wanted to do what I could fer Tom. I
got the bestI could. Mr. Ward give me some money, and Ispent it this
way. I thought I would n't mind going hungry, afterwards. You don't
suppose,"--this with a sudden fear, as one who dreads to fall
asleeplest a terrible dream may return,--"you don't suppose I'll
forget these things you've been tellin' me, and think <hi
rend="italic">that</hi> of Tom?"</p>
<p>"No," Helen answered, "not if you just say to yourself that I told you
what Mr. Dean said was not true. Never mind if you cannot remember
the reasons I have given you,--I 'll tell them all to you again; just
try and forget what the elder said."</p>
<p>"I will try," she said; and then
wavering a little, "but the preacher, Mrs. Ward?"</p>
<p>"The preacher,"
Helen answered bravely, "will think this way, too, some day, I know."
And then she made the same excuse for him which she had given Alfaretta,
with the same pang of regret.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," the woman said, "I see. I
feel now as though I could love God real hard 'cause He's good to
Tom. But Mrs. Ward, the preacher must be wonderful good, fer he can
think God would send my Tom to hell, and yet he can love Him I could
n't do it."</p>
<pb n="178 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
"Oh, he is good!" Helen cried, with a great leapof her heart.</p>
<p>The wind blew the
powdered snow about, as she walked home in the cold white dusk, piling
it in great drifts, or leaving a ridge of earth swept bareand
clean. The blackened lumber-yards were quite deserted in the
deepening-chill which was felt as soon as the sun set; the melting snow
on the hot, charred planks had frozen into long icicles, and as she
stopped to look at the ruin one snapped, and fell with a splintering
crash.</p>
<p>One of those strangely unsuggested remembrances flashed into her
mind: the gleam of a dove's white'wing against the burning blue of a
July sky, the blaze of flowers in the rectory garden, and the subtle,
penetrating fragrance of mignonette. Perhaps the contrast of the
intense cold and the gathering night brought the scene before her; she
sighed; if she and John could go away from this grief and misery and
sin, which they seemed powerless to re-lieve, and from this hideous
shadow of Calvinism!</p>
<p>"After all," she thought, hurrying along
towards home and John, "Mrs. Davis is right,--it is hard to love Him. He
does not give a chance to every one; none of us can escape the
inevitable past. And that is as hard as to be punished
unjustly. And there is no help for it all. Oh, where is God?"</p>
<p>Just as she left the lumber-yard district, she heard her name called, and saw
Gifford Woodhouse striding towards her. "You have been to those
poor Davises I suppose," he said, as he reached her side,and took her
empty basket from her hand.</p>
<pb n="179 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Yes," she answered, sighing. "Oh, Gifford, how
dreadful it all if,--the things these people say,and really believe!"
Then she told him of Elder Dean, and a little of her talk with
Mrs. Davis. Gifford listened, his face growing very grave.</p>
<p>"And that
is their idea of God?" he said, as she finished. "Well, it is mine of
the devil. But I can't help feeling sorry you spoke as you did to
the elder."</p>
<p>"Why?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "to assert your opinion
of the doctrine of eternal damnation as you did, considering your
position, Helen, was scarcely wise."</p>
<p>"Do you mean because I am the
preacher'swife?" she remonstrated, smiling. "I must have my
convictions, if I am; and I could not listen to such a thing in
silence.  You don't know John, if youtnik he would object to the
expression of pinion."  Gifford dared not say that John would object
to the opinion itself. "But perhaps I spoke too forcibly; I should be
sorry to be unkind, even to Elder Dean."</p>
<p>"Well," Gifford said
doubtfully, "I only hope hemay not feel called upon to 'deal with
you.'"</p>
<p>They laughed, but the young man added, "After all, when you come
to think of it, Helen, there is no bigotry or narrowness which does not
spring from a truth, and nothing is truer than that sin is
punished eternally. It is only their way of making God responsible for
it,--not ourselves,--and arranging the details of fire and brimstone,
which is so monstrous. Somebody says that when the Calvinists
<pb n="180 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
decided on sulphur they did
not know the properties of caustic potash. But there are stages of
truth; there's no use knocking a man down because he is only on the
first step of the ladder, which you have climbed into light. I think
belief in eternal damnation is a phase in spiritual development."</p>
<p>"But you don't really object to my protest?" she said. "Come, Giff,
the truth must be strong enough to be expressed."</p>
<p>"I don't object to the
protest," he answered slowly, "but I hope the manner of it will not
make things difficult for Mr. Ward."</p>
<p>Helen laughed, in spite of her
depression. " Why,Gifford," she said, "it is not like you to be so
ap-prehensive, and over so small a matter, too. Mr. Dean has probably
forgotten everything I said, and, except that I mean to tell him, John
would neverhear a word about it."</p>

<pb n="[181] CHAPTER XII"/>
<p>THE winter
was passing very quietly in Ashurst; the only really great excitement
was Helen's letter about the fire and Colonel Drayton's attack of
gout.</p>
<p>Life went on as it had as far back as any one cared to remember,
with the small round of church festivals and little teas, and the
Saturday evening whist parties at the rectory. But under monotonous calm
may lurk very wearing anxiety, and this was the case in
Ashurst.</p>
<p>Mr. Denner endeavored, with but indifferent success, to
conceal the indecision which was still preying upon his mind. For the
suggestion gained from Jephtha had proved useless. He had, indeed,
triedto act upon it. A day or two after the thought hadcome to him
which so interrupted family prayers, Mr. Denner sallied forth to learn
his fate. It was surprising how particular he was about his linen that
morning,--for he went in the morning,--and he arrayed himself in his
best clothes; he saw noimpropriety, considering the importance of the
occasion, in putting on his evening coat. He even worehis new hat, a
thing he had not done more than halfi a dozen times--at a funeral
perhaps, or a fair--since he bought it, three years before.</p>
<p>It was a bright, frosty day, and the little gentleman stepped briskly along
the road towards the
<pb n="182 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
house of the two sisters. He felt as light-hearted as any
youth who goes a-wooing with a reasonablecertainty of a favorable
answer from his beloved. He even sang a little to himself, in a thin,
sweet voice, keeping time with his stick, like a drum-major, and
dwelling faithfully on all the prolonged notes.</p>
<p>"Believe me," sang Mr. Denner,--
"'Believe me, if all those endearing young charms Which I
gaze on so fondly to-day'"--</p>
<p>Mr. Denner's rendering of charms was very
elaborate. But while he was still lingering on the last word,
disappointment overtook him.</p>
<p>Coming arm in arm down the road were two
small figures. Mr. Denner's sight was not what it oncewas; he fumbled
in the breast of his bottle-green overcoat for his glasses, as a
suspicion of the truth dawned upon him.</p>
<p>His song died upon his lips, and
he turned irresolutely, as though to fly, but it was too late; he had
recognized at the same moment Miss Deborahand Miss Ruth Woodhouse. By
no possibility could he say which he had seen first.</p>
<p>He advanced to meet
them, but the spring had gone from his tread and the light from his
eye; he was thrown back upon his perplexities. The sisters,still arm in
arm, made a demure little bow, andstopped to say "Good-morning," but
Mr. Denner was evidently depressed and absent-minded.</p>
<p>"I wonder what 's
the matter with William Den-ner, sister?" Miss Ruth said, when they
were out ofhearing.</p>
<pb n="183 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Perhaps he's troubled about his housekeeping,"answered Miss
Deborah. "I should think he might be, I must say. That Mary of his does
keep him looking' so! And I have no doubt she is wasteful; a woman who
is economical with her needle and thread is pretty apt not to be saving
in other things."</p>
<p>"What a pity he has n't a wife I" commented Miss
Ruth. "Adele Dale says he's never been in love. She says that that
affair with Gertrude Drayton was a sort of inoculation, and he's been
perfectly healthy ever since."</p>
<p>"Very coarse in dear Adele to speak in
that way," said Miss Deborah sharply. "I suppose he never has gotten
over Gertrude's loss. Yet, if hissister-in-law had to die, it is a
pity it was n't a littlesooner. He was too old when she died to think
of marriage."</p>
<p>"But, dear Deborah, he is not quite too old even yet, if
he found a person of proper age. Not too young, and, of course, not too
old."</p>
<p>Miss Deborah did not reply immediately. "Well,I don't know;
perhaps not," she conceded. "I do like a man to be of an age to know
his own mind.  That is why I am so surprised at Adele Dale's anxiety to
bring about a match between young Forsythe and Lois, they are neither
of them old enough to know their own minds. And it is scarcely delicate
in Adele, I must say."</p>
<p>"He's a very superior young man," objected
MissRuth.</p>
<p>"Yes," Miss Deborah acknowledged; "and yet"
<pb n="184 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
--she hesitated a little--"I think he has not
quite the--the modesty one expects in a young person."</p>
<p>"Yes, but think
how he has seen the world, sister!" cried Miss Ruth. "You cannot
expect him to be just like other young people."</p>
<p>"True," said Miss
Deborah, nodding her head; "and yet"--it was evident from her
persistencethat Miss Deborah had a grievance of some kind--"yet he
seems to have more than a proper conceit. I heard him talk about whist,
one evening at the rectory; he said something about a person,--a Pole, I
believe,--and his rules in regard to 'sig-naling.' I asked him if he
played," Miss Deborahcontinued, her hands showing a little angry
nervous-ness; "and he said, 'Oh, yes, I learned to play onewinter in
Florida!' Learned to play in a winter, indeed! To achieve whist "--Miss Deborah held herhead very straight--"to achieve whist is the
workof a lifetime! I 've no patience with a young personwho says a
thing like that."</p>
<p>Miss Ruth was silenced for a moment; she had no excuse
to offer.</p>
<p>"Adele Dale says the Forsythes are coming backin April," she
said, at last.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know it," answered Miss Deborah. "I suppose it
will all be arranged then. I asked Adele if Lois was engaged to
him;--she said, 'Not formally.'  But I 've no doubt there's an
understanding.</p>
<p>"Miss Deborah was so sure of this that she hadeven
mentioned it casually to Gifford, of course un.der the same seal of
confidence with which it had been told her.</p>
<pb n="185 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>It was quite true that Dick and his mother
were to return to Ashurst. After storming out of therectory library the
night of the Misses Woodhouse's dinner party, Dick had had a period of
hatred of everything connected with Ashurst; but that did not last more
than a month, and was followed by an imploring letter to Lois. Her
answer brought the anger back again, and then its reaction of love;
this see-saw was kept up, until his last letter had announced that he
and his mother were coming to take the house they had had before, and
spend the summer."</p>
<p>"We will come early," he wrote. "I cannot
stay away. I have made mother promise to open the house in April, so in
a month more I shall see you.I had an awful time to get her to come;
she hates the country except in summer, but at last she said she
would. She knows why I want to come, and she would be so happy
if"--and then the letter trailed off into a wail of disappointment and
love.</p>
<p>Impatient and worried, Lois threw the pages into the fire, and had
a malicious satisfaction in watching the elaborate crest curl and
blacken on the redcoals.  "I wish he'd stay away," she said;
"he bothers me to death. I hate him What a silly letter!"</p>
<p>It was so
silly, she found herself smiling, in spite of her annoyance. Now, to
feel amusement at one's lover is almost as fatal as to be bored by
him.  But poor Dick had no one to tell him this, and hadpoured out his
heart on paper, in spite of some dif-ficulty in spelling, and could
not guess that he waslaughed at for his pains.</p>
<pb n="186 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth were rewarded fortheir
walk into Ashurst by a letter from Gifford, which made them quite
forget Mr. Denner's looks, and Mrs. Dale's bad taste in being a
match-maker.</p>
<p>He would be at home for one day the next week; business had
called him from Lockhaven, and on his way back he would stay a night in
Ashurst.  The little ladies were flurried with happiness. Miss Deborah
prepared more dainties than even Gifford's healthy appetite could
possibly consume, and Miss Ruth hung her last painting of
apple-blossoms in his bedroom, and let her rose jar stand uncovered on
his dressing-table for two days before his arrival.  When he came, they
hovered about him with small caresses and little chirps of affection,
as though they would express all the love of the months in which they
had not seen him.</p>
<p>Gifford had thought he would go to the rectory in the
evening, and somehow the companionship ofhis aunts while there had not
occupied his imagination; but it would have been cruel to leave them
at home, so after tea, having tasted every one of Miss Deborah's dishes,
he begged them to come with himto see Dr. Howe. They were glad to go
anywhereif only with him, and each took an arm, and borehim
triumphantly to the rectory.</p>
<p>"Bless my soul," said Dr. Howe, looking
at them over his glasses, as they came into the library," it is good to
see you again, young man I How didyou leave Helen?" He pushed
his chair back from the fire, and let his newspapers rustle to the
floor,as he rose. Max came and sniffed about Gifford's
<pb n="187 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
knees and wagged his tail, hoping
to be petted. Lois was the only one whose greeting was
constrained, Gifford's gladness withered under the indifference in her
eyes.</p>
<p>She does n't care," he thought while he was an-ring Dr. Howe, and
rubbing Max's ears with his left hand. Helen may be right about
Forsythe,W  bit she does i't are for me, either."</p>
<p>"Sit here, dear Giff"
said Miss Ruth, motioning him to a chair at her side.</p>
<p>"There's a draught there, dear Ruth," cried Miss Deborah
anxiously. "Come nearer the fire, Gifford." But Gifford only smiled
good-naturedly, and his elbow on the mantel,
grasping his coat collar with one hand, and listening to Dr. Howe's
questions about his niece.</p>
<p>"She's very well," he answered, "and the happiest woman I ever saw. Those
two people were made for each each other, doctor."</p>
"Well, now, see here, young man," said
the rector, could not help patronizing Gifford, "you'll disturb that happiness if
you get into religious discussions with Helen. Women don't understand
that sort of  thing; young women, I mean," he added,to Miss Deborah, and
then suddenly looking confused.</p>
<p>Gifford raised his eyebrows. "Oh, well,
Helen reason, you know; she is not the woman to take for granted."</p>
<p>"She must," the rector said, with a chuckle, "if she's a Presbyterian.  She'll
get into deep watere goes to discussing predestination and original
sin, and all that sort of thing."</p>
<pb n="188 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Oh," said Gifford lightly, "of course she does not discuss
those things. I don't think that sort of theological rubbish had to be
swept out of her mind before the really earnest questions of life
presented themselves. Helen is singularly free from the trammels of
tradition--for a woman."</p>
<p>Lois looked up, with a little toss of her
head, but Gifford did not even notice her, nor realize how closely she
was following his words.</p>
<p>"John Ward, though," Gifford went on, "is
themost perfect Presbyterian I can imagine. He is logical to the
bitter end, which is unusual, I fancy. I asked him his opinion
concerning a certain man, a fellow named Davis,--perhaps Helen wrote
of his death--I asked Ward what he thought of his chances
for salvation; he acknowledged, sadly enough, that he thought he was
damned. He did n't use that word, I believe," the young man added,
smiling, "but it amounted to the same thing."</p>
<p>There was an outcry from
his auditors. "Abominable!" said Dr. Howe, bringing his fist
heavily down on the table. "I should n't have thought that of Ward,--
outrageous!"</p>
<p>Gifford looked surprised. "What a cruel man!" Lois
cried; while Miss Deborah said suddenly,--</p>
<p>"Giff, dear, have those
flannels of yours worn well?" But Gifford apparently did not hear
her.</p>
<p>"Why, doctor," he remonstrated, " you misunderstand Ward. And he
is not cruel, Lois; he is the gentlest soul I ever knew. But he is
logical, he is consistent; he simply expresses Presbyterianism
with utter truth, without shrinking from its conclusions."</p>
<pb n="189 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Oh, he may be consistent," the rector acknowledged, with easy transition to
good-nature, "but that does n't alter the fact that he's a fool to say
such things. Let him believe them, if he wants to, but for Heaven's sake
let him keep silent! He can hold his tongue and yet not be a
Universalist.  <hi rend="italic">Medio tutissimus ibis</hi>, you know. It will be sure to
offendthe parish, if he consigns people to the lower regions in such a
free way."</p>
<p>"There is no danger of that," Gifford said; "I doubt if he
could say anything on the subject of hell too tough for the spiritual
digestion of his flock. They are as sincere in their belief as he is,
though they haven't his gentleness; in fact, they have his logic without
his light; there is very little of the refinement of religion in
Lockhaven."</p>
<p>"What a place to live!" Lois cried.  "Does n't Helen hate
it? Of course she would never say so to us, but she <hi rend="italic">must!</hi> Everybody
seems so dreadfully disagreeable; and there is really no one Helen
could know."</p>
<p>"Why, Helen knows them all," answered Giffordin his slow
way, looking down at the girl's impulsive face.</p>
<p>"Lois," said her father,
"you are too emphatic in your way of speaking; be more mild. I
don't like gush."</p>
<p>"Lois punctuates with exclamation points," Gifford
explained good-naturedly, meaning to take thesting out of Dr. Howe's
reproof, but hurting her instead.</p>
<p>"But, bless my soul," said the
rector, "what does Helen say to this sort of talk?"</p>
<pb n="190 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>190
<p>"I don't think she says anything, at least to him;
Gifford answered. "It is so unimportant to Helen,she is so perfectly
satisfied with Ward, his opinions are of no consequence.  She did fire
up, though,about Davis," and then he told the story of Elder Dean and
Helen's angry protest.</p>
<p>Dr. Howe listened, first with grave
disapproval, and then with positive irritation.</p>
<p>"Dean," Gifford
concluded, "has taken it very much to heart; he told me - he's a
client of mine,a stupid idiot, who never reasoned a thing out inhis
life--he told me that 'not to believe in eternal damnation was to take a
short cut to atheism.' He also confided to me that 'a church which
could permit such a falling from the faith was in a
diseased condition.' I don't believe that opinion has reachedWard,
however. It would take more grit than Dean possesses to dare to find
fault with John Ward's wife to her husband."</p>
<p>"What folly" cried the
rector, his face flushed with annoyance.   "What possessed Helen to
say such a thing! She ought to have had more sense.  Mark my words,
that speech of hers will make trouble for Ward. I don't understand
how Helen couldbe so foolish; she was brought up just as Lois was, yet,
thank Heaven, her head isn't full of whimsabout reforming a
community. What in the worldmade her express such an opinion if she
had it, andwhat made her have it?"</p>
<p>Dr. Howe had risen, and walked
impatiently upand down the room, and now stood in front of Gifford,
with a forefinger raised to emphasize his words.
<pb n="191 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
"There is something so absurd, so
unpleasant, in ayoung woman's meddling with things which don't belong
to her, in seeing a little mind struggle with ideas. Better a thousand
times settle down tolook after her household, and cook her
husband's dinner, and be a good child."</p>
<p>Lois laughed nervously.  "She
has a cook," she said.</p>
<p>"Don't be pert, Lois, for Heaven's sake,"
answered her father, though Miss Deborah had added,--</p>
<p>"Gifford says dear
Helen is a very good house-keeper."</p>
<p>"Pray," continued the rector,
"what business isit of hers what people believe, or what she
believes herself, for that matter, provided she's a good girl,and does
her duty in that station of life where it has pleased God to put her, -
as the wife of a Presbyterian minister? 'Stead of that she tries to
grapple with theological questions, and gets into hot water with the
parish. 'Pon my word, I thought better of the child! I'll write and
tell her what I thinkof it." (And so he did, the very next day. But
his wrath had expended itself in words, and his letter showed no more of
his indignation than the powdery ashes which fell out of it showed the
flame of the cigar he was smoking when he wrote it.)  "And as for Ward
himself," the rector went on, "I don't know what to think of him. Did
you know he had given up his salary? Said ' Helen had enough for them to
live on,' and added that they had no right to any more money than was
necessary for their comfort; anything more than that belonged to
the
<pb n="192 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
Lord's poor. Bless my
soul, the clergyman comesunder that head, to my mind. Yes, sir, he's
will-ing to live on his wife I I declare, the fellow's a--a--well, I
don't know any word for him!"</p>
<p>There was a chorus of astonishment from
the ladies.</p>
"'Christian' would be a pretty good word," said Gifford
slowly. "Is n't he following Christ's example rather more literally
than most of us?"</p>
<p>"But to live on his wife!" cried Dr. Howe.</p>
<p>"I don't
believe," Gifford responded, smiling,"that that would distress John
Ward at all."</p>
<p>"Apparently not," said the rector significantly."He loves
her too much," Gifford went on, "to think of himself apart from her;
don't you see? They are one; what difference does it make about the
money?"</p>
<p>"Could you do it?" asked Dr. Howe. "Well, no," Gifford said,
shrugging his shoulders; "but then, I 'm not John Ward."</p>
<p>"Thank
Heaven!" said the rector devoutly.</p>
<p>"But it is a mistake, all the
same," Gifford went on; "it is unbusiness like, to say nothing of
beingbad for his people to have the burden of supportlifted from them;
it pauperizes them spiritually."</p>
<p>After the relief of this outburst
against John Ward, Dr. Howe felt the inevitable irritation at
his hearers. "Well, I only mention this," he said, "because, since
he is so strange, it won't do, Gifford, foryou to abet Helen in this
ridiculous skepticism of hers. If Ward agreed with her, it would be
all right, but so long as he does not, it will make trouble</p>
<pb n="193 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
between them, and a woman
cannot quarrel with an obstinate and bigoted man with impunity. And
youhave no business to have doubts yourself, sir."</p>
<p>The two sisters were
much impressed with whatthe rector said. "I must really caution
Giff," said Miss Deborah to Lois, " not to encourage dear Helen in
thinking about things; it's very unfeminine to think, and Gifford is so
clever, he does n't stop to remember she 's but a woman. And he is
greatly attached to her; dear me, he has never forgotten what might have
been,"--this in almost a whisper.</p>
<p>Both the sisters talked of
Dr. Howe's anger as they went home.</p>
<p>"He's right," said Miss Deborah,
who had dropped her nephew's arm, so that she might be more cautious
about the mud, and who lifted her skirt on each side, as though she was
about to make a curtsy,--"he 's right: a woman ought to think just as
her husband does; it is quite wrong in dear Helen not to, and it will
bring unhappiness. Indeed, it is a lesson to all of us," she
added.</p>
<p>Respect was an instinct with Gifford, and he did not stop to
think that it was a lesson by which Miss Deborah would have no
opportunity to profit.</p>
<p>But he was not listening closely to the chatter
ofthe little ladies; he was thinking of Lois's indifference. "She
even looked bored, once," he thought; "but that does not necessarily
mean that she caresfor Forsythe. I will trust her. She may never
loveme, but she will never care for him."</p>
<pb n="[194] CHAPTER XIV"/>
<p>THE feeling in Lockhaven about Helen Ward's unbelief was not
confined to Elder Dean; for everyone who knew Mrs. Davis knew what the
preacher's wife thought of Tom's salvation, and judged
her accordingly. As for the widow herself, the hope Helen had given
herquite died out under the fostering care of Elder Dean. She grew
more bitter than ever, and refused even to speak on the subject.</p>
<p>"No, ma'am," she said wearily, when Helen went to see her after the funeral,
--"no, ma'am, 'tain't nouse to talk. Elder Dean's been here, and I
knowthere ain't no good hopin'. Even the preacher don't say there's any
good hopin'. What you said was a comfort, ma'am, but 't was n't
true. 'T was n't religion. It's in the Bible that there's a hell,
and there 's no use sayin' there is n't; sayin' there is n't won't keep
us from it,ilder Dean says, and I guess he's about right. I 'm sure I
'm much obliged toyou, ma'am; but I 'm a Christian woman myself,and I
can't deny religion."</p>
<p>There was no use arguing; custom and a
smattering of logic settled her convictions, and no reasoning could
move her dreary hopelessness.</p>
<p>Helen told John of it, her head resting
on his breast, and comforted by his mere presence. "I know you believe
in hell;" she ended, "but, oh, John, it is so horrible!"</p>
<pb n="195 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>He stroked her hair
softly. "I am afraid, dearest," he said, "Mrs. Davis is right. I am
afraid there is no possibility of hope. The soul that sinneth, it
shall die, and shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</p>
<p>Helen sprang to her feet. "Oh," she cried passionately,--"that is just
it,--He does do right! Why, if I thought God capable of sending Tom
to hell, I should hate Him." John tried to speak, but she interrupted
him. "We will never talk of thisagain, never  Believe what you will,
dearest,--it does not matter,--but don't speak of it to me, ifyou
love me. I cannot bear it, John. Promise me."</p>
<p>"Oh, Helen," he said, with
tender reproach,: "would you have me conceal my deepest life from you?
It would seem like living apart, if there were onw suvject on which we
dared not touch. Just let me show you the truth and justice of all
this; let me tell you how the scheme of salvation makes the mystery of sin and
punishment clear and right."</p>
<p>"No," she said, the flush of pain dying
out of her face, but her eyes still shining with unshed tears,--"no, I
cannot talk of it. I should be wicked if I could believe it; it would
make me wicked. Don't ever speak to me of it, John."</p>
<p>She came and put
her arms around him, and kissed his forehead gently; and then she left
himto struggle with his conscience, and to ask himself whether his
delay had caused this feeling of abhorrence, or whether the waiting
had been wise and should be prolonged.</p>
<pb n="196 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>But Helen's words to Mrs. Davis were repeated, and ran
from mouth to mouth, with the strangest additions and
alterations. Mrs. Ward had said that there was no hell, and no heaven,
and no God. What wonder, then, with such a leaven of wickedness
at work in the church, Elder Dean grew alarmed, and in the bosom of
his own family expressed his opinion of Mrs. Ward, and at
prayer-meeting prayed fervently for unbelievers, even though she was
not there to profit by it. Once, while saying that the preacher's
wife was sowing tares among the wheat, he met with an astonishing
rebuff. Al-faretta dared tell her father that he ought to be ashamed of
himself to talk that way about a saint and an angel, if ever there was
one.</p>
<p>Mr. Dean was staggered; a female, a young female, and his
daughter, to dare to say such a thing to him! He opened his mouth
several times before he was able to speak.  Alfaretta was at home for her
evening out, and her young man was with her, anxious for the clock to
point to nine, that he might "see her home."  They had intended to leave
the elder's early, and wander off for a walk by the river, but prayers
were delayed a little, and after that Alfaretta had to listen to
the good advice given every week; so Thaddeus lost all hope of the
river-walk, and only watched for nine o'clock, when he knew she must
start. But in this,too, he was doomed to disappointment, for the
outburst which so stunned the elder detained Alfaretta until after
ten, thereby causing Helen no little anxiety about her prompt and
pretty maid.</p>
<pb n="197 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>The elder had closed his admonitions by warning his daughter not to be listening
to any teachings ofthe preacher's wife, for she was a backslider, and
she had fallen from grace. "In the first place," said the elder, laying
down the law with uplifted hand, "she's a Episcopalian,--I heard her
say that her-self, when she first come here; and her letter of
dismissal was from a church with some Popish name,--St. Robert or
Stephen,--I don't just remember.  I've seen one of those
churches. Thank the Lord,there is n't one in Lockhaven. They have
candlesburnin', and a big brass cross. Rags of Popery,--they all
belong to the Scarlet Woman, I tell you!  But she's a backslider even
from that, fer they havesome truth; she's a child of the Evil One,
with herunbelief!</p>
<p>"This was more than Alfaretta could bear. "Indeed,
pa," she cried, "you don't know how good sheis, or you would n't be
sayin' that! Look how she'sslaved this winter fer the families that
'a' been introuble, havin' no work!"</p>
<p>"'T ain't what she 's done,
Alfaretta," said her father solemnly; "works without faith is of
no avail. What says the Scripture? 'A man is justified by faith' (by
faith, Alfaretta!) ' without thedeeds of the law.' And what says the
confession?"</p>
<p>Alfaretta, by force of habit, began to stumble through
the answer: "'We cannot by our bestworks merit pardon of sin, or
eternal life at thehand--at the hand--of God, by reason of'"--Here
her memory failed her.</p>
<p>"Well," her father said impatiently, "can't
you
<pb n="198 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
remember the rest ?
Works done by unregeneratemen are sinful, and cannot please God,' you
know. Go on."</p>
<p>But Alfaretta could not go on, and the elder would not
betray his own lack of memory by attempting to quote.</p>\
<p>"So you see," he
continued, "it is n't any use to talk of how good and kind she is, or
what she does; it is what she believes that will settle her
eternal salvation."</p>
<p>But Alfaretta was unconvinced.  "Well, sir," she said
stubbornly, " it don't seem to me that way, fer she's the best woman,
except mother, I ever saw. I reckon if anybody goes to heaven, she
will; don't you, Thaddeus?"</p>
<p>Thaddeus was tilting back in his chair, his
curly black head against the whitewashed wall, and thus suddenly and
embarrassingly appealed to--for he was divided between a desire to win
the approval of the elder and to show his devotion to Alfaretta--he
brought his chair down with a clatter of all four legs on the floor,
and looked first at the father and then at the daughter, but did not
speak.</p>
<p>"Don't you, Thaddeus?" repeated Alfaretta severely, for the
elder was dumb with astonishment.</p>
<p>"Well," said Thaddeus, struggling
for some opinion which should please both,--"well, I do suppose we
can hope for the best; that is n't against the catechism."</p>
<p>But the
elder did not notice his feeble compromise, while Alfaretta only gave
him a quick, contemptuous look, for her father, opening and
shutting his mouth slowly for a moment, began to say,--</p>
<pb n="199 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"How sharper than a
serpent's tooth it is to havea child that's ungrateful for the best of
teaching and sound doctrine! Many's the time," said theelder, lifting
his eyes and hands,--"many 's the time I've showed her the truth;
many's the time I've explained how every other sort of religion is all
wrong, and is of its father the Devil! And I've brought her up
faithful to the catechism and the confession, yet now the child would
instruct the parent! This comes," he cried, becoming very angry, and
beating his hand so violently upon the table that the family Bible fell
with a crash to the floor, from which Thaddeus lifted it,--"this comes
from your settin' in the seat of the scornful, and bein' in the kitchen
of an unbeliever! You'll leave her; do you hear me, Alfaretta? You'll
leave her this day month. I'll perform my duty to my child's soul, even
if Brother Ward's wife has to do her own cooking.  Yes, and I'll do
my duty to Brother Ward,too, though I used to think him a pious young
man. I'll tell him he has got to convert that woman's soul. She's a
corrupter of youth, she's a teacher of false doctrines,--her tellin'
Mrs. Davis there was n't any hell--she's a--a Episcopalian, so she
is! She'll experience a change of heart, or the Session will take this
matter in hand."</p>
<p>At this terrible threat, even Alfaretta was
speechless, and her mother put two shaking hands on her arm, and
whispered, "Oh, Retta, I would n't say no more; it makes your pa
angry."</p>
<p>"Yes," continued the elder violently, " that woman is the Jonah
of the church, and she's got to be dealt
<pb n="200 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
with; to save her soul, she's got to be
disciplined, for the sake of every one that heard her false and lying
tongue.  I'll have her brought before the Session and showed the truth,
and she shall be saved.  Tom Davis not in hell, indeed!"</p>
<p>Mr. Dean stopped for breath. Alfaretta's couragecame back with a
rush.</p>
<p>"Listen to me," cried the young woman, stamping her foot with excitement, for
she was as angry as the elder himself,--"listen to me! How can you say
such things about her? A saint and angel, if ever there was one. The
Lord don't send no one to hell, let alone such as her. An' any way,
I'd rather go to the bad place with her than stay with all the golden
harps and crowns in the best sort of a heaven with them as would keep
her out, so I would!"</p>
<p>Here Alfaretta broke down, and began to
cry.  Thaddeus could not stand that; he edged up to her, murmuring, "I
would n't cry, Retta,--I would n't cry."</p>
<p>But she only gave the shoulder
he touched a vicious shake, and cried harder than ever, saying,
"No--I--I bet you would n't--you'd never--care."</p>
<p>But Alfaretta's defense
changed Mr. Dean's anger at the snub he received from the preacher's
wifeinto real alarm for his child's spiritual welfare. A daughter of
his to say the Lord did not send souls to hell!</p>
<p>"Alfaretta," he said,
with solemn slowness, "you'd better get your bunnet and go home. I'll
<pb n="201 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
see Mr. Ward about
this; his wife's done harm enough. You've got to leave her,--I mean
it. I won't see her send my child to hell before my very eyes."</p>
"Oh,
pa," Alfaretta entreated, choking and sobbing, and brushing her tears
away with the back ofher hand, "don't,--don't say nothin' to
Mr. Ward, nor take me away. 'T was n't her made me say those things; it
was just my own self. Don't take me away."</p>
<p>"Did she ever say anything
to you about the Lordnot sendin' people to hell?" asked her
father.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Alfaretta, growing more and more frightened, "'t
ain't what she talks about; it's herbein' so good, an'"--</p>
<p>"Did she
ever," interrupted the elder, with slowemphasis, standing over her,
and shaking his stubby forefinger at her,--"did she ever say the Lord
didn't send Tom Davis to hell, to you?"</p>
<p>Alfaretta cowered in her
chair, and Thaddeus began to whimper for sympathy. "I don't know,"she
answered desperately,--"I don't know anything, except she's
good."</p>
<p>"Listen to me," said Mr. Dean, in his harsh, monotonous voice:
"did Mrs. Ward ever say anything to you about hell, or the Lord's not
sendin' people there? Answer me that."</p>
<p>Then the loving little
servant-maid, truthful as the blood of Scotch ancestors and a
Presbyterian training could make her, faced what she knew would bring
remorse, and, for all she could tell, unpardonable sin upon her soul,
and said boldly, "No, she
<pb n="202 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
never did. She never said one single blessed word to me about
hell. "The wind seemed suddenly to leave the elder's sails, but the
collapse was only for a moment; even Alfaretta's offering of her first
lie upon the altar ofher devotion to her mistress was not to save
her. "Well," he said, opening his mouth slowly and looking about with
great dignity, "if she has n't said it to you, she has to other people,
I'll be bound. Fer she said it to Mrs. Davis, and "--the elder
inflated his chest, and held his head high--"and me.It is my duty as
elder to take notice of it, fer her own soul's sake, and to open her
husband's eyes, if he's been too blind to see it. Yes, the
Session should deal with her. Prayers ain't no good fer such as her," he
said, becoming excited. "Ain't she heard my prayers most all winter,
till she give up'comin' to prayer-meetin', preferrin' to stay
outside,
"'Where sinners meet, and awful scoffers dwell'?"
An' I've exhorted; but "--the elder raised hiseyes piously to heaven--"Paul may
plant and Apollos may water, but it don't do no good."</p>
<p>Alfaretta knew
her father's iron will too well to attempt any further protests. She
wiped her eyes, and, while she Ipt on a hat adorned with an aggres-sive
white feather, she bade the family good-night in an unsteady
voice. Thaddeus, anxious only to escape notice, sidled towards the
door, and stood waiting for her, with a deprecating look on his round
face.</p>
<p>In spite, however, of the elder's indignation and
<pb n="203 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
his really genuine alarm
about the influences which surrounded his child, he had a prudent
after thoughtin the matter of her leaving the service of Mrs. Ward. It
was difficult to get anything in Lock-haven for a young woman to do,
and times were hard that year.</p>
<p>"You--ah--you need n't give notice
tonight, Alfaretta," he said. "I'll speak to the preacher about it,
myself. But mind you have as little to say to her as you can, and may
the Lord protect you!"</p>
<p>But the elder's plans for cautioning his
pastor were doomed to disappointment. He was a prisoner with lumbago for
the next fortnight, and even the most sincere interest in some one
else's spiritual welfare cannot tempt a man out of the house when he is
bent almost double with lumbago. Nor, when John came to see him, could
he begin such a conversation as he had planned, for his neck was too
stiff to allow him to raise his head and look in Mr.Ward's face. When
he recovered, he was delayed still another week, because the preacher
had gone away to General Assembly.</p>
<p>But Alfaretta was far too miserable
to find in her father's command "not to give notice tonight" any ray
of comfort. She choked down her tears asbest she might, and started
for the parsonage.</p>
<p>Thaddeus had almost to run to keep up with her,such
was her troubled and impatient haste, and she scarcely noticed him,
though he tramped through the mud to show his contrition, instead of
taking his place by her side on the board walk.</p>
<pb n="204 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>It is curious to see how a simple soul inflicts
use-less punishment upon itself, when the person it has offended
refuses to retaliate. Had Alfaretta scolded, Thaddeus would not have
walked in the mud.</p>
<p>Her silence was most depressing.</p>
<p>"Retta," he ventured
timidly, "don't be mad with me,--now don't."</p>
<p>He came a little Nearer,
and essayed to put an arm about her waist, a privilege often accorded
him on such an occasion. But now she flounced away from him, and said
sharply, "You needn't be comin'round me, Mr. Thaddeus Green. Anybody
that thinks my Mrs. Ward is n't goin' to heaven had just better keep off
from me, fer I'm goin' with her,wherever that is; and I suppose, if
you think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> of me, you'd better not associate with me."</p>
<p>"I did n't
say <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was goin'," protested Thaddeus tearfully, but she interrupted
him with asperity.</p>
<p>"Don't I tell you I'm bound to go where she goes?
And if you're so fearful of souls bein' lost, Iwonder you don't put
all your money in the missionary-box, instead of buying them new
boots."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the thought of the new boots, but Thaddeus
stepped on the board walk, and this time, unreproved, slipped his arm
about Alfaretta's waist.</p>
<p>"Oh, now Retta," he said, "I did n't mean
anyharm. I only did n't want the elder thinkin' I was n't sound, for
he'd be sayin' we should n't keep company, an' that's all I joined the
church for lastspring."</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Alfaretta, willing to be
recon-
<pb n="205 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
ciled if it brought any comfort, " you do think Mrs.Ward will go to
heaven?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Thaddeus answered with great confidence,and added in a burst
of gallantry, "She'll have to, Retta, if she goes along with you, for
you'll go there,sure!"
<pb n="[206] CHAPTER XV"/>
MRS. FORSYTHE did not come to Ashurst until the middle of April, and then she came
alone. Dick had been detained, she said, and would come in a week or
two. So Lois breathed freely, though she knew it was only a respite,
and made the most of her freedom to go and see his mother.</p>
<p>She was very
fond of the invalid, who always seemed to her, in her glowing, rosy
health, like an exquisite bit of porcelain, she was so fine and
dainty, with soft white hair curling around her gentle and melancholy
face. Mrs. Forsyhe dressed in delicate grays and lavenders, and her
fingers were covered with rings, and generally held some filmy
fancy-work. Her invalidism had only given her an airof interesting
fragility, which made Lois long to puther strong young arms about her,
to shield her lest any wind might blow too roughly upon
her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Forsythe accepted her devotion with complacency. She had
never had this adoring tenderness from her son, who had heard her
remark that she was at the gates of death too often to live in a
state of anxiety; but to Lois her gentle resignation and heavenly
anticipations were most impressive. The girl's affection almost
reconciled the elder lady to having been made to come to Ashurst while
the snow still lingered in sheltered spots, and before the 
<pb n="207 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
crocuses had lighted
their golden censers in her garden; for Lois went to see her every
day, and though she could not always escape without a meaning look from
the invalid, or a sigh for Dick's future, she thoroughly enjoyed her
visits. It was charming to sit in the dusk, before the dancing flames
of an apple-wood fire, the air fragrant with the hyacinths and
jonquils of the window garden, and listen to talesof Mrs. Forsythe's
youth.</p>
<p>Lois had never heard such stories. Mrs. Dale would have said it
was not proper for young girls to know of love affairs, and it is
presumable that the Misses Woodhouse never had any to relate; so
this was Lois's first and only chance, and she would sit, clasping her
knees with her hands, listening withwide, frank eyes, and cheeks
flushed by the fire andthe tale.</p>
<p>"But then, my poor health,"
Mrs. Forsythe ended with a sigh, one evening, just before it was time
for Lois to go; "of course it interfered very much."</p>
<p>"Why, were you ill
<hi rend="italic">then</hi>," Lois said, "when you used to dance all
night?"</p>
<p>"Oh, dear me,
yes," answered the other shaking her head, "I have been a sufferer all
my life, a greatsufferer. Well, it cannot last much longer; this poor
body is almost worn out."</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> say it!" Lois cried, and kissed
the white soft hand with its shining rings, in all the tenderness of
her young heart.</p>
<p>All this endeared the girl very much, and more than
once Mrs. Forsythe wrote of her sweetness andgoodness to her son. Miss
Deborah, or Miss Ruth,
<pb n="208 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
or even Mrs. Dale, would have been careful in using the name of any young
woman in writing to agentleman, but Mrs. Forsythe had not been born
in Ashurst.</p>
<p>However, Dick still lingered, and Lois rejoiced, and even her
anticipation of the evil time to come, when he should arrive and end
her peaceful days, could not check her present contentment. It
was almost May, and that subtile, inexplainable joy of the spring time
made it a gladness even to be alive.  Lois rambled about, hunting for
the first greenspears of that great army of flowers which--wouldsoon
storm the garden, and carrying any treasure she might find to
Mrs. Forsythe's sick-room. The meadows were spongy with small springs,
bubblingup under the faintly green grass. The daffadown-dillies showed
bursting yellow buds, and the pallid, frightened-looking violets
brought all their mysteryof unfolding life to the girl's happy
eyes.</p>
<p>One Saturday morning, while she was looking forthe bunch of grape
hyacinths which came up each year, beside the stone bench, she was
especially light-hearted. Word had come from Helen that
the long-promised visit should be made the first weekin June. "It can
only be for a week, you know," Helen wrote, "because I cannot be away
from Johnlonger than that; and I must be back for our
firstanniversary, too."</p>
<p>More than this, Mrs. Forsythe had sighed,
and told her that poor dear Dick's business seemed to detain him; it was
such a shame! And perhaps he could not get to Ashurst for a
fortnight. So Lois
<pb n="209 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
Howe was a very happy and contented girl, standing under the soft
blue of the April sky, and watching her flock of white pigeons
wheeling and circling about the gable of the red barn, while the
little stream, which had gained a stronger voice since the spring rains,
babbled vociferously at her side. The long, transparent stems of the
flowers broke crisply between her fingers, as she heard her name
called.</p>
<p>Mr. Denner, with his fishing-basket slung underone arm and his
rod across his shoulder, was regarding her through a gap in the
hedge.</p>
<p>"A lovely day " said the little gentleman, his brown eyes
twinkling with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>"Indeed it is, sir," Lois answered; "and look atthe flowers I've
found!"</p>
<p>She tipped the basket of scented
grass on her armthat he might see them. Mr. Denner had stopped to ask
if Mrs. Forsythe would be present at the whist party that night, and
was rather relieved to learn that she was not able to come; he had lost
his hand the week before, because she had arrived with the Dales. Then
he inquired about her son's arrival, and went away thinking what a
simple matter a love affair was to some people. Lois and that young
man! Why, things were really arranged for them; they had almost no
responsibility in the matter; their engagement settled itself, as it
were.</p>
<p>He walked abstractedly towards his house, wrestling with the old
puzzle.  Nothing helped him, or threw light on his uncertainty; he was
tired of juggling with fate, and was growing desperate.</p>
<p>"I wish they would settle it between themselves," 
<pb n="210 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
he murmured, with a wistful wrinkle on his
forehead. Suddenly a thought struck him; there was certainlyone way out
of his difficulties: he could ask advice. He could lay the whole matter
frankly before some dispassionate person, whose judgment should
determine his course. Why had he not thought of it before I
Mr. Denner's face brightened; he walkedgayly along, and began to hum
to himself:--</p>
<p>"Oh, wert thou, love, but near me, But near, near, near
me, How fondly wouldst thou cheer me"--</p>
<p>Here he stopped abruptly. Whom
should he ask? He went carefully through his list of friends, as
he trudged along the muddy road.</p>
<p>Not Dr. Howe: he did not take a serious
enough view of such things; Mr. Denner recalled that scene in his
office, and his little face burned. Then, there was Mrs. Dale: she was
a woman, and of course she would know the real merit of each of the
sisters. Stay: Mrs. Dale did not always seem in sympathy with the Misses
Woodhouse; he had even heard her say things which were not, perhaps,
perfectly courteous; that the sisters had been able to defend
themselves, Mr. Denner overlooked. Colonel Drayton:well, a man with
the gout is not the confidant for a lover. He was beginning to look
depressed again, when the light came. Henry Dale! No one could be
better.</p>
<p>Mr. Denner awaited the evening with impatience.He would walk
home with the Dales, he thought,and then he and Henry could talk it
all over, downin the study.</p>
<pb n="211 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>He was glad when the cool spring night began to close, full of that
indefinable fragrance of fresh earth and growing things, and before it
was time to start he cheered himself by a little music. He went into the
dreary, unused parlor, and pulling up the green Venetian blinds, which
ratted like castanets, he pushed back the ivy-fastened shutters, and
satdown by the open window; then, with his chin resting upon his
fiddle, and one foot in its drab gaiter swinging across his knee, he
played mournfully and shrilly in the twilight, until it was time to
start.</p>
<p>He saw the Misses Woodhouse trotting toward the rectory, with
Sarah walking in a stately way behind them, swinging her unlighted
lantern, and cautioning them not to step in the mud. But he made no
effort to join them; it was happiness enough to contemplate the
approaching solution of his difficulties, and say to himself
triumphantly, "This time to-morrow!" and he began joyously to play, "Ye
banks and braes o' bonnie Doon," rendering carefully all the quavers
in that quavering air.</p>
<p>Mr. Denner's meditations made him late at
therectory, and he felt Mrs. Dale look sternly at him;so he made haste
to deal, sitting well forward in hischair, under which he tucked his
little feet, and put-ting down each card with nervous care. His
large cuffs almost hid his small, thin hands, and now and then he paused
to rub his thumb and forefinger to-gether, that the cards might not
stick. But Mr. Denner did not play well that night; Miss Deborah looked
at him with mild reproach,
<pb n="212 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
and was almost angr when he answered her with an absent
smile.</p>
<p>The evening seemed very long to Mr. Denner, and even when the
party had said "Good-night" Mr.Dale was slow about getting off; he put
his wife into the carriage, and then stopped to ask Dr. Howe if he had
the first edition of "Japhet in Search ofa Father"?</p>
<p>"In search of a
father!" Mr. Denner thought, ashe stood waiting by the steps,--"how
can he be interested in that?"</p>
<p>At last the front door closed, and
Mr. Dale and Mr. Denner walked silently down the lane in the starlight,
the lawyer's little heart beating so with excitement, that he had a
suffocated feeling, and once or twice put his hand to his throat, as
though to loosen his muffler.</p>
<p>Mr. Dale, still absorbed in his first
edition, took swinging strides, the tails of his brown cloth over-coat
flapping and twisting about his long, thin legs. Mr. Denner had now and
then almost to break intoa trot to keep up with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Dale walked
with his hands clasped behind him, and his stick under his arm; his
soft felt hat waspulled down over his eyes, so that his keeping
the path was more by chance than sight. He stopped once to pluck a sprig
from the hawthorn hedge, toput between his lips. This gave Mr. Denner
breath, and a chance to speak."</p>
<p>"I think I will walk home with you,
Henry," he said. "I want to have a talk with you."</p>
<p>His heart thumped as
he said that; he felt he had committed himself.</p>
<pb n="213 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
<p>"Well, now, that's very pleasant,"
responded Mr. Dale. "I was just thinking I should be alone half the way
home."</p>
<p>"But you would not be alone when you got there,"Mr. Denner said
meditatively; "now, with me it is different."</p>
<p>"Oh, quite
different,--quite different."</p>
<p>"Yes," proceeded the other, "I have very
little companionship. I go home and sit in my library all by
myself. Sometimes, I get up and wander about the house, with only my
cigar for company."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Mr. Dale, "that you can
smoke wherever you want, in your house? I often think of your
loneliness; coming and going just as you please, quite
independently."</p>
<p>Mr. Denner gave him a sudden questioning look, and then
appeared to reproach himself for having misunderstood his friend.</p>
<p>"Yes, just so,--just so. I knew you would appreciate it; but you can never
know from experience, Henry, how a man feels left quite to
himself. You do not think of the independence; it is the
loneliness. You cannot know that."</p>
<p>"No," murmured Mr. Dale, "perhaps
not, but I can imagine it."</p>
<p>When they reached the iron gate of Dale
house, they followed the trim path across the lawn to the north side of
the house, where it ended in a little walk, three bricks wide, laid end
to end, and so damp with perpetual shade, they were slippery with green
mould, and had tufts of moss between them.</p>
<p>Mr. Dale's study was in a
sort of half basement,
<pb n="214 JOHN WARD, PREACHER"/>
one went down two steps to reach the doorway, and the windows, set in thick
stone walls and almost hidden in a tangle of wistaria, were just
above the level of the path.</p>
<p>The two old men entered, Mr. Dale bending
his tall white head a little; and while the lawyer unwound a long blue
muffler from about his throat, the host lighted a lamp, and, getting
down on hisknees, blew the dim embers in the rusty grate into a
flickering blaze. Then he pulled a blackened crane from the jamb, and
hung on it a dinted brass kettle, so that he might add some hot water
to Mr.Denner's gin and sugar, and also make himself a cup of tea. That
done, he took off his overcoat, throwing it across the mahogany arm of
the horse-hair sofa, which was piled with books and pamphlets,and
whitened here and there with ashes from his silver pipe; then he
knotted the cord of his flowered dressing-gown about his waist, spread
his red silk handkerchief over his thin locks, and, placing his feet
comfortably upon the high fender, was readyfor
conversation.</p>
<p>Mr. Denner, meanwhile, without waiting for the formality
of an invitation, went at once to a small corner closet, and brought
out a flat, dark bottle and an old silver cup. He poured the contents
of the bottle into the cup, added some sugar, and lastly, with a sparing
hand, the hot water, stirring it roundand round with the one teaspoon
which they shared between them.  Mr. Dale had produced a battered caddy,
and soon the fumes of gin and tea mingled amicably together.</p>

<p>"If I could always have
such evenings as this,"Mr. Denner thought, sipping the hot gin and
water,and crossing his legs comfortably, " I should not have to think
of--something different."</p>
"Your wife would appreciate what I meant
aboutloneliness," he said, going back to what was upper-most in his
mind. "A house without a mistress atits head, Henry, is - ah - not
what it should be."The remark needed no reply; and Mr. Daleleaned back
in his leather chair, dreamily watchingthe blue smoke from his slender
pipe drift level fora moment, and then, on an unfelt draught, draw
upthe chimney.Mr. Denner, resting his mug on one knee, beganto stir
the fire gently. "Yes, Henry," he continued," I feel it more and more
as I grow older. I reallyneed - ah - brightness and comfort in my
house.Yes, I need it. And even if I were not interested,as it were,
myself, I don't know but what my dutyto Willie should make me - ah-
think of it."Mr. Dale was gazing at the fire. "Think ofwhat?" he
said.Mr. Denner became very much embarrassed."Why, what I was just
observing, just speaking of,-the need of comfort-in my house-and my
life,I might say. Less loneliness for me, Henry, and, infact, a -
person - a - a female - you understand."Mr. Dale looked at him."In
fact, as I might say, a wife, Henry."Mr. Dale was at last aroused;
with his pipe be-tween his lips, he clutched the lion's-heads on
thearms of his chair, and sat looking at Mr. Denner in<pb
n="216"/>218        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.such horrified astonishment,
that the little gentlemanstumbled over any words, simply for the
relief ofspeaking." Yes," he said, "just so, Henry, just so. I
havebeen thinking of it lately, perhaps for the last year;yes - I have
been thinking of it."Mr. Dale, still looking at him, made an
inarticu-late noise in his throat.Mr. Denner's face began to show a
faint dull redto his temples. "Ah -yes- I - I have thoughtof it, as it
were.""Denner," said Mr. Dale solemnly, "you're afool.""If you mean my
age, Henry," cried the other,his whole face a dusky crimson, that sent
the tearsstinging into his little brown eyes, "I cannot say Ithink
your-surprise- is- ah--justified. It isnot as though there was
anything unsuitable - she- they - are quite my age. And for Willie's
sake,I doubt if it is not a -a duty. And I am onlysixty-one and a
half, Henry. You did not remeln-ber, perhaps, that I was so much
younger than you ? "Mr. Dale pulled off his red handkerchief, andwiped
his forehead; after which he said quite vio-lently, "The devil!""Oh,"
remonstrated Mr. Denner, balancing hismug on his knee, and lifting his
hands deprecatingly," not such words, Henry, - not such words; we
arespeaking of ladies, Henry."Mr. Dale was silent."'You have no idea,"
the other continued, "inyour comfortable house, with a good wife, who
makes<pb n="217"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            217you perfectly
happy, how lonely a man is who livesas I do; and I can tell you, the
older he grows, themore he feels it. So really, age is a reason for
con-sidering it.""I was not thinking of age," said
Mr. Dalefeebly."Well, then," replied the other triumphantly,"age is
the only objection that could be urged. Aman is happier and better for
female influence; andthe dinners I have are really not- not what
theyshould be, Henry. That would all be changed, if Ihad a - ah
-wife.""Denner," said his friend, "there are circum-stances where a
dinner of herbs is more tb be de-sired than a stalled ox, you will
remember."" That is just how I feel," said the other eagerly,and too
much interested in his own anxieties to seeMr. Dale's point. "Maryis
not altogether amiable."Again Mr. Dale was silent."I knew you would
see the - the - desirabilityof it," the lawyer continued, the flush of
embarrass-ment fading away, " and so I decided to ask youradvice. I
thought that, not only from your own -ah - heart, but from the novels
and tales you read,you would be able to advise me in any matter
ofesteem."Mr. Dale groaned, and shook his head from sideto side."But,
good Lord, Denner, books are one thing,life's another. You can't live
in a book, man.""Just so," said Mr. Denner, "just so; but I onlywant
the benefit of your experience in reading these<pb n="218"/>218
JOHN WARD, PREACHER.tales of - ah - romance. You see, here is
mytrouble, Henry, - I cannot make up my mind.""To do it ?" cried
Mr. Dale, with animation.But Mr. Denner interrupted him with a
politegesture. "No, I shall certainly do it. I did notmean to mislead
you. I shall certainly do it, but Icannot make up my mind
which.""Which ?" said Mr. Dale vaguely."Yes," answered the little
gentleman, "which.Of course you know that I refer to the Misses
Wood-house. You must have noticed my attentions oflate, for I have
shown a great deal of attention toboth; it has been very marked. Yet,
Henry, I can-not tell which (both are such estimable persons)which I -
should - ah - prefer.  And knowingyour experience, a married man
yourself, and yourreading on such subjects, - novels are mostly
basedupon esteem, - I felt sure you could advise me."A droll look came
into Mr. Dale's face, but he didnot speak.Feeling that he had made a
clean breast of it, andthat the responsibility of choice was shifted
to hisfriend's shoulders, the lawyer, taking a last draughtfrom the
silver mug, and setting it down empty onthe table, leaned comfortably
back in his chair toawait the decision.There was a long silence; once
Mr. Denner brokeit by saying, "Of course, Henry, you see the
im-portance of careful judgment," and then they werestill again.At
last, Mr. Dale, with a long sigh, straightenedup in his chair. He
lifted his white fluted china<pb n="219"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHE.

it and a worn gilt handle, and tooka pinch of tea from the caddy;
then, pouring someboiling water over it, he set it on the hob to
steep." Denner," he said slowly, " which advice do youwant? Whether to
do it at all, or which lady tochoose ?""Which lady, of course,"
answered Mr. Dennerpromptly. "There can be but one opinion as to
thefirst question.""Ah," responded Mr. Dale; then, a momentafterwards,
he added, " Well" -Mr. Denner looked at his friend, with eyes shin-ing
with excitement. "It is very important to me,Henry," he said, with a
faltering voice. "You willkeep that in mind, I am sure. They are both
soadmirable, and yet -there must be some choice.Miss Deborah's
housekeeping - you know there's nosuch ooking in Ashurst; and she's
very economical.But then, Miss Ruth is artistic, and " -here a
finewavering blush crept over his little face - " she is- ah -pretty,
Henry. And the money is equallydivided," he added, with a visible
effort to return topractical things." I know. Yes, it 's very
puzzling. On the whole,Denner, I do not see how I can advise
you."Mr. Denner seemed to suffer a collapse." Why, Henry," he
quavered, "you must have anopinion ? ""No," Mr. Dale answered
thoughtfully," I cannotsay that I have. Now, I put it to you, Denner:
howcould I decide on the relative merits of Miss Ruth. ,<pb
n="220"/>220        JOHN WARD, PREACHERand Miss Deborah, seeing that I
have no affection,only respect, for either of them ? Affection I
thatought to be your guide. Which do you have mostaffection for ?
""Why, really"- said Mr. Denner, "really" -and he stopped to think,
looking hard at the sealring on his left hand -" I am afraid it is
just thesame, if you call it affection. You see that does n'thelp
us."He had identified Mr. Dale's interest with hisown anxiety,- and
looked wistfully at the older man,who seemed sunk in thought and quite
forgetful ofhis presence. Mr. Denner put one hand to his lipsand gave
a little cough. Then he said: -"One would think there would be a rule
aboutsuch things, some acknowledged method; a proverb,for instance; it
would simplify matters very much.""True," said Mr. Dale."Yes,"
Mr. Denner added, "you would think insuch a general thing as marriage
there would be.Complications like this must constantly arise. Whatif
Miss Deborah and Miss Ruth had another sister?Just see how confused a
man might be. Yes, onewould suppose the wisdom of experience would
takethe form of an axiom. But it has n't."He sighed deeply, and rose,
for it was late, andthe little fire had burned out.Mr. Dale bent
forward, with his elbows on hislean knees, and gently knocked the
ashes from hissilver pipe. Then he got up, and, standing with hisback
to the cold grate, and the tails of his flowereddressing-gown under
each arm in a comfortable way,<pb n="221"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
221he looked at the lawyer, with his head a little on oneside, as
though he were about to speak. Mr. Dennernoticed it."Ah, you cannot
make any suggestion, Henry ?""Well," said Mr. Dale, "it seems to me I
had athought - a sort of a proverb, you might say- butit slips my
memory."Mr. Denner, with his overcoat half on, stood quitestill, and
trembled."It is something about how to make up yourmind," Mr. Dale
continued, very slowly; "let mesee."" How to make up your mind?" cried
Mr. Den-ner. "That's just the thingl I'm sure,that's justthe thing!
And we cannot but have the greatestconfidence in proverbs. They are so
eminently trust-worthy. They are the concentrated wisdom--of--of the
ages, as it were. Yes, I should be quite will-ing to decide the matter
by a proverb."He looked at Mr. Dale eagerly, but this especialpiece of
wisdom still eluded the older man."It begins," said Mr. Dale,
hesitating, and fix-ing his eyes upon the ceiling, - "it begins- let
mesee. ' When in doubt'- ah"" What is it? " gasped Mr. Denner. " That
hasa familiar sound, but I cannot seem to finish it.When in doubt,
what? "" Well," answered his friend ruefully, "it is notquite - it
does not exactly apply. I am afraid itwon't help us out. You know the
rest. It is merely- ' take the trick' I"<pb n="222"/>CHAPTER XVI.THE
morning after John Ward's return from histwo weeks' absence at General
Assembly, he foundit hard to settle down to work. Not that there
wasvery much to talk about, for daily letters had toldof daily doings,
but to be with Helen again was anabsorbing joy. She followed him about
as he puthis papers away, and he, in turn, came out into thegarden to
watch her while she showed Alfarettawhere to plant some flower
seeds."Come over here," Helen said, "and see theseviolets under the
big elm I I have been so in hopesthey would blossom in time to welcome
you. Let'spick some for the study."They pushed the shining, wet leaves
aside, andfound the flowers, and then John watched his wifeput them in
a shallow dish on his table."It is weak in me to come in here," Helen
said,smiling. "I know you ought to work, yet here Isit.""This is
Thursday," he answered, "and I wrotemy sermon on the train yesterday,
so after I havecopied the reports I can afford to be lazy. I can-iot
bear to have you out of my sight "  He drewher brown head down on his
shoulder, and strokedher face softly. " When I'm away from you,
Helen,I seem only half alive."<pb n="223"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER
223"And in three weeks I have to go to Ashurst,"sl c said
ruefully. 'tIt is too bad I could n't havegone while you were at
General Assembly, but itwould n't have been right for us both to be
awayfrom the parsonage at once.""No. Well, we have the three weeks
yet. Yes,I must send you away, and get at the reports. Howyou brighten
this room, Helen I I think it must bethe sunshine that seems caught in
your hair. Itgleams like bronze oak-leaves in October.""Love has done
wonderful things for your eyes,John," she said, smiling, as she left
him.She put on her heavy gloves and brought hertrowel from under the
front porch, and she and themaid began to dig up the fresh, damp earth
on thesunny side of the house."We'll have some sweet-peas here,
Alfaretta,"she said cheerily, "and I think it would be nice to letthe
nasturtiums run over that log, don't you? And-you must plant these
morning-glory seeds aroundthe kitchen windows."  Suddenly she noticed
thatAlfaretta, instead of listening, was gazing down theroad, and her
round freckled face flushing hotly." He sha'n't come in," she
muttered, - " he sha'n'tcome in! " and dropping the hammer, and the
boxof tacks, and the big ball of twine, she hurried tothe gate, her
rough hands clinched into two sturdyfists.Helen looked towards the
road, and saw Mr. Deancome stiffly up to the gate, for lumbago was not
al-together a memory. Alfaretta reached it as he did,and as she
stooped to lean her elbows on its top barshe slipped the latch
inside.<pb n="224"/>224        JOHN WARD, PREACHER."Alfaretta," said
her father pompously, "openthe gate, if you please." As he spoke, he
rappedupon it with his heavy stick, and the little latchclattered and
shook." Were you coming to see me, pa? " the girl askednervously. "I -
I 'm busy this morning. It 's mynight out, so I '11 see you this
evenin'."" Yes, I '11 see you," returned Mr. Dean significantly, "but
not now. I did n't come to see younow; I 'm here to see the preacher,
Alfaretta. Come,don't keep me out here in the sun," he added
impa-tiently, shaking the gate again." I guess he 's too busy to see
you this morning,- he 's awful busy."" I guess he 's not too busy to
see me," said theelder.Alfaretta's face was white now, but she still
stoodbarring the gateway. "Well, you can't see him,anyhow;" her voice
had begun to tremble, and Mrs.Ward, who had joined them, said, with a
surprisedlook,-"Why, what do you mean, Alfaretta? Of courseMr. Ward
will see your father. I hope your lum-bago is better, Elder Dean ?
"Mr. Dean did not notice her question. "Cer-tainly he will see
me. Come, now, open the gate;be spry.""You can't see him! " cried
Alfaretta, burstinginto tears. "I say he won't see you, so there!"Her
mistress looked at her in astonishment, buther father put his big hand
over the gate, and,wrenching the little latch open, strode up to the
frontdoor of the parsonage.<pb n="225"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
225Helen and her maid looked at each other; Alfa-retta's face working
convulsively to keep back thetears, and her mistress's eyes full of
disapproval."Why did you say that, Alfaretta?" she said." It was not
true; you knew Mr. Ward could seeyour father." Then she turned back to
her plant-ing.Alfaretta followed her, and, kneeling down bythe border,
began to grub at the intruding bladesof grass, stopping to put her
hand up to her eyesonce in a while, which made her face
singularlystreaked and muddy." What is the matter, Alfaretta? " Helen
asked,at last, coldly. She did not mean to be unkind, butshe was
troubled at the girl's untruthfulness.Alfaretta wailed."Tell me,"
Helen said, putting her hand lightlyon her shoulder. "Are you crying
because yousaid what was not true ? ""'T ain't that I" sobbed
Alfaretta."I wish, then, you would either stop, or go intothe house."
Helen's voice was stern, and Alfarettalooked at her with reproachful
eyes; then coveringher face with her hands, she rocked backwards
andforwards, and wept without restraint." I 'm afraid - I 'm afraid he
's going to takeme away from here I ""Take you away ?"     Helen said,
surprised"Why? Is the work too hard?""No - no ma'am," Alfaretta
answered, choking." I '11 go and see him at once," Helen said."Oh, no
I" Alfaretta cried, catching her mis.<pb n="226"/>226        7J6N
WARD, PRtACHAtress's skirt with grimy hands, "don't go; 't won'tdo any
good."" Don't be foolish," Helen remonstrated, smiling;"of course I
must speak to him. If your fatherthinks there is too much work, he
must tell me, andI will arrange it differently."She stooped, and took
the hem of her cambricgown from between the girl's fingers, and then
wentquickly into the house.She rapped lightly at the study
door. "John, Imust come in a moment, please."She heard a chair pushed
back, and John's foot.step upon the floor. He opened the door, and
stoodlooking at her with strange, unseeing eyes."Go away, Helen," he
said hoarsely, withoutwaiting for her to speak, for she was dumb
withastonishment at his face, - "go away, my darling."He put out one
hand as if to push her back, andclosed the door, and she heard the
bolt pushed. Shestood a moment staring at the blank of the
lockeddoor. What could it mean? Alfaretta's miseryand morals were
forgotten; something troubledJohn, - she had no thought for anything
else. Sheturned away as though in a dream, and began ab-sently to take
off her garden hat. John was in somedistress. She went up-stairs to
her bedroom, andtried to keep busy with sewing until she could goto
him, but she was almost unconscious of what shedid. How long, how very
long, the morning was !John had looked up from his writing to see
Mr.Dean standing in the doorway.<pb n="227"/>$OHN WARD, PREACHER
227"Good-morning," he said cordially, as he rose togive his hand to
his elder. "I am glad to see you.How have things gone since I have
been away ? "But Mr. Dean seemed to have nothing special toreport, and
let the preacher tell him of General As-sembly, while, embarrassed and
very uncomfortable,he sat twisting his hat round and round in his
big,rough hands.A bar of sunshine from the south window creptacross
the floor, and touched the low dish of violetson the table, and then
John's face, making a suddengolden glint in his gentle dark eyes."
Mr. Ward,'" the elder said, at last, opening hismouth once or twice
before he began to speak, "Ihave a distress on my mind. I think the
Spirit ofthe Lord 's driven me to tell you of it."" Are you in any
trouble, my friend ? " The tiredlook whibh had fallen upon John's faoe
as he putdown his pen was gone in a moment  " I am glad,4hen, I was
not away any longer. I trust sicknesshas not come to your family
?""No, sir," answered the other solemnly, "notsickness of body. What
does the Good Book sayto the Christian? 'He shall give his angels
chargeover thee.'  No, I'm mercifully preserved fromsickness; for, as
for me and my house, we serve theLord. My lumbago was bad while you
was away;but it 's better, I'm thankful to say. Sickness ofthe soul,
Mr. Ward, - that is what is truly awful."" I hope you are not feeling
the power of Satanin doubts?" John said anxiously. "Such sickness.of
the soul is indeed worse than any which can cometo the body."<pb
n="228"/>228        JOHN WARD, PREACHER"No," replied the elder, "no,
my feet are fixed.I know whom I have believed. I have entered intothe
hidden things of God. I am not afraid of doubt,ever. - Yet what a
fearful thing doubt is, BrotherWard I"" It is, indeed," John replied
humbly. " Throughthe mercy of God, I have never known its
temptation.He has kept me from ever questioning truth.""What a
terrible thing it would be,' said Mr.Dean, beginning to forget his
awkwardness, "ifdoubt was to grow up in any heart, or in any family,or
in any church I I've sometimes wondered if, oflate, you had given, us
enough sound doctrine in thepulpit, sir? The milk of the Word we can
get outof the Bible for ourselves, but doctrines, they ain'tto be
found in Holy Writ as they'd ought to bepreached."John looked
troubled. He knew the rebuke wasmerited. " I have feared my sermons
were, as yousay, scarcely doctrinal enough. Yet I have in-structed you
these six years in points of faith, andI felt it was perhaps wiser to
turn more to the ten-derness of God as it is in Christ. And I
cannotagree with you that the doctrines are not in theBible,
Mr. Dean.""Well," the elder admitted, "of course. But notso he that
runs may read, or that the wayfaring manwill not err therein. There is
some folks as woqldtake ' God is love' out of the Good Book, and
for-get ' Our God is a consuming fire."'John bent his head on his hand
for a moment, anddrove his mind back to his old arguments for
silence.<pb n="229"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.           229Neither of
the men spoke for a little while, and thenJohn said, still without
raising his head:- "Do you feel that this--neglect of mine hasbeen of
injury to any soul? It is your duty totell me."It was here that
Helen's knock came, and whenJohn had taken his seat again he looked
his accuserstraight in the eyes."Do you? " he said." Sir," answered
the elder, " I can't say. I ain'theard that it has - and yet- I 'm
fearful. Yet Ididn't come to reproach you for that. You haveyour
reasons for doing as you did, no doubt. Butwhat I did come to do,
preacher, was to warn youthat there was a creepin' evil.in the church;
and weneed strong doctrine now, if we ain't before. AndI came the
quicker to tell you, sir, because it'sfastened on my own
household. Yes, on my ownchild !""Your own child?" John said.     "You
havenothing to fear for Alfaretta; she is a very good,steady girL""
She's good enough and she's steady enough,"returned 'Mr. Dean, shaking
his head; "and oh,Mr. Ward, when she joined the church, two yearsago,
there wasn't anybody (joinin' on profession)better grounded in the,
faith than she was. Sheknew her catechism through and through, and
shenever asked a question or had a doubt about it inher life. But
now,-- now it's different !" "Do you mean," John asked, "that her
faith isshaken,-- that she has doubts ? Such times are apt<pb
n="230"/>230         JOHN WARD, PREACHER.to come to very young
Christians, though theyare conscious of no insincerity, and the doubts
are butsuperficial. Has she such doubts? "" She has, sir, she has,"
cried the elder, "and itbreaks my heart to see my child given over to
theEvil One I "" No, no," John said tenderly; "if she is one ofthe
elect, - and we have reason to hope she is, -she will
persevere. Remember, for your comfort,the perseverance of the
saints. But how has thiscome about ? Is it through any influence
?""Yes, sir, it is," said the elder quickly."What is the especial
doubt ? " John asked."It is her views of hell that distress me,"
an-swered the elder. John looked absently beyondhim, with eyes which
saw, not Alfaretta, but Helen."That is very serious," he said
slowly."'Tain't natural to her," protested the elder."She was grounded
on hell; she 's been taught bet-ter. It's the influence she's been
under, preacher.""Surely it cannot be any one in our church,"John said
thoughtfully. "I can think of too manywho are weak in grace and good
works, but nonewho doubt the faith."" Yes," replied the elder, "yes,
it is in our church.That's why I came to beg you to teach sound
doc-trine, especially the doctrine of qlasting punish-ment. I could a'
dealt with Alfaretta myself, andI'll bring her round, you can depend
on that; butit is for the church I'm askin' you, and fer thatperson
that's unsettled Alfaretta.  Convert her,save her. It is a woman, sir,
a member (by letter,<pb n="231"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
281,Brother Ward) of our church, and she's spreadin'nets of eternal
ruin for our youth, and I came tosay she ought to be dealt with; the
Session ought totake notice of it. The elders have been speakin' ofit
while you was away; and we don't see no way outof it, for her own
soul's sake, - let alone other peo-ple's souls, - than to bring her
before the Session.If we can't convert her to truth, leastways she V1
bedisciplined to silence."That subtile distinction which John Ward
hadmade between his love and his life was never moreapparent than now.
Though his elder's wordsbrought him the keenest consciousness of his
wife'sunbelief, he never for an instant thought of her asthe person
whose influence in the church was to befeared. His church and his wife
were too absolutelyseparate for such identification to be possible."
And," Mr. Dean added, his metallic voice in-voluntarily softening,
"our feelings, Mr. Ward,must n't interfere with it; they must n't make
usunkind to her soul by slightin' her best good.""No," John said,
still absently, and scarcely lis-tening to his elder, - " no, of
course not. But haveyou seen her, and talked with her, and tried
tolead her to the truth? That should be done withthe tenderest
patience before anything so extremeas Sessioning.""We ain't," the
elder answered significantly,"but I make no doubt she 's been reasoned
withand prayed with.""Why, I have not spoken 'to her," John
said,bewildered; "but you have not told me who it is,yet."<pb
n="232"/>232        JOHN WARD, PREACHER."Mr. Ward," said the other
solemnly, "if youain't spoke to her, you've neglected your duty; andif
you don't give her poor soul a chance of salvationby bringing her to
the Session, you are neglectin' yourduty still more. Your church, sir,
and the ever-lastin' happiness of her soul demand that this diseaseof
unbelief should be rooted out. Yes, BrotherWa'd, if the Jonah in a
church was our nearest anddearest - and it don't make no odds - the
shipshould be saved I "They both rose; a terrible look was dawning
inJohn Ward's face, and, seeing it, the elder's voicesunk to a hurried
whisper as he spoke the lastwords."Who is this women ? " the preacher
said hoarsely." Sir - sir " - the elder cried, backing towardsthe door
and raising his hands in front of him,"don't look so, - don't look so,
sir I "" Who?" demanded the other."I spoke fer the sake of Alfaretta's
soul, and ferthe sake of them that 's heard her say them thingsabout
Tom Davis, provin' there was n't any punish-ment for sinners. Don't
look so, preacher I""Tell me her name ""Her name - her name ? Oh, you
know it, sir,you know it - it's - your wife, preacher."John Ward
sprang at the cowering figure of thebig elder, and clinched his
trembling hands on theman's shoulders, with an inarticulate cry." My
wife I" he said, between his teeth. " Howdare you speak her name I" He
stopped, strugglingfor breath.<pb n="233"/>JtOaN WARD, PREACHER
2338"My duty I " gasped the elder, trying to loosenthe trembling
fingers-" to her- an'. you - an'the church you've starved and
neglected, BrotherWard I"John blenched. Mr. Dean saw his
advantage."You know your vows when you were ordained heresix years
ago: do you keep them? Do you feedyour people with spiritual food, or
will you neglectthem for your wife's sake, and let her example sendthe
souls in your care to endless ruin ? "John had loosened his hold on
the elder, and wasleaning against the wall, his head bowed upon
hisbreast and his hands knotted together. A passionof horrified grief
swept across his face; he seemedunconscious of the elder's presence.
Mr. Deanlooked at him, not certain what to do or say; hehad quite
forgotten Alfaretta's "notice." At lastthe preacher raised his head."
You have said enough," he said, in a low voice;now go," and he pointed
with a shaking finger tothe door. "Go I" he repeated.The elder
hesitated, then slowly put on his hatand stumbled from the room. John
did not noticehis outstretched hand, but followed him blindly tothe
door, and locked it after him.The full blaze of sunshine flooded the
room withits pitiless mirth; it was wilting the dish of violets,and he
moved it to the shaded end of the table.Alfaretta, peering out of her
attic window, andwiping her eyes on the corner of the dimity
curtain<pb n="234"/>234        JOHN WARD, PREACHERwhich hid her, saw
the elder walk out of the parson.age and through the little gateway,
with shame writ-ten on his drooping shoulders and in his
hurried,shambling steps. He never once looked back.<pb

thresholdHelen stood at the bolted door. She turned theknob gently
while she knocked."John," she said anxiously,-"John, dearl-"But there
was no answer." John! " she said again, a thread of fear in
hervoice. "What is the matter? Are you ill, dear-est? Please let me

listened. "John,John! " she called again, and as she heard a

with a fright she had not realized. Sheheard a slow footstep upon the
floor, that stoppedon the other side of the door."Helen," her husband
said, in a voice she scarcelyknew, " I want to be alone. I am not ill,
but I mustbe - undisturbed. Will you go away, please ? ""Let me in
just one moment, darling," shepleaded, still nervously turning the
knob. " I won'tdisturb you, but it terrifies me to be shut out in
thisway. Please let me just see you, and then I will goright
away.""No," he answered, "I cannot see you. I do notwant to see you,
Helen. I must be alone just now."<pb n="236"/>286       aJOHN WARD,
PREACHER.You are sure you are not ill ?" she insisted."Quite
sure.""Well," she said reluctantly, "I 'U go, but callme just as soon
as I can come, will you ? ""Yes," he answered, " but do not come until
I docall you."She heard him walk back to his study table, andthen
silence seemed to fall like a shadow on herheart. She was more
bewildered than before.John was in trouble, and she could not help
him.Nevertheless, she did not speak again; she was oneof those unusual
women who are content to wait un-til the moment it is needed, to give
their sympathyor tenderness. So she went to her own room, andsat
wistfully looking out at the sweet spring day;she could not read while
this anxiety filled her mind,and her hands were idle in her lap. She
did noteven summon John to luncheon, knowing he wouldcome if he saw
fit; for herself, she could not eat.It was almost five, when she heard
John push hischair back (she was sitting on the lowest step of
thestaircase, which ended at the study door, leaning herhead against
the frame), and again her ear caughtthe heavy, long-drawn sigh. Her
suspense was toend.She rose, her hands pressed hard together to
checktheir trembling; she bit her lip lest she might speakand disturb
him one moment before he was ready tohear her.He pushed back the bolt,
and slowly opened thedoor and looked at her. All the words of love
andanxiety died on her lips.<pb n="237"/>" John," she whispered, -
oh, my dlear, what isit?"He came out, and, putting his hands on her
shoul-ders, looked down at her with terrible, unsmilingeyes. "Helen,"
he said, "I am grieved to havedistressed you so, but it had to be. I
had to bealone. I am in much trouble. No," laying hishand gently on
her lips; " listen to me, dearest. Iam in great distress of soul; and
just now, just fora few days, I must bear it alone."Helen felt a
momentary sense of relief. Distressof soul ? - that meant some
spiritual anxiety, and ithad not the awfulness to her which a more
tangibletrouble, such as sickness, would have." What is it, John? Tell
me," she said, lookingat him with overflowing love, but without an
under-standing sympathy; it was more that feeling whichbelongs to
strong women, of maternal tenderness forthe men they love, quite apart
from an intellectualappreciation of their trouble.John shook his
head. ."I must bear it alone,Helen. Do not ask me what it is; I cannot
tell youyet.""You cannot tell me ? Oh, John, your sorrow be-longs to
me; don't shut me out; tell me, dear, andlet me help you.""You cannot
help me," he answered wearily;"only trust me when I say it is best for
me not totell you now; you shall know all there is to know,later. Be
patient just a few days, - until after theSabbath. Oh, bear with me, -
I am in great sor-row, Helen; help me with silence."t,<pb
n="238"/>288         JOHN WARD, PREACHERShe put ler arms around him,
and in her caress.ing voice, with that deep note in it, she said,
"Itshall be just as you say, darling. I won't ask youanother question,
but I'm ready to hear wheneveryou want to tell me."He looked at her
with haggard eyes, but did notanswer. Then she drew him out into the
fresh cool-ness of the garden, and tried to bring some bright-ness
into his face by talking of small household hap-penings, and how she
had missed him during his twoweeks' absence, and what plans she had
for the nextweek. But no smile touched his white lips, or ban-ished
the absent look in his eyes. After tea, duringwhich his silence had
not been broken, he turned togo into his study." Oh, you are not going
to work to-night? " Helencried. " Don't leave me alone again I "He
looked at her with sudden wistfulness. " I-I must," he said, his voice
so changed it gave her ashock of pain. " I must work on my sermon.""I
thought you had written it," she said; "andyou are so tired - do wait
until to-morrow."" I am not going to use the sermon I prepared,"he
answered. " I have decided to preach more di-rectly On foreign
missions. You know I exchangewith Mr. Grier, of Chester, on the
Sabbath; and hewill preach to our church on the attitude of Assem-bly
towards missions. I had intended to give amore general sermon to his
.people, but--I havedecided otherwise."Helen was surprised at so long
an explanation;John's sermons were generally ignored by both, but<pb
n="239"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.           289for different reasons. She
followed him into thestudy, and when she had lighted his lamp he
kissedher, saying softly, "May God bless you, Helen,"and then he shut
her gently from the room."Don't lock the door, John," she had
said. "Iwon't come in, but don't lock it." Her lip almosttrembled as
she spoke."No,- no," he said tenderly. "Oh, Helen, Ihave made you
suffer! "She was quick to protect him. "No, I was onlylonely; but you
won't lock it ? "He did not, but poor Helen wandered forlornlyabout
the darkened house, an indefinable 'dread chas-ing away the relief
which had come when her hus-band spoke of spiritual trouble; she was
glad, forthe mere humanness of it, to hear Thaddeus and Al-faretta
talking in the kitchen.The next day, and the next, dragged slowly
by.When John was not at his writing-table, he wasmaking those pastoral
calls which took so much timeand strength, and which Helen always felt
were un-necessary. Once, seeing her standing leaning herforehead
against the window and looking out sadlyinto the rainy garden, he came
up to her and tookher in his arms, holding her silently to his
heart.That cheered and lightened her, and somehow, whenSunday morning
dawned, full of the freshness of thepast rain and the present wind and
sunshine, shefelt the gloom of the last three days lifting a
little.True, there was the unknown sorrow in her heart,but love was
there, too. She was almost happy,without knowing it. <pb
n="240"/>240         JOHN WARD, PREACHER.They were to go on horseback,
for Chester waseight miles off, and the thought of a ride in
thissparkling mountain air brought a glow to her cheek,which had been
pale the last few days. Theystarted early. The sun seemed to tip the
greatgreen bowl of the valley, and make every leaf shineand glisten;
the road wound among the circlinghills, which were dark with sombre
pines, lightenedhere and there by the fresh greenness of ash or-
chestnuts; in some places the horse's hoofs made avelvety sound on the
fallen catkins. A brook fol-lowed their path, whispering and
chattering, or hid-ing away under overhanging bushes, and then
laugh-ing sharply out into the sunshine again. The windwas fresh and
fickle; sometimes twisting the weedsand flowers at the wayside, or
sending a dash oflast night's raindrops into their faces from the
lowbranches of the trees, and all the while making cloudshadows scud
over the fresh-ploughed fields, and upand across the blue, distant
hills.John rested his hand on her bridle, as she strokedher horse's
mane. "How the wind has blown yourhair from under your hat " he
said.She put her gauntleted hand up to smooth it."Don't," he said,
"it's so pretty; it looks likelittle tendrils that have caught the
sun."Helen laughed, and then looked at him anxiously;the sunshine
brought out the worn lines in his face."You work too hard, dearest; it
worries me."" I have never worhed at all! " he cried, with asudden
passion of pain in his voice. "Oh, mywasted life, Helen, - my life
that has wronged andI cheated you "<pb n="241"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
241"John " she said, almost frightened. Yet it wascharacteristic that
she should think this was only asymptom of overwork and bodily
weariness. Andwhen at last they reached the church in Chester, andJohn
lifted her from her saddle, the anxiety hadcome again, and all the joy
of the summer morninghad left her face. They fastened their horses to
oneof the big chestnuts which stood in a stately row infront of the
little white church, and then Helenwent inside, and found a seat by
one of the openwindows; she secretly pushed the long inside
shutter,with its drab slats turned down, half-way open, sothat she
might look out across the burying-ground,where the high blossoming
grass nodded and wavedover the sunken graves.John had followed her,
and folded a coat over the:back of the pew. He gave her a long,
yearninglook, but did not speak. Then he turned, andwalked slowly up
the aisle, with reverently benthead.At the first hymn the congregation
turned andfaced the choir. Helen, with the shadows of theleaves
playing across her hymn-book, leaned againstthe high back of the pew
behind her, and sang in astrong, sweet voice, rejoicing in the rolling
old tuneof "Greenland's icy mountains."  She could see thedistant line
of the hills, and now and then betweenthe branches of the trees would
come the flash andripple of the brown river; and through the opendoor,
which made a frame for the leaves and sky,she caught sight of the row
of horses pounding andswitching under the chestnuts, and those
backslid.<pb n="242"/>242        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.era outside,
who found it necessary to " see to thebeasts " rather than attend
their religious privileges.But there were not very many of these, for
Mr.Ward's fame as a preacher had spread through allthe villages near
Lockhaven.Helen, watching John while he read the chap.ter from the
Bible, thought anxiously how tiredand worn his face looked, and so
thinking, and look-ing out into the dancing leaves, the short
prayer,and the long prayer, and the hymn before thesermon passed, and
she scarcely heard them. Thencame the rustle of preparation for
listening. Themen shuffled about in their seats, and crossed
theirlegs; the women settled their bonnet-strings, andgave the little
children a peppermint drop, and thelarger children a hymn-book to
read. There werethe usual rustling and whispering in the choir, andthe
creaking footsteps of the one or two who en-tered shamefacedly, as
though they would explainthat the horses had detained them. Then the
churchwas very stillJohn Ward rose, and spread his manuscript outupon
the velvet cushion of the white pulpit."You will find my text," he
said, " in the sixthchapter of Romans, the twenty-first verse: 'Theend
of those things is death.'"It had been announced that his sermon was
to beupon foreign missions, and the people waited pa-tiently while the
preacher briefly told them whathad been accomplished by the
Presbyterian Churchduring the last year, and, describing its methods
ofwork, showed what it proposed to do in the future.<pb
n="243"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.             248"That 's just a-tunin'
up, - he '11 set the heathendancin' pretty soon; you see I " some one
whisperedbehind Helen; and then there was a giggle and"hush-sh," as
Mr. Ward began to say that foreignmissions were inevitable wherever
the sentiment ofpity found room in a human heart, because theguilt of
those in the darkness of unbelief, withoutGod, without hope, would
certainly doom them toeternal misery; and this was a thought so dark
andawful, men could not go their way, one to his farm,and another to
his merchandise, and leave them toperish.The simple and unquestioning
conviction withwhich the preacher began to prove to his congre-gation
that the heathen were guilty, because Adam,their federal head and
representative, had sinned,^^ gir-pM hid from them .the cruelty with
which he:.m 4it* Deity. No one thought of disputinghis statement hat
the wrath of God rested upon allunconverted souls, and that it would,
unless theyburst from their darkness into the glorious light
ofrevealed truth, sink them to hell.Some of the older Christians
nodded their headscomfortably at this, and looked keenly at the
sinnersof their own families, trusting that they would beawakened to
their danger by these trumpet burstsof doctrine. To such hearers, it
was unnecessarythat John Ward should insist upon the worthless-ness of
natural religion, begging them rememberthat for these heathen, as well
as for more favoredsouls, Christ's was the only name given under
heavenwhereby men might be saved, and appealing to God's<pb
n="244"/>244        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.people, as custodians of the
mercies of Christ, tostretch their hands out into the darkness to
theseblind, stumbling, doomed brothers. He bade thembe quick to answer
that cry of " Come and help us I "and to listen for that deeper voice
beneath the wailof despair, which said, " Inasmuch as ye have doneit
unto one of the least of these my brethren, yehave done it unto
me."The possibility of being saved without a knowledgeof Christ
remained, he said, after eighteen hundredyears, a possibility
illustrated by no example; andwe could only stand in the shadow of
this terriblefact, knowing that millions and millions of soulswere
living without the gospel, the only source oflife, and dying without
hope, and pray God for thespirit and the means to help them.Link by
link he lengthened the chain of logic tillit reached to the deepest
hell. He showed how blas-phemous was the cry that men must be saved,
if forlack of opportunity they knew not Christ; that Godwould not damn
the soul that had had no chance toaccept salvation. It had had the
chance of salvationin Adam, and had lost it, and was therefore
con.demned. To the preacher this punishment of thehelpless heathen
seemed only just." Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ?"he
cried, and he stopped to suppose, for the sake ofargument, that Adam
had not sinned: surely no*one would have disputed the justice of
receiving theblessings -which his godliness would have entailed.Then
he began to prove the right of the potter overthe clay. He had
forgotten his congregation; the<pb n="245"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
245horror of the damnation of the heathen was lost inthe fear that one
soul should perish. He saw onlyHelen; she was in danger, she was far
from God,but yet the price of admission to heaven could notbe altered,
though his heart' broke for longing thatshe should be saved; the
requirements of the gospelhad not softened, the decrees of Omnipotence
wereas unchangeable as the eternal past.His words, glowing with his
love and grief, wereonly for her. The thunders of God's justice
shookhis soul, while he offered her the infinite mercy ofChrist. But
he did not shrink from acknowledgingthat that mercy was only for those
who would acceptit, nor presume to dictate to God that all
sinnersshould be saved, forced into salvation, without accept--    ing
his conditions.- '    Oi; W. t right," he said, "have we to expect
that-ierey should exist at all? What madness, then, tothink He will
depart from the course He has laidout for himself, and save without
condition thosewho are justly condemned ? Yet justice is satisfied,for
Christ has died. 0 Soul, accept that sacrifice I "He had come to the
edge of the pulpit, one palehand clinched upon the heavy cover of the
Bible,and the other stretched tremblingly out; his anxious,grieving
eyes looked over the solemn, upturned facesof his listeners, and
sought Helen, sitting in thedusky shadow by the open window, her face
a littleaverted, and her firm, sweet lips set in a line whichwas
almost stern.Some of the women were crying: an exaltationpurely
hysterical made them feel themselves lost sin.<pb n="246"/>246
JOHN WARD, PREACHER.ners; they thrilled at John's voice, as though
hiswords touched some strained chord in their placidand virtuous
lives."Come," he said, "stand with me to-day underthe pierced hands
and bleeding side of InfiniteMercy; look up into that face of divine
compassionand ineffable tenderness, and know that this blood-stained
cross proclaims to all the centuries deathsuffered for the sin of the
world, - for your sin andmine. Can you turn and go away to outer
darkness,to wander through, the shadows of eternity, awayfrom God,
away from hope, away from love? Oh,come, while still those arms are
open to you; come,before the day of grace has darkened into
night;come, before relentless Justice bars the way with aflaming
sword. O Soul, Christ waits I"He stood a moment, leaning forward, his
handsclasped upon the big Bible, and his face full oftrembling and
passionate pleading. Then he said,with a long, indrawn breath, "Let us
pray I "The people rose, and stood with bowed headsthrough the short,
eager, earnest prayer. Then thepreacher gave out the hymn, and there
was the rus-tle of turning to face the choir. The quaint, dolefultune
of Windham wailed and sobbed through thewords, -"The burden of our
weighty guiltWould sink us down to flames;And threatening vengeance
rolls above,To crush our feeble frames "The choir sang with cheerful
heartiness; it was arelief from the tension of the sermon, a reaction
to<pb n="247"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER               247life, and hope,
and healthy humanness after theseshadows of death. It all seemed part
of a dream toHelen: the two happy-faced girls standing in thechoir,
with bunches of apple-blossoms in the belts oftheir fresh calico
dresses, and the three young farm-ers who held the green singing-books
open, all sing-ing heartily together, -"'T is boundless, 't is amazing
love,That bears us up from hell I "Helen watched them with fascinated
curiosity;she wondered if they could believe what they hadjust
heard. Surely not; or how could they know amoment's happiness, or even
live!After the benediction had been pronounced shewalked absently down
the aisle, and went at once toher horse under the flickering shadows
of the chest-nuts. Here she waited for John, one hand twistedinf the
gray's mane, and with the other switching atthe tall grass with her
riding-whip. Only a few ofthe people knew her, but these came to speak
of thesermon. One woman peered at her curiously fromunder her big
shaker bonnet. The stories of Mr.Ward's wife's unbelief had traveled
out from Lock-haven. "Wonderful how some folks could standagainst such
doctrine!" she said; "and yet theymust know it's a sin not to believe
in everlastingpunishment. I believe it's a mortal sin, don't
you,Mrs. Ward?""No," Helen said quietly.<pb n="248"/>CHAPTER
XVIII.THEY rode quite silently to the house of the min-ister with whom
John had exchanged, where theywere to dine; after that, the preacher
was to goback to the church for the afternoon sermon.Mrs. Grier, a
spare, anxious-looking woman, witha tight friz of hair about her
temples which werethin and shining, met them at the door. She
hadhurried home to " see to things," and be ready towelcome her
guests. John she ushered at once intoher husband's study, a poor
little room, with evenfewer books than Mr. Ward's own, while Helen
shetook to the spare chamber, where she had thought-fully provided a
cambric dress for her, for the dayhad grown very warm, and the
riding-habit washeavy.She sat down in a splint rocking - chair,
andwatched her guest brush out her length of shiningbronze hair, and
twist it in a firm coil low on herneck."It was a good gathering," she
said; "peoplecame from a distance to hear Mr. Ward. The folksat
Lockhaven are favored to listen to such preach-ing.""No doubt they
feel favored to have Mr. Grierwith them to-day," Helen answered,
courteously;but there was an absent look in her eyes, and shedid not
listen closely.<pb n="249"/>JASON WARD, PREACHER.
249"Well, people like a change once in a while,"Mrs. Grier admitted,
rocking hard. "Mr. Grier'sdiscourse was to be on the same subject as
your hus-band's, foreign missions  It is one that moves thepreachers,
and the people seem to like it, I notice,though I don't know that it
makes much differencein the collections. But I think they like to get
allharrowed up. You '11 find there won't be such anattendancein the
afternoon. It is ways and means,then, you know. Yes, seems as if
sermons on hellmade them shiver, and they enjoyed it. I 've some-times
thought - I don't know as I'm right - theyget the same kind of
pleasure out of it that worldlypeople do out of a play. Not that I
know muchabout such things, I'm sure."Helen smiled, which rather
shocked Mrs.* Grier;but though the guest scarcely listened, .the
littlesharp babble of talk ws kept up, until they wentdown to
dinner.There had been no chanee for the husband andwife to speak to
each other. John looked at Helensteadily a moment, but her eyes veiled
any thought.In the midst of Mrs. Grier's chatter, she had goneinto the
solitude of her own heart, and slowly andsilently light was beginning
to shine into the mys-terious darkness of the last few days. John's
griefmust have had something to do with this terriblesermon. She felt
her heart leap up from the pastanxiety like a bird from a net, and the
broodingsadness began to fade from her face. The preacherhad come down
from the pulpit with a certain ex-hilaration, as of duty done. He was
inspired to<pb n="250"/>250         JOHN WARD, PREACHERhope, and
even certainty, by the greatness of thetheme. Helen should see the
truth, his silence shouldno longer mislead her, she should believe in
the jus-tice of God. He had forgotten his sin of cowardicein the
onward-sweeping wave of his convictions;he seemed to yield himself up
to the grasp of truth,and lost even personal remorse in the
contemplationof its majesty.Mrs. Grier had four noisy children, who
all spokeat once, and needed their mother's constant care
andattention, so John and Helen could at least be si-lent; yet it was
hard to sit through the dinner whentheir hearts were impatient for
each other.In a little breathing space at the end of the meal,when two
of the children had clambered down fromtheir high chairs and been
dismissed, Mrs. Grierbegan to speak of the sermon."It was a wonderful
discourse, sir," she said;"seems as if nobody could stand against such
doc-trine as you gave us. I could have wished, though,you'd have told
us your thoughts about infants be-ing lost. There is a difference of
opinion betweenMr. Grier and two of our elders.""What does Brother
Grier hold?" asked thepreacher."Well," Mrs. Grier answered, shaking
her head,"he does say they are all saved. But the elders,they say that
the confession of faith teaches thatelect infants are saved, and of
course it follows thatthose not elect are lost. My father, Mr. Ward,
wasa real old-fashioned Christian, and I must say thatwas what I was
taught to believe, and I hold by it.<pb n="251"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHEiP   .        251There now, Ellen, you take your little sister
and.go out into the garden, like a good girl."She lifted the baby down
from her chair, and puther hand into that of her elder
sister."Mrs. Grier," Helen said, speaking quickly,"you say you believe
it, but if you had ever lost achild, I am sure you could not."" I
have, ma'am," -Mrs. Grier's thin lip quivered,sad her eyes reddened a
little, - "but that can'tmake any difference in truth; besides, we
have theblessed hope that she was an elect infant."It would have been
cruel to press the reason forthis hope, and Helen listened instead
with a breathof relief to what John was saying, -he, at least,did not
hold this horrible doctrine." No, I agree with your husband," he
said. " True,aU children are born in sin, and are despised addabhorred
as sinners. by God. Jonathan Edwards,you know, calls them  vipers,'
which of course wasa crude and cruel way of stating the truth, that
theyare sinners. Yet, through the infinite mercy, theyare saved
because Christ died, not of themselves;in other words, all infants who
die, are elect."Mrs. Grier shook her head. "I 'm for holdingto the
catechism," she said; and then, with a sharp,thin laugh, she added,
"But you're sound on theheathen, I must say."Helen shivered, and it
did not escape her hostess,who turned and looked at her with
interested curios-ity. She, too, had heard the Lockhaven rumors." But
then," she proceeded, "I don't see how apeon oa& help being sound on
that, though it is<pb n="252"/>252        -JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.surprising what people will doubt, even the thingsthat are
plainest to other people. I've many a timeheard my father say that the
proper holding of thedoctrine of reprobation was necessary to eternal
life.I suppose you believe that, Mr. Ward," she added,with a little
toss of her head, "even if you-don't goall the way with the
confession, about infants ?""Yes," John said sadly, "I must; because
notto believe in reprobation is to say that the sacrificeof the cross
was a useless offering.""And of course," Mrs. Grier went on, an edgeof
sarcasm cutting into her voice, "Mrs. Wardthinks so, too ? Of course
she thinks that a beliefin hell is necessary to get to heaven ? "The
preacher looked at his wife with a growinganxiety in his face.'"No,"
Helen said, "I do not think so, Mrs.Grier."Mrs. Grier flung up her
little thin hands, whichlooked like bird-claws. "You don't/" she
criedshrilly. "Well, now, I do say I And what do youthink about the
heathen, then? Do you thinkthey '11 be damned ?""No," Helen said
again.Mrs. Grier gave a gurgle of astonishment, andlooked at Mr. Ward,
but he did not speak."Well," she exclaimed, "if I didn't think
theheathen would be lost, I would n't see the use of theplan of
salvation I Why, they've got to be I ""If they had to be," cried
Helen, with suddenpassion, " I should want to be a heathen. I shouldbe
ashamed to be saved, if there were so many lost."<pb n="253"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER            258She stopped; the anguish in John's face
silencedher."Well," Mrs. Grier said again, really enjoyingthe scene, "
I'm surprised; I would n't a' believedit "She folded her hands across
her waist, and lookedat Mrs. Ward with keen interest. Helen's
faceished under the contemptuous curiosity in thewonan's eyes; she
turned appealingly to John.- "Mrs. Ward does not think quite as we do,
yet,"he said gently; "you know she has not been a Pres-byterian as
long as we have."He rose as he spoke, and came and stood byHelen's
chair, and then walked at her side into theparlor.Mrs. Grier had
followed them, and heard Helensay in a low voice, "I would rather not
go to churchthis afternoon, dearest. - May I wait for you here
?"Well," she broke in, " I should n't suppose youwould care to go, so
long as it's just about the waysand means of sending the gospel to the
heathen, andyou think they're all going right to heaven, anyway.""I do
not know where they are going, Mrs.Grier," Helen said wearily; "for
all I know, there isno heaven, either. I only know that God--if
thereis a God who has any personal care for us -couldnot be so wicked
and cruel as to punish people forwhat they could not help.""Good land
I " cried Mrs. Grier, really frightenedat such words, and looking
about as though she ex-pected a judgment as immediate as the bears
whichdevoured the scoffing children.<pb n="254"/>.254         JOHN
WARD, PREACHER."If you would rather not go," John answered,"if you are
tired, wait for me here. I am sure Mrs.Grier will let you lie down and
rest until it is timeto start for home ?"" Oh, of course," responded
Mrs. Grier, foreseeinga chance for further investigation, for she,
too, wasto be at home.But Helen did not invite her to come into
thespare room, when she went to lie down, after John'sdeparture for
church. She wanted to be alone.he had much to think of, much to
reconcile and ex-plain, to protect herself from the unhappiness
whichJohn's sermon might have caused her. She had hadan unmistakable
shock of pain and distress as sherealized her husband's belief, and to
feel even thatseemed unloving and disloyal. To Helen's mind, ifshe
disapproved of her husband's opinions on whatto her was an unimportant
subject, her first dutywas to banish the thought, and forget that she
hadever had it. She sat now by the open window,looking out over the
bright garden to the distantpeaceful hills, and by degrees the pain of
it beganto fade from her mind, in thoughts of John himself,his
goodness, and their love. Yes, they loved oneanother,- that was
enough."What does it matter what his belief is ?" shesaid. "I love
him!"So, by and by, the content of mere existence un-folded in her
heart, aud John's belief was no moreto her than a dress of the mind;
his character wasunchanged. There was a momentary pang that
thecharacters of others might be hurt by this teaching<pb
n="255"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER            25,of the expediency of
virtue, but she forced thethought back. John, whose whole life was a
lessonin the beauty of holiness -John could not injureany one. The
possibility that he might be right ilhis creed simply never presented
itself to her.Helen's face had relaxed into a happy smile;again the
day was fair and the wind sweet. Thegarden below her was fragrant with
growing thingsad- th  smell of damp earth; and while she sat,drinking
in its sweetness, a sudden burst of chil-dren's voices reached her
ear, and Ellen and the twolittle boys came around the corner of the
house, andsettled down under the window. A group of lilacs,with
feathery purple blossoms, made a deep, coolshade, where the children
sat; and near them wasan old grindstone, streaked with rust, and worn
bymany summers of sharpening scythes; a tin dipperluag o- thBwooden
frame, nearly full of last night'srain, and with some lilac stars
floating in the water.- This was evidently a favorite playground with
thechildren, for under the frame of the grindstone weresome corn-cob
houses, and a little row of broken bitsof china, which their simple
imagination transformedinto " dishes." But to-day the corn-cob houses
andthe dishes were untouched." Now, children," Ellen said, " you sit
right down,and I '11 hear your catechism.""Who 'll hear yours ?" Bobby
asked discontent-edly. " When we play school, you're always

answered, skill-fully evading the first question. "Don't you know<pb

and with some stumblingBobby succeeded in saying, -"It is that sin in
which I was conceived andborn.""Now, Jim," said Ellen, "you can answer

the question: " Dothoriginal sin wholly defile you, and is it

yawned, and then said contemptuously,"Oh, skip that,- cast into hell,
of course."" You ought to answer right," Ellen said reprov-ingly, but
she was glad 'to give the last question,"What will the wicked do
forever in hell?"'  "They will roar, curse, and blaspheme God,"
saidlittle Jim cheerfully; while Bobby, to show his joythat the lesson
was done, leaned over on his flower-pot, and tried to stand on his
head, making all thetime an unearthly noise." I'm roarin' I " he cried

to begin to practice now," she said.Then, while her brothers watched
her, deeply in-terested, she took off her shoes, and in her
well-darned little red stockings climbed deliberatelyupon the
grindstone."This is my horse," she said, balancing herself,.with
outstretched arms, on the stone, and making itrevolve in a queer,

and rosy face; butMrs. Grier, who had come to the door at the noiseof
the cheers, did not stop to notice it." Oh, you naughty children I "
she cried. "Don'tyou know it is wicked to play on the Sabbath?Ellen's

Mrs. Grier wasfirm; and when, a little later, Helen came down.<pb
n="259"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.           269stairs, ready for her ride,
the house was strangelyquiet. Mrs. Grier, really troubled at her
children'ssinfulness, confided their misdeeds to Helen, and wasnot
soothed by the smile that flashed across her face."They were such
good. children to study theircatechism first," she interceded, "and
making ahorse out of a grindstone shows an imagination which might
excuse the playing."But Mrs. Grier was not comforted, and only feltthe
more convinced of the lost condition of Mrs.Ward's soul. The
conviction of other people's sinis sometimes a very pleasing emotion,
so she badeher guest good-by with much cordiality and evenpulled the
skirt of her habit straight, and gave thegray a lump of sugar.Helen
told John of the scene under the lilacs, asthey trotted down the lane
to the highway, but hismood was too grave to see any humor in
it. Indeed,his frame of mind had changed after he left his wifefor his
second sermon. The exhilaration and tri-umph had gone, and the
reaction had come. Hebrooded over his sin, and the harassed,
distressedlook of the last few days settled down again on hisface. But
Helen had regained her sweet serenityand content; she felt so certain
that the darknesssince Thursday had been the shadow in which hissermon
had been conceived that her relief broughta joy which obscured any
thought of regret that heshould hold such views.John's head was bent,
and his hands were claspedupon his saddle-bow, while the reins fell
looselyfrom between his listless fingers.<pb n="260"/>260
JOHN WARD, PREACHER"You are so tired, John," Helen said
regret.fully.He sighed, as though rousing himself from thought."A
little, dearest," and then his sorrowful eyessmiled. "You look so
fresh and rested, Helen. Itwas wise for you to lie down this
afternoon.""Oh, but I didn't," she said quickly. "I wasbusy
thinking."He looked at her eagerly. "Yes," she continued,"I think I
know what has distressed you so theselast few days, dear. It is this
thought of the suf-fering of mankind   If you have felt that all
theheathen who have died are in hell, I don't wonderat your sorrow. It
would be dreadful, and I wishyou did not think it. But we will not
talk about it,- of course you would rather not talk about it, evento
me, but I understand."She bent forward, and smiled brightly, as
shelooked at him. But his face was full of grief."It was not that,
Helen," he said; "it was some-thing nearer than that. It was remorse,
because oflate, for nearly a year, I have neglected my people.I have
not admonished them and warned them as Iought. And nearer still,
because I have neglectedyou.""MeI" she cried, too much astonished to
saymore."Yes," he answered, his head bent again uponhis breast, "you,

dearerthan my happiness. I have known that you havebeen far from

n="261"/>_ JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            261Helen looked at him, and
the sudden awfulthought flashed into her mind that he did not knowwhat
he was saying, and then she said with a gasp:"Oh, John, is that all?
Have you been so un-happy just because of that? Oh, you poor fellow
"She brought her horse close beside his, and laidher hand on his
arm. " Dear, what does it matterwhat I believe or do not believe? We
love eachother. And where is your tolerance, John?" She  /laughed, but
the look of terrible concern in his facefrightened her."Ah, Helen," he
said, "such tolerance as youwould have me show would be
indifference.""Oh, John! " she said, and then began resolutelyto speak
of other things.But soon they fell into silence, Helen longing toget
home and brush this useless and foolish anxietyfrom her husband's
heart, and he agonizing for hissin towards her and towards his
people.The late afternoon sunshine gilded the tendergreen of the
fields, and slanting deep into the dark-ness of the woods, touched the
rough trunks of thetrees with gold. Long shadows stretched across
theroad, and the fragrance which steals out with theevening dews began
to come from unseen blossoms,and early clover; and a breath of the
uncertainnight wind brought hints of apple orchards or thepungent
sweetness of cherry-blossoms. They hadgone more than half-way home
when they drew reinto water their horses, under a whispering pine
bythe roadside. The trough, overflowing with spar-kling water, was
green with moss and lichen, and was<pb n="262"/>262        JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.so old and soft that a bunch of ferns had found a
homeon its side. The horses thrust their noses down intoit, blowing
and sputtering with sheer delight in thecoolness. John made a cup of a
big beech leaf, andfilled it for his wife. As he handed it to her,
theyheard steps, and in a moment more Mr. Grier camearound the curve
of the road. His horse, too, wasthirsty, and he let the reins fall on
its neck while hegreeted them both with formal and ministerial
dig-nity, saying he "wished they might have tarrieduntil he came home,
and perhaps he could have per-suaded them to stay the night."The
horses pounded and splashed in the poolsabout their feet, and were
impatient to be off, butMr. Grier delayed. He spoke of church
matters,and General Assembly, and their respective con-gregations; and
then, with a little hesitation, hesaid: -" I had almost hoped,
Mrs. Ward, that you wouldhave been in Brother Ward's church to-day,
eventhough Mrs. Grier had much pleasure in seeing youunder our roof. I
had you in my mind in the pre-paration of my sermon."Mr. Grier was a
tall, thin man, with wateryblue eyes, and a sparse sandy beard growing
like afringe under his chin from ear to ear. He movedhis jaws
nervously as he waited for her answer, andplucked at his beard with
long, lean fingers.Helen smiled. "Did you think I should be alarge
contributor to foreign missions, Mr. Grier? ""' No, ma'am," he
answered solemnly, " I was notthinking of any benefit to the
heathen. I had some.<pb n="263"/>JORN WARD, PREACHER
268what to say whieh I felt might be for the good ofyour own
soul."Helen flushed, and flung her head back with ahaughty
look. "Ah,-you are very good, I'm sure,"she said, "but"-Mr. Grier
interrupted her, wagging his head upand down upon his breast: "Brother
Ward willforgive me for saying so, ma'am, but I had your wel-fare at
heart. Brother Ward, you have my prayersfor your dear wife.""I - I
thank you," John said, " but you must notfeel that my wife is far from
the Lord. Have youbeen told that the truth is not clear to her
eyes?Yet it will be ""I hope so,- I hope so," responded Mr. Grier,but
with very little hope in his voice; and then,shaking the reins, he
jogged on down the shadowyroad." What does he mean ?" cried Helen, her
voicetrembling with anger, and careless whether the re-treating
minister overheard her. John gave her along, tender look." Dearest,"
he said, " I am sorry he should havespoken as he did, but the prayers
of a good man "-" I don't want his prayers," she interrupted,
be-wildered; " it seems to me simply impertinence! ""Helen," he said,
"it cannot be impertinence topray for a soul in danger, as yours is,
my darling.I cannot tell how he knew it, but it is so. It ismy sin
which has kept you blind and hidden thetruth from you, and how can I
be angry if anotherman joins his prayers to mine for your eternal
sal-vation ?"<pb n="264"/>264        JOHN WARD, PREACHER"You say
this because I do not believe in eternalpunishment, John ?" she
asked." Yes," he answered gently, " first because of that,and then
because of all the errors of belief to whichthat leads."" It all seems
so unimportant," she said, sighing;" certainly nothing which could
make me claim theprayers of a stranger. Ah, well, no doubt he meansit
kindly, but don't let us speak of it any more,dearest."Their horses
were so dose, that, glancing shylyabout for a moment into the
twilight, Helen laidher head against his arm, and looked tenderly
intohis face.He started, and then put a quick arm about her tokeep her
from falling. "No," he said, "no, I willnot forget." It was as though
he answered somevoice in his soul, and Helen looked at him in
trou-bled wonder.The rest of the ride was very silent. Once, whenhe
stopped to tighten her saddle-girth for her,she bent his head back,
and smiled down into hiseyes. He only answered her by a look, but it
wasenough.<pb n="265"/>CHAPTER XIX.GxToRD WOODHOUSE was not quite
honest withhimself when he said that he felt it was time togo back to
Ashurst to make his aunts a visit. Hehad been restless and
absent-minded very often sincethat flying trip in the early spring. In
spite of hissternest reasoning, hope was beginning to grow upin his
heart again. Dick Forsythe had not come toAshurst, and Helen said
plainly that she knew Loiswas not engaged to him. So why should not
Giffordhimself be on the spot ?"Not that I would bother Lois," he
argued in hisown mind, "but just to know if"--  And besides,he really
ought to see the two little ladies.He left Lockhaven a few days after
John Wardhad preached his sermon on foreign missions atChester. It was
reported to have been " powerful,"and Elder Dean said he wished " our
own peoplecould have been benefited by it."" I thought the heathen
were expected to be ben-efited by such sermons," Gifford said,
twisting acigarette between his fingers, as he leaned over
thehalf-door of the elder's shop, lazily watching a longwhite shaving
curl up under his plane. " I thoughtthe object was a large
contribution."The elder looked up solemnly, and opened hislips with
vast deliberation. " Lawyer Woodhouse,"<pb n="266"/>goa        JorN
WARD, PREACHERhe said, "that's your mistake.  They 're fer thepurpose
of instructing us that the heathen is damned,so that we will rejoice
in our own salvation, and makehaste to accept it if we are
unconverted."He looked hard at the young man as he spoke, forevery one
knew Lawyer Woodhouse did not go reg.ularly to church, and so,
presumably, was not aChristian.Then Mr. Dean, while he pulled the
shavings outof his plane, and threw them on the fragrant heap athis
feet, said one or two things which made Giffordstop lounging and
forget his cigarette while he lis-tened with a grave face. "Unbelief
in the church,""the example for our youth," "the heresy of
thepreacher's wife."This was not the first time Gifford had heard
suchcomments, but there was a threat in Mr. Dean's voice,though he did
not put it into words, which made theyoung man carry a growing anxiety
about Helenaway with him. He could not forget it, even inthe
rejoicings of his home-coming, and he gaveguarded answers about her
which were unlike hisusual frankness.Lois noticed it, and wondered a
little, but wasperhaps more annoyed than troubled by it.The shyness of
her welcome Gifford quite misun.derstood."After all," he thought,
"what was the use ofcoming? Whatever Forsythe's chances are, thereis
one thing sure, -she does not care for me. Sheused to have that old

that Providence showedvery poor judgment sometimes. Look at HenryDale.

mentioned her suspicion of the "nicegirl in Lockhaven" to Lois, while
Miss Deborahadded that it was really no pleasure to cook for dearGiff;
he was so out of spirits he did n't seem to carefor anything; he did
not even eat the whigs, andLois knew how fond he was of whigs. Very
likelydear Ruth was right.This made Lois's interest in Gifford still
deeper,though she said, tossing her head with airy impa-tience, that
she did not believe there were any nicegirls in Lockhaven; there were
only working peoplethere. Then she thought of that talk with Giffordat
the stone bench, and recalled the promise she hadmade, and how she had
sealed it. Her cheeksburned till they hurt her."He has forgotten it
all, long ago," she said toherself; "men never remember such
things. Well,he sha'n't think I remember I "But how often Gifford
remembered!One afternoon he walked over to the stone bench,and sat
down on the very same sunken step fromwhich he had looked up into
Lois's face that Juneevening. He saw a bunch of violets growing

wondering howlong it would take Sally to brush the mud off

the grass, and his fishing-basket onthe stone bench beside
him. Gifford's sense ofhumor padded a good many of the sharp points
oflife; he had to look less doleful when he saw thatthe lawyer had
chosen Lois's seat, and even her at-titude; his little shriveled hands
were clasped uponhis knees, and he was bending forward, looking atthe
young man as he talked. Gifford thought of asonnet in his left

by saying he believed it was not usual toask advice in such matters, -
a man usually knew.But perhaps he was mistaken." Yes - I am inclined
to think you are," respond-ed Mr. Denner, with a jauntiness which sat
strangelyupon his wrinkled face,- " I think you are. Beingstill a very
young person, Gifford, you scarcely un-derstand the importance of such
matters, and the-ah-wisdom of seeking advice.    I believe it isalways
said that youth does not realize the impor-tance of advice. But the
fact is, my friend has placedhis affections upon two ladies. They are
connections,and both he represents to be estimable persons; both,<pb

admirable. Equally, youobserve, Gifford. And he is unable to make up
hismind which is the most -J should say the more -desirable. I,
unfortunately, was unable to throw anylight upon the subject.""Do you
know the young ladies? " asked Gifford."I- I may say I have met them,"
admitted Mr.Denner." And how did you advise him?" Gifford asked,his
face preternaturally grave.Mr. Denner looked anxious. "That is just
it.I have been unable to come to any conclusion. Iwondered if - if I
spoke of their characteristics ina general way (they are both so truly
estimable)you might have an opinion. He did think he couldreach a
decision, he tells me, for a friend of histhought he knew a proverb
which would throw alight upon it."" Settle it by a proverb " cried
Gifford."Yes," answered Mr. Denner firmly, "yes; andan excellent way
it would be, if one could find theproverb."The air of offended dignity
in Mr. Denner's facesobered Gifford at once." I beg your pardon, sir,"
he said; "the methodwas new to me, though it is, no doubt,
excellent.May I ask the proverb ?"But the lawyer was hurt. "It is not
worth whileto mention it. It was not-not suitable. It (lidnot enable
my friend to reach a decision, after all;it was merely something in
regard to whist."Gifford hid his face in the grass for a moment,<pb

beg your pardon,Mr. Denner; it struck me as an unusual way ofsettling
a love affair. Your friend 'must have beenmuch disappointed ? ""' He
was, he was, sir," answered Mr. Denner, notknowing whether to be angry
or injured, and pick-ing up his reel and rod with trembling hands."
Well, now," Gifford said, sitting up and leaninghis arms upon his
knees, the laughter still glimmer-ing in his gray eyes, " I could give
you a proverb,,-unless they are twins ?"Mr. Denner sat down again on
the stone bench,and looked at him eagerly."No, Gifford, they are not
twins, -no. There isa good ten years between them.""Then," said the
young man, "what does yourfriend want better than ' Age before

upon the grass,and, rising, extended his hand to his

remarkable young man, sir. I knew itwhen I determined to ask your
advice - for myfriend. I thank you. My- my friend thanks
you,Gifford. He will act upon this at once; he is for-ever indebted to
you, sir."It was all so solemn that Gifford's gravity lasteduntil the
little gentleman had disappeared throughthe hedge, and was far down
the road; then he hidhis face in the grass, and laughed aloud.But
Mr. Denner was happy. He fairly beamedas he walked along, repeating

strange that it has not occurred tome before, or that Henry should not
have thought ofit! 'Age before beauty!' Yes,just so,-just so "While he
was meditating thus happily, he heardbehind him that curious,

side of the road, his littleheart pounding with sudden fright, and
looked backto see the rectory phaeton, reeling and almost
over-turning, dragged madly at the heels of the shaggylittle
pony. They came flying toward him. Mr.Denner caught a glimpse, through
the cloud of dust,of Lois Howe's white face, and a shrinking
figureclinging to her. A gray veil fluttered across theface, so that
Mr. tenner could not tell who it was,but instantly it flashed through
his mind, "It is oneof themI"  He threw down his basket and rod,and
braced himself for the shock of the encounterwith the plunging horse;
his little nerves, never veryfirm, were strung like steel. Somehow, in
that in-stant of waiting, the proverb was forgotten; he feltthat fate
would decide for him. "It shall be thisone! " he said aloud, - " this
one I" Then the horseseemed upon him; he did not know when he madethat
jump at the bridle, or felt the iron hoof strikehis breast; he had
only a confused sense of seeingthe gray figure thrown out upon the
ground just ashe found himself falling backwards. Then he
lostconsciousness.When he came to himself, and saw the trees and<pb

him for a moment, hefound that he had been lifted over to the grass
atthe roadside, and that Gifford Woodhouse's arm wasunder his head. As
his eyes grew steady, he sawthat two men were holding the trembling,
steaminghorse, and that a little group of people were stand-ing about
the phaeton; but the gray figure had dis-appeared. Gifford was fanning
him, and pressingsomething to his lips with a gentle, anxious
hand."Gifford," he said faintly -" ah - which ?""They are neither of
them hurt, thank God," an-swered the young man reverently, "but they
owetheir lives to you, Mr. Denner.""( Yes - but "- he struggled to
say-" which-which was it ? "" He means who was it," said the rector,
who hadtaken his place on the other side of the injured man."It was my
daughter - God bless you, Denner !-and Mrs. Forsythe."Mr. Denner
groaned, and shut his eyes. " Oh, itwas n't, either," he murmured;
"that's always theway ""His mind is wandering," Gifford said, in a
lowvoice. "I'm afraid this is very serious, doctor.Do you think he can
be moved now?"The lawyer did not try to prove his sanity; he
onlygroaned again, but this time it was partly from pain.They lifted
him gently, and carried him into his ownhouse, which he had nearly
reached when the runa-way overtook him.Both the women in the carriage
had been thrownout, but Lois was able to walk, and so far as
could<pb n="277"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            277be ascertained
Mrs. Forsythe was unhurt, save forthe shock, which sent her from one
fainting fit intoanother until late that night. They had carriedher
back to the rectory, Lois clinging to one limphand, and crying
hysterically."Oh, she will die," she sobbed, "I know she willdie; and
it is my fault, it is my carelessness I Youneedn't say it isn't,
father. I know it is! Oh,what shall I do I"But there was nothing to
do; and Mrs. Dale, whohad been hastily summoned, - for her reputation
fornursing was even wider than Miss Deborah's forhousekeeping, -only
put her to bed, "to get herout of the way," she said, but really
because she wasfilled with sympathy for her niece's remorse, and
feltthat the forgetfulness of sleep was the only comfortfor her.I '11
tell you what it is, brother," she said, - shehad quietly settled
herself in authority at the rec-tory, despite Jean's air of
contemptuous dignity -"I believe Arabella Forsythe will have a
chanceto die, at last. She 's been looking for it these tenyears, and
as soon as she stops fainting it will bea positive satisfaction to
her. I'm afraid she isreally a very sick woman."But no such thought
did she impart to Lois, whenshe tucked her up in bed, giving her a
hearty kisswith her soothing draught, and bidding her havesome sense
and stop crying, for Mrs. Forsythe wouldbe all right in the
morning. But the morningbrought no comfort; the doctor, who had come
fromMercer as quickly as Mrs. Dale's horses could bringhim, was very
grave.<pb n="278"/>278        JOHN WARD, PREACHER"The shock to the
nervous system," he said, -"s we cannot tell what it will do."Lois was
so prostrated by grief at Mrs. Forsythe'scondition, no one dared tell
her that Mr. Dennerwas the immediate anxiety. There was an injury
tothe spine, and the plunging hoofs had done moreharm than was at
first supposed; things looked veryserious for the little gentleman.The
lawyer had fainted when he was lifted overhis gloomy threshold, where
Mary stood waiting andwringing her hands, and had struggled back to
con-sciousness to find himself on the big, slippery horse.hair sofa,
in his dusky library. Dr. Howe was stand-ing at his side, looking
anxiously down at him, anda neighbor was trying to slip a pillow under
his head.Gifford had gone to help Mary bring a bed down-stairs, for
the slightest movement caused Mr. Den.ner pain, and they dared not
lift him, even to takehim up to his bedroom."What is the matter ? "
Mr. Denner tried to say."I seem to be giving trouble. Ah -pray do
notmind me, doctor.""You were hurt, you know, Denner," said therector,
whose feet were planted wide apart, and his- hands thrust down in his
pockets, and who felt op-pressed by the consciousness of his own
superabun-dant vitality, for the lawyer looked so small andthin, and
his voice was hardly more than a whisper."You've been a little
faint. You'll be all rightsoon. But Giff 's going to put a bed up in
here for you, because you might find it uncomfortable to tryto get
up-stairs, you know."<pb n="279"/>JOHNV WARD, PREACHER.
279Mr. Denner looked anxious at this; he wonderedif Mary would not be
offended; but he was toostrangely weary to talk, and his little
twinkling eyeswere dim and blurred.Gifford and Mary had carried down
the four bigposts of Mr. Denner's bed, which looked like mahog-any
obelisks, and began to put it together, withmany interruptions for
Mary to wipe her eyes on thecorner of her gingham apron, and remark it
wouldsoon be over, and she did not know where she wouldever get such
another place. Once the rector turnedand sharply bade her hold her
tongue. Mr. Denneropened his eyes at that, though he had
scarcelyseemed to hear her. Nor did he know why Giffordand the rector
talked so long with the doctor on thebroad flat stone at the front
door, in the fragrantspring twilight. Afterwards he beckoned Giffordto
him.He did not quite like, he said, to leave his rod outover night; he
could go and get it in the morning,he knew, but if it would n't be too
much trouble, hewould be obliged if Gifford would bring it
in. Andthere were two trout in the basket: perhaps hewould be good
enough to present them, with hiscompliments, to the Misses
Woodhouse. Giffordwent for the rod, but could not go back without
aninquiry at the rectory."Arabella Forsythe," said Mrs. Dale,-"
well,as I told brother, I think this is her opportunity.She really is
in a bad way, Giff. Lois was n't hurtat all, wonderful to say; but,
naturally, she's ingreat distress, because she blames herself for
thewhole thing."<pb n="280"/>280        JOHN WARD, PREACHER."How so
? " asked Gifford." Well, of course," Mrs. Dale answered, rubbingher
little red nose with her handkerchief, and witha suspicious mist in
her eyes, - " of course it reallywas her fault, only we must n't let
her know we thinkso. You see, she was driving. (I 've always saidwomen
don't know how to drive; they're too incon-sequent.)  She wasn't
paying attention to her horse,and let a rein slip. Before she could
pick it up, thehorse shied at a newspaper blowing along the road.Well,
you know the rest. But Lois does not knowthatwe think it was her
carelessness"Gifford hesitated a moment, and then said slowly,"But
would n't it be better to help her face the truthof it now? There is
no use to try to escape self-reproaches that have their root in
facts.""Nonsense! " responded Mrs. Dale sharply. "Ithought you had
more sympathy! "Gifford had told his aunts of the accident, whenhe
brought them the offering of the two small fishes,and the ladies were
full of distress and anxiety, andthe flutter of excited interest which
would be sureto be felt in a place like Ashurst. They had goneat once
to the rectory, to see if they could be of use,though, as Miss Deborah
said to her sister, "withAdele Dale there, of course there is nothing
more tobe desired." Nevertheless, the next morning, MissRuth ran over
with a bowl of wine jelly from MissDeborah, and brought back word that
Mrs. Forsythewas "still breathing;" and that the gravest
appre.hensions were felt for Mr. Denner.Miss Deborah was waiting in
the parlor to hear<pb n="281"/>,  .oI WARD, PREACHER.
281the news; so important an occasion seemed to de-mand the dignity of
the parlor, and in a high-backedarmchair, with her feet on a cricket
and a freshhandkerchief in her hand, she listened to Miss
Ruth'sagitated and tearful story."I will make some whips for William
Denner,"she said promptly, as Miss Ruth finished, " and wewill tke
them to him this afternoon.""Well, but, sister,' said Miss Ruth,
hesitating,"do you think - we 'd better ? Ought not we to letGiff take
them ?""Why?" asked Miss Deborah. "He is able tosee us, is n't he ?""
It is not quite that," answered the younger sis-ter nervously, taking
off her bonnet, and beginningto roll the strings tight and smooth
between her fin-gers, " but-- he is in - his chamber, sister. Wouldit
be quite- proper ?""I think," said Miss Deborah, holding her headvery
straight, " we are old enough to "-"You may be," returned Miss Ruth
firmly, ".butI am not."Miss Deborah was silent for a moment; then
shesaid, "Well, perhaps you are right, dear Ruth;though he is
certainly very ill, and did n't you sayhe was in the library ? ""Yes,"
said Miss Ruth, "he is very ill, but thefact of his couch being in the
library does not alterit. If anything sad should be going to happen,
-it would be different, then.""Of course," assented Miss Deborah.u You
see," Miss Ruth explained, "if we saw him,and then he got well, it
would be very awkward."<pb n="282"/>282        JOHN WARD,

be too delicate in such matters.We will send the whips by Giff. Poor,

to answer his questions."Isn't there any change in Mrs. Forsythe?"he
asked, with anxious sympathy.Lois shook her head. "No," she said."Has
n't the rector gotten word to her son yet ? ""No," Lois said
again. "We telegraphed twice,but he seems to be out of town, and
nobody knowshis address."Gifford made no comment."I wish he would
come!" the girl cried paa-Cionately. "It would be a relief to have him
reproach me.""I hope there will be no need of reproaches. Ido hope his
mother will get well.""Oh, no, no," Lois said, " she won't I I know

absolutely no injury except theshock. I believe she will get well,

frail she is. And then there's Mr.Denner! It is the responsibility of
it that killsme, Giff I I cannot get away from it for one

taken place, and Lois shivered S she sawthe trampled grass, though it
had been her wish thatthey should come this way."Oh," she said,

whichwas the outlet for the rectory path, Gifford heldaside the twigs
for her to enter."Let us sit down on the stone bench a littlewhile,"
he said. "This is where poor little Mr.Denner sat that afternoon. Oh,"
he added in a lowertons, "b ju   think from what a grief he may

gratitude."  Then he looked at thetransplanted bunch of violets, which
was fresh andflourishing, and was silent.Lois sat down a little
reluctantly. The memoryof that June night, nearly a year ago, flashed
intoher mind; she felt the color creep up to her fore-head. "Oh," she
thought, "how contemptible I am.t hbae uny thought but grie-- how

repeated slowly, looking athim with questioning eyes. " How do you

was full of a grievedreluctance.Why," she said, with a quick breath,
"do youblame me ?"Gifford put his strong, steady hand impulsivelyover
hers. " I only know how you must blame your-self," he said
pitifully. "I wish I could bear thepain of it for you.""Then you say

down at herwith anxious tenderness. "I wish I did n't have tosay it,

do to make up forit. I cannot even die as an atonement. Oh, if Iould

enough yet to know that the desire ofdeath is part of youth, and it
seemed as though hetoo had incurred a great responsibility. " What
abrute I was to say it I" he said to himself. " I feelas though I had

down, and softly kissed her hand." My only trouble," Mrs. Forsythe
continued, "isabout my boy. Who will take care of him when Iam gone

justice could not have sustainedthe conviction that he had done right

Mrs. Forsythespoke thus of her son. It was not the first time sinceher
injury that she had told Lois of her anxiety forDick's future, and now
the girl left her with a dazedand aching heart.Mrs. Dale, full of
importance and authority, mether in the hall."I 've got some beef-tea
for Arabella Forsythe,"she said, balancing the tray she carried on one
hand,and lifting the white napkin with the other to see thatit was all
right, " i I can only persuade her to takeit. I never saw anybody who

and disappeared intothe sick-room. Lois had a sudden contraction ofthe
heart that made her lips white.   "If auntDeely says Mrs. Forsythe is
worse, it is surely verybad."She stumbled blindly up-stairs; she
wanted to getaway from everybody, and look this horrible fact inthe

still faintly yellow with sunset light, andbarred by long films of
gray cloud. She knelt downand laid her cheek against the sill, which
was notchedand whittled by childish hands; for this had been
aplay-room once, and many a rainy afternoon she andHelen and Gifford
had spent here, masquerading inthe queer dresses and bonnets packed
away in thegreen chests ranged against the wall, or swingingmadly in
the little swing which hung from the barerafters, until the bunches of
southernwood and sweet-marjoram and the festoons of dried apples shook
ontheir nails. She looked at the stars and hearts carvedon the sill,
and a big " Gifford" hacked into thewood, and she followed the letters
absently with herfinger." Fte blames me," she said to herself; "he
seesthe tr1t of it. How shll I make up for it ? Whatcan I do?"She
stayed by the window until the clouds turnedblack in the west; down in
the heavy darkness ofthe garden the crickets began their
monotonousz-z-ing, and in the locust-trees the katydids answeredeach
other with a sharp, shrill cry. Then she creptdown-stairs and sat
outside of Mrs. Forsythe's room,that she might hear the slightest
sound, or note theflicker of the night-lamp burning dimly on the
standat the bedside.Gifford, sitting in another sick-room, was
suffer-ing with her, and blaming himself, in spite of
prin-eiple.Mr. Deamer lay in his big bed in the middle of<pb

drawn up to the topsof the long, narrow windows, that the last gleam
oflight might enter, but the room was full of shadows,save where a
taper flickered on a small table whichheld the medicines."I think,"
said Mr. Denner, folding his littlehands upon his breast,- , I think,
Gifford, that thedoctor was not quite frank with me, to-day. Ithought
it proper to ask him if my injury was at allof a serious nature, if it
might have-ah-I oughtto apologize for speaking of unpleasant things-
ifit might have an untoward ending. He merely re-marked that all
injuries had possibilities of serious-ness in them; he appeared in
haste, and anxious toget away, so I did not detain him, thinking he
mighthave an important case elsewhere. But it seemed asthough he was
not quite frank, Gifford; as though,in fact, he evaded. I did not
press it, fearing toembarrass him, but I think he evaded."Gifford
also- evaded. "He did not say anythingwhich seemed evasive to me,
Mr. Denner. He wasbusy charging me to remember your medicines, andhe
stopped to say a word about your bravery, too."Mr. Denner shook his
head deprecatingly at this,but he seemed pleased. "Oh, not at all, it
wasnothing, - it was of no consequence." One of theshutters blew
softly to, and darkened the room; Gif-ford rose, and, leaning from the
window, fastened itback against the ivy which had twisted about
thehinge from the stained bricks of the wall  "I can-not claim any
bravery," the sick man went on."No. It was, as it were, accidental,
Gifford."<pb n="291"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER
291"Accidental?" said the young man. "Howcould that be? I heard the
horse, and ran downthe road after the phaeton just in time to see
youmake that jump, and save her."Mr. Denner sighed. "No," he replied,
"no, itwas quite by chance. I--I was mistaken. I amglad I did not
know, however, for I might have hes-itated. As it was, laboring under
a misapprehen-sion, I had no time to be afraid.""I don't think I quite
understand," said Gifford.Mr. Denner was silent. The room was so
darknow, he could scarcely see the young man's face ashe stood leaning
against one of the huge bed-posts.Behind him, Mr. Denner just
distinguished his bigsecretary, with its pigeon-holes neatly labeled,
andwith papers filed in an orderly way. No one hadclosed it since the
afternoon that he had been car-ried in and laid on the horse-hair
sofa. He hadgiven Mary the key then, and had asked her to fetchthe
bottle of brandy from one of the long divisionswhere it stood beside a
big ledger. The little gentle-man had hesitated to give trouble in
asking to have.it locked again, though that it should be open
of-fended his ideas of privacy. Now he looked at it,and then let his
eyes rest upon the nephew of theMisses Woodhouse." Gifford," he
said,w' would you be so obliging asto take the small brass key from my

his bunch of keys, which jingled as he held'them unsteadily out, -"

took the ring over to the candle, whichmade the shadow of his head
loom up on the op.posite wall, as he bent to find the little brass
keyamong a dozen others of all shapes and sizes."I have unlocked it,
sir," he said, a momentlater." Take the candle, if you please,"
responded Mr.Denner, "and you will see, I think, in the right-hand
corner, back, under a small roll, a flat, squareparcel."" Yes, sir,"
Gifford answered, holding the candlein his left hand, and carefully
lifting the parcel."Under that," proceeded Mr. Denner, "is anoval
package. If you will be good enough to handme that, Gifford. Stay,
-will you lock the drawerfirst, if you please, and the desk ? "Gifford
did so, and then put the package into Mr.Denner's hands. He held it a
moment before hegently removed the soft, worn tissue paper in whichit
was wrapped; his very touch was a caress."I was desirous," he said, "

Gifford?),-I called for itnow, because I wished to say, in the event
of my-demise, I should wish this given to one of youraunts,
sir."Gifford came out from the shadow at the foot oftie bed, and took
Mr. Denner's hand. He did notspeak; he had only the man's way of
showing sym-pathy, and one weaker than Gifford could not haveresisted
the piteous longing for life in Mr. Denner'stone, and would have
hastened to reassure him.But Gifford only held his hand in a firm,
gentlegrasp, and was silent." I should wish one of them to have it,"
he con-tinued. "I have not provided for its welfare in mywill; I had
thought there was no one for whom Ihad enough - enough regard, to
intrust them withit. I even thought to destroy it when I became
old.Some people might wish to carry it with them to thegrave, but I
could not - oh, no, not my little sister ISee, Gifford-- take it to

sending it to - her."Gifford took the miniature from the lawyer's
hand,and, kneeling by the candle, looked at it. The fadedvelvet case
held only the rosy, happy face of a littlechild; not very pretty,
perhaps, but with eyes whichhad smiled into Mr. Denner's for forty
years, andGifford held it in reverent hands.<pb n="294"/>294-
JOHN WARD, PREACHER."Yes," said the old man, "I would like one ofthem
to have it.""I shall remember it, sir," Gifford answered, put-ting the
case down on the lawyer's pillow.The room was quite still for a few
moments, andthen Mr. Denner said, "Gifford, it was quite acci-dental,
quite by mistake, as it were, that I stoppedthe horse for
Mrs. Forsythe and little Lois. I - Ithought, sir, it was one of your
aunts. One of youraunts, do you understand Gifford ? You know whatI
said to you, at the stone bench, that afternoon ? I-I alluded to
myself, sir."Gifford was silent, almost breathless; it all cameback to
him, - the warm, still afternoon, the sunshine,the faintly rustling
leaves of the big silver poplar,and Mr. Denner's friend's love
story. But only thepathos and the tenderness of it showed themselvesto
him now. He put his hand up to his eyes amoment; somehow, he felt as
though this was some-thing too sacred for him to see.X I know, sir,"
he said; "I - I see.""I trust," Mr. Denner continued, in a
relievedvoice, "there is no impropriety in mentioning thisto you,
though you are still a youth. You haveseemed older these last few

of the family.And therefore it seemed to me fitting that I
shouldmention this to you, because I wished to request youto dispose
of the miniature. It would have been<pb n="295"/>JOrN WARD, PREACHER
295scarcely proper to do otherwise, scarcely honorable,sir.""I am
grateful to you for doing so," Gifford re-plied gently. " I beg you
will believe how entirelyI appreciate the honor of your
confidence.""Oh, not at all," said Mr. Denner, waving hishand, "not at
all, - pray do not mention it. Andyou will give it to one of them," he
added, peeringthrough the dusk at the young man, "if--if itshould be
necessary ? ""Yes, sir," he answered, " I will; but you did notmention
which one, Mr. Denner.,'Mr. Denner was silent; he turned his head
wea-rily toward the faint glimmer which showed wherethe window waM,
and Gifford heard him sigh. "Idid not mention which, - no. I had not
quite de-cided. Perhaps you can tell me which you thinkwould like it
best? ""I am sure your choice would seem of most valueto
them."Mr. Denner did not speak; he was thinking howhe had hoped that
leap at the runaway horse wouldhave decided it all. And then his mind
traveledback to the stone bench, and his talk with Gifford,and the
proverb. "Gifford," he said firmly, "giveit, if you please, to Miss
Deborah."They did not speak of it further. Gifford wasalready
reproaching himself for having let his pa-tient talk too much, and
Mr. Denner, his mind atlast at rest, was ready to fall asleep, the
miniatureclasped in his fgverish hand.T- he next day, Gifford had no
good news to carry<pb n="296"/>296         JOHNB WARD, PREACOER.to
the rectory. The lawyer had had a bad night, andwas certainly weaker,
and sometimes he seemed alittle confused when he spoke. Gifford shrank
fromtelling Lois this, and yet he longed to see her, butshe did not
appear.She was with Mrs. Forsythe, her aunt said; andwhen he asked for
the invalid, Mrs. Dale shook herhead. " I asked her how she felt this
morning, andshe said, 'Still breathing ' But she certainly ispretty
sick, though she's one to make herself out atthe point of death if she
scratches her finger. StillI don't know.   I call her a sick
woman."Mrs. Dale could not easily resign the sense of im-portance
which attends the care of a very sick per.son, even though Arabella
Forsythe's appetite hadunquestionably improved." We've telegraphed
again for her son," she wenton, " though I must say she does not seem
to takehis absence much to heart. They are the sort ofpeople, I think,
that love each other better at a dis.tance. Now, if I were in her
place, I 'd be perfectlymiserable without my children. I don't know
whatto think of his not writing to her. It appears thathe's on a
pleasure party of some kind, and he's notwritten her a line since he
started; so of course shedoes not know where he is."But to Lois
Mrs. Forsythe's illness was somethingbeside interest and
occupation. The horror of herpossible death hung over the young girl,
and seemedto sap her youth and vigor.  Her face was drawnand haggard,
and her pleasant gray eyes had losttheir smile. Somehow Mr. Denner's
danger, which<pb n="297"/>JOBN WARD, PREACHER.           297to some
extent she realized, did not impress her so,deeply; perhaps because
that was, in a manner, theresult of his own will, and perhaps, too,
because noone quite knew how much the little gentleman suf-fered and
how near death he was.Lois had heard Gifford's voice as she went
intothe sick-room, and his words of blame rung again inher ears. They
emphasized Mrs. Forsythe's despairabout her son's future. She spoke to
Lois as thoughshe knew there was no possible chance of her
re-covery."You see, my dear," she said, in her soft, com-plaining
voice, which sometimes dropped to a whis-per, " he has no aunts or
uncles to look after himwhen I am gone; no one to be good to him
andhelp him to be good. Not that he is wild or foolish,Lois, like some
young men, but he's full of spirit,and he needs a good home. Oh, what
will he dowithout me. He has no one to take care of him I "Lois was
too crushed by misery to feel even agleam of humor, when the thought
flashed throughher mind that she might offer to take his
mother'splace; but she knew enough not to express it." Oh,"
Mrs. Forsythe continued, "if he were onlymarried to some sweet girl
that I knew and loved,how happy I should be, how content ""I - I wish
he were," Lois said."My death will be so hard for him, and who
willcomfort him I I am sorry I distress you by speak-ing so, but, my
dear child, on your death-bed youlook facts in the face. I cannot help
knowing hissorno, an it makes me so wretched. My. boy,--<pb

want to make me happy. I might have hada little more of life, a few
months, perhaps, if ithad not been for the accident. There, there,
youmust n't be distressed; but if I could know you caredfor him, it
would be worth dying for, Lois.""I do care for himI" Lois sobbed. "We
alldo "Mrs. Forsythe shook her head. "You are theonly one I want; if
you told me you wuld love him,I should be happy, so happy I Perhaps
you don'tlike to say it. But listen: I know all about lastfall, and
how you sent the poor fellow away broken-hearted; but I could n't stop
loving you, for all that,and I was so glad when he told me he was
going totry again; and that is what he is coming down toAshurst
for. Yes, he is coming to ask you. Yousee, I know all his secrets; he
tells me everything,-such a good boy, he is. But I've told you,
be.cause I cannot die, oh, I cannot die, unless I knowhow it will be
for him. If you could say yes, Lois,if you could I "Her voice had
faltered again, and the pallor ofweariness which spread grayly over
her face fright-ened Lois. She shivered, and wrung her handssharply
together."Oh," she said, "I would do anything in theworld for you -
but - but" -"But this is all I want," interrupted the
othereagerly. "Promise this, and I am content to die.<pb n="299"/>
JtorN WARD, PREACHER            299When he asks you-oh, my dear, my
deav, promiseme to sy yes I "Lois had hidden her face in the pillow. "
It wasall my fault," she was saying to herself;" it is theonly
atonement I can make."" I will do anything you want me to," she said
atlast.Mrs. Forsythe, laid her shaking hand on the girl'sbowed head. "
Oh, look at me I You give me lifewhen you say that. Will you promise
to say yes,Lois ?"She lifted her head, but she would not look
intoMrs. Forsythe's eyes."Yes," she answered, twisting her fingers
ner.vously together. "I promise if- if he wants me.""Oh, my dear, my
dear I" Mrs. Forsythe said,and then, to Lois's horror, she burst into
tears.She tried to say it was joy, and Lois must not befrightened, but
the young girl fled for Mrs. Dale,and then ran up to the garret, and
locked the door.She went over to the western window and threwherself
upon the floor, her face hidden in her arms." He made me do it," she
said between her sobs;"he said it was my fault. Well, I have made
upfor it now. I have atoned. I have promised."She was too miserable
even to take the satisfac-tion which belongs to youth, of observing
its ownwretchedness. She sobbed and cried without con.sciousness of
tears. At last, for very wearinessand exhaustion, she fell asleep, and
was wakened byhearing Mrs. Dale rap sharply at the door."Come, Lois,
come " she cried. "What's the<pb n="300"/>800        JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.matter? Dick Forsythe is here. Do have polite-ness enough to
come down-stairs. I don't know butthat his mother is a shade better,
but she has had achance to die twice over, the time he's been
gettinghere I"<pb n="301"/>CHAPTER XXI.THE news of the anxiety in
Ashurst hurriedHelen's visit. She might be of use, she thought,and she
had better go now than a week later.Perhaps, too, she felt the
necessity of calm. Shehad been forced into a tumult of discussion
andargument, which at last she had begun to meet withthe silence of
exhaustion. Elder Dean had come tosee her, and she had received him at
first with pa-tience, and given him her reasons for not believingin
hell. There had even been a moment when Helenfancied that she might
convince hinm of what was soclear and simple to her own mind. But to
eachargument of hers he had but one reply,-"TheBible, ma'am, the Word
of God, instructs us" thusor thus,--and he returned again and again
withunwearied obstinacy to his own position. After awhile Helen's
annoyance at the man got the betterof her judgment, and she wrote to
him, saying shedid not wish to argue with him again, and must beghim
not to come to the parsonage to see her.Mr. Grier, too, horrified at
his wife's reports ofwhat Mrs. Ward had said, hastened to Lockhavento
reproach and admonish John for permitting suchheresy in his household;
for Mr. Grier held withSt. Paul that the husband was head of the
wife,even to the extent of regulating her conscience.<pb
n="302"/>802     oJOHN WARD, PREACHERJohn was not at home, so he
turned his attack uponthe real offender, assuring her that it was for
hersoul's sake that he thus dealt with her. Helen hadbrought the
interview to a sudden close by refusingto hear further argument, and
bowing Mr. Grierfrom the room, with a certain steady look from un-der
her level brows and a compression of the lipswhich, greatly to his
surprise when he thought itover, silenced him.The talks with John
could not, of course, be calledpainful, for they were with him, but
they werefutile.When the last evening came before she was toleave
home, Helen knew, with a dull pain of help-less remorse, that it was a
relief to go; she wasglad that she could not hear Elder Dean's voice
fora fortnight, or even know, she said with a patheticlittle laugh to
her husband, that she " was destroy-ing anybody's hope of hell, in the
parish.""Yes," John answered, " it will be good for you tobe away from
it all for a time. It is hard to think: clearly, hurried by my
impatient anxiety to haveyou reach a certain conclusion. I realize
that. ButI know you will try to reach it, dearest."Helen shook her
head wearily. " No, I am afraidI cannot promise that. You must not
hope that Ishall ever come to believe in eternal damnation. Ofcourse I
believe that the consequences of sin areeternal; the effect upon
character must be eternal,and I should think that would be hell
enough, some-times. But I shall never, never believe in it as
youdo."<pb n="303"/>~   -       xJOmN WARD, PREACHER
803"Oh, Helen," her husband said, "I cannot ceaseto hope while I have
power to pray."Helen sighed. "I wish you could understandhow useless
it is, dearest, or how it hurts me, thistalk of hell. For people to be
good for fear ofhell is like saying 'Honesty is the best policy;' itis
degrading. And it seems selfish to me, somehow,to.think so much about
one's own salvation, - it iswall, John. The scheme of salvation that
theelders talk. so much about really resolves itself intoa fear' of
hell and hope of heaven, all for the in-dividual soul, and is n't that
selfish?  But after all,this question of eternal punishment is such a
littlething, so on the outside of the great puzzle. Onegoes in, and
in: Why is sin, which is its own punish-sent : the world at all ? What
does it all mean,i, w^ J  m    LifW m is God, and why does He let usM

death in the sameKd?-: Oh,-tht is so oruel, - love,and death to--: -
ert: Is He, at all? Those are the things, itseems to me, one has to
think about. But why doI go all over it? We can't get away from it,
canwe ?""' Those questions are the outgrowth of unbeliefin justice,"
he said eagerly; "if you only realizedjustice and mercy, the rest
would be clear."She came over to him, and, kneeling down, puther head
on his knee. " Oh, John, how can I leaveyou to-morrow ?"It was true
that they could not drop the subject.Hour after hour they had sat
thus, John instructing,<pb n="304"/>804         1SoN WARD,
PREACHERproving, reasoning, with always the tenderest loveand patience
in his voice. Helen listening with asweet graciousness, which kept her
firm negationsfrom making her husband hopeless. He had showedher, that
Sunday evening after the sermon on foreignmissions, what he felt had
been his awful sin: hehad deprived his people of the bread of life for
hersake, and, for fear of jarring the perfect peace oftheir lives and
giving her a moment's unhappiness,he had shrunk from his duty to her
souLAt first Helen had been incredulous. She couldnot realize that her
mere unbelief in any doctrine,especially such a doctrine as this of
eternal punish-ment, could be a matter of serious importance toher
husband. It needed an effort to treat his arga-ment with respect. "
What does it matter ?" shekept saying. " We love each other, so never
mindwhat we believe. Believe anything you want, dar-ling. I don't
care! Only love me, John. And if myideas offend your people, let us
leave Lockhaven; orI can keep silence, unless I should have to speak
forwhat seems to me truth's sake."And then John tried to-show her how
he hadwronged his people and been false to his own vowsand that he
dared not leave them until he hadrooted out the evil his own neglect
had allowed togrow up among them, and that her mere silencewould not
reach the root of the evil in her own souL0 And the importance of it
I" Oh," he cried, oncvwhen they had been talkinguntil late into the
night, "is not your soul's life ofimportance, Helen? When I see you
going down to<pb n="305"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER            806eternal
death because I have failed in my duty toyou, can I satisfy myself by
saying, We love one an-other? Because I love you, I cannot be
silent. Oh,I have wronged you, I have not loved you enough!I have been
content with the present happiness ofmy love, - my happiness! I had no
thought ofyours."So they had gone over and over the subject, untilto
Helen it seemed threadbare, and they sat nowin the dusky library, with
long stretches of silencebetween their words.Alfaretta brought in the
lamps. In view of Mrs.Ward's departure for a fortnight, her father,
stillwith an eye to wages, deferred giving notice. "Be-sides," he
thought, "Mrs. Ward may be convictedand converted after she's been
dealt with."Helen had risen, and was writing some instru-.tions for
her maid: just what was to be cooked forthe preacher, and what
precautions taken for hiscomfort. As she put her pen down, she turned
tolook at her husband. He was sitting, leaning for-ward, with his head
bowed upon his hand, and hiseyes covered." Helen," he said, in a low,
repressed voice, "oncemore, just once more, let me entreat you; and
thenwe will not speak of this before you go."She sighed.  "Yes,
dearest, say anything youwant."There was a moment's silence, and then
Johnrose, and stood looking down at her. " I have sucha horror of your
going away. I do not understandit; it is more than the grief and
loneliness of being<pb n="306"/>806        JOHN WARD,
PREACHERwithout you for a few days. It is vague and inde.finable, but
it is terribly real. Perhaps it is thefeeling that atonement for my
sin towards you isbeing placed out of my reach. You will be whereI
cannot help you, or show you the truth. Yet youwill try to find it! I
know you will. But now,just this last night, I must once more
implore.you toopen your heart to God's Spirit. Ah, my Helen, Ihave
sinned against Heaven and before you, butmy punishment will be greater
than I can bear if Ienter heaven without you! Heaven? My God, itwould
be helll The knowledge that my sin hadkept you out - yet even as I
speak I sin."He was walking up and down the room, his handsknotted in
front of him, and his face filled withhopeless despair."Yes, I sin
even in this, for my grief is not thatI have sinned against God in my
duty to his peopleand in forgetting Him, but that I may lose
youheaven, I may make you suffer I "Helen came to him, and tried to
put her armsabout him. " Oh, my dear," she said, " don't
youunderstand? I have heaven now, in your love.And for the rest, - oh,
John, be content to leave itin Hands not limited by our poor ideas of
justice.If there is a God, and He is good, He will not sendme away
from you in eternity; if He is wicked andcruel, as this theology makes

heard him say; " she knows not what<pb n="307"/>.JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.           80T she says. Yet I-Oh, Helen, that same

- I cannot getaway from it. Yet if I could only save you I Butthere
again I distrust my motive: not for God'sglory, but for my own love's
sake, I would save you.My God, my God, be merciful to me a sinner I"In
his excitement, he had pushed her arm fromhis shoulder, and stood in
tense and trembling si-lence, looking up, as though listening for an
answerto his prayer.Helen dared not speak. There is a great gulffixed
between the nearest and dearest souls when inany spiritual anguish;
even love cannot pass it, andno human tenderness can fathom it. Helen
couldnot enter into this holiest of holies, where her hus-band's soul
was prostrate before its Maker. In thesolitude of grief and remorse he
was alone.It was this isolation from him which broke hercalm. It
seemed profane even to look upon his suf-fering. She shrank away from
him, and hid herface in her hands. That roused him, and in a mo-ment
the old tenderness enveloped her.He comforted her with silent love,
until sheceased to tremble, and looked again into his tendereyes."
What I wanted to say," he said, after a while,when she was leaning
quietly against his breast,"was just to tell you once more the reasons
for be-lieving in this doctrine which so distresses you, dear-est. To
say, in a word, if I could, why I lay such<pb n="308"/>s.H JOBE
TWARD, PREACHERstress upon it, instead of some of the other
doctrinesof the church. It is because I do believe that sal.vation,
eternal life, Helen, depends upon holdingthe doctrine of reprobation
in its truth and entirety.For see, beloved: deny the eternity of
punishment,and the scheme of salvation is futile. Christ neednot have
died, a man need not repent, and the wholemotive of the gospel is
false; revelation is denied,and we are without God and without
hope. Grantthe eternity of punishment, and the beauty and or-der of
the moral universe burst upon us: man is asinner, and deserves death,
and justice is satisfied;for, though mercy is offered, it is because
Christ hasdied. And his atonement is not cheapened by be-ing forced
upon men who do not want it. Theymust accept it, or be punished."Helen
looked up into his face with a sad wonder.U Don't you see, dear," she
said, " we cannot reasonabout it ? You take all this from the Bible,
becauseyou believe it is inspired. I do not believe it is.So how can
we argue ? If I granted your premises,all that you say would be
perfectly logical. But Ido not, John. I cannot. I am so grieved for
you,dearest, because I know how this distresses you; butI must say
it. Silence can never take the place oftruth, between us."" Oh, it
did, too long, too long I" John groaned."Is there no hope ?" and then
he began his restlesswalk again, Helen watching him with yearning
eyes." I cannot give it up," he said at last. "Theremust be some way
by which the truth can be madeclear to you. Perhaps the Lord will show
it to me.<pb n="309"/>rOHN WARD, PREACHER             809There is no
pain too great for me to bear, to findit out; no, even the anguish of
remorse, if it bringsyou to God! Oh, you shall be saved! Do
thepromises of the Eternal fail?"He came over to her, and took her
hands in his.Their eyes met. This sacrament of souls was toosolemn for
words or kisses. When they spoke againit was of commonplace things.It
was hard for her to leave the little low-browedhouse, the next
morning. John stopped to gather abunch of prairie roses from the bush
which they hadtrained beneath the study window, and Helen fas-tened
them in her dress; then, just as they wereready to start, the
preacher's wife ran back to thestudy, and hurriedly put one of the
roses from herbosom into a vase on the writing-table, and stoopedand
gave a quick, furtive kiss to the chair in whichJohn always sat when
at work on a sermon.They neither of them spoke as they walked to
thestation, and no one spoke to them. Helen knewthere were shy looks
from curtained windows andpeeping from behind doors, for she was a
moral cu-riosity in Lockhaven; but no one interrupted them.Just before
she started, John took her hand, andheld it in a nervous
grasp. "Helen," he saidhoarsely, " fr the sake of my eternal happiness
seekfor truth, seek for truth I"She only looked at him, with
speechless love strug-gling through the pain in her eyes.The long,
slow journey to Ashurst passed like atroubled dream. It was an effort
to adjust her mind.to the different life to which she was
going. Late<pb n="310"/>t10        .rOHN WARD, PREACHERin the
afternoon, the train drew up to the depot inMercer, and Helen tried to
push aside her absorbingthought of John's suffering, that she might
greet heruncle naturally and gladly. The rector stood onthe platform,
his stick in one hand and his glassesin the other, and his ruddy face
beaming with pleas-ure. When he saw her, he opened his arms andhugged
her; it would have seemed to Dr. Howethat he was wanting in affection
had he reserved hisdemonstrations until they were alone."Bless my
soul," he cried, "it is-good to see youagain, my darling child. We're
all in such distressin Ashnrst, you'll do us good. Your husbandcould

again. Get in, my dear, get in.Now give your old uncle a kiss, and

heart; a tremuloussort of happiness stole over the background of
hertroubled thoughts, as a gleam of light from a stormysunset may
flutter upon the darkness of the clouds."Tell me - everything    How
is Lois? Howare the sick people ? How is Ashurst ?"Dr. Howe took up a
great deal of room, sittingwell forward upon the seat, with his hands
claspedon his big stick, which was planted between hisknees, and he
had to turn his head to see Helenwhen he answered her."Mrs. Forsythe

it is her fault, and all that sort of thing. Butshe wasn't to blame;

horse. Sheaeeds you to cheer her up.""Poor little Mr. Denner " Helen
exclaimed."I 'm glad Giff is with him. Has Mr. Forsythecome?""Yes,"
said the rector; "but they are queer peo-ple, those Forsythes. The
young man seems quiteannoyed at having been summoned: he remarkedto
your aunt that there was nothing the matter withhis mother, and she
must be moved to her own house;tisoe was nothing so bad for her as to

for her.Your aunt Adele feels her occupation gone, andthinks

won't, - she '11 get well."Here he gave a heavy sigh, and said, "Poor
Den-ner!"" You don't mean Mr. Denner won't get well?"Helen asked
anxiously."I'm afraid not," Dr. Howe answered sadly.<pb n="312"/>812
JOHN WARD, PREACHER.They were silent for a little while, and then
Helensaid in a hushed voice, "Does he know it, uncleArchie ?""No,"
said the rector explosively, "he-hedoes n't "Dr. Howe was evidently
disturbed; he pulled upone of the carriage windows with some violence,
anda few minutes afterwards lowered it with equal force."No, he does
n't," he repeated. "The doctor onlytold me this morning that there was
no hope. Saysit is a question of days. He's very quiet; does notseem
to.suffer; just lies there, and is polite to peo-ple. He was
dreadfully troubled at breaking up thewhist party last Saturday; sent
apologies to theother three by Gifford." Dr. Howe tugged at hisgray
mustache, and looked absently out of the win-dow. "No, I don't believe
he has an idea that he- he won't get well." The rector had a
strangeshrinking from the word "death."" I suppose he ought to know,"
Helen said thought-fully." That is what the doctor said," answered the
rec-tor; "told me he might want to settle his affairs.But bless my
soul, what affairs can Denner have ?He made his will fifteen years
ago, and left all hehad to Sarah Denner's boy. I don't see what hehas
to do.""But, uncle," Helen said, "might n't he havesome friends or
relatives to whom he would wantto send a message, - or perhaps see ?
People younever heard of?""Oh, no, no," responded Dr. Howe.     "I

straightforward as a child. No; WillieDenner '11 have his money, -
there's not too muchof it, - and that's all there is to consider.""
But it is not only money," Helen went on slowly:"has nt he a right to
know of eternity? Not justgo out into it blindly? "" Perhaps so, -
perhaps so," the rector admitted,hiding his evident emotion with a
flourish of his bigwhite silk handkerchief. "You see," he
continued,steadying his cane between his knees, while he tookoff his
glasses and began to polish them, " the doctorwants me to tell him,
Helen.""I suppose so," she said sympathetically."And I suppose I
must," the rector went on, "butit is the hardest task he could set
me. I- I don'tknow how to approach it.""It must be very hard.""Of
course it seems natural to the doctor that Ishould be the one to tell
him. I'm his pastor, andhe's a member of my church-    Stay! is
he?"Dr. Howe thrust out his lower lip and wrinkled hisforehead, as he
thought. "Yes, oh yes, I remember.We were confirmed at the same time,
when wewere boys, -old Bishop White's last confirmation.But he has n't
been at communion since my day."" Why do you think that is,uncle
Archie ? " Helenasked."Why, my dear child, how do I know ? " criedthe
rector. "Had his own reasons, I suppose. I<pb n="314"/>814

whatmakes it so hard to go and tell Denner that--that he 's got to
die. Somehow, we never touchedon the serious side of life. I think
that's apt to bethe case with friends in our position. We havegone
fishing together since we were out of pinafores,and we have played
whist, -at least I 've watchedhim, - and talked politics or church
business overour pipes; but never anything like this. We weresimply
the best of friends. Ah, well, Denner willleave a great vacancy in my
life."They rods in silepee- for some time, and thenHelenasaid gently,
"Yes, but uncle, dear, that isthe only way you are going to help him
now,- withthe old friendship.  It is too late for anythingelse,--any
religious aid, I mean,-when a mancomes to look death in the face. The
getting readyfor death has gone, and it is death itself, then.And I
should think it would be only the friend'shand and the friend's eyes,
just the human sympa-thy, which would make it easier. I suppose all
onecan do is to say, 'Let my friendship go with youthrough it all,-
all this unknown to us both."'Dr. Howe turned and looked at her
sharply; thetwilight had fallen, and the carriage was very dark."
That's a heathenish thing to say, Helen, and it isnot so. The
consolations of religion belong to a manin death as much as in life;
they ought not to be-long more to death than to life, but they do,
some-times. It is n't that there is not much to say toDenner. It is
the- the unusualness of it, if I canso express it.  We have never
touched on such<pb n="315"/>JOHEN WARD, PREACHER.
815things, I tell you, old friends as we are; and it isawkward, you
understand."They were very quiet for the rest of the longlrive.They
stopped a moment at Mr. Denner's gate; thehouse was dark, except for a
dim light in the libraryand another in the kitchen, where Mary sat
poringover her usual volume. Gifford came out to saythere was no
change, and opened the carriage doorto shake hands with Helen." He
would have prayers to-night," he said to therector, still talking in a
hushed voice, as though thespell of the sick-room were on him out
under thestars, in the shadows of the poplar-trees.  "Hemade Willie

such forms in afamily, no matter what the conditions might be.Imagine
Willie stumbling through Chronicles, andLary fast asleep at her end of

much dis-tressed to be amused; he shivered as they droveaway." Ah," he
said sharply, " how I hate that slam ofa carriage door I Makes me
think of but one thing.Ye; I must see him to-morrow. I must tell him
to-morrow."The rector settled back in his corner, his facedarkening
with a grieved and troubled frown, andthey did not speak until they
reached the rectorygate. As it swung heavily back against the groupof
white lilacs behind it, shaking out their soft, pen-etrating fragrance
into the night air, some one sprang<pb n="316"/>581(6     ;JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.towards the carriage, and almost before it stoppedstood
on the steps, and rapped with impatient joy atthe window.It was
Lois. She had thrown a filmy white scarfabout her head, and had come
out to walk up anddown the driveway, and listen for the sound
ofwheels. She had not wanted to stay in the house,lest Mr. Forsythe
might appear.Lois had scarcely seen him since he arrived, thoughthis
was not because of his devotion to his mother.He spent most of his
time lounging about the post-ofice, and swearing hat Ashurst was the
dullest,deadest place on the face of the eart   He had notlistened to
Lois's self-reproaches, and insisted thatblame must not even be
mentioned. He was quitein earnest, but strangely awkward. Lois,
weigheddown by the consciousness of her promise, felt it washer fault,
yet dared not try to put him at his ease,and fled, at the sound of his
step, to her refuge in.the garret. She did not feel that her promise
toMrs. Forsythe meant that she must give opportunityas well as
consent. But Dick did not force his pres-ence upon her, and he was
very uncomfortable anddistrait when at the rectory.  "She need not
have feared his coming again thatevening. He was in the library of his
mother'shous, covering many pages of heavy crested note-paper with his
big, boyish writing.  Strangelyenough, however, for a young gentleman
in lovewith Miss Lois Howe, he was addressing in termsof ardent
admiration some one called " Lizzie."But in the gladness of meeting

against her wet cheek,there was nothing left to wish for, except the
recov-ery of the two sick people." Oh, Helen I Helen I Helen! " she
cried hyster.ically, while Dr. Howe, flourishing his silk
handker-chief, patted them both without discrimination, andsaid,
"There, my dear, there, there."<pb n="318"/>CHAPTER XXII.AFrB
Helen had gone, John Ward went backto the parsonage, dazed and
stupefied by the exhaus-tion of the moral conflict which for nearly a
monthhad strained every fibre of his soul.The house seemed dark and
empty. His facebrightened a moment, as he sat wearily down at
hiswriting-table and saw the prairie rose in the slendervase. He
leaned his head on his hand, and drewthe flower towards him, touching
it with gentle fin-gers, as though he caressed the bloom of
Helen'scheek. Then he pushed it in front of her picturewhich stood
always on the same table, and thoughtvaguely that he would leave it
there until she put afresh one in its place.And so his thoughts came
heavily back to the oldgrief and anxiety. He went over all the
argumentshe had used, and saw new points and reasons whichhe had
neglected to give, and he even drew his penand paper towards him, and
began to make somenotes. He would send them to her; and, away fromhim,
anrely what he should may would have an addedYet he could not fi his
mind upon his subject.He found himself heavily conscious of the
silence ofthe house; and by and by he rose and went up-stairs to their
bedroom, standing drearily in the cen.<pb n="319"/>tOHN, WARD,

lone-liness. He lifted a bit of lace upon her dressing-table, and
smoothed it between his fingers, noting.the faint scent of orris which
it held. Again thatstrange, unreasonable fear of her absence seized
him,and he was glad to go out and find some pressingoccupation to
forget it.When he started (as he had had to do of late),alone, for
prayer-meeting, his mind was dulled by itsown pain of anxiety, and he
went absently throughthe services, saying little, and " opening" the
meet-ing as soon as he could. After that, he sat withhead bent and
arms folded, scarcely hearing whatwas said.Just before be pronounced

ofthe tall lamps beside his desk, for the writing wasdim and crabbed,
and the light poor, and then reada call that the Session should meet
immediatelyafter the prayer-meeting. No object for considera-tion was
named, and the paper was signed by Mr.Dean and another elder. John put
it down, and,noticing that his four elders sat together on one ofthe
bare settees, omitted the usual request that theyshould aJ remain.The
little congregation gradually dispersed. ThenElder Dean arose, and,
creaking heavily down theaie, closed and locked the front door, and
put out<pb n="320"/>820         JOHN WARD, PREACHER.four of the
lamps in the back of the room for econ.omy's sake. After that he sat
down again on thesettee beside the three other elders, and the
lecture.room was silent.John looked up, and waited for some one
tospeak, then, suddenly recalling his duty of modera-tor, he called
the Session to order, and asked thereason for meeting.Mr. Johnson, who
was the youngest elder in thechurch, shuffled his feet under the
bench, coughed-slightly, and looked at hiscolleagues. Mr. Bent
andMr. Smith kept their eyes upon the ground, andMr. Dean folded and
unfolded his arms severaltimes."Brethren," said the preacher, "we have
askedthe blessing of God upon the deliberations of thisSession; it now
remains to bring the business be.fore it."Mr. Dean poked Mr. Smith
furtively, who re-plied in a loud whisper, "It is your place,
BrotherDean."The elder's face turned a dull mottled red; hefelt John's
surprised eyes upon him. Under coverof blowing his nose violently, he
rose, and, shiftingfrom one foot to the other, he glanced
imploringlyat his companions. But no one spoke."Brother Ward," he,
began at last, opening andshutting his mouth until his upper lip
looked like ahooked beak, " this Session has been called for
theconsideration of--of the spiritual condition of thischurch. The
duties of the elders of a church areheavy, and painful - and - and -
large. But they<pb n="321"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            82iare
discharged,--they are always," said Mr. Dean,inflating his chest, and
raising one hand, "dis-charged   The church expects it, and the church
isnot disappointed. Yet it is most terribly painful,sometimes - most
awful, and - unpleasant."Here Mr. Dean stopped, and coughed behind
hishand. Mr. Johnson crossed his legs, and glancedback at the door as
though calculating his chancesof escape. The other two men did not
look up.Elder Dean had no reason to fear that he had notthe attention
of the moderator. John was watchinghim with burning eyes."Proceed," he
said."Well," he continued, "as we always performour painful, most
painful duties, we are here to-night. We are here to-night,
Mr. Moderator, toconsider the spiritual welfare of the church, and
ofone especial soul connected with the church. Thissoul is -is far
from grace; it is in a lost condition;a stranger to God, an alien from
the commonwealthof Israel. But that is not all No. It is - ah
-spreading its own disease of sin in the vitals of thechurch. It is
not only going down to hell itself, butit is dragging others along
with it. It is to considerthe welfare of that soul, Brother Ward, that
thisSession has been convened. It is a very difficulttask which is set
before us, but we are sustained byduty, - by duty, sir I We will not
have to reproachourselves for neglect of an immortal souL  Wewish to

upon the pulpit rail, his face rigidand his teeth set, - "do you refer
to my wife?"<pb n="322"/>822        JOAN WARD, PREACHER.The three
men on the bench started as thoughthey had received a galvanic
shock. Elder Dean,with his lips parted, looked at his minister in
si-lence."Answer me," said John Ward."Mr. Moderator," replied the
elder in a quaver-ing voice, "if I do refer to your wife, that is not
theway it is to be considered. I refer to a sin-sick soul.I refer to
a--a cause of falling from grace, in thischurch. I refer to a poor
neglected sinner, whomust be saved; yes, sir, saved. If she happens
tobe your wife, I - I - am sorry."The room was very silent. The
flaring lampsshone on the bare, whitewashed walls and on theshamed
faces 'of the four men; the shadows in thecorners pressed upon the
small centre of light. Oneof the lamps smoked, and Mr. Bent rose to
turn itdown, and a deeper gloom settled upon the group.Mr. Johnson
nervously opened a hymn-book, andbegan to turn the pages. For a moment
the rustleof the paper was the only sound that broke
thequiet.John-Ward, appalled and angry, humiliated thathis most sacred
grief was dragged from his heart tobe gazed at and discussed by these
men, was yet si.lenced by his accusing conscience."There is no need,"
he said at last, with painfulslowness, and breathing hard, " to bring
this matterbefore the Session. As preacher of this church, Iprefer to
deal with that soul according to the wis.dom God gives me. I neither
ask nor desire youradvice."<pb n="323"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER
828Elder Dean turned to his companions, and raisedhis hands
slightly. Mr. Smith responded to his lookby rising and saying, still
gazing fixedly upon thefloor, "This ain't the way, Brother Ward, to
con-sider this matter. Your wisdom ain't enough, seein'that it has
allowed things to get to this pass. Allwe desire is to deal with
Mrs. Ward for her owngood. Brother Dean speaks of the evil in the
church,- ain't it our duty to check that ? It appears, sir,that,
preacher of this church or not, you've allowedher sin of unbelief to
remain unreproved, and theconsequence is its spread in the church:
that's whatwe're responsible for; that's our duty. 'If you'veneglected
your duty, we ain't a-goin' to neglectours." He wagged his head
emphatically, and thensat down.John Ward was toe entirely without
self-con.sciousness to feel the change in the tone of thesemen. Their
old sincerely felt admiration and aweof their preacher was gone. The
moment theybecame his critics, they ceased to feel his
superior-ity. Disapproval was power, and their freedom fromthe
trammels of respect made them cruel. But theoutcry of John's
conscience made him deaf to smallerthings. He sat bending forward, his
hands lockedtogether, and the vein in his forehead standingout like
whip- cord; his lips were white and com-pressed.Mr. Dean got on his
feet again, with much lessembarrassment in his manner. Mr. Smith's
share inthe responsibility was a great relief."It is exactly as
Brother Smith says," he said<pb n="324"/>824        4fOHN WARD,
PREACHER."If it was just -just her, we would n't, perhaps,meddle,
though I ain't sure but what it would be ourduty. But the church, - we
have got to protect it.We would wish to summon her, and see if we
canbring her to a realizing sense of her condition be-fore proceeding
to any extreme measure. If sheremained in a hardened state, it would
then be ourduty to bring charges and proof. And we shoulddo it, bein'
supported by a sense of duty- and bythe grace of God."Here Mr. Johnson
rose, rather noisily, and Mr.Dean looked: at him impatiently."He '11
spoil it all," he muttered, as he sat downbetween Mr. Smith and
Mr. Bent." I just want to say," said Mr. Johnson, in a quick,high
voice, "that I'm not in sympathy with thismeeting."John looked at him
eagerly."It is my idea that these sort of things hever do.The day has
passed for forcing people into believingthings, - yes, sir,'- and it
does n't do any good,anyhow. Now, my advice would be, don't
disturbthings, don't break up the peace. I 'm for peaceand quiet and a
happy life, before anything else.Just let's not say anything about
it. There's noth-ing, brethren, like argument for disturbing a
churchor a home. I know it; I'm a married man. AndI just advise you to
keep quiet. Use your influencein a quiet, easy way, but nothing
else. May be itwill come out all right, after all."He sat down again,
and Mr. Dean and Mr. Smithbegan to whisper to him with evident
indignation.<pb n="325"/>jOHN WARD, PREACHER              3282But
the preacher's face was full of doubt andgrief. " No," he said at
last, moving his dry lipswith a visible effort, "we cannot conquer sin
byhiding it or forgetting it, and I believe that thisSession has the
welfare of the church sincerely atheart; but I do not believe the plan
you proposewill profit either the church or the soul of whomyou
speak. Her absence at present would, at allevents, make it necessary
to defer any action. Inthe mean time, I believe that the Lord will
teachme wisdom, and will grant grace and peace to herwhose welfare is
the subject of your prayers. If Ireach any conlusion in the matter
which you oughtto know, I will communicate with you. If there isno
further motion, this meeting is adjourned."The elders rose, and with
the exception of Mr.Johnson, retreated in embarrassed haste.
Theyducked their heads, and made a guttural noise intheir throats, as
though to say good-night; but theywere ashamed to speak to him, though
Mr. Bentsaid as he turned his back on the preacher, "We 'U- ah - pray
for her." Mr. Johnson stopped to justify his presence, andsay again,
"Don't notice it, Mr. Ward. I'd justgently like bring her round some
time; keep onprayin', an' all that, but don't force it. It will
onlymake trouble for you." John hurried away from him, stung to the
quick.This, then, was his own real attitude; this was whathis plea of
wisdom had meant this last year. Hisown deceit loomed up before his
soul, and the sky of<pb n="326"/>826         JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.faith grew black. One by one, the accusations ofthe elders
repeated themselves to him, and he madeno protest. His assenting
conscience left him abso-lutely defenseless.*<pb n="327"/>CHAPTER
XXIII.THERE   was a strange unreality about Helen'swakening, the first
morning in Ashurst.The year in Lockhaven seemed to have made aslittle
change as a dream. Here she was, back inher old room. How familiar
everything looked!Her little white bed; the old cherry-wood
dressing-ease, with its shining brass rings and spotless linencover;
the morning sunshine dancing with the shad-ows of the leaves, and
falling in a golden squareupon the floor; the curtains at the south
windowblowing softly to and fro in the fresh wind, and theflutter of
wings outside in the climbing roses; eventhe bunch of white lilacs on
the little table, appar-ently all just as she had left them nearly a
year ago.Lockhaven and theology were behind her, and yetin some
indefinable way she was a stranger in astrange land. The consciousness
of a difference had come thenight before, when Lois poured out her
fears andgriefs to her cousin (all except her promise to Mrs.Forsythe)
as soon as they were alone.Lois felt no difference. Helen had been
away fora long time, but she was still the same Helen to her;strong,
and true, and gentle, with perhaps a littlemore gravity in her eyes,
but Lois was so grave her-self she did not notice that. Whereas with
Helen<pb n="328"/>828         JOHN WARD, PREACBERthere was a dual
life: the one, absorbing, passion.ate, and intense; the other, a
memory; a tender,6eautiful past, no longer a necessity.Helen's joys
had come between her and this oncedear home life, and even while Lois
was telling herof her cruel anxiety, and Helen was listening witha
face full of sympathy, her thoughts were follow.ing John on his lonely
walk back from prayer-meet-ing, and greeting him in the doorway of the
emptyhouse.Of course the consciousness of the difference andthe
strangeness wore off in a few days; perhaps ifAshurst had been its
usual quiet self, it would havelasted longer, but there was so much to
do, and solittle appreciation of change in the mind of any oneelse,
she almost forgot to notice it herself, but onlyknew that all the
time, under all her sympathy withAshurst joys and sorrows, - mostly
sorrows, now, -was a deep, still current of thought flowing towardsher
husband.Mrs. Dale had been the first one to come in, inthe
morning. They had scarcely finished breakfastwhen they heard her
decided voice in the hall, re-proving Sally for some careless
sweeping. A littlewhile ago, Lois would have resented this as
inter-ference; but she had too many real troubles now to.take
Mrs. Dale's meddling to heart."' Well, Helen, my dear," she said, "I'm
glad tosee you." Mrs. Dale turned her cheek to her niece,under the
impression that she was kissing her."It is high time for you to be
home again. Youmust keep this foolish child in order; she hardly,<pb
n="329"/>J*OHN WARD, PREACHER.          829eats or sleeps. I suppose
you've sent to know howArabella Forsythe is to-day, Lois ? "Lois
looked anxious. "I thought she really wasbetter last night, but she
sent word this morningthere was no change.""Fudge!" cried
Mrs. Dale. "I brought herround all right before that nurse came. She
can'thave killed her in this time. The fact is, brother,Arabella
Forsythe is n't in any hurry to get well;she likes the excitement of
frightening us all todeath. I declare, Helen, she made her
death-bedadieux six times over  I must say, nothing doesshow a
person's position in this world so well ashis manner of leaving
it. You won't find poorWilliam Denner making a fuss. He is n't
AdmiralPenner's great-grandson for nothing. Yes, Ara-hella Forthe has
talked about her soul, and madearrangements for her funeral, every day
for a .week.That's where her father's money made in buttonscrops
out!""But aunt Deely," Helen said, "is n't there anylope for
Mr. Denner? Ashurst wouldn't be Ash-urst without Mr. Denner "" No, not
a bit," Mrs. Dale answered promptly."I suppose you'll go and see him
this morning,brother, and tell him ? ""Yes," replied Dr. Howe,
sighing, "I suppose Imust, but it does seem unnecessary to disturb
him.""He won't be disturbed," said Mrs. Dale stoutly;"he isn't that
kind. There, now," she added, asDr. Howe took up his hat and stick and
went gloom.ily out into the sunshine, "I should n't wonder if<pb
n="330"/>880         JOHN WARD, PREACHER.your father left it to
Gifford to break it to him, afterall. It is curious how Archibald
shrinks from it,and he a clergyman I I could do it, easily. Now,Lois,
you run along; I want to talk to Helen."But the rector had more
strength of purpose thanhis sister thought. His keen eyes blurred once
ortwice in his walk to the village, and his lip almosttrembled, but
'when he reached Mr. Denner's bed-side he had a firm hand to give his
friend. Thedoctor had left a note for him, saying the end wasnear, and
he read this before he went into the sick-room.Mr. Denner had failed
very perceptibly since theday before. He looked strangely little in
the greatbed, and his brown eyes had grown large and bright.But he
greeted the rector with courteous cordiality,under which his faint
voice faltered, and almostbroke." How are you to-day, Denner ? " his
friend said,sitting down on the edge of the bed, and taking thesick
man's hand in his big warm grasp."Thank you," replied Mr. Denner, with
laboredbreath, " I am doing nicely."" Has Giff been here this morning?
" asked Dr.Howe."Yes," the lawyer answered. "He has gonehome for an
hour. Mary takes excellent care of me,and I felt I was really keeping
him too much fromhis aunts. For his stay is limited, you know, and Iam
afraid I have been selfish in keeping him somuch with me.""No, no,"
the rector said, " it is a pleasure for him<pb n="331"/>JOBN WARD,
PREACHER.            Uito be with you; it is a pleasure for any of
us. Poorlittle Lois is dreadfully distressed about you, - shelongs to
come and nurse you herself; and Helen, -Helen came last night, you
know, - she wants to beof some use, too.""Oh, well, now, dear me,"
remonstrated Mr. Den-ner feebly, "Miss Lois must not have a
moment'suneasiness about me,- not a moment's. Pray tellher I am doing
nicely; and it is really of no conse-quence in the world, - not the
slightest."Then Mr. Denner began to speak of Gifford'skindness, and
how good every one in the village hadbeen to him; even Mary had
softened wonderfullyin the last few days, though of this the sick
mandid not speak, for it would seem to imply that Mazyhahe-Imi&U4

exceedingly kind and thoughtful. Hisgentleness - for I have been very
troublesome, doe-tor - has been wonderful. Like a woman's; atleast so
I should imagine."The rector had clasped his hands upon his stick,and
was looking intently at Mr. Denner, his lowerlip thrust out and his
eyebrows gathered in an ab-sent frown."William," he said suddenly,
"you've seen thedoctor this morning? "<pb n="332"/>882         J1HN

about getting here early; the nights seemquite long, and it is a
relief to see him early.""I have not seen him to-day," said
Dr. Howeslowly, "but yesterday he made me feel very anx-ious about
you. Yes, we were all quite anxious,William."The lawyer gave a little
start, and looked sharplyat his old friend; then he said, hesitating
slightly,"That - ah - that was yesterday, did I understandyou to say
?"Dr. Hewe leaned forward and took one of Mr.Denner's trembling little
hands in his, which wasstrong and firm. " Yes," he said gently, " but,
Wil-liam, my dear old friend, I am anxious still. I can-not help - I
cannot help fearing that - that" -"Stay," interrupted Mr. Denner, with
a visibleeffort at composure, "I-- I quite understand. Prayspare
yourself the pain of speaking of it, Archibald.You are very kind, but
- I quite understand."He put his hand before his eyes a moment,
andthen blindly stretched it out to his friend. Therector took it, and
held it hard in his own. Thetwo men were silent. Mr. Denner was the
first tospeak." It is very good in you to come and tell
me,Archibald. I fear it has discomposed you; it wasvery painful for
you. Pray do not allow yourself tofeel the slightest annoyance; it is
of no consequence,I- ah- assure you. But since we are on the sub.ject,
perhaps you will kindly mention - how -howsoon?"<pb n="333"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER            833"I hope, I trust," answered the rector
huskily, "-itmay not be for several days.""But probably," said
Mr. Denner calmly, "prob-ably - sooner ?"Dr. Howe bowed his head." Ah
- just so - just so. I - I thank you,Archibald."Suddenly the rector
drew a long breath, andstraightened himself, as though he had
forgottensomething. "It must come to us all, sooner orlater," he said
gently, " and if we have lived wellwe need not dread it. Surely you
need not, of allthe men I have ever known.""I have always endeavored,"
said Mr. Denner,in a voice which still trembled a little, "to
remem-ber that I was a gentleman."Dr. Howe opened his lips and shut
them again be-fore he spoke. "I-I meant that the trust in God,William,
of a Christian man, which is yours, must beyour certain support
now."The lawyer looked up, with a faint surprise dawn-ing in his
eyes. " Ah - you are very good to sayso, I'm sure," he replied
courteously.Dr. Howe moved his hands nervously, claspingand
re-clasping them upon the head of his stick." Yes, William," he said,
after a moment's silence,"that trust in God which leads us safely
through allthe dark places in life will not fail us at the end.The rod
and the staff still comfort us.""Ah - yes," responded Mr. Denner.The
rector gained confidence as he spoke. "Andyou must have that blessed
assurance of the love of<pb n="334"/>884        JOHN WARD,
PREACHERGod, William," he continued; "your life has beenso pure and
good. You must see in this visitationnot chastisement, but
mercy."Dr. Howe's hand moved slowly back to the bigpocket in one of
his black coat-tails, and brought outa small, shabby prayer-book." You
will let me read the prayers for the sick,"he continued gently, and
without waiting for a replybegan to say with more feeling than
Dr. Howe oftenput into the reading of the service, -" ' Dearly
beloved, know this, that Almighty Godis the Lod -of- life and death,
and of all things tcthem pertaining; as " -"Archibald," said
Mr. Denner faintly, "you wiBexcuse me, but this is not-not necessary,
as it were."Dr. Howe looked at him blankly, the prayer-bookclosing in
his hand." I mean," Mr. Denner added, "if you will allowme to say so,
the time for- for speaking thus haspassed. It is now, with me,
Archibald."There was a wistful look in his eyes as he spoke." I know,"
answered Dr. Howe tenderly, think-ing that the Visitation of the Sick
must wait, "butGod enters into now; the Eternal is our refuge, avery
present help in time of trouble."" Ah - yes " - said the sick man; "
but I shouldlike to approach this from our usual - point of view,if
you will be so good. I have every respect for youroffice, but would it
not be easier for us to speak of- of this as we have been in the habit
of speakingon all subjects, quite - in our ordinary way, as itwere?
You will pardon me, Archibald, if I sayanything else seems - ah -
unreal ? "<pb n="335"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER            885Dr. Howe
rose and walked to the window. Hestood there a few minutes, but the
golden June daywas dim, and there was a tightening in his throatthat
kept him silent. When he came back to thebedside, he stood looking
down at the sick man,without speaking. Mr. Denner was embarrassed."I
did not mean to pain you," he said."William," the rector answered,
"have I madereligion so worthless? Have I held it so weaklythat you
feel that it cannot help you now ? "" Oh, not at all," responded
Mr. Denner, "not atall. I have the greatest respect for it, - I fear I

clergyman took his place on the side of thebed, but he leaned his head
on his hand, and hiseyes were hidden.  "Ask me anything you will.Yet,

Dr. Howe's face." How can we tell ? " answered the rector. " Thatit is
infinitely good we can trust; 'Eye hath notseen, nor ear heard' " - He
stopped, for Mr. Den.ner shook his head with a fine sort of
impatience." If you please, doctor I"The rector was silent."I have
wondered about it often," the other con-tinued. " I have expected -

in his feeblevoice. "Think of that, doctor. I shall know morethan the
wisest man that lives, -I! I was never avery clever person, never very
wise; and yet, here isa knowledge which shall not be too wonderful

peering at thelight between the transparent fingers. "To think,"he
said slowly, with a puzzled smile, "to think thatthis is going to be

IThe rector could not escape the penetrating gazeof those strangely
bright brown eyes. He lookedinto them, and then wavered and turned
away." Do you ? " said the lawyer.The other put his hands up to his
face a moment."Ah! " he answered sharply, " I don't know - Ican't

tranquil satis-faction, "I supposed not,-I supposed not. Butwhen a man
gets where I am, it seems the one thingin the world worth being sure
of."Dr. Howe sat silently holding the lawyer's hand,and Mr. Denner
seemed to sink into pleasantthought. Once he smiled, with that

empty, blackened fireplace, where, on acharred log and a heap of gray
ashes, a single barof sunshine had fallen; his fiddle, lying on a heap
ofmanuscript music; the one or two formal portraitsof the women of his
family; and the large paintingof Admiral Denner in red coat and gold
lace. Oneach one he lingered with a loving, wondering gaze."'The place

on the table beside him, and, takingit up, looked long and earnestly
at the childish faceinside b ri of blackened pearls."I wonder " - he
said, and then stopped, layingit down again, with a little sigh. "Ah,
well, Ishall knowt It is only to wait."He did not seem to want any
answer; it wasenough to ramble on, filled with placid content,
be.tween dreams and waking, his hand held firm inthat of his old
friend. Afterwards, when Giffordcame in, he scarcely noticed that the
rector slippedaway. It was enough to fill his mist of dreams
withgentle wonderings and a quiet expectation. Oncehe said softly, "'

looked at him."Good Lord," he said, "ah - yes - yes - that isenough,

strange look onhis face. He. answered his daughter briefly, that<pb

then, going into hislibrary, he moved a table from in front of the
door,which always stood hospitably open, and shut andlocked it."What's
the matter with the doctor?" askedDick Forsythe, lounging up to the
rectory porch, hishands in his pockets and his hat on the back of
hishead. "I walked behind him all the way from thevillage; he looked
as though some awful thing hadhappened, and he walked as if he was
possessed.""Oh, Mr. Denner's worse," Lois answered
tear-fully.Mr. Forsythe had found her on the porch, and, inspite of

Howe?"<pb n="340"/> 840        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.Lois felt herself
grow white. A sudden flash ofhope came into her mind, and then
fear. What didit mean ? Was he going because he dared not askher, or
would his mother tell him that he wouldsurely succeed ? Oh, her
promise IHer breath came quick, and Mr. Forsythe saw it."Yes," he
said, stammering with embarrassment,"I-I fear I shall have to go- ah-

caughtsight of Helen coming serenely across the lawn."There's my
cousin," said Lois; "let us go andmeet her.""Oh, yes, do! " Dick
answered fervently; andpresently greeted Helen with a warmth which
madeher give Lois a quick, questioning look from underher staight
brows, and sent her thoughts with a flashof sympathy to Gifford
Woodhouse.When the young man had gone, Helen said toher cousin, "
Lois, dear - ? "But Lois only threw herself into her arms withsuch
floods of tears Helen could do nothing but tryto calm her.Lois was not
the only one who heard of Dick'splan of leaving Ashurst with mingled
joy and dread.Gifford knew that Mr. Forsythe was going away,and seeing
the distress in Lois's face, in these saddays, he put it down to grief
at his departure. Itwas easier to give himself this pain than to
reflectthat Lois was trembling with anxiety about Mr. Den.ner, and was
still full of alarm for Mrs. Forsythe."If that puppy neglects her," he
thought, "if she<pb n="341"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
841cares for him, and if he grieves her, I vow I '11 havea word to say
to him! Now why should she cry, ifit isn't because he 's going away ?
"Though he was glad Ashurst would see the last ofthis objectionable
young man, Lois's grief turned hisgladness into pain, and there was no
hope for him-self in his relief at Dick's departure. Miss Deborah,with
the best intentions in the world, had made thatimpossible.The day
after Dr. Howe had told Mr. Dennerthat he must die, Gifford had come
home for a fewminutes. He had met the little ladies walking armin arm
up and down one of the shady paths of theirwalled garden. Miss Ruth
still held her trowel inher hand, and her shabby gloves were stained
by theweeds she had pulled up. " Oh, there you are, dear Giff," she
cried; "wewere just looking for you. Pray, how is Mr. Den-ner
?"Gifford's serious face answered her without words,and none of the
group spoke for a moment. ThenGifford said, "It cannot last much
longer. Yousee, he suffers very much at night; it does n't seemas
though he could live through another."" Oh, dear me," said Miss Ruth,
wiping her eyeswith the frankest grief, "you don't say so I ""Have n't
you just heard him say so, sister ?"asked Miss Deborah, trying to
conceal an unsteadylip by a show of irritation. "Do pay attention."" I
did, dear Deborah," returned Miss Ruth, " butI cannot bear to believe
it."" Your believing it, or not, does n't alter the case,<pb

the syllabub yesterday,Gifford ?"" He could n't eat it," her nephew
answered, " butWillie seemed to enjoy it."" Poor child," cried Miss
Deborah, full of sympa-thy, "I 'm glad he had anything to comfort
him.But Gifford, do you really feel sure Mr. Dennercannot recover ?
""Too sure," replied the young man, with a sigh."There 's no doubt
about it, - no doubt what-ever?" Miss Ruth inquired anxiously.Her
nephew looked at her in surprise. "I wishthere were."" Well, then,
sister ? " said Miss Ruth.Miss Deborah nodded and sighed. " I - I
thinkso,' she answered, and the two sisters turned to gointo the
house, importance and grief on both theirfaces; but Miss Deborah
suddenly recollected some-thing she wished to say.' Do you know,
Gifford," she said, letting MissRuth get a little ahead of her, " I
really think thatthat young Forsythe is without proper feeling; andI
am surprised at dear Lois, too. I cannot say--Iam not at liberty to
say anything more, but at sucha time "-Gifford gave her a quick
look. "What do youmean, aunt Deborah ? "But his aunt seemed reluctant
to speak, andlooked after Miss Ruth, who was walking slowly upthe
mossy path, flecked here and there by patchesof sunshine that fell
through the flickering leavesabove her. When she was quite out of
hearing,Miss Deborah said mysteriously, -<pb n="343"/>J'.ONt WARD,
PREACHER          848"Well, perhaps I might tell you; you are notlike
any one else. Ruth thinks I cannot keep a se-cret, but then you know
your dear aunt Ruth doesnot discriminate. You are quite different from
thepublic.""Well, and what is it?" he. said impatiently,and with a
horrible foreboding."Why, it is settled," answered Miss Deborah;"it is
all settled between Lois and young Forsythe.Arabella Forsythe told
Adele Dale, and Adele Daletold me; quite privately, of course. It was
n't to bementioned to any one; but it was only natural tospeak of it
to dear Ruth and to you."Gifford did not wait to hear more. " I must
go,"he said hurriedly. "I must get back to Mr. Den-ner," and he was
off."Oh, dear GiffI" cried Miss Deborah; takinglittle mining steps as
she tried to run after him." You won't mention it? You won't speak of
it toany one, or say I- I" -"No! " he called back, -" no, of course
not.""Not even to your aunt Ruth would be best "But he did not hear
her, and Miss Deborah wentback to the house, annoyed at Gifford,
because ofher own indiscretion.Miss Ruth had gone to her own bedroom,
andsome time after Miss Deborah had disappeared inhers, the younger
sister emerged, ready to go to Mr.Denner's. Miss Ruth had dressed with
great care, yet witha proper sense of fitness, considering the
occasion.She wore a soft, old-fashioned lawn with small/<pb
n="344"/>844         JOHN WARD, PREACHERbunches of purple flowers
scattered. over it, andgathered very full about the waist. But, before
theswinging mirror of her high bureau, she thought itlooked too light
and bright for so sad a visit, and sotrotted up-stairs to the garret,
and, standing on tip.toe by a great chest of drawers, opened one
withmuch care, that the brass rings might not clatter onthe oval
plates under them, and disturb Miss Debo-rah. The drawer was sweet
with lavender and sweetclover, and, as she lifted from its wrappings
of sil-vered paper a fine black lace shawl, some pale, brit-tle
rose-leaves fell out upon the floor. That shawl,thrown about her
shoulders, subdued her dress, shethought; and the wide-brimmed black
hat of fineNeapolitan straw, tied with soft black ribbons be-neath her
little round chin, completed the look ofhalf mourning.Miss Deborah
answered her sister's knock at herbedroom door in person. She was not
dressed tomake calls, for she wore a short gown over her redflannel
petticoat, and on her feet were large andcomfortable list
slippers. Miss Deborah's eyes werered, and she sniffed once,
suspiciously."Why, Ruth Woodhouse!" she cried. "Haveyou no sense?
Don't, for pity's sake, dress as thoughyou had gone into mourning for
the man, when he'salive. And it is very forward of you, too, for
ifeither of us did it (being such old friends), it shouldbe I, for I
am nearer his age."But Miss Ruth did not stop for discussion. "Areyou
not going ?" she said." No," Miss Deborah answered, "we'd better
go<pb n="345"/>JON' WARD, PREACHER.           845to-morrow. You
might just inquire of Mary, thisafternoon, but we will call
to-morrow. It is morebecoming to put it off as long as possible."Miss
Ruth had her own views, and she consentedwith but slight demur, and
left Miss Deborah tospend the rest of the afternoon in a big chair
bythe open window, with Baxter's "Saints' Rest"upon her knee.When
Gifford had gone back to the lawyer's house,he found the little
gentleman somewhat brighter.Mary had put a clean white counterpane on
the bed,and buttoned a fresh valance around it; and on thesmall table
at his side Willie had placed a big bunchof gillyflowers and lupins,
with perhaps less thoughtof beauty than of love." Gifford," he said,
"I am glad to see you. Andhow, if you please, did you leave your aunt?
Ihope you conveyed to her my thanks for her thought-fulness, and my
apologies' for detaining you aswell?""Yes, sir," the young man
answered, "I did.They are both rejoiced that I can be of any
ser-vice."Gifford had come to the side of the bed, and,slipping his
strong young arm under Mr. Denner'shead, lifted him that he might take
with greaterease the medicine he held in a little
slender-stemmedglass.  "Ah," said Mr. Denner, between a sighand a
groan, as Gifford laid him down again,"how gentle you are! There is a
look in yourface, sometimes, of one of your aunts, sir; not, Ithink,
Miss Deborah. I have thought much, sine<pb n="346"/>846        JOHN
WARD, PREACHERI- I knew my condition, Gifford, of my wish thatyour
aunt Deborah should have the miniature of mylittle sister. I still
wish it. It is not easy for meto decide a momentous question, but,
having decided,I am apt to be firm. Perhaps - unreasonably firm.I
would not have you imagine I had, in any way,changed my mind, as it
were -yet I have recurred,occasionally, in my thoughts, to Miss
Ruth. Ishould not wish to seem to slight Miss Ruth, Gif-ford ?""She
could not feel it so, I know," the young mananswered.But Mr. Denner's
thoughts apparently dwelt uponit, for twice again, in intervals of
those wakingdreams, or snatches of sleep, he said, quite to him-self,
" It is decided; yet it would seem marked topass over Miss Ruth." And
again he murmured,"I should not wish to slight Miss Deborah's
sister."Later in the afternoon he wakened, with a bright,clear look in
his face. " It occurs to me," he said,"that I have another portrait,
of no value at allcompared with the miniature (and of course it
isbecoming that the miniature should go to Miss Deb-orah), which I
might give to Miss Ruth. Becauseshe is the sister of Miss Deborah, you
understand,Gifford. Perhaps you will be so good as to hand methe
square package from that same little drawer?Here is the key."Gifford
brought it: it was a daguerreotype case,much worn and frayed along the
leather back, andwithout the little brass hooks which used to fas-ten
it; instead, a bit of ribbon had been tied about<pb n="347"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER            847it to keep it closed. Mr. Denner did not
open it;he patted the faded green bow with his little thinfingers." It
is a portrait of myself," he said. 4'It be,longed to my mother. I had
it taken for her whenI was but a boy; yes, I was only thirty. She
tiedthe ribbon; it has never been opened since."He put it down on the
stand, by the miniature,under the gillies and lupins.So it happened
that when Miss Ruth Woodhousecame to inquire for him, she had been in
Mr. Den-ner's thoughts all the afternoon. "Not," he keptassuring
himself, "not that I have changed mymind,--not at all,--but she is
Miss Deborah'ssister."It was after five when Mary pushed the
librarydoor open softly, and looked in, and then beckonedmysteriously
to Gifford."It is your aunt; she wants to know how he is.You 'd better
come and tell her."Mr. Denner heard her, and turned his head
feeblytowards the door. " Miss Woodhouse, did you say,Mary ? Which
Miss Woodhouse, if you please?"" It's the young one," said Mary, who
spoke rela-tively."Miss Ruth?" Mr. Denner said, with an eagerquaver in
his voice. "Gifford, do you think -would you have any objection,
Gifford, to permit-ting me to see your aunt? That is, if she would
beso obliging and kind as to step in for a moment ?"" She will be glad
to, I know," Gifford answered."Let me go and bring her."<pb
n="348"/>848        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.Miss Ruth was in a flutter of
grief and excite.ment. "I'll come, of course.  I-I had ratherhoped I
might see him; but what will Deborah say?Yet I can't but think it 's
better for him not to seetwo people at once."Mr. Denner greeted her by
a feeble flourish ofhis hand. "Oh, dear me, Mr. Denner," said she,half
crying, in spite of Gifford's whispered caution,"I 'm so distressed to
see you so ill, indeed I am."" Oh, not at all," responded Mr. Denner,
but hisvoice had a strange, far-away sound in his ears, andhe tried to
speak louder and more confidently, -"not at all. You are very good to
'come, ma'am;"and then he stopped to remember what it was hehad wished
to say.Miss Ruth was awed into silence, and there wasa growing anxiety
in Gifford's face." Ah - yes " -Mr. Denner began again, with aflash of
strength in his tone, " I wished to ask youif you would accept -
accept" - he reached to-wards the little table, but he could not find
theleather case until Gifford put it into his hand - "ifyou would be
so good as to accept this; and will youopen it, if you please, Miss
Ruth?"She did so, with trembling fingers. It was adaguerreotype of
Mr. Denner; the high neckelothand the short-waisted, brass-buttoned
coat and waist-coat showed its age, as well as the dimness of theglass
and the fresh boyish face of the young man ofthirty."What - what was I
speaking of, Gifford? " saidMr. Denner.<pb n="349"/>-JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.           849"You gave my aunt Ruth the picture, sir.""Oh,
yes, just so, just so. I merely wished toadd that I desired to present
it to Miss Deborah'ssister, - though it is of no value, not the
leastvalue; but I should be honored by its acceptance.And perhaps you
will be good enough to -to con.vey the assurance of my esteem to Miss
Deborah.And Gifford - my friend Gifford is to give her theminiature of
my little sister.""Yes," said Miss Ruth, who was crying softly."Not
that I have - have changed my mind," saidMr. Denner, "but it is not
improper, I am sure,that Miss Deborah's sister should give me--if
shewill be so good -her hand, that I may say good-by?"Miss Ruth did
not quite understand, until Giffordmotioned to her to lay her little
hand in that feebleone which was groping blindly towards
her.Mr. Denner's eyes were very dim."I - I am very happy," he
murmured. " I thankyou, Ruth;" and then, a moment after, "If youwill
excuse me, I think I will rest for a few mo-ments."Still holding Miss
Ruth's hand, he turned hishead in a weary way towards the light, and
softlyclosed his eyes.Mr. Denner rested.<pb n="350"/>CHAPTER

Howe, in those first sad days,that her cousin was with her, or the
reaction fromthe excitement of anxiety into hopeless grief mighthave
been even more prostrating than it was. Allthe comfort and tenderness
Helen could give her inher helpless self-reproach were hers, though
she aswell as Gifford never sought to make the sorrowless by evading

"Lois must cometo see me for a while; she does need a change

can't she come as soon as she isstrong enough to travel ? "And so it

Lockhaven in about<pb n="351"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            861a
fortnight. Business, which never reached Mr. Den.ner in Mercer, had
been offered the young lawyer,and he had been willing to stay in
Ashurst a littlelonger, though he had told himself he was a fool.Lois
looked forward to the visit with feverishanxiety. Mr. Forsythe,
perhaps to please his mother,but certainly with rather an ill grace,
had lingeredin Ashurst. But he had not been very much at therectory;
perhaps because it was not a time to make-visits, or be careless and
light-hearted, while littleMr. Denner was fading out of life, and his
motherfelt herself trembling on the edge of the grave. This,at least,
was what Mrs. Forsythe said to Lois morethan once, with an anxious,
troubled look, whichperhaps explained more than her words did.She had
acepted very complacentl Lois's pro-jag_     f,_ Qf joy and gratitude
that she was no.j.t     se-   expl_ ressed it, in immediate danger,;,
.s ahe did not apparently feel that that altereda all the conditions
of the promise Lois had givenher, which was evidently a very precious
thing. Nordid Lois remonstrate against being held by it. Shefelt she
deserved any grief that came to her, and itwould have been cowardly,
she thought, to shrinkfrom what she had undertaken merery because
shehad been so far mercifully spared the grief of Mrs.Forsythe's
death.  And who could'tell that shewould live, even yet? Certainly
Mrs. Forsytheherself seemed to consider her recovery a matter ofgrave
doubt, and Lois's anxieties were quick toagree with her.So she went
about with a white face and eyes from<pb n="352"/>852        JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.which all the careless gayety had gone, simply bear.ing
her life with a dull pain and in constant fear.Gifford saw it, and
misunderstood it; he thought,in view of what Miss Deborah had told him
andwhat he knew of Mr. Forsythe's plans, that it wasnatural for Lois
to look unhappy. Anxieties arevery misleading; the simple explanation
of remorsefor her carelessness did not come into Gifford's mindat
all.One afternoon,- it was the day following Mr.Denner's funeral,-
Gifford thought this all over,and ried to see what his life offered
him for the fu-ture, now that the last faint hope of winning
Lois'slove had died. Mr. Denner's will had been readthat morning in
his dining-room, with only Dr.Howe and Mary and Willie present, while
the rainbeat persistently against the windows, and made theroom so
dark that Gifford had to call for a candle,and hold the paper close to
his eyes to see to read.Willie had shivered, and looked steadfastly
underthe table, thinking, while his little heart beat suf-focatingly,
that he was glad there were no prayersafter a will. When that was
over, and Dr. Howehad carried Willie back with him to be cheered
andcomforted at the rectory, Gifford had devoted him.self to disposing
of such small effects as Mr. Dennerhad left as personal bequests.They
were not very many. A certain bamboo rodwith' silver mountings and a
tarnished silver reel,were for Dr. Howe; and there were a few books
tobe sent to Mr. Dale, and six bottles of Tokay, '52,for Colonel
Drayton. There was a mourning-ring,<pb n="353"/>JOBN WARD, PREACHER.
853which had been Mr. Denner's father's, for a distantcousin, who was
further comforted by a few hun-dred dollars, but all the rest was for
Willie.Gifford had felt, as he sat at Mr. Denner's writ-ing-desk and
touched some small possessions, all thepathetic powerlessness of the
dead. How Mr. Den-ner had treasured his little valueless
belongings!There was a pair of silver shoe-buckles, wrapped inchamois
skin, which the little gentleman had faith-fully kept bright and
shining; they had belonged tohis grandfather, and Mr. Denner could
rememberwhen they had been worn, and the knee-breeches,and the great
bunch of seals at the fob. Perhaps,when his little twinkling brown
eyes looked at them,he felt again the thrill of love and fear for
thestately gentleman who had awed his boyhood. Therewas a look of
faded gray hair in a yellow old en-velope, on which was written, in
the lawyer's precisehand, "My mother's hair," and a date which
seemedto Gifford very far back. There were one or tworelics of the
little sister: a smallogreen morocco shoe,which had buttoned about her
ankle, and a pair ofgold shoulder-straps, and a narrow pink ribbon
sashthat had grown yellow on the outside fold.There was a pile of
neatly kept diaries, withfaithful accounts of the weather, and his
fishing ex-cursions, and the whist parties; scarcely more thanthis,
except a brief mention of a marriage or a death.Of course there were
letters; not very many, butall neatly labeled with the writer's name
and thedate of their arrival. These Gifford burned, andthe blackened
ashes were in the wide fireplace, be.<pb n="354"/>864         JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.hind a jug of flowers, on which hScould hear, downthe
chimney, the occasional splash of a raindrop.There was one package of
letters where the namewas "Gertrude;" there were but few of these,
and,had Gifford looked, he would have seen that the lastone, blistered
with tears, said that her father hadforbidden further correspondence,
and bade him,with the old epistolary formality from which noteven love
could escape, "an eternal farewell."  Butthe tear-stains told more
than the words, at least ofMr. Denner's heart, if not of pretty
sixteen-year-old Gertrude's. These were among the first to beburned;
yet how Mr. Denner had loved them, eventhough Gertrude, running away
with her dancing-master, and becoming the mother of a family ofboys,
had been dead these twenty years, and theproverb had pointed to Miss
Deborah Woodhouse ISome papers had to be sealed, and the few piecesof
silver packed, ready to be sent to the bank inMercer, and then Gifford
had done.He was in the library, from which the bed hadbeen moved, and
which was in trim and dreary or-der. The rain still beat fitfully upon
the windows,and the room was quite dark. Gifford had pushedthe
writing-desk up to theewindow for the last rayof light, and now he sat
there, the papers all ar-ranged and nothing more to do, yet a vague,
tenderloyalty to the little dead gentleman keeping him.And sitting,
leaning his elbows on the almost un-spotted sheet of blue
blotting-paper which coveredthe open flap of the desk, he fell into
troubledthinking.<pb n="355"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            855"Of
course," he said to himself, " she 's awfullydistressed about
Mr. Denner, but there's somethingmore than that. She seems to be-
watching forsomething all the time; expecting that fellow,,deyond a
doubt. And why he is not there oftenerHeaven only knows ! And to think
of his going offon his confounded business at such a time, when sheis
in such trouble I If only for a week; he has no'right to go and leave
her. His business is to stayand comfort her. Then, when he is at the
rectory,what makes him pay her so little attention? If hewas n't a
born cad, somebody ought to thrash him.for his rudeness. If Lois had a
brother I- But Isuppose he does not know any better, and then
Loisloves him. Where's Helen's theory now, I wonder?Oh, I suppose she
thinks he is all right. I'd liketo ask her, if I had n't promised aunt
Deborah."Just here, Gifford heard the garden gate closewith a bang,
and some one came down the path,holding an umbrella against the
pelting rain, so thathis face was hidden. But Gifford knew who it
was,even before Mary, shuffling asthmatically throughthe hall, opened
the door to say, "Mr. Forsythe'shere to see you."" Ask him to come
in," he said, pushing his chairback from the secretary, and lifting
the flap to lockit as he spoke.Dick Forsythe came in, shaking his
dripping um.brella, and saying with a good-natured laugh, "Jove what a
wet day I You need a boat to get throughthe garden. Your aunt--the old
one, I think itwas -asked me, if I was passing, to bring you

afraid you had none, and wouldtake cold."He laughed again, as though
he knew how amus-ing such nonsense was, and then had a gleam of
sur-prise at Giffordclgravity."I'd gone to her house with a message
from mymother," he continued; "you know we get off to-morrow. Mother's
decided to go, too, so of coursethere are a good many things to do,
and the old ladyis so strict about Ashurst customs I've had to goround
and ' return thanks' to everybody."Gifford had taken the parcel from
Dick's hand,and thanked him briefly. The young man, how.ever, seemed
in no haste to go.' I don't know which is damper, this room or
out-of-doors," he said, seating himself in Mr. Denner'sbig chair,
-though Gifford was standing - andlooking about in an interested way;
"must havebeen a gloomy house to live in. Wonder he nevergot
married. Perhaps he couldn't find anybodywilling to stay in such a
hole, - it's so confound-edly damp. He died in here, didn't he?"
Thiswas in a lower voice." Yes," Gifford answered."Should n't think
you 'd stay alone," Dick wenton; "it is awfully dismal. I see he
cheered him-self once in a while." -He pointed to a tray, whichheld a
varied collection of pipes and a dingy tobaccopouch of buckskin with a
border of colored porcepine quills."Yes, Mr. Denner smoked," Gifford
was constrained to say.<pb n="357"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
857" I think," said Dick, clapping his hand upon hisbreast-pocket, "
I'll have a cigar myself. It bracesone up this weather." He struck a
match on thesole of his boot, forgetting it was wet, and
vowinggood-naturedly that he was an ass. "No objection,I suppose ? "
he added, carefully biting off the endof his cigar."I should prefer,"
Gifford replied slowly, "thatyou did not smoke. There is an
impropriety aboutit, which surely you must appreciate."Dick looked at
him, with the lighted match flaringbluely between his fingers. "Lord!
" he said, "howmany things are improper in Ashurst I But just asyou
say, of course." He put his cigar back in anelaborate case, and blew
out the match, throwing itinto the fireplace, among the flowers. "The
ddg&trian wsmoked himsel, though.":Oi-'d's  face flushed slowly, and
he spoke witheven more deliberation than usual. "Since youhave decided
not to smoke, you must not let medetain you. I am very much obliged
for the pack-age.""You 're welcome, I'm sure," Dick said. "Yes,I
suppose I'd better be getting along. Well, I '1say good-by,
Mr. Woodhouse. I suppose I sha' n'tsee you before I go ? And Heaven
knows when I'11be in Ashurst again! "Gifford started. " Sit down a
moment," he said,waving aside Dick's hand. "Surely you are notleaving
Ashurst for any length of time ? '" Length of time ? " answered the
other, laughing."Well, I rather think so.  I expect to go abroadnext
month."<pb n="358"/>858        JOHN WARD, PREACBERA curious desire
came into Gifford Woodhouse'sstrong hands to take this boy by the
throat, andshake him until his ceaseless smile was torn to
pieces.Instead of that, however, he folded his arms, andstood looking
down at his companion in silence.Dick had seated himself again, and
was twirlinghis wet umbrella round and round by the shiny endof one of
the ribs. " Yes," he said, " this is a longgood-by to
Ashurst.""M*. Forsythe," said Gifford, with an edge ofanger ii his
voice which could not have escaped evena more indifferent ear than
Dick's, "may I ask ifDr. Howe knows of your plans ? Dick looked up,
with a sudden ugly shadow com-ing across the sunny brightness of his
face. "Idon't know what I 've done to deserve this concernon your
part, Mr. Woodhouse; but, since you ask,I have no objection to saying
that Dr. Howe doesnot particularly interest himself in my
affairs. Idon't know whether he's aware of my plans, and Icare
less."He rose, and stood grasping his wet umbrella mid.ways, looking
defiantly into Gifford's face. It wassingular how instantly, in some
wordless way, he ap.preciated that he had been blamed.Gifford began to
speak in the slow, measured tonewhich showed how he was guarding his
words." You may not care for his interest," he said, " butyou can
scarcely expect that he would not noticeyour absence.""I cannot see
that my movements are of so muchimportance to Dr. Howe," Dick
answered, "and he<pb n="359"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHERP
859certainly has never taken it upon himself to meddlein my affairs to
the extent of asking me aboutthem.""Nevertheless," said Gifford, with
ominous gen-tleness, " he must feel - surprise at your departure.That
your business should take you away at thistime, Mr. Forsythe, is
unfortunate."" I know my business, at least," cried the otherloudly,
his voice trembling with anger, "and I'mcapable of attending to it
without suggestions fromyou   I '11 trouble you to speak plainly,
instead ofhinting. What right have you to question my leav-ing Ashurst
? ""No right," Gifford said calmly. "Why don't you speak out like a
man ?" For--y.tshe demanded with a burst of rage, striking the.i

""Be silent " Gifford said between his teeth."Gentlemen do not
introduce the name of a womaninto their discussions. You forgot
yourself. It isunnecessary to pursue this subject. I have nothingmore
to say.""But I have more to say. Who gave you theright to speak to me?
The lady herself? Shemust be indeed distressed to choose you for a
mes-senger."Gifford did not answer; for a moment the darkroom was very
still, except for the beating rain andthe tapping of the ivy at the
south window.<pb n="360"/>860        JOHN WARD, PREACHER"Or
perhaps," he went on, a sneer curling hishandsome mouth, "you will
comfort her yourself,instead? Well, you're welcome."Gifford's hands
clenched on the back of the chairin front of him. " Sir," he said, "
this place protectsyou, and you know it."But Dick Forsythe was beside
himself with anger.He laughed insultingly. "I'll not detain you
anylonger. Doubtless you will wish to go to the rec-tory to-night. But
I'm afraid, even though I'mobliging enough to leave Ashurst, you will
haveno"-      - He did -not finish his sentenee. GiffordWoodhouse's
hand closed like a vise upon his collar.There were no words. Dick's
struggles were as use-less as beating against a rock; his maddest
effortscould not shake off that relentless hand. Giffordhalf pushed,
half carried, him to the door, and inanother moment Dick Forsythe
found himself flunglike a snapping cur in the mud and rain of
Mr. Den-ner's garden.He gathered himself up, and saw Gifford
standingin the doorway, as though to offer him a chance ofrevenge."
Damn you!" he screamed, furious with passion." I'11 pay you for this !
I -I" -  He choked withrage, and shook his fist at the motionless
figure onthe steps. Then, trembling with impotent fury,oaths stumbling
upon his lips, he turned and rushedinto the gathering darkness.Gifford
watched him, and then the door swungshut, and he went back to
Mr. Denner's library.His breath was short, and he was tingling with
pas<pb n="361"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER            861sion, but he had
no glow of triumph. " I've beena fool," he said, -" I 've been a fool
I I've madeit worse for her. The hound !"But in spite of his genuine
contrition, there wasa subtile joy. " He does not love her," he
thought," and she will forget him."Yet, as he sat there in
Mr. Denner's dark library,filled with remorse and unabated rage as
well, hebegan to realize that he had been meddlesome; andhe was stung
with a sudden sense that it was nothonorable to have pushed his
questions upon For-sythe. Gifford's relentless justice overtook
him.Had he not given Forsythe the right to insult him ?Would not he
have protected himself against anyman's prying? .Gifford blushed hotly
in the dark-ness. "But not to use Lois's name, -  not that-!Nothing
could justify the insult to her!"Mary came in to lock up, and started
with frightat the sight of the dark, still figure. "Lord I it 'sa
ghost! " she cried shrilly."I am here, Mary," he said wearily. "I'm
goinghome now."And so he did, walking doggedly through thestorm, with
his head bent and his hands in hispockets, forgetful of Miss Deborah's
thoughtfulnessin the way of rubbers, and only anxious to avoid
anykindly interruption from his aunts, which their anx-iety concerning
damp clothes might occasion. Buthe could not escape them. Miss Deborah
met himat the door with a worried face. " My dear boyI "she said, "no
umbrella? Pray go to bed directly,and let me bring you a hot
drink. You will surely<pb n="362"/>862        JOHN WARD,
PREACHERhave a cough to-morrow." But the little lady cameback to the
parlor with an aggrieved face, for hehad answered her with quiet
determination not tobe fussed over. The sisters heard him walk
quicklyup-stairs and lock his door. They looked at eachother in
astonishment." He feels it very much," said Miss Ruth."Yes," returned
Miss Deborah; "he has beensorting the papers all the afternoon. I must
go andsee Willie to-morrow.""Oh, I '11 do that," Miss Ruth answered. "
I can-,not help feeling that it is - my place.""t Not alt aI," replied
Miss Deborah firmly; "theminiature shows plainly his sentiments
towards me.I know he would wish me to look after Willie. In-deed, I
feel it a sacred duty."Miss Deborah moved her hands
nervously. Mr.Denner's death was too recent for it to be possibleto
speak of him without agitation."Well," said Miss Ruth, "perhaps, after
all, youare right, in a way. The miniature is childish. Ofcourse a
portrait of himself has a far deeper mean-ing.""Ruth Woodhouse," cried
the other, "I'mashamed of you   Didn't you tell me yourself hesaid it
was of no value? And you know how muchhe thought of the little sister
I ""But that was his modesty," said Miss Rutheagerly. However, both
ladies parted for the nightwith unaltered convictions, and the younger
sister,opening the daguerreotype for one last look by herbedroom
candle, murmured to herself, "I wonder<pb n="363"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.           863what Deborah would think if she knew he
said'Ruth'?"The Forsythes went away the next morning.Perhaps it was
the early start which prevented Dickfrom seeing Gifford again, and
finishing the so sum-marily ended quarrel, or possibly it was
recollectionof the weight of Gifford Woodhouse's hand. Yethe thought
he had found a means of revenge.In spite of the rain, he had gone to
the rectory.Helen was writing to her husband, and Dr. Howewas
reading. " You 'l have to see him in the parlor,Lois," her father
said, looking at her over his paper,as Sally announced
Mr. Forsythe."Oh, father !" she said."Nonsense," replied the rector
impatiently, "youknow him well enough to receive him alone. I can'te
intrruplted. BRun along, child.""Will you come in, Helen, dear? " she
pleaded."Yes," Helen said, glancing at her with absenteyes; it was
hard to leave the intricacies of a theo-logical argument to think of a
girl's lover. "I'llcome soon."But in a letter to John she forgot every
one else,and when Lois went tremblingly out of the roomboth the rector
and his niece lost themselves in theirown interests."Good-evening,
Miss Lois," Dick said, comingtowards her with extended hand.She could
hardly hear her answer for her beatingheart." I came to say good-by,"
he went on, his brightblue eyes fastened angrily upon her; but she
didnot see him.<pb n="364"/>864        JOHN WARD, PREACHER"You go
to-morrow? " she faltered."Yes," he answered; "but I could not
leaveAshurst without-- one more look at the rectory."Lois did not
speak. Oh, why did not Helencome ?" A different scene this from that
night after thedinner party," Dick thought, looking at her down.cast
eyes and trembling hands with cruel exultationin his face. "If I cared
I"r     " How I have adored Ashurst I " he said slowly,wondering how
far it would be safe to go. "I havebee verLby happyJhere. I hope Ihal
be still happier, Lois?" Still she did not answer, but she pressed her
handshard together. Dick looked at her critically." When I come again,
- oh, when I come again,-then, if you have not forgotten me - Tell
meyou will not forget me, until I come again ?" -Lois shook her
head. Dick had drawn her to aseat, and his eager face was close to
hers."I said good-by to the rector this afternoon," hesaid, "but I
felt I must see you again, alone."Lois was silent."I wonder if you
know," he went on, " how oftenI shall think of Ashurst, and of you?"He
had possessed himself of her hand, which wascold and rigid, but lay
passively in his. She hadturned her face away from him, and in a
stunned,helpless- way was waiting for the question whichseemed on his
lips. "And you know what mythoughts will be," he said meaningly. "You
makeAshurst beautiful."<pb n="365"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
865He saw the color, which had rushed to her facewhen he had begun to
talk, fade slowly; even herlips were white. But she never looked at
him." You were not always kind to me," he continued,but when I come
back" -She turned with a sudden impulse toward him,her breath quick
and her lips unsteady. "Mr. For-sythe," she said, "I" -But he had
risen. "I suppose I must go," hesaid in his natural voice, from which
sentiment hadfled, and left even a suggestion of alarm. "It islate,

something. We never canforget your kindness, Miss Lois. Good-by,

gone in another moment. Loisstoodreathless. hse put her hands up to
her head,as though to quiet the confusion of her thoughtsWhatdid it
mea ? Was it only to let her see thathe still loved her? Was he coming
again?When Helen, remembering her duties, came intothe parlor, it was
deserted, and Lois was facing hermisery and fright in her own room,
while Dick For-sythe, raging homeward through the rain, was say-ing to
himself, "I've put an end to your prospects IShe'll wait for me, if it
is six years. It is just aswell she does n't know I'm going abroad. I

visit ended.I- must go," she said, smiling at Dr. Howe'srailings. '
"I 'eN t aty- away frfm  htoe anylonger. And you'll come ooh, Lois
dear I"     -Even daily letters from John had not saved herfrom
homesickness. They were a comfort, eventhough they were filled with
pleadings and prayersthat, for her soul's sake, she would see the
error ofher belief. Such tenderness struggled through thepages of
argument, Helen would lay her cheekagainst them, and say softly, "I'll
come home toyou soon, dear."One of these last letters had entreated
her to writeimmediately upon its receipt, and answer it pointby
point. She did so, saying at the last, "Now letus drop the whole
subject. I will never, as longas I have reason, believe this terrible
doctrine,-never. So why need we ever speak of it again?I know it is
your fear of eternity which leads youto try to make me believe it,
but, dearest, if eter-nity depends on this, it is already settled; let
usjust be glad together while we can, in this beautifultime. Oh, I
shall soon be home; I can think ofnothing else."<pb n="367"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER              867And she counted the hours until she
could start.When the morning came, with its clear June sky,and great
white clouds lying dreamily behind thehills, her face was running over
with gladness, inspite of her sympathy for Lois's grief." How happy
you look " Lois said .wistfully, asshe sat watching Helen put on her
bonnet beforethe swinging mirror in its white and gold frame, onher
dressing-table.Helen had not known how her eyes were -smiling,and she
looked with quick compunction at Lois'swhite face. "I shall see John
so soon," she an-swered contritely. "I can't help it.""I shall miss
you awfully," Lois went on, leaningher forehead against the edge of
the bureau, andknotting the long linen fringe of the cover withnervous
little fingers."But think how soon I'll have you in Lockhaven,dear;
and you will be a little stronger then, andhappier, too," Helen said,
brightly.'or Lois was so worn and tired that a less activeperson would
have called herself ill; as it was, shewas not able to bear the long
ride to Mercer andback, and Helen was to go alone, for Dr. Howe hadto
go out of Ashurst a little way, to perform a mar-riage
ceremony."You'll have rain before the day is over, mydear," he said,
as he put her into the carriage, "andthat will make it better
traveling, no dust. It's ashame that I should have to go in the other
direc-tion. Why could n't those people get married to-morrow instead
of to-ay, I should like to know?<pb n="368"/>868         JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.Or why could n't you stay twenty-four hours longer ?Could not
stand it to be away from home anotherminute I Well, well, that 's
right,--that 's the wayit should be. Hope Ward is as anxious to get
youback as you are to run off and leave us; perhaps hedoes n't want
you, young lady." The rector laughedat Helen's confident look. "I
don't half like yourgoing to Mercer by yourself," he added."Oh, I
shall get along very well," said Helencheerily: " I have no doubt
there 'll be a letter forme from John at the postffice, and I will get
it aswr'g-through the village    - I'l hve that to read."1" It will
hardly last all the way to Lockhaven,"Lois commented." Oh, yes, it
will," answered Helen, with a rippleof joy in her tone, which, for
pure gladness, was al-most laughter. " You don't know, Lois I "Lois
smiled drearily; she was sitting on the steps,her arms crossed
listlessly on her knees, and her eyesfixed in an absent gaze on the
garden."Here's Giff," Helen continued, arranging hertraveling-bag and
some books on the opposite seat ofthe carriage. "I shall just have
time to say good-byto him.""That is what I came for," Gifford said, as
hetook her hand a moment. " I will bring Lois safelyto you in a
fortnight."Mrs. Dale was on the porch, and Sally and Jeanstood smiling
in the doorway; so, followed by heartygood-bys and blessings, with her
hands full of flowers,and the sunshine resting on her happy face
andglinting through her brown hair, Helen drove away.<pb
n="369"/>JOfN WARD, PREACHER            869Mr. Dale was at the
post-office, and came out tohand her the letter she expected." So
you're off ? " he said, resting his hand on thecarriage door, and
looking at her with a pleasantsmile. "You've made me think, of the
starling,this last week, - you remember the starling in theBastile? '
I can't get out,' says the starling, -  I1can't get out.' Well, I 'm
glad you want to get out,my dear. My regards to your husband." He
stoodwatching the carriage whirl down the road, with ashade of envy on
his face.When Helen had gone, and the little group on theporch had
scattered, Lois rose to go into the house,but Gifford begged her to
wait." You stay too much in-doors," he remonstrated;"it has made your
face a little white. Do come intothe garden awhile.""She does look
badly," said Mrs. Dale from thetop of the steps, contemplating her
niece eritically."I declare it puts me out of all patience with her,to
see her fretting in this way."Mrs. Dale was experiencing that curious
indigna-tion at a friend's suffering which expends itself uponthe
friend; in reality her heart was very tender to-wards her niece. "She
misses the Forsythes," Mrs.Dale continued.  " She 's been so occupied
withArabella Forsythe since the accident, she feels as ifshe had
nothing to do."There was no lack of color in Lois's face now,which did
not escape Gifford's eye." Go, now, and walk with Gifford," said
Mrs.Dale coaxingly, as though she were speaking to achild.<pb
n="370"/>870         JOHN WARD, PREACHERLois shook her head, without
looking at him. "Idon't believe I will, if you don't mind."But
Mrs. Dale was not satisfied. " Oh, yes, you'dbetter go. You've
neglected the flowers dreadfully.I don't know how long it is since
your father hashad any fresh roses in the library.""I '11 get the
garden scissors," Gifford pleaded;"i won't take long just to cut some
roses.""Well," Lois said languidly.Gifford went through the wide cool
hall for theshears and the basket of scented grass for the po-sies; he
knew the rectory as well as his own home.Mrs. Dale had followed him,
and in the shadowyback hall she gave him a significant look."That's
right, cheer her up. Of course she feelstheir going very much. I must
say, it does notshow much consideration on the part of the youngman to
leave her at such a time, - I don't care whatthe business is that
calls him away! Still, I can'tsay that I 'm surprised. I never did
like that Dick,and I have always been afraid Lois would care
forhim.""I think it is a great misfortune," Gifford saidgravely."Oh,
well, I don't know," demurred Mrs. Dale. "It is an excellent match;
and his carelessness now- well, it is only to be expected from a young
manwho would carry his mother off from -from ourcare, to be looked
after by a hired nurse.   Hethought," said Mrs. Dale, bridling her
head andpursing up her lips, "that a lot of 'fussy old wo.men' could
n't take care of her. Still, it will be a<pb n="371"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHER             871good marriage for Lois. I'm bound to say
that,though I have never liked him."The young people did not talk much
as they wentdown into the garden. Lois pointed out what rosesGifford
might cut, and, taking them from him, putthem into the little basket
on her arm." How I miss Helen I" she said at last."Yes, of course," he
answered, "but think howsoon you'll see her in Lockhaven;" and then
hetried to make her talk of the lumber town, and thepeople, and John
Ward. But he had the conver-sation quite to himself. At last, with a
desperatedesire to find something in which she would be in-terested,
he said, "You must miss your friends verymuch. I'm sorry they are
gone.""My friends?"" Yes, Mr. Forsythe - and his mother.""Oh, no! "
she answered quickly."No ?" Gifford said, wondering if she were
afraidhe had discovered her secret, and hastening to helpher conceal
it. " Oh, of course you feel that thechange will be good for
Mrs. Forsythe ?""Oh, I hope it will I" cried Lois, fear tremblingin
the earnestness of her voice.Gifford had stepped over the low box
border toa stately bunch of milk-white phlox. "Let's havesome of
this," he said, beginning to cut the longstems close to the roots; "
it always looks so well inthe blue jug."His back was toward her, and
perhaps that gavehim the courage to say, with a suddenness that
sur-prised himself, "Ah -does Mrs. Forsythe goabroad with her son ?
"<pb n="372"/>872        SOHN WARD, PREACHEREven as he spoke he
wondered why he had saidit; certainly it was from no interest in the
sick lady.Was it because he hoped to betray Lois into someexpression
of opinion concerning Mr. Forsythe's de-parture ? He despised himself
if it were a test, buthe did not stop to follow the windings of his
ownmotives."Abroad ?" Lois said, in a quick, breathless way."Does he
go abroad ?"Gifford felt her excitement and suspense withoutseeing it,
and he began to clip the phlox with aecklessness which would have
wrung Dr. Howe'ssouL"I - I believe so. I supposed you knew it.""How do
you know it ?" she demanded."He told me," Gifford admitted."Are you
sure ? " she said in a quavering voice.Gifford had turned, and was
stepping carefullyback among the plants, sinking at every step intothe
soft fresh earth. He did not look at her, as hereached the path."Are
you sure ?" she said again."Yes," he answered reluctantly, "yes, he is
go-ing; I don't know about his mother."Here, to his dismay, he saw the
color come andgo on Lois's sad little face, and her lip tremble,
andher eyes fill, and then, dropping her roses, she beganto cry
heartily."Oh, Lois I" he exclaimed, aghast, and was ather side in a
moment. But she turned away, and,throwing her arm about an old
locust-tree in thepath, laid her cheek against the rough bark, and
hidher eyes.<pb n="373"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.          878"Oh, don't
cry, Lois," he besought her. "What abrute I was to have told you in
that abrupt way IDon't cry."" Oh, no," she said, " no, no, no I you
must notsay that - you-- you do not understand " -" Don't," he said
tenderly, " don't -Lois "Lois put one hand softly on his arm, but she
kepther face eovered. Gifford was greatly distressed."I ought not to
have told you in that way,"-Loisshook her head, -"and-and I have no
doubt he- they '1 come to Ashurst and tell you of theirplans before
they start."Lois seemed to listen." Yes," Gifford continued, gaining
conviction fromhis desire to help her, "of course he will return."L
ois had ceased to ry. "Do-doyou think so?"I -m' s-t of it," Giffoad
answered firmly; andeven ms he spoke, he had a mental vision, in
whichhe saw himself bringing Dick Forsythe back toAshurst, and
planting him forcibly at Lois's feet."I ought to have considered," he
went on, lookingat her anxiously, " that in your exhausted state
itwould be a shook to hear that your friends were go.ing so far away;
though Europe is n't so very far,Lois. Of course they '1 come and tell
you all aboutit before they go; probably they had their own rea-sons
for not doing it before they left Ashurst, -yourhealth, perhaps. But
no doubt, no possible doubt,that Mr. Forsythe, at least, will come
back here tomake any arrangements there may be about hishouse, you
know."This last was a very lame reason, and Gifford flt<pb
n="374"/>874        JOHN WARD, PREACHERit, for the house had been
closed and the rent paid,and there was nothing more to do; but he must
saysomething to comfort her.Lois had quite regained her composure;
even theold hopeless look had returned."I beg your pardon," she
said. "I am very--foolish. I don't know why I am so weak - I -- I

turned to go into the house, and Gifford fol-lowed her, first picking
up the neglected roses at herfeet."I do not know what you think of
me," she saidtremulously." I only think you are not very strong," he
an-swered tenderly, yet keeping his eyes from heraverted face; he felt
that he had seen more than hehad a right to, already. His first
thought was toprotect her from herself; she must not think shehad
betrayed herself, and fancy that Gifford hadguessed her engagement. He
still hoped that, forthe sake of their old friendship, she would
freelychoose to tell him. But most of all, she should notfeel that she
had shown despairing love for a marwho neglected and slighted her, and
that her com-panion pitied her. He even refused to let his thoughtturn
to it." You must not mind me, Lois. I quite understand-the suddenness
of hearing even the most- in-different thing is enough to upset one
when one is so<pb n="375"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.             875tired
out with nursing, and all that. Don't mindme.""You are so good,
Gifford," she said, with asudden shy look from under her wet lashes,
and alittle lightening of her heavy eyes.It was at least a joy to feel
that he could comforther, even though it cut his own heart to do so,
andthe pain of it made him silent for a few minutes.When they had
reached the steps, Lois' face hadsettled into its white apathy, which
was almost de-spair. "I think I 'U go in, Giff," she said. " I amso
tired."" Won't you fix the roses ? " he asked.She shook her head. "No,
I -I don't care any-thing about them; Sally can do it. Just leave
themon the steps."She gave him a wan little smile, and went intothe
house. Gifford stood in the sunshine, with theroses and the white
phlox, and looked after her re-treating figure. But in spite of his
heartache, hewould not leave the flowers to die, so he went hunt-ing
about for something to put them in, and findingthe India china
punch-bowl, with its soft blues andgreens of enamel, and twists of
roses and butterfliesover groups of tiny mandarins, he brought it
out,and laid his flowers in it, a little clumsily, perhaps,and
heedless that some of the stems stuck out; butas he forgot the water,
this did not so much matter.Then he carried it into the hall, and put
it down onthe table under the square window, and ploddedhome alone.The
noon sunshine poured hot and bright through<pb n="376"/>876
JOHN WARD, PREACHER.the little panes of glass, and when Lois, later
inthe day, found the withered, drooping roses and thehanging heads of
the white phlox, she felt they wereonly in keeping with all the rest
of life.Even the sparkling day had darkened, and Dr.Howe's prophecy of
rain had been fulfilled.<pb n="377"/>CHAPTER XXVLIT grew quite
chilly towards dusk, which gaveDr. Howe an excuse for putting a match
to thedusty pile of logs in the library fireplace. He likedthe snap
and glow of the flames, and did not objectto the mild, soft heat; so
he sat there long afterLois had gone wearily up-stairs to bed, and the
rec.tory was full of drowsy silence.Outside, the tree which leaned
toward the housebent and swayed in the wind, and scratched against-
ie ether boards, while the rain came in a quicks  daagainst the glass,
and then seemed to listen foran answer, and waver, and retreat, and go
sweeping'down among the bushes in the garden.The rector had not
lighted his lamp; the faint,still light from two candles in the row of
silvercandlesticks on the tall mantel was all he wanteduntil he began
to read. He was ready to do thatlater. A church journal, with an
account of aquarrel between a High-Church clergyman and hisLow-Church
Bishop, was within reach of his hand,and the "Three Guardsmen," in a
ragged yellowcover, was astride his knee, but now he was contentto sit
and think. He made a prosperous and com-fortable figure, reflected in
the dim, dark mirrorover the mantel, where the candles shone back
likestars in a pool at night A white moth had found<pb n="378"/>878
JOHN WARD, PREACHER.its way into the house, and fluttered back and
f6rthbetween the candles, its little white ghost followingit in the
glass. The rector watched it placidly.Even his thoughts were tranquil
and comfortable,for he was equally indifferent both to the bishopand
his rebellious clergyman. There was a cup ofmulled wine simmering by
the brass dogs, and thefire sputtered and sung softly. Max, with his
nosebetween his paws, watched it with sleepy eyes. Thelittle tinge of
melancholy in Dr. Howe's face didnot interfere with a look of quiet
satisfaction withlife; perhaps, indeed5 itgave an added charm to
hisruddy, handsome features. At first he had beenthinking of
Mr. Denner; not of that distressingday when he had told him of
approaching death,- that was too painful for such an hour, he meantto
meet it later, - but of the sad vacancy the littlegentleman had
left.Perhaps the consciousness of the thought fromwhich he was hiding
turned his mind to Helen, andhere all was satisfactory., There had
been no dis-cussion, none of the theological argument that herletters
had given him cause to dread, which hadmade him feel a quiver in that
solid rock of customthat a long-quieted earthquake had once shaken
toits centre. He felt in a vague way that his niecewas not quite so
near and familiar, and there wasa subtile reserve, which did not show
itself in wordsor any check in the expression of her love, but
whichwas certainly there. Yet he did not analyze it; hedid not care to
realize that perhaps she feared tospeak of what was so real to her,
because she knew<pb n="379"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.             379he
had no help for her. Dr. Howe would have per-fectly understood that
this must inevitably create adistance between them; but it would have
beenextremely painful to have let this creep into histhoughts, just as
it would have been painful for himhad she spoken of it; so he
preferred to say to him-self that all was well The child had gotten
over allthat foolishness; he would have disliked to find faultwith
her, as he must have done had she mentionedit; he was glad it was all
forgotten. He was glad,too, Lois was going to Lockhaven to see
her. Poorlittle LoisI Ah, poor DennerI Well, well, thereare some very
sad things in life. And he liftedhis mug of mulled wine, and drank
thoughtfully,and then crossed his legs again on the fender; andthe
rain beat and sobbed outside.He wondered if Lois's pale face had any
con-nection with the departure of the Forsythes. Mrs.Dale had hinted
at it, though she had not dared toquote Arabella Forsythe's triumphant
secret. Thenhe remembered how disappointed he had been thatnothing
came of that affair. But on the whole itwould have been very lonely at
the rectory withoutLois. It was just as well. Dr. Howe generally
foundthat most things were " just as well." Indeed, he hadbeen heard
to say that, with a good digestion, anysorrow showed itself to have
been best inside threeyears. Perhaps he had forgotten for the
momentthat he was a widower; but at all events, he said it.So he blew
his logs to a brighter blaze, and drankthe rest of his mulled wine,
stirring it round andround for the nutmeg and spice. and said to
himself,<pb n="380"/>980         JOHN WARD, PREACHERlistening to the
beat of the rain as he pulled Max'ssilky ears, that it was the worst
June storm he re-membered. Perhaps that was why he did not hearthe
front door open and close with a bang againstthe gust which tried to
force its way into the house,blowing out the hall lights,'and sending
a dash ofrain into Sally's face."Lord 1" cried Sally, with a shrill
scream, " it'sMiss Helen's ghost "The face she saw was ghost-like
indeed. It waswet and streaming with rain, and the dark eyeswere
strange and unseeing-"Do not tell Miss Lois I am here," the pale
lipssaid. "Where is my uncle ? I must see him."Sally could only point
speechlessly to the librarydoor. Helen went swiftly towards it. She
seemedto hesitate a moment before she entered, and thenshe opened it,
and closed it again behind her, stand-ing silently in front of
it.Dr. Howe looked up calmly, expecting to seeSally; but the sight of
that still figure, with eyeswhich looked at him with a curious
fixedness, sentthe color from his face in one moment of
actualfright. "Helen " he cried, springing to his feet."Good heavens
child, what is it? What is thematter?""I have come back," she
answered, uttering eachword with that peculiar slowness one notices in
avery sick person, who tries to hear himself speak.Dr. Howe had turned
to light the lamp, but hishand shook, and Helen absently steadied the
shadeuntil he raised the wick, and then fumbled for his<pb
n="381"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.           881glasses, and turned to look
at her. It was a relief tohear her speak."My dear," he said, his voice
still tremulous,"you alarmed me terribly. Why,' how wet youare I" He
had laid his hand upon her shoulder tohelp her take off her
wraps. "Bless my soul, child,you're drenched I Did you come in an open
car-riage ? But why are you here? Did you miss yourtrain ?"Even as he
spoke, before she silently shook herhead, he knew she would have been
back by noonhad she missed her train.Max had come and sniffed
suspiciously at herskirts before he recognized her, and then he
rubbedhis head against her knee, and reached up to bepatted. She let
her hand rest a moment on hishead, and then with cold, stiff fingers
tried to helpher uncle take off her oloak, and lift her bonnet fromher
dripping hair. She made no effort to wipe therain from her face, and
Dr. Howe, with his bighandkerchief, tried clumsily to do it for
her."What is the matter, my dear?" the rector wassaying nervously. "
Is anything wrong with Mr.Ward? Have you had bad news? Tell me,
mydarling; you distress me by your silence."Helen's throat seemed dry,
and she moved herlips once or twice before the words came. ',I
havecome back," she answered slowly, looking with ab-sent eyes at Max,
who was furtively licking her hand."I have had a letter from John. So
I have comeback. I am very tired."She looked wearily around, and
swayed a little<pb n="382"/>882        JGOHN WARD, PREACHERfrom side
to side. Dr. Howe caught her in hisarms. "My dear," he said, in a
frightened voice,"my dear-you are very ill. I '1 fetch Jean -I '11
send for Adele I"Helen laid her shaking hand upon his arm. "No,no, -I
am not ill. I am only tired. I walkedfrom Mercer, I think; I don't
quite remember.Please do not call any one, uncle."In spite of the
wildness of her words, it was not adelirious woman who was speaking to
him, as he hadthought. "Try and tell me, then, what it all means,"he
said; "or stay,-first let me get you a glass ofwine."He went shuffling
along in his slippers to thedining-room, and came back with a
wineglass andthe little fat decanter, with the silver collar
clinkingabout its neck. He filled the glass, and held it toher lips,
and then stood and looked at her as shedrank, his lower lip thrust
out, and perplexity andanxiety written on every feature.Helen handed
the glass back to him, and rose."Thank you, uncle Archie," she
said. "I -I mustgo up-stairs now. I am tired."" But, my dear child,"
he remonstrated, "my dearHelen, you must tell me what all this means,
first."She looked at him entreatingly. "Not now,--oh, notto-night.""
But, Helen," he said, "I can't be kept in sus-pense, you know."He
tried to put his arm about her, but she pushedit a little aside and
shook her head. "I will tellyou," she said, while Dr. Howe, not
understanding<pb n="383"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.           -his
repulse, stood with parted lips and frowning eye-brows, polishing his
glasses on the skirt of his dress-ing-gown. Helen rubbed her hand
across her fore.head."I am a- little confused," she began, "but--there
is not much to say. John has written that Imust not come back to
Lockhaven. I shall neversee my husband again, uncle Archie," she
addedpiteously."Why - why- why I" cried Dr. Howe. "Blessmy soul,
what's all this? Mr. Ward says my nieceis not to return to her husband
I Oh, come, now,come""Need we say anything more to-night ?"
Helensaid. "I - I cannot talk."Nothing could have shown Dr. Howe's
affectionfor his niece more than the way in which he said,looking at
her in silence for a moment, " My child,you shall do just what you
please. Come up-stairsnow, and get to bed. It will be a mercy if
you'renot laid up with a cold to-morrow. Would yourather not see Lois?
Well, then, Jean shall comeand make you comfortable."But Dr. Howe,
shuffling over the bare stairs, andfuming to himself, " What's all
this I Nonsense,I say, perfect nonsense I" could not fail to
arouseLois, and she called out drowsily, "Good-night,father, dear. Is
anything the matter? ""Nothing, - nothing !" cried the rector
testily."Go to sleep. Come, Helen, take my arm, and letme help
you.""Helen I" Lois exclaimed, wide awake, aan<pb n="384"/>A84
JOHN WARD, PREACHERspringing from her bed to rush to her cousin." What
is it?" she gasped, as she caught sight ofthe group."Nothing, I tell
you," said the rector. " Go tobed at once; you '1 take cold."But
Helen, seeing the distressed face, put herhands on Lois's shoulders,
and pushed her gentlyback into her room. " I had to come back,
Lois,?she said. "I will tell you why, to-morrow. 1 amtoo tired,
now. Don't speak to me, please, dear."The rector had hurried down the
entry to findJean, who indeed needed no rousing, for Sally hadtold her
who had come. " Let me know when MissHelen is comfortable," he
said.And when the old woman, awed by Helen's still,white face, told
him his niece was in bed, he came upagain, holding the decanter by the
throat, and begiging her to take another glass of wine. But she
onlyturned her head away and asked to be alone. Shewould not say
anything more, and did not seem tohear his assurances that it would be
"all right'iathe morning," and that " she must not worry."It was the
kindest thing to her, but it was veryhard for the rector to go down to
his library stillin ignorance. The spell of peace had been
rudelybroken, and his fire was out. He lifted Helen'sbonnet, still
heavy with rain, and laid it on thecloak she had thrown across a
chair, and then stoodand looked at them as though they could
explainthe mystery of her return. The tall clock on thestairs struck
eleven, and outside the storm beat andcomplained.<pb n="385"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.             8Dr. Howe was up early the next
morning. Hewent through the silent house before Sally hadcrept yawning
from her room, and, throwing openthe doors at each end of the hall,
let a burst of sun-shine and fresh wind into the darkness and
stillness.Then he went out, and began to walk up and downthe porch as
a sort of outlet to his impatience.Over and over he said, "What can it
be?" Indeed,Dr. Howe had asked himself that question even inhis
dreams. " I hope there's no woman at the bot-tom of it," he
thought. "But no; Ward 's a fool,but he is a good man."He stopped
once, to lift a trailing vine and twistit about a support. The rain
had done great dam-age in the night: the locust blossoms had been
tornfrom the trees, and the lawn was white with them;the soft, wet
petals of the climbing roses were scat-tered upon the path by the side
of the house; and along branch of honeysuckle, wrenched from its
trel-lis, was prone upon the porch. These small inter-ests quieted the
rector, and he was able soon to rea-son himself into the belief that
his niece's returnwas a trifling affair, perhaps a little
uncomfortable,and certainly silly, but he would soon make it allright;
so that when he saw her coming slowly down-stairs, with Lois creeping
after her, almost afraid tospeak, he was able to greet her very
tranquilly."Are you rested, my child?    After breakfast,we'll have a
good talk, and everything shall bestraightened out."Breakfast was a
dreary affair. Helen's abstrac-tion was too profound for her to make
even the pre-<pb n="386"/>86 ~-JOHN WARD, PREACHER.tense of
eating. Once or twice, when Lois's ~voicepierced through the clouds
and reached her heart,she looked up, and tried to reply. But they
wereall glad when it was over, and the rector put his armgently over
his niece's shoulders, and drew her intothe library."If any one comes,
Lois," he said, "you had bet-ter just say Helen changed her mind about
goingyesterday, and has come back for a few days.""No," interrupted
Helen slowly. " You had bet-ter say what is the truth, Lois. I have
come backto Ashurst to stay.""Now, my dear," remonstrated the rector
whenthey were in the library, and he had shut the door,"that is really
very unwise. These little affairs,little misunderstandings, are soon
cleared up, andthey are even forgotten by the people most inter-ested
in them. But outsiders never forget. So it isvery unwise to speak of
them."Helen had seated herself on the other side of hiswriting-table,
brushing away the litter of papers andunanswered letters, so that she
could lean her elbowOn it, and now she looked steadily across at him.
"Uncle," she said, calmly "you do not know.There is no
misunderstanding. It is just what Itold you last night: he thinks it
best that I shouldleave him indefinitely. I know that it is
forever.Yes, it seems to him best. And I am sure, feelingas he does,
he is right. Yes, John is right."Dr. Howe threw himself back in his
revolvingchair, and spun half-way round. " Helen," he said,"this is
folly; you must talk like a sensible woman.<pb n="387"/>yOBHN WAPRD,
PREACHER.          887You know you cannot leave your husband. I
sup.pose you and Ward, like all the rest of the worldthat is married,
have had some falling out; and now,being young, you think your lives
are over. Non-sense I Bless my soul, child, your aunt and I haddozens
of them, and all as silly as this, I 'U be bound.But I'm sure we did
not take the public into ourconfidence by declaring that we would live
apart.I should have given you credit for more sense, in.deed I
should."Helen did not notice the reprimand."Now tell me all about it,"
he continued. "Youknow you can trust me, and I'11 write your husbanda
letter which will make things clear."Helen shook her head
wearily. "You will not-understand. Nothing can be done; it is as
fixedas -death. We can neither of us alter it and beourselves. Oh, I
have tried and tried to see someway out of it, until it seems as if my
soul weretired.""I did not intend to be severe, my child," therector
said, with remorseful gentleness, " but in oneway it is a more serious
thing than you realize. Idon't mean this foolishness of a separation;
thatwill all be straightened out in a day or two. Butwe do not want it
gossiped about, and your beinghere at all, after having started home,
looks strange;and of course, if you say anything about having hada-a
falling out with Ward, it will make it tentimes worse. But you have
n't told me what it is ?""Yes, I '11 tell you," she answered," and
then per-haps you will see that it is useless to talk about it<pb
n="388"/>888       JJOHN WARD, PREACHER.I must just take up the burden
of life as well as Ican.""Go on," said the rector."John has-been much
distressed lately," Helenbegan, looking down at her hands, clasping
eachother until the skin was white across the knuckles,because I have
not believed in eternal punishment.He has felt that my eternal
happiness depended uponholding such a belief." Dr. Howe looked
incredu-lous. " Some weeks ago, one of his elders came tohim and told
him I was spreading heresy in thechurch, and damning my own soul and
the souls ofothers who might come to believe as I did,-yoaknow I told
Mrs. Davis that her husband had notgone to hell, - and he reproached
John for neglect-ing me and his church too; for John, to spare me,had
not preached as he used to, on eternal punish-ment. It almost killed
him, uncle," she said, andher voice, which had given no hint of tears
since herreturn, grew unsteady. "Oh, he has suffered so Iand he has
felt that it was his fault, a failure in hislove, that I did not
believe what he holdsto be true.""Heavens " cried the rector
explosively, "her-esy? Is this the nineteenth century?""Since I have
been away," Helen went on, with-out noticing the interruption, "they
have insistedthat I should be sessioned, - dealt with, they call
it.John won't let me come back to that; but if thatwere his only
reason, we could move away fromLockhaven. He has a nobler reason: he
feels thatthis unbelief of mine will bring eternal misery tomy soul,
and he would convert me by any means.<pb n="389"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.           889He has tried all that he knows (for oh, we have
dis.cussed it endlessly, uncle Archie 1), - argument,prayer, love,
tenderness, and now - sorrow." 'The rector was sitting very straight
in his chair,his plump hands gripping the arms of it, and hislips
compressed with anger, while he struggled forpatience to hear this
preposterous story through."He makes me suffer," Helen continued,
"thatI may be saved. And indeed I don't see how hecan do anything
else. If a man believes his wifewill be damned for all eternity unless
she acceptscertain doctrines, I should think he would moveheaven and
earth to make her accept them. AndJohn does believe that. In denying
repr6bation, Ideny revelation, he says, and also the Atonement,upon
which salvation depends. So now you seewhy he says I shall not come
back to him until Ihave found the truth."Then Dr. Howe burst into a
torrent of indignantremonstrance. A clergyman send his wife from
himbecause she does not believe some dogma I Werewe back in the dark
ages? It was tbo monstrouslyabsurd 1 If the idiots he preached to
forced him todo it, let him leave them; let him' come to Ashurst.The
rector would build him a meeting-house, andhe could preach his
abominable doctrine to anybodywho was fool enough to go and hear
him.Dr. Howe was walking hastily up and down theroom, gesticulating as
he talked. 'Helen'i patienteyes followed him. Again and again she
tried topoint out to him her husband's intense sincerity, andthe
necessity which his convictions forced upon him.<pb n="390"/>890
JOHN WARD, PREACHER.But the rector refused to think Mr. Ward's
attitudeworthy of serious consideration. "The man is in-sane !" he
cried. "Send his wife away from him toforce her into a certain belief
? Madness,- I tellyou, madness! "" I cannot hear you speak so of my
husband,"Helen said very quietly, but it caused Dr. Howe toconceal his
wrath." He '11 think differently in a day or two," he said."This
nonsense won't last."Then Helen, having exhausted all her argumentsto
show that John was immovable, said, "Let meread you what he says
himself; then you will under-stand, perhaps, how real it all is to
him, and how hecannot help it."" Bah! " cried Dr. Howe, and certainly
it was try-ing to have Helen attempt to excuse such folly." I 've no
patience with - There, there I I did n'tmean to lose my temper, but
bless my soul, this isthe worst thing I ever knew. See here, Helen,
ifthe man is so determined, you 'll have to changeyour views, or go
back to your old views, I mean, -I don't know what you do believe, -
that's all thereis. about it."Helen was unfolding John's letter, and
she lookedup at her uncle with a fleeting smile. " Change myviews so
that I can go back? Do you think thatwould satisfy John ? Do you think
I could ? Why,uncle Archie, do you believe in eternal damna-tion ? I
know you pray to be delivered from it inthe Litany, but do you believe
in it ? ""That has nothing to do with the question,<pb n="391"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.            891.Helen," he answered, frowning, "and of
course Ibelieve that the consequences of sin are eternal."" You know
that is not what the prayer means,"she insisted; "you have to put your
private inter-pretation upon it. Well, it is my private
interpre-tation which John thinks is sin, and sin which willreceive
what it denies.""Well, you must believe it, then," the rector
said,striking his fist on the arm of his chair "it is thewife's place
to yield; and while I acknowledge it isall folly, you must give
in.""You mean," she said, "that I must say I believeit. Can I change a
belief ? You know I cannot,uncle Archie. And when you hear what John
says,you will see I must be true, no matter where truthleads me."Helen
knew every word of that letter by -heart.She had read it while she
drove towards the depot,and when she dismissed the carriage it was
with avague idea of flying to Lockhaven, and brushing allthis cobweb
of unreason away, and claiming herright to take her place at her
husband's side. Butas she sat in the station, waiting, every sentence
ofthe letter began to burn into her heart, and sheslowly realized that
she could not go back. 'helong day passed, and the people, coming and
going,looked curiously at her; one kindly woman, seeingthe agony in
her white face, came up and asked herif she were ill, and could she
help her? Helenstared at her like a person in a dream, and shookher
head. Then, in a numb sort of way, she beganto understand that she
must go back to Ashurst.<pb n="392"/>892         JOHN WARD,
PREACHEdShe did not notice that it had begun to rain, orthink of a
carriage, but plodded, half blind anddazed, over the country road to
her old home, some-times sitting down, not so much to rest as to
takethe letter from its envelope again and read it.She looked at it
now, with a sudden gasp of pain;it was as though a dagger had been
turned in awound. It seemed too sacred to read to Dr. Howe,but it was
just to John that it should be heard,even if only partly understood;
and it was alsojust to her- for Helenhad one of those healthysouls
which couldbe just to itself. With the letterbad come a clear and
logical statement of the do-etrine of reprobation, together with the
argumentsand reasons for holding it; besides this, there was alist of
books which he' meant to send her. All theseshe handed to her uncle."I
will not read you all he writes," she said,"but even a little will
show you the hopelessness ofthinking I can ever go back to him. He

writes, 'in assenting anguish, when hecharged me with having been

sin; despair and death lay hold upon me. ButHe has had merey upon
me. He has shown me oneway in which you shall be saved, and by his
strengthI am not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Reasonand
argument have not shown you the light. Joyand peace have not led you
to it. There is oneother path, beloved, which I have faith to
believeshall not fail. It is sorrow. Sorrow can bring thetruth home to
you as no other thing will. The re-lentless pressure of grief will
force you to seek forlight. It will admit of no evasion; it will
receiveno subtilty; it will bring you face to face with theeternal
verities; it will save your soul. And whatsorrow, Helen, can come to
you such as making mesuffer? And is there a pang which can tear my
soulin this world like absence from my beloved? I tram,ple my own
happiness under my feet. Too longI have been weak, too long I have
loved you with buthalf my nature; now I am strong. Therefore I
say,before God, for your soul's sake, you shall not seemy face until
you have found the truth. This pain,which will be to me but the just
punishment for<pb n="395"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.           895my sin,
will be to you like some sharp and bittermedicine which shall heal you
of what would other-wise bring eternal death. Even as I write I
amfilled with strength from God to save you. For Godhas shown me the
way. And it shall be soon,- Iknow it shall be soon. The Lord's hand is
notshortened that it cannot save. He has revealed tome the one last
way of showing you the truth, andHe will lighten your eyes. Yet, oh,
my love, mywife, help me to be strong for you, -my Helen,help me in
these days or weeks of waiting."'There is one mercy vouchsafed to me
who am allunworthy of the least favor: it is the knowledge ofyour
understanding it all, - the bitter distress, theabsolute conviction,
and the necessity which followsit. You see what the temptation was to
fly with youto some spot where your unbelief could not injureany one,
and there work and pray for your salva-tion; leaving these souls,
which my neglect of youand so of them, has allowed to drift deep into
sin.You will understand that, believing (oh, knowing,Helen, knowing)
that salvation depends upon aright conception of truth, I have no
choice but toforce you by any means to save your soul. Thisknowledge
makes me strong. So I am set, withstrength which you yourself give me,
to inflict thissuffering upon you. Take this absence and use
itsbitterness to sting you to search for truth. Take itsanguish to
God. Pray for light, pray for the Spiritof God. And when light comes -
Oh, love, thethought of that joy seems too great to bear except<pb

shall not write again;you will meet this grief in the solitude of
yourown soul, where even I dare not come to break thesilence which may
be the voice of God. Write meany questionings, that I may help those
first faintstirrings of the Holy Spirit, but unless questioningscome I
shall be silent.'"Helen had not read all of this aloud, and therewas
yet more, on which she looked a moment beforeshe folded the
letter. The closing words were fullof a human tenderness too divine
and holy for anyheart but her:own; a faint smile crept about herlips
for a moment, as she leaned out of her distressto rest upon her
husband's love, and then she wokeagain to the present.<pb
n="397"/>CHAPTER XXVII.BUT the rector was not softened by John's
letter;there was a 'curl of contempt upon his lip whichcolored his
words, though with Helen's quiet eyesupon him he forced himself to
speak calmly."You see he expects you to return. This idea ofyours, of
a separation, is nonsense. I told you so,in the first place. Now the
only thing to do is to goto Lockhaven, and just say that your
convictionsare immovable (if they are, though it would be wiserto make
a concession, Helen), so there is no use inexperimenting in this
absurd way. Absurd ? Whyitis    it is" -Dr. Howe's face was crimson,
and he could findno epithet strong enough to use."Do you suppose I
have not told John that Icould not change ?" Helen said sadly,
ignoring thesuggestion of a concession; "and to go back, uncleArchie,
-you don't know John I He thinks I willcome back,-you are right
there,-but only be-cause he thinks this plan of his is an
inspirationfrom God, and will lead me to believe as he wishes.It will
not, and you know it. But John would feelthat he was doubting God to
let me come, if thepromise were unfulfilled. So I shall never
return.Oh, must we discuss it ? It is fixed; it can neverbe
changed. Jf only it could be understood at once IThere is no
hope."<pb n="398"/>398        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.Dr. Howe rose, and
walked about the room a mo-ment, breathing hard, and swallowing once
or twice,as though to choke some hot words. Then he satdown, and began
to argue.First, he tried to prove to Helen that there was ahell, but
unconsciously he veered to assertions thatit made no difference,
anyhow; that of course thedoctrine of eternal-damnation was
preposterous, andthat she must persuade Mr. Ward to drop the
sub-ject. He reasoned and threatened, then he expos-tulated and
implored, ending all with, "You mustgo back, and at once."Helen had
been silent, but when he finished shesaid, so absently that he knew
she had not beenlistening, " Shall I explain why I have come back,or
would you prefer to do it ?""Explain? " cried the rector. "What are
youthinking of? Of course not! It is not to beknown.""It must be
known, I think," Helen answeredcalmly. " I am here, and I shall stay
here, so itseems to me better to disarm gossip by telling thetruth at
once."Dr. Howe sunk_ back in his chair, and looked athis niece in
speechless annoyance."You had better let me tell them, uncle
Archie,"she said simply; "it will be less unpleasant foryou."Then he
regained his voice: "It is not to betold, Helen. I shall not allow
it. If you have nosense, I'11 take the matter into my own
hands. Ifpeople choose to gossip about your being here a few<pb
n="399"/>JOHSI WARD, PREACHER           899days or a week, - it may
take a week for this gollyto blow over,--why, they can, that's all. I
willnot -you hear me, Helen? - I will not enter intoany absurd
explanations."Helen lifted her heavy eyes, and looked at hima moment,
and then she said, " Aunt Deely ? "Dr. Howe suffered a sudden
collapse. "Well,I - ah - well, perhaps Adele. I suppose Adelemust know
it. I don't know but what her commonsense may be good for you, my
dear. Yes, I '11 tellAdele."" I should like to have Lois understand
it," Helensaid."Well," Dr. Howe conceded, "yes-I supposeyou might
mention it to Lois - because ' -"I don't want her to think anything
wrong ofJohn," Helen explained.Dr. Howe stared at her blankly, but did
notburst into wrathful exclamations; he was actuallyexhausted in mind
and body; this controversy hadbeen too much for him. But that remark
of Helen'sended it. She went slowly up-stairs, clinging tothe
balustrade as though she needed some support,yet she had not spoken of
being tired. She passedLois, sitting on the window-seat which ran
acrossthe broad landing, but did not seem to see her,and there was
something in her cousin's face whichkept the young girl dumb.Dr. Howe
did not go to Dale house until the nextday; he vaguely hoped something
would turn upbefore his sister discovered Helen's presence at
therectory, which would make this humiliating confes<pb n="400"/>m

exceptthe.arrival of a letter from John Ward to Dr. Howe,explaining
his convictions and reiterating his deter.mination.Helen kept in her
own room that day and thenext, so Gifford Woodhouse, who came to the
rec-tory, did not guess her presence, since Lois had beenadmonished to
be silent concerning it, and no oneelse chanced to call. Of course the

all he could to make Helen return to her hustband, he yet trembled as
he thought how his sisterwould reproach him   "' ITough I can't help

"" But what does it matter to her what his viewsare? " said
Mrs. Dale." It matters to him what her views are," answeredDr. Howe
despondently. Somehow, since he hadbegun to talk to his sister, he had
grown almost ashopeless as Helen."Then Helen must change her views,"
Mrs. Dalesaid promptly. "I have no patience with womenwho set up their
own Ebenezers. A woman shouldbe in subjection to her own husband, I
say, - and sodoes St. Paul. In my young days we were taughtto love,
honor, and obey. Helen needs to be re-minded of her duty, and I 'IU

grimly."And I '11 have it I" Mrs. Dale retorted."But you don't take

Adele. It is per-fectly useless !"The brother and sister looked at
each other a mo-ment silently; then Mrs. Dale said, "Well, if youask
my advice " -"I didn't; there's no use. Helen will be herown adviser,
you.can depend upon that. I only justwanted you to know the facts. No
outsider candirect the affairs of a man and woman who areentirely

call yourself one, if you choose. And I am going to give you advice,
and I hopeyou'll be sensible enough to take it. You havejust got to go

his head, and sighed."I don't believe it will do any good for me to

does he want? "" He wants her to be converted, I tell you," criedher

sister'squestion; " but conversion with him merely means abelief in
hell, so far as I can make out."" Well, of course Helen is all wrong
not to believein hell," said Mrs. Dale promptly; "the Prayer-Book
teaches it, and she must. I'll tell her so.All you have to do is to

440added triumphantly. "You rememberi I. tld youso?"The rector
sighed. After all, Mrs. Dale did nothelp him. It was useless to try to
impress herwith the theological side of the matter, as she
onlyreturned with fresh vigor to the charge that.it was a.disgrace to
the family.  So he rose to go, saying,. "Well, I '11 wait for Ward's
letter, and if he per-sists in this insanity I '11 start

.Ms. Dale began in her positive way to saybow he ought to talk to
"this man," Mr, Dalecame in."I thought I heard your voice," he said'to
hisbrother-in-law, "and I came up " - he looked dep-reeatingly at his
wife -"to ask you to step downand have a pipe. I want to, spoak to you
aboutDeaner's books."But before Dr. Howe could: answer,
Mrs. Dalepoured forth all the troublesome and disgracefulstory of the
"separated husband and wife."  Mr.Dale listened intently; once he
flourished his redhandkerchief across his eyes as he blew his
nose,When he did this, he scattered some loose tobacco,about, and
Mrs. Dale stopped to reprimand hila\"I tell you," she ended
emphatically, " it is thisnew-fangled talk of woman's rights that has

cried the other two together."Yes," continued Mr. Dale slowly; "one
feels asif we ought not even to discuss it, for we are scarcelycapable
of understanding it. The place whereon westand is holy
ground.""Henry," said his wife, "there's no fool like anold fool. You
don't know what you are talkingabout."But when Dr. Howe, softening a
little since Mr.Dale did not abuse John Ward, said he must tellHelen
that,--it would please her, - Mrs. Dalebegged him to do nothing of the
sort."It would be just like her to consider thewhole affair a unique
mode of expressing affection.We had better try to show her it is a
disgrace tothe family.  Love, indeed! Well, I don't under-stand love
like that!""No," Mr. Dale responded, "no, I suppose not.But, my dear,
don't you wish you did ?"When Dr. Howe told Helen of his plan of
goingto Lockhaven, she tried to show him that it was use-less; but as
she saw his determination, she ceasedto oppose him. She would have
spared John if shecould (and she knew how impossible it was thatthe
rector could move her husband), yet she feltthat her family had a
right to insist upon a personalexplanation, and to make an effort,
however futile,to induce her husband to take her home. In themean
time, they waited for an answer to the rector'sletter. Helen had
written, but she knew no answer<pb n="407"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER
407.would come to her. She understood too well thatsweet and gentle
nature, which yielded readily insmall things, and was possessed of
invincible deter-mination in crises, to hope that John could
change.Yet she had written; she had shared her hopeless-ness as well
as her grief with him, when she toldhim how impossible it was for her
to think as he did.She showed how fast and far she had drifted
intodarkness and unbelief since she had left him, yetshe held out no
hope that a return to him couldthrow any light into those eternal
shadows. "Iunderstand it all," she hat written, stopping to
com-fort'him even while she told him how futile was hispain and hers,
"and oh, how you must suffer, mydarling, but it cannot lie helped
unless you freeyourself from your convictions. Perhaps that willcome
some time; until then, you can only be trueto yourself. But I
understand it all, - I know."Those days of waiting were hard to
bear. Thedistance between her uncle and herself had suddenlywidened;
and she could not see that beneath hisirritation there was really a
very genuine sympathy.She had vaguely hoped that Lois would
comforther, for one turns instinctively in grief to the near-est
loving thing, and she knew her cousin loved her.Yet Lois had not been
able to understand, and Helenwould hear no words of sympathy which
were not asmuch for John as for herself.It was not until Thursday that
she had told Loiswhy she had come back. They were in their pleas-ant
sitting-room, Lois walking restlessly about, withsuch puzzled
expectation on her face that its white<pb n="408"/>408        JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.sadness was almost banished. Helen sat with herhands
clasped loosely in her lap, and leaning herhead against the
window. Below, there was thebloom and glory of the garden, butterflies
dartedthrough the sunshine, and the air was full of the.honeyed hum of
the bees. But the silence of theroom seemed only a breathless anxiety,
which for--bade rest of mind or body; and so Helen hadroused herself,
and tried to tell her cousin what itall meant; but even as she talked
she-felt Lois's un-spoken condemnation of her husband, and her
voicehardened, and she continued with such apparent in-difference Lois
was entirely deceived.  "So yousee," she ended, "I cannot go back to
Lockhaven."Lois, walking back and forth, as impatient as herfather
might have been, listened, her eyes first fill-ing with tears, and
then flashing angrily. Shethrew herself on her knees beside Helen, as
shefinished, and put her arms about her cousin's waist,kissing her
listless hands in a passion of sympathy."Oh, my dear I" she cried, her
cheeks wet withtears, "how dreadful- how horrible!  Oh, Helen,darling,
my poor darling I "Lois did not stop to consider the theological
sideof the matter, which was a relief to Helen. Shetried to quiet the
young girl's distress, holding herbright head against her breast, and
soothing herwith gentle words."If I were you," Lois said at last, "I
would goback to Lockhaven; I would go, if it had to be indisguise I
"-"Not if you loved John," Helen answered.<pb n="409"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.            409"How can you bear it?" Lois whispered,
look-ing up into the calm face with a sort of awe whichchecked her
tears. " It is so cruel, Helen, you can-not forgive him."" There is
nothing to forgive; I hoped you wouldunderstand that, Lois. John
cannot do anythingelse, don't you see? Why, I would not love him asI
do, if, having such convictions, he was not truedothem. He must be
true before anything else."Lois was sitting on the floor in front of
her,clasping her knees with her arms, and rocking backand forth. "
Well," she cried hotly, " I don't un-derstand anything about his
convictions, but I tellyou what it is, Helen, I do understand how
hardit is for you l And I can never forgive him, ifyou can. It is all
very well to think about truth,but it seems to me he ought to think
about you."" But don't you see," Helen explained, still vaguelyhoping
that Lois would understand, "he thinks onlyof me? Why, Lois, it is all
for me."Lois's face was flushed with excitement. "I don'tcare! " she
cried, "it is cruel - cruel - cruel!"Helen looked at her steadily a
moment, and thenshe said patiently, "The motive is what makescruelty,
Lois. And can't you see that it is only be-cause of his love that he
does this? If he loved meless, he could not do it.""Heavens!" Lois
exclaimed, springing to herfeet, " I wish he loved you less, then! No,
there isno use saying things like that, Helen; he is narrowand
bigoted, - he is a cruel fanatic." She did notsee that Helen had half
risen from her chair, and<pb n="410"/>410       -JOHN WARD,

himself on being able to make you suf-fer,- you retd me that yourself

"-She would have said more, but Helen had fol-lowed her swiftly across
the room, and graspingher arm until the girl cried out with pain, she

a terrible voice; " do not dare to speakso to me I    If I hear such
words again, I shall leavethis house. Yu 'may -not be able to see my

hand away, and stared at her inamazement. "I didn't mean to offend
you," shestammered. "I only meant that he " -" Do not speak of him I"
Helen said passionately,her breath still quick, and her face white to
thelips. " I do not wish to hear what you meant! Oh,Lois, Lois, I
thought that you "-  She turned away,and pressed her hands hard on her
eyes a moment;then she said," I understand - I know - your affec-tion
for me prompted it - but I cannot listen, Lois,if you have such
feelings about him. I will takeyour sympathy for granted after this. I
do not wantto talk about it again."Lois went silently out of the room,
her heart over-flowing with love for her cousin, and added rage atthe
man who had come between them. She foundGifford walking about in the
hall down-stairs, and,forgetful of her father's injunction, she went
quicklyup to him, trembling with excitement, and half sob-bing.<pb

to his arm, her eyesoverflowing, "he is a wicked man-he is cruel--and
she thinks I am, Giff, just because I said hewas "Lois's agitation
drove him into his most deliberatespeech,"What do you mean ? I do not

the cool hearthstones; it was full ofdusky shadows lurking in the
wainscoted corners;the outside shutters were bowed, and only two
thinstreaks of sunshine traveled in from the warmsweet garden
outside. Some roses in a bowl on thetable filled the air with
fragrance.Lois hurried nervously through the story, break-ing into
angry grief that John Ward should havemade Helen angry at her. For she
had told Giffordhow she had tried to console her cousin."It makes me
hate John Ward more than ever!"she said, striking her hands
passionately together."Oh, Giff, is n't it awful ? ""Poor fellow "

little. " Whata wretch I am I" shesaid sternly. "Mr. Denneris dead,

course it was soon known that Helen Wardwas at the rectory, but to the
Misses Woodhouse,at least, her presence was not of enough importanceto
speculate or gossip about. Gifford had merelysaid Helen had changed
her mind about going, andwould be in Ashurst a few days longer, and
the lit-tle ladies had such an absorbing interest of theirown they did
not ask many questions. Miss Ruthonly remarked that she wondered how
she could besatisfied to stay away from her husband so long, andMiss
Deborah replied that the young did not under.stand serious
attachment.To both sisters a vague happiness had come inthese last few
weeks, and a certain sense of impor-tance. Each felt it for herself,
but was unable torealize it for the other, yet constantly encountered
itwith irritated astonishment, when the desire to con-fide was
strong.Once Miss Ruth, tearful with the memory of thatlast look from
Mr. Denner's dying eyes, tried to ap-proach the subject delicately,
but was met with suchamazing certainty on the part of Miss Deborah,

flat when she foundthat her sister had intended going, and had
evenpicked some flowers to put on Mr. Denner's grave.However, they

a little in the soft wind, and from thetop of one of them flew
suddenly a brown hawk, hisshadow floating from the green dusk under
the treesout over the sunny meadow below.The two sisters went to- the
graves of their fatherand mother first, and laid some flowers on
them,and stood a moment looking at them silently. Theirsighs were
rather a reverent recognition of an oldgrief than real sorrow, for it
was many years agothat these two had been laid here; the simple
soulswere too happy to understand the pathos of a for-gotten grief,
indeed, they did not even know thatthey had forgotten it.As they taud

PREACHERvoice, "It is over by Dr. Howe's lot, sister. Youcan see it
under that larch." So they went towardsthis one new grave, stepping
softly, and stopping bysome familiar name to brush away the grass
thathid the inscription, or lay a blossom against thestone. They spoke
once or twice of those who laythere, calling them by their first
names, yet withthat curious lowering of the voice which shows withwhat
dignity death has invested what was oncefamtiliar.They were silent as
they laid their flowers on thefresh earth of Mr. Denner's grave, over
which thekindly grass had not yet thrown its veil; and MissDeborah
stopped to put a single rose upon the sunken,mossy spot where, forty
years before, the littlesister had been laid to rest. Both the little
ladiesfrankly wiped their eyes, though with no thoughtexcept for the
old friendship which had ended here.They would have turned to go,
then, but Miss Deb-orah laid her hand on Miss Ruth's
arm. "Why,sister," she said, " who is that by Mary Jeffrey'sgrave
?"Some one was lying upon the grass, her cheekresting against the
small marble cross at the headof the grave, and one arm thrown around
it." It must be Helen I" answered Miss Ruth anx-iously. "How imprudent

the Ashurst burying-ground, -and Miss Deborah stooped and touched her

brushingthe tears away, and struggling to speak calmly. "I- I did not
know any one was here."" We were just going," Miss Ruth replied in
herkind little voice, "but we were grieved to see youtroubled, my dear
?"Miss Ruth could not help saying it in a question.ing way, for, in
spite of Ashurst traditions of paren-tal love, it could hardly be
imagined that Helen wascrying for a mother she had never known."You
are very kind," Helen said, the tears stilltrembling in her eyes. "
Something did trouble me -and- and I came here."The sisters spoke some
gentle words of this youngmother, dead now for more than twenty years,
andthen went softly away, full of sympathy, yet fearingto intrude,
though wondering in their kind heartswhat could be the matter. But
their curiosityfaded; Mr. Denner's grave was a much more im-portant
thing than Helen's unknown grief."I dare say she misses her husband ?"
Miss Ruthsuggested.But Miss Deborah thought that quite improbable."For
she could go home, you know, if that was thecase."And here the sisters
dropped the subject.As for Helen, she still lingered in the silent
grave-yard. She felt, with the unreasoning passion ofyouth, that the
dead gave her more comfort than theliving. Lois had scarcely dared to'
speak to hersince that talk-in their sitting-room, and
Dr. Howe'ssilence was like a pall over the whole house. So<pb

visit.His interview with her husband had only resultedin a greater

to Helen." He is lost to all sense of propriety; apparentlyhe has no
thought of what he owes you. Well, Ishall go to Lockhaven
to-morrow.""It is all for me!" Helen said. "Oh, uncleArchie, if you

onlysaid, " Tell Lois to pack my bag. I'll take theearly train. Oh,
Helen, why can't you be like otherwomen? Why do you have to think

attained a pitch ofangry excitement which drove all theological

with quick alarm, for Dr. Howe had not an-swered her questions."No,
no, my good woman," he said impatiently,"certainly not. Where is your
master? ""The preacher's not home," the girl answeredcoldly. She was
not used to being called " my goodwoman," if she did live out. "You
can wait, ifyou want to;" but there, her anxiety getting thebetter of
her resentment, she added, " Is she comin'back soon ? ""I 'll wait,"
said Dr. Howe briefly, walking pasther into John Ward's
study."Insufferable people!" he muttered. He lookedabout him as he
entered the room, and the povertyof the bookshelves did not escape his
keen eyes, northe open volume of Jonathan Edwards on the
writ-ing-table. There was a vase beside it, which heldone dried and
withered rose; but it is doubtful ifthe pathos of the flower which was
to await Helen'sreturn would have softened him, even if he couldhave
known it. He stopped and glanced at thebook, and then began to read
it, holding it close tohis eyes, while, with his other hand behind
him, hegrasped his hat and stick.He read the frequently quoted
passages from Ed-wards, that God holds man over hell as a manmight
hold a spider or some loathsome insect overthe fire, with the
satisfaction one feels in detectinga proof of the vicious nature of an
enemy. " Wardis naturally cruel," he said to himself. " I've al-ways
thought so. That speech of his about slaveryshowed it."<pb
n="423"/>AtMHN WARD, PREACHER.          423He put down the book with
an emphasis whichargued ill for his opinion of a man who could
studysuch words, and began to pace up and down theroom like some caged
animal, glancing once witha smothered exclamation at the old
leather-coveredvolume, which had fallen upon the floor; he evengave it
a furtive kick, as he passed.He was so occupied with his own thoughts,
he didnot see John Ward come up the garden path andenter
the. parsonage, and when, a moment after-wards, the preacher came into
the room, Dr. Howestarted at the change in him. These weeks of
spir-itual conflict had left their mark upon him. Hiseyes had a
strained look which was almost terror,and his firm, gentle lips were
set in a line of silentand patient pain. Yet a certain brightness
restedupon his face, which for a moment hid its pallor.Through fear,
and darkness, and grief, throughan extraordinary misconception and
strange blind-ness of the soul, John Ward had come, in his com-plete
abnegation of himself, close to God. Sincethat June night, when he met
the temptation whichlove for his wife held out to him, he had clung
withall the passion of his life to his love for God. Thewhole night,
upon his knees, 'he besought God'smercy for Helen, and fought the wild
desire offlight, the longing to take her and go away, whereher
unbelief could not injure any one else, and de-vote his life to
leading her to light; go away fromhis people, whom God had committed
to him, andwhom he had betrayed, leave them, stained with thesin he
had permitted to grow unchecked among<pb n="424"/>4S4        JQ.r a
,NWA, .PE, .AOBEthem, and give his very soul to Helen, to save her.But
the temptation was conquered.   When thefaint, crystal brightness of
the dawn looked into hisstudy, it saw him still kneeling, his face
hidden inhis arms, but silent and at peace. God had grantedhis prayer,
he said to himself. He had shown himthe way to save Helen. At first he
had shrunk fromit, appalled, crying out, "This is death, I cannot,
Icannot!"  But when, a little later, he went out intothe growing glory
of the day, and, standing bare.Iaided, lifted.his face to heaven, he
said, "I loveher enough, ;;,tBfCjG. O - a     .Q " ..A  .holyand awful
joy shone in Eisys. "     X ill^4he said, with simple conviction. "He
will save her,and my love shall be the human instrument."After that
had come the days when John hadwritten those imploring letters to his
wife, the lastof which she had answered with such entire deci-sion,
saying that there was no possible hope that shecould ever believe in
what she called a " monstrousdoctrine," and adding sorrowfully that it
was hardeven to believe in God, -a personal God, and shecould be
content to let doetrines go, if only thatlight upon the darkness of
the world could be lefther.Then he had sent his last letter. He had
writ-ten it upon his knees, his eyes stung .wth ter-rible tears; but
his hand did not fiter; the letterwas sent. TheA he waited for the
manifestation ofGod in Helen's soul: he distrusted himself and hisown
strength, but he never doubted God; he neverquestioned that this plan
for converting his wife wasa direct answer to his prayers.<pb
n="425"/>A#Y WARD, PREACHER.             25'eow, when he saw Dr. Howe,
he had a momentof breathless hope that her uncle had come to tellhim
that Helen had found the truth. But almostbefore the unreasonableness
of his idea struck him,he knew from Dr. Howe's face that the
time-wasnot yet."I am glad to see you," he-said, a little hur-riedly;
the thin hand he extended was not quitesteady.The rector's forehead
was gathered into a heavy,frown. " See here," he answered, planting
his feetwide apart, and still holding his hat and stick be-hind him,
"I cannot give you my hand while youare ignorant of the spirit in
which I come." "You come for Helei's sake," John replied."Yes, eir,-I
do 'eme 'for Helen's sake," returnedDr. Howe, "but it is because of
your conduet, be-cause of the heartless way in which you have
treatedmy niece. You cannot expect me to have-a friendlyfeeling for
the man who is cruel to her."  For themoment' he forgot that this was
to be a theologicaldispute. "Now, sir, what explanation have you
togive of this outrageous affair ?""* Helen's soul shall be saved,"
John said, his voicegrowing firmer, but losing none of its
gentleness.Dr. Howe made an impatient gesture. " Helen'ssoul I" he
cried. "Is it possible-that a sane mancan seriously excuse his conduct
on such a ground?Why, it is incredible  How do you suppose theworld
will regard your action ? ""What have you or I to do with the
world?"the other arnwered.<pb n="426"/>426         JOHN WARD,
PREACHER."We live in it," said Dr. Howe, "and if we arewise men we
will not, for a mad whim, violate itsstandards of propriety. When a
man turns hiswife out of his house, he must consider what mean-ing is
attached to such an action by the world. Youblast Helen's life, sir,
and her family is necessarilyinvolved in the same disgrace."John
looked at him with clear, direct eyes. "Isave Helen's soul, and her
family will rejoice withme when that day comes."" Her family," the
other replied contemptuously,"are not troubled about Helen's soul;
they arequite satisfied with her spiritual condition.""Do they know
what it is ? " John asked."Certainly," answered the rector, "of
course.But it is n't of the slightest consequence, anyhow.The main
thing is to cover up this unfortunate affairat once. If Helen comes
back right away, I thinkno one need know what has happened.""But there
is nothing to cover up," John saidsimply; " there is no shame that
Helen should acceptGod's way of leading her to himself.""Lord I"
exclaimed Dr. Howe, and then stopped.This would never do; if Ward
became angry, hewould only grow more obstinate." If you are so
troubled about her unbelief," therector said, feeling that he was very
wily, "I shouldthink you would see the need of daily influence.You
could accomplish more if she were with you.The constant guidance of a
clergyman would be ofthe utmost value. I suppose you think she is
withme, but I doubt " - his lip curled a little -" if Ican give her
quite the instruction you desire."<pb n="427"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.
427" Oh, I had not hoped for that," John answered." But her
surroundings will not influence Helen now.Impelled by my grief, she
must search for truth."Dr. Howe was too much excited to notice
thereproof in John's words. " Well, it-will teach herto think; it will
push her into positive unbelief.Agnosticism I - that's what this '
search for truth'ends in nowadays! Come, now, be reasonable,Ward; for
Heaven's sake, don't be a - a - don'tbe so unwise. I advise this
really in your owninterests. Why, my dear fellow, you 'll converther
in half the time if she is with you. What?And don't you see that your
present attitude willonly drive her further away? You are really
goingagainst your own interests."" Do not play the part of the
Tempter," John saidgently; " it ill becomes Christ's minister to do
that.Would you have me pray for guidance, and then re-fuse to follow
it when it comes? God will give methe strength and courage to make her
suffer that shemay be saved."Dr. Howe stared at him for a moment. Then
hesaid, "I-I do not need you to teach me my dutyas Christ's minister,
sir; it would be more fittingthat you should concern yourself with
your duty asa husband." The vein in his forehead was swollenwith
wrath. " The way in which you pride yourselfupon devising the most
exquisite pain for your wifeis inhuman,- it is devilish  And you drag
herfamily into the scandal of it, too."John was silent.Again Dr. Howe
realized that he must control<pb n="428"/>F4%         .irHN WARD,
PREACHERhimself; if he got into a passion, there would be anend of
bringing about a reconciliation."You made me forget myself," he said.
"Idid n't mean to speak of my own feelings. It isHelen I want to talk
about." Perhaps some flashof memory brought her face before his
eyes. "Sitdown," he added brusquely,-" you look tired ;" andindeed the
pallor of John's face was deadly.The rector, in his impatience, sat on
the edge ofhis chair, one plump fist resting on the table, andthe
other hand clenched on the head of his cane.Eis arguments and
entreaties were equally divided,but he resolutely checked the
denunciations whichtrembled upon his lips. John answered him
almosttenderly; his own grief was not so absorbing thathe could be
indifferent to the danger of a man whoset the opinion of the world
before the solemn obli-gations of his profession. Carefully, and
fully, andvery quietly, he explained his position in regard tohis
parish; but when Dr. Howe urged that Helenmight observe all proper
forms, and yet keep silenceon what was, after all, a most immaterial
difference,John roused to sudden passion. Here was an
oldtemptation."God forbid I" he said. "Observe forms, andlet her hope
of spiritual life die ? No, no, - notthat. Form without soul is
dead. You must haveseen that too often.""Well, I '11 tell you whit to
do," said the rector,in his eagerness pulling his chair closer to
John's,and resting his hand almost confidentially upon hisknee: " if
you fear her influence in your parish,--<pb n="429"/>ZJON WARD,
PREACHER.          429and of course I understand that,--why, give her
aletter to another church."John half smiled, but did not answer. The
roomhad grown dark as they talked, and now Alfarettabrought a lamp,
looking curiously at the rector,as she passed him. " Supper's ready,
Mr. Ward,"she said."Yes," John said. "Dr. Howe, I hope "-But the
rector plunged again into argument.Once he stopped, and said, "So,
surely, she can re-turn ?""It is impossible," John answered
quietly.And again, "You will let me send her back ?"And he said,
"No."At last, wearied and baffied, Dr. Howe rose. Heleaned heavily
forward on the table, his open palmresting on the volume of sermons,
which Alfarettahad lifted from the floor, and he looked steadily
atJohn. " Then, sir," he said slowly, "I am to un-derstand, for my
niece, that this monstrous decisionof yours is fixed and unchangeable?
We cannothope that her love, or her youth, or your duty, or
themiserable scandal of the affair, will ever move yourcruel
determination ? "John rose, too. The interview had been a
terriblestrain. His courage was unshaken, but his strengthwas leaving
him; a pathetic desire for sympathy andunderstanding seized him. " I
love her too much tochange. Don't you understand? But I cling tomore
than human strength, when I say, I will notchange.""Then, by Heaven,"
cried the reotor, "neither<pb n="430"/> ft     ' JOHN WARD,

reads such books as those," and hepointed to the row of Edwards,- "a

of religion ; the very existence of whose faithis a denunciation and
execration of every one whodoes not agree with him. You are firm, sir?
Sois she 1 I bid you good-day."He turned to the door, breathing hard
through hisshut teeth. John Ward followed him, and laid hishand upon
his arm. " Do not go," he said; " thereis much I would like to say;
and you will spend thenight here with me ? I beg that you will not
go.""The roof which refuses to shelter my niece," an.swered Dr. Howe,
his voice shaking with anger,"shall not be over Ipy head I ""Then,"
said John slowly and gently, "you mustlisten now to what I have to
say.""Must I" cried the rector."Yes, for it is your duty to listen, as
it is mine tospeak. I dare not hear a servant of God set theopinion of
the world above a conception of duty -no matter how strained and
unnatural the duty mayappear to him -and keep silence. I cannot
listenwhen you urge Helen's temporal happiness, and re.fuse to
consider her eternal welfare, and not tell you'you are wrong. You
evade the truth; you seek easein Zion. I charge you, by the sacred
name of Himwhose minister you are, that you examine your
ownsoul."Dr. Howe looked at him, his face crimson withanger. " Sir,"
he stammered, flinging the detaining<pb n="431"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.           431hand from his arm, - "sir "  And then, for
thefirst time since Archibald Howe took orders, anoath burst from his
lips; he struck his stick madlyagainst the table, and rushed from the
room.Alfaretta was lying in wait for him at the garden gate, a large
and rustic bunch of fowers in her hand,which she hoped he would carry
to Helen."How's Mrs. Ward ?" she said, trying to detainhim. " When
will she be home ? ""Get out of my way, girl I" he cried, and,
slam-ming the gate behind him, he strode down the street.<pb
n="432"/>CHAPTER XXIX.WHEN Dr. Howe reached his own door, Helenwas
waiting for him.She had been sitting on the porch alone for morethan
an hour. She had been very quiet; there was.none of that restlessness
which excitement producedin her uncle or cousin; but when she saw
Dr. How.,she rose, and stood trembling at the head of thesteps. The
rector flung himself out of the carriagealmost before it stopped.s" I
want to see you, Helen," he said. "I havesomething to say to you. Come
into the library."She followed him silently, and when he had closedthe
door he turned and looked at her. " Now, mychild," he began, "you must
listen to what I haveto say."He stood with one hand on his hip, and
lifted theforefinger of the other as he spoke. "I have seenthat man. I
have been insulted by him. He is asfirm as the devil can make him that
you shall notreturn to him. Now, I have no right to interferebetween
husband and wife; you are entirely free atany moment to follow any
course you may wish.At the same time, I must tell you that I shall
respectyou more if you do not return to him. And I wantto add one
other thing: from this time, his name isnot to be spoken in my
presence."<pb n="433"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            433Helen's
face had grown slowly whiter. " Oh, you-will not understand! " she
said hoarsely; but he in-terrupted her." I am sorry for you, my
darling. Oh, what ablow this would have been for your mother! PoorMary
felt any family trouble so deeply. But youmust be a woman, you must
bear it bravely. Yes,your marriage with this fanatic was a terrible
mis-take, but we must bear it."Helen shook her head; she could not
speak. Shehad not known that she had hoped anything fromher uncle's
visit, but this final despair almost over-powered her."He thinks you
are going to change your mindin a week or two," he went on. " I 'd say
he was in-sane if he were not so cruel! There is too muchmethod in his
madness. There! I cannot speakof it; let us drop the subject. Your
place in myheart is secure; I trust you will never leave me; buton
this one topic we cannot meet." Then with asudden tenderness, " Oh,
Helen, how hard this is foryou ! You must try to forgive him, - I
cannot.""Forgive him?" she said, almost in a whisper,her beautiful
eyes dilating and her lips white. " Oh,John, how I have wronged you,
if they think I haveanything to forgive!"Dr. Howe looked at her, and
seemed to swallow asob; then he opened his arms, and, drawing her
headdown on his shoulder, "Poor child," he said, " poorchild!"SBut
this softening on his part met no responsefrom Helen. " You do not
understand John," shesaid, " and so-- so please do not think about
me."<pb n="434"/>-434        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.The rebuff sent the
rector baclk to his own resent.ment. "Remember, I do not wish to speak
of himagain, Helen. I have nothing more to say."Nor would he say more
to Lois and Mrs. Dalethan that John Ward was inflexible, and he
wishedno further discussion upon the subject; he also for-bade any
urging that Helen should return to herhusband."Well, but, brother,
what explanation shall wegive of her being here?" asked Mrs. Dale
anx-iously.'4I'm sure I don't know," he answered impa-tiently;
"anything but the truth.""Why, Archibald! " his sister cried, in a

of an excuse. Of course, don'tsay anything which is untrue, but don't
tell peopleour private affairs.""Do you think she 'll ever go back to
him?"Mrs. ])ale inquired, looking at him meditatively overher
glasses."I hope not!" he said savagely. "Now stop,Adele, stop ! I will
not discuss that man ! ""Where did she get her obstinacy?" Mrs,
Dalesighed. " I suppose it was from her father's side.And the whole
affair is so ill-bred; one would knowHelen was not all a Howe. I
always felt there wassomething lacking in Charles Jeffrey, though

well-born people. She used to sit up straightand uncomfortable in a
carriage. I never saw herlean back, and I always said that that girl's
grand-mother was n't used to riding in carriages ! So yousee, that's
where Helen gets her - her bad taste.""Well, don't talk about it,"
said Dr. Howe, walk-ing restlessly back and forth.Mrs. Dale took off
her glasses, and rubbed themon the corner of her black silk apron. "It
wouldnever have happened," she said positively, "if theyhad had
children. I declare, I " - and she stopped,as though about to suggest
that Helen should adopta child at once. Mrs. Dale usually blamed
Johnand Helen with equal impartiality, but to-day thefault seemed to
belong entirely to her niece. Shewas very much puzzled to know how she
was to"make excuses " without telling an untruth. "I '11just speak to
Giff about it," she thought;  it alldepends on the way Deborah
Woodhouse hears it,and Giff is really quite sensible, and can advise
mewhat to tell her."She saw him that afternoon, but, as she said
after-wards in reluctant confidence to her husband, " Giffhasn't much
sense, after all. He thought it wasbest to just tell the truth about
it.""Yes?" responded Mr. Dale. "Well, I haveoften noticed, I am only
apt to admire the goodsense of people who agree with me. Gifford
doubt-ss has not the advantage of feeling sure that hiswishes
constitute the standards of right and wrong.""Nonsense," said
Mrs. Dale; " I am sure I don'tknow what you are talking about."<pb
n="436"/>486         JOHN WARD, PREACHER."Well, what are you going to
do ?" asked herhusband."Oh," Mrs. Dale answered, "Gifford will
tellDeborah Woodhouse the truth (Helen wants himto), but he will do it
as carefully and as mildly aspossible. And he will make her promise to
keep itto herself. But you know Deborah Woodhouse;she trickles - there
is no other word for it - every-thing. She could n't keep a secret to
save her life.But Helen will have it so. Oh, dear, dear, dear!Heaven
save us from willful women !"Gifford broke the news to his aunts as
wisely ashe knew how, but he did not hide the truth. It wasnot until
the day before he went back to Lockhaventhat he told them; he had put
it off as long as hecould, hoping, as Dr. Howe had done, that JohnWard
would see how useless it was to carry out hisplan. Gifford had found
the sisters together. MissRuth was at work in her studio, while Miss
Deborahsat in the doorway, in the shadow of the grape-vines,topping
and tailing gooseberries into a big bluebowl. She had a handful of
crushed thyme in herlap, and some pennyroyal."It isn't roses," Miss
Deborah remarked, "butit is better than Ruth's turpentine. And so long
asI have got to sit here (for I will sit here while she 'scopying the
miniature; it is a sacred charge), thepennyroyal is stronger than the
paint."Miss Ruth, her hands neatly gloved, was mixingher colors a
little wearily; somehow, on her canvas,the face of the little sister
lost what beauty it hadever known.<pb n="437"/>F-        .JOHN WARD,
PREACHER. "I can't get the eyes," Miss Ruth sighed. " Ihave a great
mind to help you with your preserving,sister."" My dear Ruth," said
Miss Deborah, with muchdignity, " do I try to do your work ?""But you
know you could n't paint, dear Deb-orah," said the younger sister
eagerly. The roundchina-blue eyes of the little sister stared at her
ma-liciously."Well," returned Miss Deborah, running hersmall hand
through the gooseberries in the bowl," neither could you make
gooseberry jelly, or evena tart." Then seeing her nephew lounging down
theflagged path to the door of the studio, his straw hatpushed back
and his hands in his pockets, she wassuddenly reminded of his
packing. "I hope, Giff,dear," she cried, " you left plenty of room in
yourtrunk ? I have a number of articles I want you totake.""There's
lots of room, aunt Deborah," he antswered. " You know I had to put in
a bag of strawto fill up, when I came on, -I could n't have
thingsrattle around."Miss Deborah laughed. "You need your aunt tolook
after you, my dear."" Or a wife," said Miss Ruth, looking up at
himover her gleaming spectacles." Nonsense," replied her sister
vigorously; " don't*put such ideas into his head, if you please. I
mustsay such jokes are not in good taste, dear Ruth."But Miss Rath was
more anxious about her lightthan Gifford's marriage. "You are really
so big,<pb n="438"/>38   oJOHN WARD, PREACHER.
1Giff," she complained mildly, "you darken thewhole studio, standing
there in the doorway. Dopray sit down."Gifford obediently took his
seat upon the step,and this brought his face on a level with
MissRuth's."Oh, that is nice," the little lady said, withgentle
enthusiasm. " I shall have your eyes to lookat. I have not been able
to get' the little sister'seyes just to suit me."It made no difference
to Miss Ruth that Gifford'seyes were gray and full of trouble. "Aunt
Deb-orah," he said abruptly, " Helen Ward is not goingback to
Lockhaven for the present. Indeed, I donot know when she will go."Miss
Deborah forgot her gooseberries, in her sur-prise. "Not going back!"
she cried, while hersister said, "Is Mr. Ward coming here ?"Then
Gifford told them the story as briefly as hecould, interrupted by
small cries of amazement anddismay.  "Well," exclaimed Miss Deborah,
herdelicate hands uplifted, "well! I never heard ofsuch a thing! How
shocking, how ill-bred ! Andshe is going to be at the rectory ? Ruth,
my dear,you must never go there without me, do you hear?It is not
proper. A wife separated from her hus-band! - Dear me, dear me !""How
can she leave him? " gasped Miss Ruth."Married people ought to love
each other so thatthey could not be parted."'" You have never been in
a position to judge howthey ought to love each other," said Miss
Deborah<pb n="439"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            49sharply.  "But
this is what comes of youthfulmarriages, Gifford. A person should have
reachedyears of maturity before thinking of marriage.Such things do
not happen when people are reason-ably old"-"But not too old, sister,"
Miss Ruth interrupted,a little color creeping into her faded
cheek.Miss Deborah did not notice the amendment; shewas anxious to
hear the practical side of the matter,-and had questions to ask about
Helen's money, andwhether Gifford supposed that that man would
doanything for her; but except their grave disapprovalthat Helen
should differ from her husband, nothingwas said of theology. As they
talked, the sistersgrew full of sympathy, which waxed and waned asthey
thought of Helen's sorrow, or the improprietyof her action." I shall
make her some jelly directly," said MissDeborah, " and put in plenty
of Madeira; the poorthing needs strength."" This must be the reason,"
Miss Ruth said, - shehad put her brushes down some time ago, - "
thatshe was in such distress that day at her mother'sgrave. Oh, how
trying this is for her! Indeed, Iam sure death is easier to bear, when
one - loves -than a parting like this."" Really, dear Ruth," returned
her sister, holdingher head very straight, " you would not say that
ifpau knew what it was to lose a -friend, by death.At least Mr. Ward
is alive, even if Helen cannot seehim. Ah, dear me! Well, I wonder how
Adele ,Dale feels now?  I should be miserable if we had<pb
n="440"/>4t0         JONt WARD, PREACHER. such a thing happen in our
family. A husband andwife quarrel, and separate ! Shocking !""But
there is no quarrel, you know," Gifford pro-tested slowly, and for the
third or fourth time.But Miss Deborah brushed this aside. " Theyare
separated; it is the same thing. In our family,an unhappy marriage was
never known. Even whenyour grandfather's sister married a
Bellingham,-and of course everybody knows the Bellingham tem.per, -
and they quarreled, just three weeks to a dayafter the wedding, she
never thought of such a dis.graceful thing as leaving him. I have
heard dearmamma say she never spoke to him again, exceptwhen she had
to ask for money; that almost killedher, she was so proud. But she
never would havelowered herself by leaving him. Yes, this is
reallymost improper in poor dear Helen."Miss Deborah's feelings
vibrated, even while shewas making the jelly, and though it was
finally sent,she balanced her kindness by saying to Mrs. Dalethat it
did not seem just right for a young thinglike Lois to know of such a
painful affair. It gaveMiss Deborah so much pleasure to say this to
herold enemy that she made excuses for Helen for awhole day
afterwards.Late that afternoon Gifford went to say good-byat the
rectory. It was a still, hazy August day,with a hint of autumn in the
air; sometimes a yel-lowing leaf floated slowly down, or one would
noticethat the square toer of St. Michael's could be seen,and that the
ivy which covered its south side wasbeginning to redden.<pb
n="441"/>JOOHN WARD, PREACHER.          4Miss Helen was not at home,
Jean said. Shethought she'd gone up to the graveyard, - she mostalways
went there.So Gifford started in'search of her. "She oughtnot to be
alone so much," he thought, and he won-dered, with a man's dullness in
such matters, why,if she and Lois had made up after that one
quarrel,they were not the same tender friends. He metLois at the
rectory gate. She was coming from thevillage, and there was a look in
her face which gavehim a sudden jealous pain. She held a letter in
herhand, and her eyes were running over with happi-ness; her lips
smiled so that they almost broke intolaughter as she spoke." Something
seems to make yowt very happy,Lois-? "he said."It does," she cried, -
"very, very I ""I am glad," he said, wishing she could find it inher
heart to tell him of her joy."Forsythe has come to his senses," he
thought."I suppose he has been unusually loving, confoundhim!"The two
young people parted, each a little graverthan when they met. " How he
does like to be withHelen ! " Lois thought, as she went on, and
Giffordsighed impatiently as he wished Forsythe were moreworthy of
her.He found Helen walking wearily home alone."I wanted to say
good-by," he said, taking herhand in his big warm grasp, " and just
tell you thatI '11 look after him, you know, in any way I can.I '11
see him every day, Helen." She looked at him<pb n="442"/>442
JOHN W:ARD, PREACHER. gratefully, but did not speak. "I wish," Gifford
continued, hesitating, "you would not take suchlong walks by
yourself. Why don't you let Lois  )come: with you ?"
|" She would not care to," she answered briefly. " Oh, I think you are
wrong there," he remon-strated. " She is lonely, too." Helen seemed to
con-sider. " You know it has been an unhappy summerfor Lois, and if
you shut her out of your sorrow " -"I did not mean to be selfish," she
replied, notseeing how much Gifford spoke for her own sake,"and I do
not shut her out; but so long as she onlysympathizes with me, and not
with John too, I can-not let her talk to me about it.""That is not
quite just, Helen," he said; andafterward, Helen acknowledged this.She
put her hands into his, when he turned to gohome, and searched his
face with sad, eager eyes." You are going to see him,- oh, Giff,
you'll seeJohn !" she said.Lois saw them talking, as they came to the
rec-tory door, with a dull feeling of envy. Giffordnever seemed to
care to talk much to her. Whatwas that Miss Deborah had said of his
once caringfor Helen ? She had the good sense to be ashamedof herself
for remembering it, but a thought whichcomes even into an unwilling
mind cannot be drivenaway without leaving its impress; the point of
viewis subtilely and unconsciously changed. She was notaltogether
cordial to Gifford, when he said good-byto her, which he was quick to
feel. "He thinksonly of Helen," she said to herself. " I suppose
he<pb n="443"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.            443has forgotten
anything he ever said to me, and mypromise, too. I'm ready enough with
promises," shethought, with a bitter little smile. But even thismemory
could not keep that happiness which Giffordhad seen from shining in
her eyes; and when shewent up-stairs, Helen noticed it.Perhaps because
of Gifford's gentle reproof sheroused herself to say, as he had done,
"Yotr aevery happy, Lois ?" Oh, I am, I am  " she cried
impulsively. "Oh,Helen, I have something to tell you."  A very
littlesympathy in her cousin's voice brought her eager con-fidence to
her lips. " Oh, Helen, a letter has come !""John ? " she hardly
breathed. For one exquisiten maimet,.whiah bad yet its lbaikegouid ti

twisted her fingers together, with a nervoussort of joy. "I've just
heard," she said; "Mrs.Forsythe has just written to me."gA' d she is
very well ?" Helen asked. She hadalmost forgotten her cousin's grief
and anxiety aboutMrs. Forsythe. It all seemed so long ago and
Sounimportant.           - ."No, n9," Lois said, "she says she's very
sick;but oh, Helen, Dick Forsythe is engaged to be mai-ried !"Helen
looked puzzled. " I don't understand."- "Never mind," Lois cried
joyously, "he is, aniI am so happy! "<pb n="444"/>CHAPTER XXX.WHiEN
the summer had faded into autumn, Ash.urst had not yet recovered from

long time, for William Denner'sface was a constant reminder of his
grief; but byand by it faded, and, as Gertrude never came backto
Ashurst, people even said very kindly things abouther.But Helen Ward
continued to live among them.-Indeed, the excitement was so great at
first thatMiss Deborah did not remember for some time towrite to
Gifford that Dick Forsythe was engaged toa New York girl. " She really
could scarcely blamehim," she had added, " for he could hardly be
ex-pected to keep his engagement with Lois after thisdisgraceful
affair in her family."Gifford read that part of the  tter again,

hurry to Ashurst. "Notfor my own sake," he reasoned, "but just to
bethere. I would never show that I knew how he hadtreated her. She
should not have an instant's mor.tification in my presence. But she
might just see,without being told, that I loved her through itall."He
even rose, and began to study a time-table;but he frowned a little and
put it down, and wentand ;1oked dut of the window a while. "Helenwould
be more unhappy if she thought I were nothere to look after Ward. Yes,
I must wait till hegets stronger. Perhaps next month "-Then, shaking
himself together, with a revulsionof commaoti sense, 4As she is
unhappy, she won'tcare 'ewther I    t there or not, or may be

desireto rush to Ashurst, the thought that Helen's sorrowwould be a
little greater if she could not think ofhim as near her husband,
helped to keep him at hispost.But it might have been good for Helen to
havehad the young man's frank and healthy understand-ing of her
position. She was growing every daymore lonely and self-absorbed; she
was losing herclear perceptions of the values of life; she
becamewarped, and prejudiced, and very silent. She evenfanciedi with a
morbid self-consciousness whichwould have been impossible before,
that she hadnever possessed the love of her uncle and cousin, andhad
always been an alien. This subtile danger to<pb n="446"/>446       f
'JHN WARD, PREACHER.her generous nature was checked in an
unexpectedway.One afternoon, late in September, she went asusual,
alone, to the graveyard on East Hill. Theblue haze lay like a ribbon
through the valley andacross the hills; the air was still, and full of
the pun.gent fragrance of burning brush, and yellow leavesrustled
about her feet. The faded grass had beenbeaten down by the rain, and
was matted above thegraves; here and there a frosted weed stood
straight.and thin against the low soft sky; some late golden*ro i btla
a g the eedge, of the -meadow among thepurple asters, and a single
stalk of cardinal flowersflashed out beside the lichen-covered wall;
but allthe rest of the world was a blur of yellow and gray.Helen sat
down on a stone, and listened to the smallwood sounds around her. A
beech leaf, twisted likethe keel of a fantastic boat, came pattering
down onthe dead leaves; a bird stirred in the pine behindher, and now
and then a cricket gave a muffledchirp.It was here Mr. Dale found her,
her head restingforlornly on her hands; she was absently watchinga
gray squirrel who had ventured from his covertin the wall, and was
looking at her with curious,twinkling eyes. "My dear," said Mr. Dale
gently, "they told meat the rectory they thought you were up here, so
Icame to see if you would let me walk home withyou."Helen started as
he spoke, and the squirrel scam-pered away. " Did you come for that ?"
she said,touched in spite of her bitter thoughts.<pb n="447"/>JOHN
WARD, PREACHER.              ,Mr. Dale pushed his broad-brimmed hat
back oihis head, so that his face seemed to have a blackaureola around
it. "Yes,"'hereplied, regarding herwith anxious blue eyes,-" yes. I am
grieved to-have you so much alone; yet I know how naturalit is to
desire to be alone."Helen did not answer."I hope," he went on,
hesitating, "you will notthink I intrude if I say - I came because I
wantedto say that I have a great respect for your husband,Helen."Helen
turned sharply, as though she would haveclasped his hands, and then
put her own over herface, which was quivering with sudden tears.Mr
Dale. toupped ler s holder gently. "Yes, agreai respect. tove like his
inspires reverence. Itis almost divine."Helen's assent was inaudible."
Not, my dear," the old man continued, "that Ido not regret - yes, with
all my heart I deplore -the suffering for you both, by which his love
isproved. Yet I recognize with awe that it is love.And when one has
come so near the end of life as Ihave, it is much to have once seen
love. We lookinto the mysteries of God when we see how divinea human
soul can be. Perhaps I have no right tospeak of what is so sacredly
yours, yet it is properthat you should know that the full meaning of
thiscalamity can be understood.  It is not all grief,Helen, to be
loved as you are."She could not speak; she clung to him in a pas-sion
of tears, and the love and warmth she had<pb n="448"/>448
JO1N WARD, PREACHER.thought she should never feel again began to
stirabout her heart."So you will be strong for him," Mr. Dale
saidgently, his wrinkled hand stroking her soft hair."Be patient,
because we have perhaps loved you toomuch to be just to him; yet your
peace would teachus justice. Be happier, my dear, that we may
un-derstand him. You see what I mean? "Helen did see; courage began to
creep back, andher reserve melted and broke down with a storm oftears,
too long unshed. "I will try," she said bro-ely,      6h,-- wi-try   -
She did not say whatshe would try to do, but to struggle for John's
sakegave her strength and purpose for all of life. Shewould so live
that no one could misunderstand him.Mr. Dale walked home with her, but
he did notspeak to her again of her sorrow. The impulse hadbeen given,
and her conscience aroused; the harder-struggle of coming back to the
daily life of othersshe 'must meet alone. And she met it
bravely.Little by little she tried to see the interests andsmall
concerns of people about her, and very gradu-ally the heavy atmosphere
of the rectory began tolighten. Dr. Howe scarcely knew how it was
thatthere was a whist party in his library one Fridayevening; rather a
silent one, with a few sighs fralmthe Misses Woodhouse and a
suspicious dimness inMr. Dale's eyes. The rector someiow slipped
intothe vacant chair he said he thotght he was so oldwhist would not
hurt him, if they were willing toteach him. But as he swept the board
at the firstdeal, and criticised his partner's lead at the
second,instruction was deemed superfluous.<pb n="449"/>JOHN WARD,
PREACHER.             449By degrees, Lois and Helen came nearer
together.There was no explanation: the differences had beentoo subtile
for words, at least on Lois's side, and tohave attempted it would have
made a vague impres-sion harden into permanence.No one recognized an
effort on Helen's part, andshe only knew it herself when she realized
that itwas a relief to be with Mr. Dale.. He understood;she could be
silent with him. So she came veryoften to his little basement office,
and spent longmornings with him, helping him label some books,or
copying-notes which he had intended "gettinginto shape" these twenty
years. She liked the still-ness and dimness of the small room, with
its smellof leather-cowveed vefes, -or whiff of wood smokefrom the
fireplace-  ' Mrs. Dale rarely disturbed them.    If Helenfinds any
pleasure in that musty old room," she said,one cold January morning,
"'I 'm sure I'm glad.But she would be a great deal more sensible
andcheerful if she'd sit up in the parlor with me, if shedid n't do
anything more than play patience. Butthen, Helen never was like other
people."And so she left her niece and her husband, with alittle
good-natured contempt in her eyes, and wentup to her own
domains. Mr. Dale was arrangingsome plants on a shelf acros one of the
windowgQjand Helen was watching him. " They generally diebefore the
winter is out," he said, " but perhaps, withyou to look after them
they 'll pull through."He was in his flowered dressing-gown, and
wasstanding on tiptoe, reaching up for-one of the mil-<pb
n="450"/>450        JOHN WARD, PREACHER.dewed flower-pots. "These are
orange plants," heexplained proudly. " I planted the seeds a monthago,
and see how they've grown." He put his glasseson and bent down to
examine them, with an absorbedlook. The pot that held the six
spindling shoots hadstreaks of white mould down its sides, and the
earthwas black and hard with the deluge of water withwhich Mr. Dale's
anxious care usually began theseason. He began now to loosen it gently
with hispenknife, saying, "I 'm sure they '11 flourish if youlook
after them."I will if I 'm here, uncle Henry," she replied."Ah, my
dear," lhe said- looking at her sharply,"you are not thinking of that
hospital plan again ?""Yes," she answered, " I cannot help it. I
feelas though I must be of some use in the world." Shewas standing in
the stream of wintry sunshine whichflooded the narrow window, and
Mr. Dale saw thatsome white threads had begun to show in the
bronze-browp waves of her hair. "Yes," she continued,"it is so hard to
keep still. I must do something,and be something."Mr. Dale stopped
digging in his flower-pots, andlooked at her without speaking for a
moment; thenhe said, "I wonder if you will not be somethingnobler by
the discipline of this quiet life, Helen?And are you not really doing
something if you rottseus out of our sleepy satisfaction with our own
lives,and make us more earnest ? I krow that cannot beyour object, as
it wouid defeat itself by self-con.sciousness, but it is true, my
dear."She did not speak.<pb n="451"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.

negative anywhere., You have takena stand for a vital principle, and
it must make usbetter. Truth is like heat or light; its vibrationsare
endless, and are endlessly felt. There is some-thing very beautiful to

absolutely-opposite and extreme points, have yet this force oftruth in
your souls . You have both touched theprinciple of life, - he fem  one

telegram."I'm afraid John is ill," Lois said, the quicktears springing
to her eyes."Give it to me," said Helen.Reluctantly Lois gave her the

sweeps away all small things," he said, ashe sat alone in his study
that night,-" time, hope,fear, even grief itself ! "His wife did not
enter into such analysis; she hadbeen summone[, and had seen to wraps

eould undierstnd she had known the sorrow of death, and all the
im-patience which had stood between Helen and herselfwas swept away in

too had gone to Mercer. Helen had not seemedeven to notice her
presence in .the carriage, and shedared not speak. She thought, in a
vague way, thatshe had never known her cousin before.  Helen,with
white, immovable face, sat leaning forward, herhand on the door, her
tearless eyes straining into thedistance, and a tense, breathless air
of waiting abouther."May I go to Lockhaven with you?" Lo:     1softly;
but Helen did not answer untWA x :re-peated the question, and then she
trned with thestart of one suddenly wakefied; and looked at her." Oh,

further than Mercer."Then she noticed that the window beside Lois was/

forward to close it. After that, shelapsed again into her stony
silence.When they reached the-station, it was she whobought the
ticket, and then again seemed startled tofind the girl by her side. "
Good-by," she said, asLois kissed her, but there was no change in her
face, either of relief or regret, when her cousin lefther.How that
long slow journey passed Helen neverknew. She was not even conscious
of its length.When Gifford met her, she gave him one question-ing
look."Yes," he said tenderly, "you are in time. Hewould not let me
send before, Helen; and I knewya wouiM:    ot -come mamle  I said,
'John sends for-you.'"No," she answered. He told her, in their
quicktide to the parsonage, that this had been the thirdhemorrhage,
and John had not rallied; but it wasnot until the night before that he
had known the endwas inevitable and near, and had sent for his
wife.Oh, the strangeness of those village streets! Hadshe -ever been
away?    These months in Ashurstwere a dream; here only was reality

ran by Helen's side, and furtively kissedher hand. There was a light
burning in the study,but Helen stood at the table in the hall and
tookoffher bonnet and cloak."I will go and tell him you are here,"

calmly, and left Giffordand the servant standing in the entry.She did
not even pause at the door; there' seemedno need to gather strength
for the shock of thatmeeting; she was all strength and love.The room
was lighted only by the fire, and thebed was in shadow.There were no
words; those empty, dying armswere stretched out to her, and she
gathered himclose to her heart.The house was strangely silent. Again

heard that soft soundwi c tIo.b  i- 'wetwhen she soothes her baby on
her breast, and againa low murmur, which died away as though evenwords
were an intrusion.All that long winter day, Gifford, in his
intenseanxiety lest Helen should not come in time, and hisdistress for
the sorrow of this little household, hadbeen calmed and comforted by
John's serene cour-age. He knew that death was near, but there wasan
exultant look in his fading eyes, and sometimeshis lips moved in
grateful prayer. Perhaps hisphysical extremity had dulled his fears
for his wife'ssalvation into a conviction that his death was to bethe
climax of God's plans for her. He was     ;-,wildered at the
temptation of greater ifj   i:"'prospect of her presence than gratii

then went quietly down to John'sstudy, and found a book to while away
the time.And then they waited.When the first faint lightening of the
sky came,and the chill of dawn began to creep through thesilent house,
Helen came out of the closed room.She put her hand upon Gifford's
shoulder. " Go andrest," she said; "there is no need to sit here
anylonger. John is dead,"<pb n="456"/>CHAPTER XXXI,AFTER it was all
over, they begged her to go backto Ashurst."You can't stay here," Lois
entreated - she hadcome with Mr. Dale as soon as the news of
JohnWard's death reached Ashurst- "you can't liveamong these people,
Helen."But Helen shook her head. "They are John'speople. I cannot go
yet."Lois thought with a shiver of the exhortations ofthe clergymen
who had come to the funeral to offi-ciate. She wondered how Helen
could stay whereevery one had heard her sin of unbelief publiclyprayed
for; yet, with her cousin's brave sad eyesupon her, she dared not give
this as a reason whyHelen should leave Lockhaven.Mr. Dale did not urge
her to return; he knew hertoo well. He only said when he went away,
holdingher hands in his and looking at her, his gentle oldface
quivering with tears, "He is all yours now, mydear; death has given
you what life could not. INomatter where you are, nothing can change
the per-fect possession."There was a swift, glad light in the eyes she
liftedto his for a moment, but she did not answer.At first she had
been stunned and dazed; she hadnot realized what her sorrow was; an

came to her in the thought that John was free,and the terrible and
merciful commonplace of pack-ing and putting in order, hid her from
herself.She had stayed behind in the small brown parson.age, with only
Alfaretta for a companion, -and Gif-ford's unspoken sympathy when he
came every dayto see her. Once she answered it. "I am glad it is John
instead of me," she said,with an uplifted look; ".the pain is not
his.""And it is s imucha happier for him now," Gif-ford ventured to
say, -" he must see so clearly; andthe old grief is lost in joy.""No,"
Helen answered wearily; "you must notsay those things to me. I cannot

cannot hope; I dare not. I could notgo on living if I thought he were
living somew-here,and needing me. No, it is ended. I have had
mylife."She listened in eager and pathetic silence to everydetail of
John's life since she had left him whichAlfaretta or Gifford could
give her. A little later,she asked them both to write out all that
they re-membered of those last days. She dared not trustthe sacred
memory only to her heart, lest the obliter-ating years should steal it
from her. And then, byand by, she gathered up all her power of
endurance,aad-quietly went back to Ashurst. That last nightin the
litte low-browed parsonage not even Alfarettawas with her. Gifford

early in the morning; but she methim calmly, with perfect
comprehension of the anx-iety in his face."You need not be afraid for
me," she said. " Ido not dare to be a coward."And then she walked to
the station, without onelook back at the house where she had known
hergreatest joy and greatest grief.The summer had left spring far
behind, whenGifford Woodhouse came to Ashurst.He could nbt. stay
i'iloekhavea; the tragedy ofJohn Ward had thrown a shadow upon
_him. --Thepeople did not forget that he was Mrs. Ward'sfriend, and
they made no doubt, the bolder onessaid, that Lawyer Woodhouse was an
infidel, too.So he decided to take an office in Mercer. Thiswould make
it possible for him to come back toAshurst every Saturday, and be with
his aunts untilMonday.Perhaps he did not know it, but Lockhaven
shad-ows seemed deeper than they really were becauseMercer was only
twelve miles from Lois Howe.Not that that could mean anything more
than justthe pleasure of seeing her sometimes. Gifford toldhimself he
had no hope. He searched her occasiolletters in vain for the faintest
hint that she:i1dbe glad to see him. "If there were thb
slightestchance of it," he said, with a sigh, "of course I 'dknow
it. She promised. I suppose she was awfullyattached to that
puppy."However, in spite of hopelessness, he went to<pb

should drop in at the rectory                ' -spending the evening
with Helen after I:.;and Lois had gone to church. Helen never went. "

of the galrai  as beginning to meltinto trembling light as the moon
rose, and the lastflush of sunset faded behind the hills. Helen had
asoft :ait[ rap over her black dress, but Oiffordhad tht     it vas
cool enough to throw a grayshawl across ther feet; he himself was
bareheaded,and sat on the steps, clasping his knees with hishands."
Perhaps so," Helen said, " but I think I am like<pb n="460"/>460

toward the east. I will not comfort myself with lit-:tle candles of
memory or desire, and say, ' This islight!' Perhaps light will never
come to my eyes,I but I will wait, for I believe there is light
some-where."It was much for Helen to say this. No one hadguessed what
was behind her reserve on such sub-jects; perhaps no one had very
greatly cared."Gifford!" she said suddenly. He looked up,surprised at
her tone.-'Yes, Helen ?" "I wish," she sai, " I wish you were as happy
asyou deserve to be." He knew what she meant, and would not repayher
confidence by pretending not to understand." Well, I'm -not as happy
as I desire, perhaps, butno doubt I'm as happy as I deserve.""No," she
answered, "you are not. And oh,Gifford, there is so much sorrow in the
world, theonly thing which makes life possible is love, becausethat is
the only thing which does not change.""I am afraid it can never be for
me,"-he said,after a moment's silence, "except the joy of
givinglove.""Why ?" she asked gently.Gifford did not speak; he rose,
and began to pMweup and down in front of the porch, crossi a
re-crossing the square of light which fell from the openhall door. '"
I ought not to talk about it," he saidat last. "I 've got i down at

having loved once. Aid it is curious, Helen,but in a certain
paradoxical way I'm content sheshould n't. She would not be the woman

darkness. "(Gifforcd"  -sheiw.   n.  ;  .' . ^  .  ' .  .

Gifford did not speak; he turned sharply onhis heel, and began his
restless walk. His silenceras getting .unbearable, when he stopped,

Helen. I do not understandit all, but that ' no matter. Only, don't
you see,it does n't make any difference? If she had beengoing to care,
I should have known it long ago."This was very vague to Helen; she
wondered ifLois had refused him again. But Gifford began totalk
quietly of his life in Mercer, and she did notventure to say anything
more. "After all, theymust work out their own salvation," she
thought." No one can help them, when they both know thefacts."SWe-

Iin Mercer.   But really," he ad&d, AK cught i6otto go too far away
from my aunts, now; and I be-lieve that the highest development of
character cancome from the most commonplace necessities of life."Helen
sighed; she wondered if this commonplaceof Ashurst were her necessity
? For again she wassearching for her place in the world, - the place
thatneeded her, and was to give her the happiness ofusefulness; and
she had even thought vaguely thatshe might find some work in
Lockhaven, amongJohn's people, and for them. They both fell into
thesilence of their own thoughts, until the rector'and hisdaughter
came back from church, and Gifford wenhome.

day Willie Denner, who had come<pb n="463"/>JOHN WARD, PREACHER.to
read law, and was aspiring to be his clerk, foau4him staring out of
the window, with a new client'spapers lying untouched before
him. After all, hethought, would it be wrong, would it trouble Lois(he
had said he should never trouble her), if hejust told her how the
thought of her helped him,how she was a continual inspiration in his
life ? " IfI saw it bothered her, I could stop," he argued.And so,
reasoning with himself, he rode over fromMercer late that Saturday
night. The little ladieswere, as usual, delighted to see him. These
weeklyvisits were charming; their nephew could be admiredand fussed
over to their hearts' content, but was offagain before they had time
to feel their spall resource*at aa,?enI, e., ^te-ae~fr^<6!H^,,hely

Woodhouse; each took an arm of the youngman, whose very size made him
imposing, and walkedin a stately way to the door of
St. Michael's. Theywould gladly have been supported by him to
theirpew, but it would have been, Miss Deborah said,really flaunting
their nephew in the faces of lessfortunate families, for Ashurst could
not boast ofanother young man.Miss Ruth wore her new bonnet that day
in honorof his presence. She had taken it from the bandboxand
carefully removed its wrapping of tissue paper,looking anxiously at
the clouds as she smoothed thelavender strings and pinched the white
asters on theside, before she decided that it was safe to wear
it.Gifford loaked up the rectory lane as they dr&wnear the church, and
Miss Deborah noticed it. "Giff,<pb n="464"/>IW4         Jt6LN WARD,
PREACHER.dear," she asked, " did you observe, last Sunday, howill poor
little Lois looked?""No," he said, somewhat startled."Ah, yes," said
Miss Ruth, nodding her head sothat the white asters trembled, " she
has never reallygotten over that disappointment about young
For-sythe.""But she was not engaged to him," respondedGifford boldly."
Not engaged," Miss Deborah admitted, " but shefully expected to be. He
did not treat her honor-ab-r 1-iAhm- e   doiof that   Bu her
-affectionswere unalterably his."        --     "How do you know
that?" demanded her nephew." Why, my dear child," said Miss Ruth,
"thereis no doubt of it. Adele Dale told dear Deborahthe whole
story. Of course she had it from Lois."" Not that it makes the
slightest difference in myposition," Gifford thought, as he sat
crowding downthe pain of it, and looking at Lois, sitting in therosy
light of the window of the left transept. "Iam just where I was
before, and I '11 tell her, if itdoes not seem to bother her."After
church, there was the usual subdued gossipabout the door, and while
Gifford waited for hisaunts, who had something to say to the rector,
he lis,tened to Mrs. Dale, who said in her incisive voice,"Is n't it
too bad Helen is n't here? I should think,whether she wanted to or
not, she'd come for herhusband's sake." Even the apology of death
hadnot made Mrs. Dale pardon John Ward.But Mr. Dale mdolay

my thoughts!"               'So, with the utmost innocence, Miss Debo
planted the seeds of hopelessness and jealou  l hearts of both these
young people. Gifford rest of the long, still Sunday wandering rests

guess Sarah will give me something toeat. And, aunt Deborah, I don't

they were secretlyvery proud that his business should occupy him
somuch.<pb n="466"/>466         JOHN WARD, PREACHER. There was a
silver mist across the hills, when Gif-ford led his horse out of the
barn the next morning,and the little sharp paving-stones in the
stable-yard,with thin lines of grass between them, were shiningwith
dew. The morning-glories about the kitchenporch had flung their rosy
horns toward the east, asthough to greet the sunrise.  Sarah stood
underthem, surveying the young man regretfully. " Youraunts won't half
like it, Mr. Gifford," she said,"that you would- n't eat a proper
breakfast."But he put his foot in the stirrup, and flung him-self into
his saddle. He was too much absorbed inhis own concerns to reflect
that Miss Deborah wouldbe distressed if her Scotch collops were
slighted, andthat was not like Gifford. However, he was youngand a
man, so his grief did not prevent him fromlighting a cigarette. The
reins fell on the horse'sneck as he climbed East Hill, and Gifford
turned,with one hand on the bay's broad flanks, to lookdown at
Ashurst. The valley was still full of. mist,that flushed and trembled
into gold before it disap-peared at the touch of the sun. There was a
flutterof birds' wings in the bushes along the road, and thelight wind
made the birch leaves flicker and dance;but there was hardly another
sound, for his horsewalked deliberately in the grass beside the
road,until suddenly a dog barked. Gifford drew his reinsharply. " That
wast Max ! " he said, and lookedabout for him, even rising a little in
his stirrups." How fond she is of the old fellow! " he thought.In
another moment the dog ran across the road,his red coat marked with
dew; then the bushes werepushed aside, and his mistress followed
him.<pb n="467"/>JOHN WARD, PRaC4iQAs             -."Why, Gifford "
she said."Why, Lois I " he exclaimed with her, and thethey looked at
each other.The young man threw away his cigarette, and,springing from
his horse, slipped the reins over hisarm, and walked beside her." Are

the back of her head, and the wind hadblown the curls around her face
into a sunny tan-gle, and made her cheeks as fresh as a wild rose."You

to get mushrooms for father," sheexplaied.   It is best to get them
early, while thedew is on them. Ther     e are  good many aroundthat
little old ruin further up the road, you know.""Yes, I know," he
said. (He felt himself sud-denly in a tumult of uncertainty. "It would
beno harm just to say a word," he thought. "Whyshould n't she know-no
Matter if she can nevercare herself- that I care? It would not trouble
her.No, I am a fool to think of it,--I won't.")  "Butit is so early
for you to be out alone," he said. "Doyou take care of her, Max? ""Max

she blushed, lest (if-ford should think that she had thought be was
notQnstant,<pb n="468"/>468         JOHN WARD, PREACHER.But
Gifford's thoughts were never so compli-cated. With him, it was
either, "She loves me,"or, "She does not;" he never tormented
himself,after the fashion of women, by wondering what thislook meant,
or that inflection, and fearing that theinnermost recesses of his mind
might be guessedfrom a calm and indifferent face."You see the old
chimney ? " Lois said, as theydrew near the small ruin. " Some
mushrooms growright in on the hearth."It was rather the suggestion of
a ruin, for thewaplls-'e wert  : ir; - ;ay this -tome ehiriney.with

withspikes of brown dead blossoms, grew tall and thickaround it, and
roses, gone back to wild singleness,blbssomed near the steps and along
a path, which wasonly a memory, the grass had tangled so above it.Max
kept his nose under Lois's hand, and thehorse stumbled once over a
stone that had rolledfrom the broken foundation and hidden itself
be-neath a dock. The mushrooms had opened theirlittle shining brown
umbrellas, as Lois had said, onthe very hearth, and she stooped down
to gatherthem and put them in her basket of sweet graS;From the bushes

to-  " Lois, I'd like -I 'd like totell you something, if you don't
mind.""What?" she said pleasantly; her basket wasfull, and they began
to walk back to the road again.Gifford stopped to let his horse crop
the thick wetgrass about a fallen gate-post. He threw his armover the
bay's neck, and Lois leaned her elbows onthe other post, swinging her
basket lightly while shewaited for him to speak. The mist had quite
goneby this time, and the sky was a fresh, clear blue.'" Well," he
began, suddenly realizing that this wasa great deal harder than he had
supposed (" She '11think I 'm going to bother her with a proposal,"he
thought),- "well, the fact 'is, Lois, there'ssomething I want you to

Deborah's suggestion was a cer-tainty to: *i.S She clasped her hands
tight aroundthe handle of her grass basket; Gifford should notse them

my head to tell you," Giffordwent on nervously. "I hope you won't feel
that Iam not keeping my word "-She held- her white chin a little
higher. "I don'tknow of any ' word,' as you call it, that there is

in her voice."But I am sure," he said hurriedly, "it won'tmake you

that it always will be,and that love, no matter if "-"Oh, wait a

turned away so that he could only see theblush which had crept up to
her temple, " but I" -He waited, but she did not go on. Then he
sud-denly took her in his arms and kissed her without aword; and Max,

all it was onlypart of the morning, and the sunrise, and
Natureherself."And to think- that it's I! " Lois said a
minuteafterward."Why, who else could it be?" cried
Giffordrapturously.But Lois shook her head; even in her joy shewas
ashamed of herself. "I won't even rememberit," she thought.Of course
there were many explanations. Eachwas astonished at the other for not

he would not hear. Whenthey came to the rectory gate,- and never did
ittake so long to walk from East Hill to the rectory,- Gifford said,
"Now let's go and tell Helen;we've kept her out of our joy too long."
They mether in the cool, dusky hall, and Gifford, taking herhand, said
gently, " Be glad, too, Helen !"Lois had ut her arms about her cousin,
and with-out further wor-s enk                  - .And so Helen

need be no thought of occu-pation now. When Mr. Dale heard the news,
hesaid his congratulations were not only for Lois andGifford, but for
Helen, and after that for Ashurst.A genuine Ashurst engagement was a
great thing,and the friends of the young people received it intheir
several ways. Dr. Howe was surprised, butdisposed to make the best of
it. 'This is alwaysthe way," he said, with his big, jolly laugh: "-a

<pb n="1"/>CHAPTER I.THE NARRATIVE OF M. LE MAIRE:  THE CONDITION OF THE CITY.<p>I, MARTIN DUPIN (de la Clairie*re), had the honour of holding the office of Maire in the town of Semur, in the Haute Bourgogne, at the time when the following events occurred. It will be perceived, therefore, that no one could have more complete knowledge of the facts--at once from my official position, and from the place of eminence in the affairs of the district generally which my family has held for many generations--by what citizen-like virtues and unblemished integrity I will not be vain enough to specify. Nor is it necessary; for no one who knows Semur can be ignorant of the position held by<pb n="2 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>the Dupins, from  father to son.  The estate La Clairie*re has been so long in the family that we might very well, were we disposed, add its name to our own, as so many families in France do; and, indeed, I do not prevent my wife (whose prejudices I respect) from making this use of it upon her cards.  But, for myself, bourgeois I was born and bourgeois I mean to die. My residence, like that of my father and grand- father, is at No. 29 in the Grande Rue, opposite, the Cathedral, and not far from the Hospital of St. Jean. We inhabit the first floor, along with the rez-de-chausse*e, which has been turned into domestic offices suitable for the needs of the family. My mother, holding a respected place in my household, lives with us in the most perfect family union.  My wife (ne*e de Champ- fleurie) is everything that is calculated to render a household happy; but, alas! one only of our two children survives to bless us. I have thought these details of my private circumstances necessary, to explain<pb n="3 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>the following narrative; to which I will also add, by way of introduction, a simple sketch of the town itself and its general conditions before these remarkable events occurred.</p><p>It was on a summer evening about sunset, the middle of the month of June, thatmy attention was attracted by an incident of no importance which occurred in the street, when I was making my way home, after an inspection of the young vines inmy new vineyard to the left of La Clairie*re. All were in perfectly good condition, and none of the many signs which point to the arrival of the insect were apparent. I had come back in good spirits, thinking of the prosperity which I was happy to believe I had merited by a conscientious performance of all my duties. I had little with which to blame myself: not only my wife and relations, but my dependants and neighbours, approved my conduct as a man; and even my fellow-citizens, exacting as they are, had confirmed in my favour the good<pb n="4 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>opinion which my family had been fortunate enough to secure from father to son.These thoughts were in my mind as I turned the corner of the Grande Rue and approached  my own house.  At this moment the tinkle of a little bell warnedall the bystanders of the procession which was about to pass, carrying the rites of the Church to some dying person.  Some of the women, always devout, fell on their knees. I did not go so far as this, for I do not pretend, in these days of progress, to have retained the same attitude of mind as that which it is no doubt becoming to behold in the more devout sex; but I stood respectfully out of the way, and took off my hat, as good breeding alone, if nothing else, demanded of me. Just in front of me, however, was Jacques Richard, always a troublesome individual, standing doggedly, with his hat upon his head and his hands in his pockets, straight in the path of M. le Cure*. There is not in all France a more obstinate fellow. He stood there, notwith-<pb n="5 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>standing the efforts of a good woman to draw him away, and though I myself called to him. M. le Cure* is not the man to flinch; and as he passed, walking as usual very quickly and straight, his soutane brushed against the blouse of Jacques.  He gave one quick glance from beneath his eyebrows at the profane interruption, but he would not distract himself from his sacred errand at such a moment. It is a sacred errand when any one, be he priest or layman, carries the best he can give to the bedside of the dying. I said this to Jacques when M. le Cure* had passed and the bell went tinkling on along the street.  'Jacques,' said I, 'I do not call it impious, like this good woman, but I call it inhuman.  What! a man goes to carry help to the dying, and you show him no respect !'</p><p>This brought the colour to his face; and I think, perhaps, that he might have become ashamed of the part he had played; but the women pushed in again, as they are so fond of doing. 'Oh, M. le Maire, he<pb n="6 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>does not deserve that you should lose your words upon him!' they cried; 'and, besides, is it likely he will pay any attention to you when he tries to stop even the bon Dieu?' 'The bon Dieu' cried Jacques. 'Why doesn't He clear the way for himself? Look here. I do not care one farthing for your bon Dieu. Here is mine; I carry him about with me.' And he took a piece of a hundred sous out of his pocket (how had it got there?) 'Vive l'argent!' he said. 'You know it yourself, though you will not say so.  There is no bon Dieu but money. With money you can do anything. L'argent c'est le bon Dieu.'</p><p>'Be silent,' I cried, 'thou profane one!' And the women were still more indignant than I. 'We shall see, we shall see; when he is ill and would give his soul for something to wet his lips, his bon Dieu will not do much for him,' cried one; and another said, clasping her hands with a shrill cry, 'It is enough to make the dead rise out of their graves!'</p><pb n="7 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/><p>'The dead rise out of their graves!'These words, though one has heard them before, took possession of my imagination. I saw the rude fellow go along the street as I went on, tossing the coin in his hand. One time it fell to the ground and rang upon the pavement, and he laughed more loudly as he picked it up. He was walking towards the sunset, and I too, at a distance after. The sky was full of rose- tinted clouds floating across the blue, floating high over the grey pinnacles of the Cathedral, and filling the long open line of the Rue St. Etienne down which he was going.  As I crossed to my own house I caught him full against the light, in his blue blouse, tossing the big silver piece in the air, and heard him laugh and shout 'Vive l'argent!  This is the only bon Dieu.' Though there are many people who live as if this were their sentiment, there are few who give it such brutal expression; but some of the people at the corner of the street laughed too. 'Bravo, Jacques!' they<pb n="8 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>cried; and one said, 'You are right, mon ami, the only god to trust in nowadays.' 'It is a short credo, M. le Maire,' said another, who caught my eye. He saw I was displeased, this one, and his countenance changed at once. </p><p>'Yes, Jean Pierre,' I said, 'it is worse than short--it is brutal. I hope no man who respects himself will ever countenance it.  It is against the dignity of human nature, if nothing more.'</p><p>'Ah, M. le Maire!' cried a poor woman, one of the good ladies of the market, with entrenchments of baskets all round her, who had been walking my way; 'ah, M. le Maire! did not I say true ? it is enough to bring the dead out of their graves.'</p><p>'That would be something to see,' said Jean Pierre, with a laugh; 'and I hope,ma bonne femme, that if you have any interest with them, you will entreat thesegentlemen to appear before I go away.'</p><p>'I do not like such jesting,' said I. 'The dead are very dead and will not disturb<pb n="9 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>anybody, but even the prejudices of respectable persons ought to be respected. A ribald like Jacques counts for nothing, but I did not expect this from you.'</p><p>'What would you, M. le Maire ?' he said, with a shrug of his shoulders. 'We are made like that. I respect prejudices as you say. My wife is a good woman, she prays for two--but me! How can I tell that Jacques is not right after all? A grosse pie*ce of a hundred sous, one sees that, one knows what it can do--but for the other!'  He thrust up one shoulder to his ear, and turned up the palms of his hands.</p><p>'It is our duty at all times to respect the convictions of others,' I said, severely; and passed on to my own house, having no desire to encourage discussions at the street corner. A man in my position is obliged to be always mindful of the example he ought to set. But I had not yet done with this phrase, which had, as I have said, caught my ear and my imagination. My mother was in the great salle of the rez-de-<pb n="10 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>chause*e, as I passed, in altercation with a peasant who had just brought us in some loads of wood. There is often, it seems to me, a sort of refrain in conversation, which one catches everywhere as one comes and goes.  Figure my astonishment when I heard from the lips of my good mother the same words with which that good-for-nothing Jacques Richard had made the profession of his brutal faith. 'Go!' she cried, in anger; 'you are all the same.  Money is your god.  De grosses pie*ces, that is all you think of in these days.'</p><p>'Eh, bien, madame,' said the peasant; and if so, what then ? Don't you others, gentlemen and ladies, do just the same?  What is there in the world but money to think of? If it is a question of marriage, you demand what is the dot; if it is a question of office, you ask, Monsieur Untel, is he rich ? And it is perfectly just. We know what money can do; but as for le bon Dieu, whom our grandmothers used to talk about--'</p><pb n="11 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/><p>And lo! our gros paysan made exactly the same gesture as Jean Pierre. He putup his shoulders to his ears, and spread out the palms of his hands, as who should say, There is nothing further to be said.</p><p>Then there occurred a still more remarkable repetition.  My mother, as may be supposed, being a very respectable person, and more or less de*vote, grew red with indignation and horror.</p><p>'Oh, these poor grandmothers!' she cried; 'God give them rest! It is enough to make the dead rise out of their graves.'</p><p>'Oh, I will answer for les morts! They wi11 give nobody any trouble,' he said with a laugh. I went in and reproved the man severely, finding that, as I supposed, he had attempted to cheat my good mother in the price of the wood.  Fortunately she had been quite as clever as he was. She went upstairs shaking her head, while I gave the man to understand that no one should speak to her but with the profoundest respect in my house. 'She has<pb n="12 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>her opinions, like all respectable ladies,' I said, 'but under this roof these opinions sha11 always be sacred.' And, to do him justice, I will add that when it was put to him in this way Gros-Jean was ashamed of himself.</p><p>When I talked over these incidents with my wife, as we gave each other the narrative of our day's experiences, she was greatly distressed, as may be supposed. 'I try to hope they are not so bad as Bonne Maman thinks. But oh, mon ami!' she said, 'what will the world come to if this is what they really believe?'</p><p>'Take courage,' I said; 'the world will never come to anything much different from what it is. So long as there are des anges like thee to pray for us, the scale will not go down to the wrong side.'</p><p>I said this, of course, to please my Agne*s, who is the best of wives; but on thinking it over after, I could not but be struck with the extreme justice (not to speak of the beauty of the sentiment) of<pb n="13 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>this thought. The bon Dieu--if, indeed, that great Being is as represented to us by the Church--must naturally care as much for one-half of His creatures as for the other, though they have not the same weight in the world; and consequently the faith of the women must hold the balance straight, especially if, as is said, they exceed us in point of numbers. This leaves a little margin for those of them who profess the same freedom of thought as is generally accorded to men-a class, I must add, which I abominate from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>I need not dwell upon other little scenes which impressed the same idea still more upon my mind. Semur, I need not say, is not the centre of the world, and might, therefore, be supposed likely to escape the full current of worldliness. We amuse ourselves little, and we have not any opportunity of rising to the heights of ambition; for our town is not even the chef-lieu of the department,--though this is<pb n="14 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>a subject upon which I cannot trust myself to speak.  Figure to yourself that LaRochette--a place of yesterday, without either the beauty or the antiquity of Semur--has been chosen as the centre of affairs, the residence of M. le Pre*fet! But I will not enter upon this question. What I was saying was, that, notwithstanding the fact that we amuse ourselves but little, that there is no theatre to speak of, little society, few distractions, and none of those induce- ments to strive for gain and to indulge the senses, which exist, for instance, in Paris--that capital of the world--yet, nevertheless, the thirst for money and for pleasure has increased among us to an extent which I cannot but consider alarming. Gros-Jean, peasant, toils for money, and hoards; Jacques, who is a cooper and maker of wine casks, gains and drinks; Jean Pierre snatches at every sous that comes in his way, and spends it in yet worse dissipations. He is one who quails when he meets my eye; he sins en cachette; but Jacques is<pb n="15 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>bold, and defies opinion; and Gros-Jean  is firm in the belief that to hoard money is the highest of mortal occupations. These three are types of what the population is at Semur. The men would all sell their souls for a grosse pie*ce of fifty sous-indeed, they would laugh, and express their delight that any one should believe them to have souls, if they could but have a chance of selling them; and the devil, who was once supposed to deal in that commodity, would be very welcome among us. And as for the bon Dieu-pouff! that was an affair of the grandmothers- le bon Dieu c'est l'argent. This is their creed. I was very near the beginning of my official year as Maire when my attention was called to these matters as I have described above. A man may go on for years keeping quiet himself--keeping out of tumult, religious or political --and make no discovery of the general current of feeling; but when you are forced to serve your country in any official capacity, and when your eyes are opened to the state<pb n="16 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>of affairs around you, then I allow that an inexperienced observer might well cry out, as my wife did, 'What will become of the world?' I am not prejudiced myself--unnecessary to say that the foolish scruples of the women do not move me. But the devotion of the community at large to this pursuit of gain--money without any grandeur, and pleasure without any refinement--that is a thing which cannot fail to wound all who believe in human nature. To be a millionaire--that, I grant, would be pleasant.  A man as rich as Monte Christo, able to do whatever he would, with the equipage of an English duke, the palace of an Italian prince, the retinue of a Russian noble--he, indeed, might be excused if his money seemed to him a kind of god. But Gros-Jean, who lays up two sous at a time, and lives on black bread and an onion; and Jacques, whose grosse pie*ce but secures him the headache of a drunkard next morning--what to them could be this miserable deity ? As for myself, however, it was my business, as<pb n="17 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>Maire of the commune, to take as little notice as possible of the follies these people might say, and to hold the middle course between the prejudices of the respectable and the levities of the foolish. With this, without more, to think of, I had enough to keep all my faculties employed.</p><pb n="18"/>CHAPTER      II.THE NARRATIVE OF M. LE MAIRE CONTINUED:  BEGINNING OF THE LATE REMARKABLE EVENTS.<p>I do not attempt to make out any distinct connection between the simple incidents above recorded, and the extraordinary events that followed. I have  related them as they happened; chiefly by way of showing the state of feeling in the city, and the sentiment which pervaded the community--a sentiment, I fear, too common in my country. I need not say that to encourage superstition is far from my wish. I am a man of my century, and proud of being so; very little disposed to yield to the domination of the clerical party, though desirous of showing all just tolerance for conscien-<pb n="19 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>tious faith, and every respect for the prejudices of the ladies of my family. I am, moreover, all the more inclined to be careful of giving in my adhesion to any prodigy, in consequence of a consciousness that the faculty of imagination has always been one of my characteristics. It usually is so, I am aware, in superior minds, and it has procured me many pleasures un- known to the common herd. Had it been possible for me to believe that I had been misled by this faculty, I should have carefully refrained from putting upon record any account of my individual impressions; but my attitude here is not that of a man recording his personal experiences only, but of one who is the official mouthpiece and representative of the commune, and whose duty it is to render to government and to the human race a true narrative of the very wonderful facts to which every citizen of Semur can bear witness. In this capacity it has become my duty so to arrange and edit the different accounts of<pb n="20 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>the mystery, as to present one coherent and trustworthy chronicle to the world.</p><p>To proceed, however, with my narrative.  It is not necessary for me to describe what summer is in the Haute Bourgogne.  Our generous wines, our glorious fruits, are sufficient proof, without any assertion on my part.  The summer with us is as a perrpetual fe*te--at least, before the insect appeared it was so, though now anxiety about the condition of our vines may cloud our enjoyment of the glorious sunshine which ripens them hourly before our eyes. Judge, then, of the astonishment of the world when there suddenly came upon us a darkness as in the depth of winter, falling, without warning, into the midst of the brilliant weather to which we are accustomed, and which had never failed us before in the memory of man! It was the month of July, when, in ordinary seasons, a cloud is so rare that it is a joy to see one, merely as a variety upon the brightness. Suddenly, in the midst of our summer delights, this<pb n="21 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>darkness came. Its first appearance took us so entirely by surprise that life seemed to stop short, and the business of the whole town was delayed by an hour or two; nobody being able to believe that at six o'clock in the morning the sun had not risen. I do not assert that the sun did not rise; all I mean to say is that at Semur it was still dark, as in a morning of winter, and when it gradually and slowly became day many hours of the morning were already spent.And never shall I forget the aspect of day when it came. It was like a ghost or pale shadow of the glorious days of July with which we are usually blessed. The barometer did not go down, nor was there any rain, but an unusual greyness wrapped earth and sky. I heard people say in the streets, and I am aware that the same words came to my own lips: 'If it were not full summer, I should say it was going to snow.' We have much snow in the Haute Bourgogne, and we are well acquainted with this aspect of the skies. Of the depressing effect which this<pb n="22 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>greyness exercised upon myself personally, I will not speak. I have always been noted as a man of fine perceptions, and I was aware instinctively that such a state of the atmosphere must mean something more than was apparent on the surface. But, as the danger was of an entirely unprecedented character, it is not to be wondered at that I should be completely at a loss to divine what its meaning was. It was a blight some people said; and many were of opinion that it was caused by clouds of animalculae coming, as is described in ancient writings, to destroy the crops, and even to affect the health of the population. The doctors scoffed at this; but they talked about malaria, which, as far as I could understand, was likely to produce exactly the same effect.  The night closed in early as the day had dawned late; the lamps were lighted before six o'clock, and daylight had only begun about ten!  Figure to yourself, a July day! There ought to have been a moon almost<pb n="23 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>at the full; but no moon was visible, no stars--nothing but a grey veil of clouds, growing darker and darker as the moments went on; such I have heard are the days and the nights in England, where the sea- fogs so often blot out the sky. But we are unacquainted with anything of the kind in our plaisant pays de France. There was nothing else talked of in Semur all that night, as may well be imagined. My own mind was extremely uneasy. Do what I would, I could not deliver myself from a sense of something dreadful in the air which was neither malaria nor animalculae, I took a promenade through the streets that evening, accompanied by M. Barbou, my adjoint, to make sure that all was safe; and the darkness was such that we almost lost our way, though we were both born in the town and had known every turning from our boyhood. It cannot be denied that Semur is very badly lighted. We retain still the lanterns slung by cords across the streets which once were general<pb n="24 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>in France, but which, in most places, have been superseded by the modern institution of gas. Gladly would I have distinguished my term of office by bringing gas to Semur.  But the expense would have been great, and there were a hundred objections. In summer generally, the lanterns were of little consequence because of the brightness of the sky; but to see them now, twinkling dimly here and there, making us conscious how dark it was, was strange indeed. It was in the interests of order that we took our round, with a fear, in my mind at least, of I knew not what. M. 1'Adjoint said nothing, but no doubt he thought as I did.</p><p>While we were thus patrolling the city with a special eye to the prevention of all seditious assemblages, such as are too apt to take advantage of any circumstances that may disturb the ordinary life of a city, or throw discredit on its magistrates, we were accosted by Paul Lecamus, a man whom I have always considered as something of a visionary, though his conduct is<pb n="25 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>irreproachable, and his life honourable and industrious. He entertains religious convictions of a curious kind; but, as the man is quite free from revolutionary sentiments, I have never considered it to be my duty to interfere with him, or to investigate his creed. Indeed, he has been treated generally in Semur as a dreamer of dreams--one who holds a great many impracticable and foolish opinions--though the respect which I always exact for those whose lives are respectable and worthy has been a protection to him. He was, I think, aware that he owed something to my good offices, and it was to me accordingly that he addressed himself.</p><p>'Good evening, M. le Maire,' he said; 'you are groping about, like myself, in this strange night.'</p><p>'Good evening M. Paul,' I replied. 'It is, indeed, a strange night. It indicates, I fear, that a storm is coming.'</p><p>M. Paul shook his head. There is a solemnity about even his ordinary appear-<pb n="26 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>ance.  He has a long face, pale, and adorned with a heavy, drooping moustache, which adds much to the solemn impression made by his countenance. He looked at me with great gravity as he stood in the shadow of the lamp, and slowly shook his head.</p><p>'You do not agree with me? Well! the opinion of a man like M. Paul Lecamus is always worthy to be heard.'</p><p>'Oh!' he said, 'I am called visionary.  I am not supposed to be a trustworthy witness. Nevertheless, if M. Le Maire will come with me, I will show him something that is very strange--something that is almost more wonderful than the darkness-- more strange,' he went on with great earnestness, 'than any storm that ever ravaged Burgundy.'</p><p>'That is much to say. A tempest now when the vines are in full bearing--'</p><p>'Would be nothing, nothing to what I can show you. Only come with me to the Porte St. Lambert.'</p><p>'If M. le Maire will excuse me,' said M.<pb n="27 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>Barbou, 'I think I will go home. It is a little cold, and you are aware that 1 am always afraid of the damp.' In fact, our coats were beaded with a cold dew as in November, and I could not but acknowledge that my respectable colleague had reason.  Besides, we were close to his house, and he had, no doubt, the sustaining consciousness of having done everything that was really incumbent upon him. 'Our ways lie together as far as my house,' he said, with a slight chattering of his teeth.  No doubt it was the cold. After we had walked with him to his door, we proceeded to the Porte St. Lambert. By this time almost everybody had re-entered their houses. The streets were very dark, and they were also very still.  When we reached the gates, at that hour of the night, we found them shut as a matter of course. The officers of the octroi were standing close together at the door of their office, in which the lamp was burning. The very lamp seemed oppressed by the heavy<pb n="28 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>air; it burnt dully, surrounded with a yellow haze.  The men had the appearance of suffering greatly from cold. They received me with a satisfaction which was very gratifying to me. 'At length here is M. le Maire himself,' they said.</p><p>'My good friends,' said I, 'you have a cold post to-night.  The weather has changed in the most extraordinary way. I have no doubt the scientific gentlemen at the Muse*e will be able to tell us all about it--M. de Clairon--'</p><p>'Not to interrupt M. le Maire,' said Riou, of the octroi, ' I think there is more in it than any scientific gentleman can explain.'</p><p>'Ah! You think so. But they explain everything,' I said, with a smile. 'They tell us how the wind is going to blow.'</p><p>As I said this, there seemed to pass us, from the direction of the closed gates, a breath of air so cold that I could not restrain a shiver. They looked at each other. It was not a smile that passed between them --they were too pale, too cold, to smile:<pb n="29 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>but a look of intelligence. 'M. le Maire,' said one of them, 'perceives it too;' but they did not shiver as I did. They were like men turned into ice who could feel no more.</p><p>'It is, without doubt, the most extraordinary weather,' I said.  My teeth chattered like Barbou's.  It was all I could do to keep myself steady. No one made any reply; but Lecamus said, 'Have the goodness to open the little postern for foot-passengers: M. le Maire wishes to make an inspection outside.'</p><p>Upon these words, Riou, who knew me well, caught me by the arm. 'A thousand pardons,' he said, 'M. le Maire; but I entreat you, do not go. Who can tell what is outside? Since this morning there is something very strange on the other side of the gates. If M. le Maire would listen to me, he would keep them shut night and day till that is gone, he would not go out into the midst of it. Mon Dieu! a man may be brave. I know the courage of M.<pb n="30 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>le Maire; but to march without necessity into the jaws of hell: mon Dieu!' cried the poor man again. He crossed himself, and none of us smiled. Now a man may sign himself at the church door--one does so out of respect; but to use that ceremony for one's own advantage, before other men, is rare--except in the case of members of a very decided party. Riou was not one of these. He signed himself in sight of us all, and not one of us smiled.</p><p>The other was less familiar--he knew me only in my public capacity--he was one Gallais of the Quartier St. Me*don.  He said, taking off his hat: 'If I were M. le Maire, saving your respect, I would not go Out into an unknown danger with this man here, a man who is known as a pietist, as a clerical, as one who sees visions--'</p><p>'He is not a clerical, he is a good citizen,' I said; 'come, lend us your lantern. Shall I shrink from my duty wherever it leads me? Nay, my good friends, the Maire of a French commune fears neither man nor<pb n="31 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>devil in the exercise of his duty. M. Paul, lead on.' When I said the word 'devil' a spasm of alarm passed over Riou's face.  He crossed himself again.  This time I could not but smile. 'My little Riou,' I said, 'do you know that you are a little imbecile with your piety? There is a time for everything.'</p><p>'Except religion, M. le Maire; that is never out of place,' said Gallais.</p><p>I could not believe my senses. 'Is it a conversion?' I said. 'Some of our Carmes de*chausse*s must have passed this way.'</p><p>'M. le Maire will soon see other teachers more wonderful than the Carmes de*chausse*s,' said Lecamus. He went and took down the lantern from its nail, and opened the little door. When it opened, I was once more penetrated by the same icy breath; once, twice, thrice, I cannot tell how many times this crossed me, as if some one passed.  I looked round upon the others--I gave way a step. I could not help it. In spite of me, the hair seemed to<pb n="32 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>rise erect on my head. The two officers stood close together, and Riou, collecting his courage, made an attempt to laugh. 'M. le Maire perceives,' he said, his lips trembling almost too much to form the words, 'that the winds are walking about.' 'Hush, for God's sake!' said the other, grasping him by the arm.</p><p>This recalled me to myself; and I followed Lecamus, who stood waiting for me holding the door a little ajar.  He went on strangely, like--I can use no other words to express it--a man making his way in the face of a crowd, a thing very surprising to me.   I followed him close; but the moment I emerged from the doorway something caught my breath. The same feeling seized me also. I gasped; a sense of suffocation came upon me; I put out my hand to lay hold upon my guide.  The solid grasp I got of his arm re-assured me a little, and he did not hesitate, but pushed his way on. We got out clear of the gate and the shadow of the wall, keeping close<pb n="33 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>to the little watch-tower on the west side.  Then he made a pause, and so did I. We stood against the tower and looked out before us. There was nothing there. The darkness was great, yet through the gloom of the night I could see the division of the road from the broken ground on either side; there was nothing there.  I gasped, and drew myself up close against the wall, as Lecamus had also done. There was in the air, in the night, a sensation the most strange I have ever experienced. I have felt the same thing indeed at other times, in face of a great crowd, when thousands of people were moving, rustling, struggling, breathing around me, thronging all the vacant space, filling up every spot. This was the sensation that overwhelmed me here--a crowd: yet nothing to be seen but the darkness, the indistinct line of the road. We could not move for them, so close were they round us. What do I say?  There was nobody--nothing--not a form to be seen, not a face but his and mine. I am obliged<pb n="34 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>to confess that the moment was to me an awful moment. I could not speak. My heart beat wildly as if trying to escape from my breast--every breath I drew was with an effort. I clung to Lecamus with deadly and helpless terror, and forced myself back upon the wall, crouching against it; I did not turn and fly, as would have been natural. What say I? did not! I could not! they pressed round us so. Ah! you would think I must be mad to use such words, for there was nobody near me--not a shadow even upon the road.</p><p>Lecamus would have gone farther on; he would have pressed his way boldly into the midst; but my courage was not equal to this.  I clutched and clung to him, dragging myself along against the wall, my whole mind intent upon getting back. I was stronger than he, and he had no power to resist me.  I turned back, stumbling blindly, keeping my face to that crowd (there was no one), but struggling back again, tearing the skin off my hands as I<pb n="35 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>groped my way along the wall.  Oh, the agony of seeing the door closed! I havebuffeted my way through a crowd before now, but I may say that I never before knew what terror was. When I fell upon the door, dragging Lecamus with me, it opened, thank God! I stumbled in, clutching at Riou with my disengaged hand, and fell upon the floor of the octroi, where they thought I had fainted. But this was not the case. A man of resolution may give way to the overpowering sensations of the moment.  His bodily faculties may fail him; but his mind will not fail.  As in every really superior intelligence, my forces collected for the emergency. While the officers ran to bring me water, to search for the eau-de vie which they had in a cupboard, I astonished them all by rising up, pale, but with fu11 command of myself. 'It is enough,' I said, raising my hand.  'I thank you, Messieurs, but nothing more is necessary;' and I would not take any of their restoratives. They were impressed, as was only<pb n="36 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>natural, by the sight of my perfect self-possession: it helped them to acquire for themselves a demeanour befitting the occasion; and I felt, though still in great physical weakness and agitation, the consoling consciousness of having fulfilled my functions as head of the community.</p><p>'M. le Maire has seen a--what there is outside?' Riou cried, stammering in his excitement; and the other fixed upon me eyes which were hungering with eagerness--if, indeed, it is permitted to use such words.</p><p>'I have seen-nothing, Riou,' I said.</p><p>They looked at me with the utmost wonder. 'M. le Maire has seen--nothing?' said Riou.  'Ah, I see! you say so to spare us.  We have proved ourselves cowards; but if you will pardon me, M. le Maire, you, too, re-entered precipitately--you too! There are facts which may appal the bravest--but I implore you to tell us what you have seen.'</p><p>'I have seen nothing,' I said.  As I<pb n="37 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>spoke, my natural calm composure returned, my heart resumed its usual tranquil beating.  'There is nothing to be seen--it is dark, and one can perceive the line of the road for but a little way--that is all. There is nothing to be seen--'</p><p>They looked at me, startled and incredulous. They did not know what to think. How could they refuse to believe me, sitting there calmly raising my eyes to them, making my statement with what they felt to be an air of perfect truth? But, then, how account for the precipitate return which they had already noted, the supposed faint, the pallor of my looks? They did not know what to think.</p><p>And here, let me remark, as in my conduct throughout these remarkable events, may be seen the benefit, the high advantage, of truth. Had not this been the truth, I could not have borne the searching of their looks. But it was true. There was nothing--nothing to be seen; in one sense, this was the thing of all others which over-<pb n="38 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>whelmed my mind. But why insist upon these matters of detail to unenlightened men?  There was nothing, and I had seen nothing.  What I said was the truth.</p><p>All this time Lecamus had said nothing.  As I raised myself from the ground, I had vaguely perceived him hanging up the lantern where it had been before; now he became distinct to me as I recovered the ful1 possession of my faculties.  He had seated himself upon a bench by the wall.  There was no agitation about him; no sign of the thrill of departing excitement, which I felt going through my veins as through the strings of a harp.  He was sitting against the wall, with his head drooping, his eyes cast down, an air of disappointment and despondency about him--nothing more.  I got up as soon as I felt that I could go away with perfect propriety; but, before I left the place, called him. He got up when he heard his name, but he did it with reluctance. He came with me be-<pb n="39 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>cause I asked him to do so, not from any wish of his own. Very different were the feelings of Riou and Gallais. They did their utmost to engage me in conversation, to consult me about a hundred trifles, to ask me with the greatest deference whatthey ought to do in such and such cases, pressing close to me, trying every expedient to delay my departure. When we went away they stood at the door of their little office close together, looking after us with looks which I found it difficult to forget; they would not abandon their post; but their faces were pale and contracted, their eyes wild with anxiety and distress.</p><p>It was only as I walked away, hearing my own steps and those of Lecamus ringing upon the pavement, that I began to realise what had happened.  The effort of recovering my composure, the relief from the extreme excitement of terror (which, dreadful as the idea is, I am obliged to confess I had actually felt), the sudden<pb n="40 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>influx of life and strength to my brain, had pushed away for the moment the recollection of what lay outside. When I thought of it again, the blood began once more to course in my veins. Lecamus went on by my side with his head down, the eyelids drooping over his eyes, not saying a word.  He followed me when I called him: but cast a regretful look at the postern by which we had gone out, through which I had dragged him back in a panic (I confess it) unworthy of me. Only when we had left at some distance behind us that door into the unseen, did my senses come fully back to me, and I ventured to ask myself what it meant. 'Lecamus,' I said--I could scarcely put my question into words--'what do you think? what is your idea?--how do you explain--' Even then I am glad to think I had sufficient power of control not to betray all that I felt.</p><p>'One does not try to explain,' he said slowly; 'one longs to know--that is all.If M. le Maire had not been--in such<pb n="41 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>haste--had he been willing to go farther--to investigate--'</p><p>'God forbid!' I said; and the impulse to quicken my steps, to get home and put myself in safety, was almost more than I could restrain. But I forced myself to go quietly, to measure my steps by his, which were slow and reluctant, as if he dragged himself away with difficulty from that which was behind.</p><p>What was it?  'Do not ask, do not ask!' Nature seemed to say in my heart.  Thoughts came into my mind in such a dizzy crowd, that the multitude of them seemed to take away my senses. I put up my hands to my ears, in which they seemed to be buzzing and rustling like bees, to stop the sound.  When I did so, Lecamus turned and looked at me--grave and wondering. This recalled me to a sense of my weakness. But how I got home I can scarcely say. My mother and wife met me with anxiety. They were greatly disturbed about the Hospital of St. Jean, in respect to which it had been recently<pb n="42 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>decided that certain changes should be made. The great ward of the hospital, which was the chief establishment for the sick in the town, had hitherto been so placed in communication with the chapel that mass was heard daily by all the patients--a thing which some had complained of as an annoyance disturbing their rest. So many, indeed, had been the complaints received, that we had come to the conclusion either that the opening should be built up, or the office suspended.  Against this decision, it is needless to say, the Sisters of St. Jean were moving heaven and earth. Equally unnecessary for me to add, that having so decided in my public capacity, as at once the representative of popular opinion and its guide, the covert reproaches which were breathed in my presence, and even the personal appeals made to me, had failed of any result. I respect the Sisters of St. Jean. They are good women and excellent nurses, and the commune owes them much. Still, justice must<pb n="43 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>be impartial; and so long as I retain my position at the head of the community, it is my duty to see that all have their due.  My opinions as a private individual, were I allowed to return to that humble position, are entirely a different matter; but this is a thing which ladies, however excellent, are slow to allow or to understand.</p><p>I will not pretend that this was to me a night of rest. In the darkness, when all is sti11, any anxiety which may afflict the soul is apt to gain complete possession and mastery, as all who have had true experience of life will understand. The night was very dark and very still, the clocks striking out the hours which went so slowly, and not another sound audible.  The streets of Semur are always quiet, but they were more sti11 than usual that night. Now and then, in a pause of my thoughts, I could hear the soft breathing of my Agne*s in the adjoining room, which gave me a little comfort. But this was only by intervals, when I was able to escape from the grasp of the recollections<pb n="44 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>that held me fast. Again I seemed to see under my closed eyelids the faint line of the high road which led from the Porte St. Lambert, the broken ground with its ragged bushes on either side, and no one--no one there--not a soul, not a shadow: yet a multitude! When I allowed myself to think of this, my heart leaped into my throat again, my blood ran in my veins like a river in flood. I need not say that I resisted this transport of the nerves with all my might. As the night grew slowly into morning my power of resistance increased; I turned my back, so to speak, upon my recollections, and said to myself, with growing firmness, that all sensations of the body must have their origin in the body.  Some derangement of the system-easily explainable, no doubt, if one but held the clue--must have produced the impression which otherwise it would be impossible to explain. As I turned this over and over in my mind, carefully avoiding all temptations to excitement--which is the only<pb n="45 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>wise course in the case of a strong impression on the nerves--I gradually became able to believe that this was the cause.  It is one of the penalties, I said to myself, which one has to pay for an organization more finely tempered than that of the crowd.</p><p>This long struggle with myself made the night less tedious, though, perhaps, more terrible; and when at length I was overpowered by sleep, the short interval of unconsciousness restored me like a cordial.  I woke in the early morning, feeling almost able to smile at the terrors of the night. When one can assure oneself that the day has really begun, even while it is yet dark, there is a change of sensation, an increase of strength and courage. One by one the dark hours went on. I heard them pealing from the Cathedral clock--four, five, six, seven--all dark, dark. I had got up and dressed before the last, but found no one else awake when I went out--no one stirring in the house,--no one<pb n="46 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>moving in the street. The Cathedral doors were shut fast, a thing I have never seen before since I remember. Get up early who will, Pe*re Laserques the sacristan is always up still earlier. He is a good old man, and I have often heard him say God's house should be open first of all houses, in case there might be any miserable ones about who had found no shelter in the dwellings of men. But the darkness had cheated even Pe*re Laserques.  To see those great doors closed which stood always open gave me a shiver, I cannot well tell why. Had they been open, there was an inclination in my mind to have gone in, though I cannot tell why; for I am not in the habit of attending mass, save on Sunday to set an example. There were no shops open, not a sound about.  I went out upon the ramparts to the Mont St. Lambert, where the band plays on Sundays.  In all the trees there was not so much as the twitter of a bird. I could hear the river flowing swiftly below the wall, but I<pb n="47 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>could not see it, except as something dark, a ravine of gloom below, and beyond the walls I did not venture to look.  Why should I look?  There was nothing, nothing, as I knew. But fancy is so uncontrollable, and one's nerves so little to be trusted, that it was a wise precaution to refrain. The gloom itself was oppressive enough; the air seemed to creep with apprehensions, and from time to time my heart fluttered with a sick movement, as if it would escape from my control.   But everything was still, still as the dead who had been so often in recent days called out of their graves by one or another. 'Enough to bring the dead out of their graves.'  What strange words to make use of! It was rather now as if the world had become a grave in which we, though living, were held fast.</p><p>Soon after this the dark world began to lighten faintly, and with the rising of a little white mist, like a veil rolling upwards, I at last saw the river and the fields beyond.<pb n="48 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>To see anything at all lightened my heart a little, and I turned homeward when this faint daylight appeared. When I got back into the street, I found that the people at last were stirring. They had all a look of half panic, half shame upon their faces.  Many were yawning and stretching themselves.  'Good morning, M. le Maire,' said one and another; 'you are early astir.' 'Not so early either,' I said; and then they added, almost every individual, with a look of shame, 'We were so late this morning; we overslept ourselves--like yesterday.The weather is extraordinary.' This was repeated to me by all kinds of people.They were half frightened, and they were ashamed.   Pe*re Laserques was sitting moaning on the Cathedral steps. Such a thing had never happened before.  He had not rung the bell for early mass; he had not opened the Cathedral; he had not called M. le Cure*. 'I think I must be going out of my senses,' he said; 'but then, M. le Maire, the weather! Did any-<pb n="49 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>one ever see such weather? I think there must be some evil brewing. It is not for nothing that the seasons change-that winter comes in the midst of summer.'</p><p>After this I went home. My mother came running to one door when I entered, and my wife to another. '0 mon fils!' and '0 mon ami!' they said, rushing upon me.  They wept, these dear women. I could not at first prevail upon them to tell me what was the matter. At last they confessed that they believed something to have happened to me, in punishment for the wrong done to the Sisters at the hospital. 'Make haste, my son, to amend this error,' my mother cried, 'lest a worse thing befall us!' And then I discovered that among the women, and among many of the poor people, it had come to be believed that the darkness was a curse upon us for what we had done in respect to the hospital. This roused me to indignation. 'If they think I am to be driven from my duty by their magic,' I<pb n="50 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>cried; 'it is no better than witchcraft!' not that I believed for a moment that it was they who had done it. My wife wept, and my mother became angry with me; but  when a thing is duty, it is neither wife nor mother who will move me out of my way.</p><p>It was a miserable day. There was not light enough to see anything--scarcely tosee each other's faces; and to add to our alarm, some travellers arriving by the diligence (we are still three leagues from a railway, while that miserable little place, La Rochette, being the chef-lieu, has a terminus) informed me that the darkness only existed in Semur and the neighbourhood, and that within a distance of three miles the sun was shining. The sun was shining! was it possible? it seemed so long since we had seen the sunshine; but this made our calamity more mysterious and more terrible. The people began to gather into little knots in the streets to ta1k of the strange thing that was happening. In the course of the day M. Barbou<pb n="51 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>came to ask whether I did not think it would be well to appease the popular feeling by conceding what they wished to the Sisters of the hospital. I would not hear of it. 'Shall we own that we are in the wrong? I do not think we are in the wrong,' I said, and I would not yield. 'Do you think the good Sisters have it in their power to darken the sky with their incantations ?'  M. l'Adjoint shook his head.  He went away with a troubled countenance; but then he was not like myself, a man of natural firmness. All the efforts that were employed to influence him were also employed with me; but to yield to the women was not in my thoughts.</p><p>We are now approaching, however, the first important incident in this narrative.  The darkness increased as the afternoon came on; and it became a kind of thick twilight, no lighter than many a night. It was between five and six o'clock, just the time when our streets are the most crowded, when, sitting at my window, from which I<pb n="52 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>kept a watch upon the Grande Rue, not knowing what might happen--I saw that  some fresh incident had taken place. Very dimly through the darkness I perceived a crowd, which increased every moment, in front of the Cathedral. After watching it for a few minutes, I got my hat and went out. The people whom I saw--so many that they covered the whole middle of the Place, reaching almost to the pavement on the other side--had their heads all turned towards the Cathedral.  'What are you gazing at, my friend?' I said to one by whom I stood. He looked up at me with a face which looked ghastly in the gloom. 'Look, M. le Maire!' he said; 'cannot you see it on the great door?'</p><p>'I see nothing,' said I; but as I uttered these words I did indeed see something which was very startling. Looking towards the great door of the Cathedral, as they all were doing, it suddenly seemed to me that I saw an illuminated placard attached to it headed with the word 'Sommation' in<pb n="53 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>gigantic letters. 'Tiens!' I cried; but when I looked again there was nothing. What is this? it is some witchcraft!' I said, in spite of myself. 'Do you see anything, Jean Pierre?'</p><p>'M. le Maire,' he said, 'one moment one sees something--the next, one sees nothing. Look! it comes again.' I have always considered myself a man of courage, but when I saw this extraordinary appearance the panic which had seized upon me the former night returned, though in another form. Fly I could not, but I will not deny that my knees smote together. I stood for some minutes without being able to articulate a word--which, indeed, seemed the case with most of those before me.  Never have I seen a more quiet crowd.  They were all gazing, as if it was life or death that was set before them--while I, too, gazed with a shiver going over me.  It was as I have seen an illumination of lamps in a stormy night; one moment the whole seems black as the wind sweeps over<pb n="54 A BELEAGUERED CITY. "/>it, the next it springs into life again; and thus you go on, by turns losing and discovering the device formed by the lights.  Thus from moment to moment there appeared before us, in letters that seemed to blaze and flicker, something that looked like a great official placard. 'Sommation!'--this was how it was headed. I read a few words at a time, as it came and went; and who can describe the chill that ran through my veins as I made it out?  It was a summons to the people of Semur by name--myself at the head as Maire (and I heard afterwards that every man who saw it saw his own name, though the whole facade of the Cathedral would not have held a full list of all the people of Semur)--to yield their places, which they had not filled aright, to those who knew the meaning of life, being dead. NOUS AUTRES MORTS--these were the words which blazed out oftenest of all, so that every one saw them. And 'Go!' this terrible placard said-'Go! leave this place to us who<pb n="55 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

know the true signification of life.' These words I remember, but not the rest; and even at this moment it struck me that there was no explanation, nothing but this vraie signification de la vie. I felt like one in a dream: the light coming and going before me; one word, then another, appearing--sometimes a phrase like that I have quoted, blazing out, then dropping into darkness.  For the moment I was struck dumb; but then it came back to my mind that I had an example to give, and that for me, eminently a man of my century, to yield credence to a miracle was something not to be thought of. Also I knew the necessity of doing something to break the impression of awe and terror on the mind of the people. 'This is a trick,' I cried loudly, that all might hear. 'Let some one go and fetch M. de Clairon from the Muse*e. He will tell us how it has been done.' This, boldly uttered, broke the spell. A number of pale faces gathered round me. 'Here is M. le Maire--he will clear it up,' they cried, making
<pb n="56 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

room for me that I might approach nearer.
'M. le Maire is a man of courage--he has judgment.  Listen to M. le Maire.' It was a relief to everybody that I had spoken.  And soon I found myself by the side of M. le Cure*, who was standing among the rest, saying nothing, and with the air of one as much bewildered as any of us. He gave me one quick look from under his eyebrows to see who it was that approached him, as was his way, and made room for me, but said nothing. I was in too much emotion myself to keep silence--indeed, I was in that condition of wonder, alarm, and nervous excitement, that I had to speak or die; and there seemed an escape from something too terrible for flesh and blood to contemplate in the idea that there was trickery here. 'M. le Cure*,' I said, 'this is a strange ornament that you have placed on the front of your church. You are standing here to enjoy the effect. Now that you have seen how successful it has been, will not you tell me in confidence how it is done?'</p>
<pb n="57 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>I am conscious that there was a sneer in my voice, but I was too much excited to think of politeness. He gave me another of his rapid, keen looks.</p>
<p>'M. le Maire,' he said, 'you are injurious to a man who is as little fond of tricks as yourself.'</p>
<p>His tone, his glance, gave me a certain sense of shame, but I could not stop myself.  'One knows,' I said, 'that there are many things which an ecclesiastic may do without harm, which are not permitted to an ordinary layman--one who is an honest man, and no more.'</p>
<p>M. le Cure* made no reply. He gave me another of his quick glances, with an impatient turn of his head. Why should I have suspected him? for no harm was known of him. He was the Cure*, that was all; and perhaps we men of the world have our prejudices too. Afterwards, however, as we waited for M. de Clairon--for the crisis was too exciting for personal resentment--M. le Cure* himself let drop some-
<pb n="58 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>
 
thing which made it apparent that it was the ladies of the hospital upon whom his suspicions fell. 'It is never well to offend women, M. le Maire,' he said. 'Women do not discriminate the lawful from the unlawful: so long as they produce an effect, it does not matter to them.' This gave me a strange impression, for it seemed to me that M. le Cure* was abandoning his own side. However, all other sentiments were, as may be imagined, but as shadows compared with the overwhelming power that held all our eyes and our thoughts to the wonder before us. Every moment seemed an hour till M. de Clairon appeared.  He was pushed forward through the crowd as by magic, all making room for him; and many of us thought that when science thus came forward capable of finding out everything, the miracle would disappear. But instead of this it seemed to glow brighter than ever.  That great word 'Sommation' blazed out, so that we saw his figure waver against the light as if giving way before the flames that
<pb n="59 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

scorched him. He was so near that his outline was marked out dark against the glare they gave.  It was as though his close approach rekindled every light.  Then, with a flicker and trembling, word by word and letter by letter went slowly out before our eyes.</p>
<p>M. de Clairon came down very pale, but with a sort of smile on his face. 'No, M. le Maire,' he said, 'I cannot see how it is done. It is clever. I will examine the door further, and try the panels. Yes, I have left some one to watch that nothing is touched in the meantime, with the permission of M. le Cure*--'</p>
<p>'You have my full permission,' M. le Cure* said; and M. de Clairon laughed, though he was still very pale. 'You saw my name there,' he said. 'I am amused--I who am not one of your worthy citizens, M. le Maire.  What can Messieurs les Morts of Semur want with a poor man of science like me? But you shall have my report before the evening is out.'</p>
<pb n="60 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>
 
<p>With this I had to be content. The darkness which succeeded to that strange  light seemed more terrible than ever. We all stumbled as we turned to go away, dazzled by it, and stricken dumb, though some kept saying that it was a trick, and some murmured exclamations with voices full of terror. The sound of the crowd breaking up was like a regiment marching --all the world had been there. I was thankful, however, that neither my mother nor my wife had seen anything; and though
they were anxious to know why I was so serious, I succeeded fortunately in keeping  the secret from them.</p>
<p>M. de Clairon did not appear till late, and then he confessed to me he could make nothing of it. 'If it is a trick (as of course it must be), it has been most cleverly done,' he said; and admitted that he was baffled altogether.  For my part, I was not surprised.  Had it been the Sisters of the hospital, as M. le Cure* thought, would they have let the opportunity pass of
<pb n="61 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

preaching a sermon to us, and recommending their doctrines? Not so; here there were no doctrines, nothing but that pregnant phrase, la vraie signification de la vie. This made a more deep impression upon me than anything else. The Holy Mother herself (whom I wish to speak of with profound respect), and the saints, and the forgiveness of sins, would have all been there had it been the Sisters, or even M. le Cure*.  This, though I had myself suggested an imposture, made it very unlikely to my quiet thoughts. But if not an imposture, what could it be supposed to be?</p>
<pb n="62"/>

CHAPTER III. EXPULSION OF THE INHABITANTS.
<p>I will not attempt to give any detailed account of the state of the town during this evening. For myself I was utterly worn out, and went to rest as soon as M. de Clairon left me, having satisfied, as well as I could, the questions of the women. Even in the intensest excitement weary nature will claim her dues. I slept. I can even remember the grateful sense of being able to put all anxieties and perplexities aside for the moment, as I went to sleep. I felt the drowsiness gain upon me, and I was glad. To forget was of itself a happiness.</p> 
<p>I woke up, however, intensely awake, and in perfect possession of all my faculties, while it was yet dark; and at once got up
<pb n="63 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

and began to dress.   The moment of hesitation which generally follows waking--the little interval of thought in which one turns over perhaps that which is past, perhaps that which is to come--found no place within me. I got up without a moment's pause, like one who has been called to go on a journey; nor did it surprise me at all to see my wife moving about, taking a cloak from her wardrobe, and putting up linen in a bag. She was already fully dressed; but she asked no questions of me any more than I did of her. We were in haste, though we said nothing. When I
had dressed, I looked round me to see if I had forgotten anything, as one does when one leaves a place. I saw my watch suspended to its usual hook, and my pocketbook, which I had taken from my pocket on the previous night. I took up also the light overcoat which I had worn when I made my rounds through the city on the first night of the darkness. 'Now,' I said, 'Agne*s, I am ready.' I did not speak to
<pb n="64 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

her of where we were going, nor she to me.  Little Jean and my mother met us at the door. Nor did she say anything, contrary to her custom; and the child was quite quiet. We went downstairs together without saying a word.  The servants, who were all astir, followed us. I cannot give any description of the feelings that were in my mind. I had not any feelings. I was only hurried out, hastened by something which I could not define--a sense that I must go; and perhaps I was too much astonished to do anything but yield. It seemed, however, to be no force or fear that was moving me, but a desire of my own; though I could not tell how it was, or why I should be so anxious to get away. All the servants, trooping after me, had the same look in their faces; they were anxious to be gone--it seemed their business to go--there was no question, no consultation.  And when we came out into the street, we encountered a stream of processions similar to our own.   The children went quite

arms across his breast, and holding

t have told why.
Behind M. le Cure there was another

them 'Open, open in the name of God!' I
was not aware of what I said, but it seemed
to me that I heard a voice of which nobody
said anything to me, so that it would seem
to have been unheard by the others, saying
with a faint sound as of a trumpet, 'Closed 
-in the name of God.' It might be only
an echo, faintly brought back to me, of the
words I had myself said.
There was another change, however, of
which no one could have any doubt. When
I turned round from these closed doors,
though the moment before the darkness 
was such that we could not see the gates 
closing, I found the sun shining gloriously
round us, and all my fellow-citizens turning
with one impulse, with a sudden cry of joy,
to hail the full day. 
Legrandjour ! Never in my life did I
feel the full happiness of it, the full sense 
of the words before. The sun burst out
into shining, the birds into singing. The
sky stretched over us-deep and unfathom.

Lying the curls of the children, the veils

make up to us for the misery of being
us expelled from our homes. It was early,
d all the freshness of the morning was
ion the road and the fields, where the sun
.d just dried the dew. The river ran
ftly, reflecting the blue sky. How black

t flatter ourselves now that it was a trick
a deception. M. de Clairon stood there
e the rest of us, staring at the closed
tes which science could not open. And
ere stood M. le Cure, which was more
markable still. The Church herself had
t been able to do anything. We stood,
:rowd of houseless exiles, looking at each 
her, our children clinging to us, our hearts
ling us, expelled from our homes. As
looked in each other's faces we saw our
rn trouble. Many of the women sat

owd saw, restored confidence. Many of
e poor people gathered round me, and
aced themselves near me, especially those
omen who had no natural support. When
I. le Cure saw this, it seemed to make a
'eat impression upon him. He changed
flour, he who was usually so calm.
itherto he had appeared bewildered,
nazed to find himself as others. This, I

.Is, which had gone on tolling, suddenly 
rst into a wild peal. I do not know 
at it sounded like. It was a clamour of
tes all run together, tone upon tone,
;hout time or measure, as though a
altitude had seized upon the bells and
lied all the ropes at once. If it was joy,
Lat strange and terrible joy! It froze
very blood in our veins. M. le Cur6
came quite pale.  He stepped down
rriedly from the piece of wood. We all
ide a hurried movement farther off from

It was now that I perceived the necessity
doing something, of getting this crowd
;posed of, especially the women and the
ildren. I am not ashamed to own that

;s than the consciousness that all eyes

took advantage of the opportunity to

rhere then occurred one of those inci-

it were to open the flood-gates; my wife

ich I had seen when we left our own

e said. And then there arose a great
T and clamour of others, both men
d women pressing round.  'I saw my
)ther,' said one, 'who is dead twenty
ars come the St. Jean.' 'And I my
:le Rena,' said another.  'And I my
.mille, who was killed in Africa.' And
what did they do, but rush towards the
te in a crowd-that gate from which
sy had but this moment fled in terror-

ippens in times of emotion, it was those
ho were most impassioned who took the

But while we stood waiting, not knowing

om the walls, which made them all silent
a moment. The most of us ran to this

riosity and anxiety had for the moment
tinguished fear), in a wild eagerness to 
who or what it was. But there was
thing to be seen, though the sound came  7
m the wall close to the Mont St. Lam-
rt, which I have already described. It
.s to me like the sound of a trumpet, and
I heard others say; and along with the
lmpet were sounds as of words, though
could not make them out.  But those
lers seemed to understand-they grew
lmer-they ceased to weep. They raised
eir faces, all with that light upon them-
it light I had seen in my Agnes. Some
them fell upon their knees. Imagine to
urself what a sight it was, all of us stand-
g round, pale, stupefied, without a word
say! Then the women suddenly burst
rth into replies-' Oui, ma chriez /   Oui,
?n ange /' they cried. And while we
)ked they rose up; they came back,
lling the children around them.  My 
gnes took that place which I had bidden

)ugh I had bidden her to do this, yet to
her do it bewildered me, made my heart
Lnd still. ' Mon ami,' she said, 'I must
Lve thee; it is commanded: they will not

? We stood pale and looked on, while
the little ones, all the feeble, were
thered in a little army.  My mother
)od like me-to her nothing had been
vealed. She was very pale, and there
is a quiver of pain in her lips. She was
e one who had been ready to do my
Iding: but there was a rebellion in her
art now.   When the procession was
rmed (for it was my care to see that
erything was done in order), she followed,
it among the last. Thus they went away,
any of them weeping, looking back, wav-

This is how we were left alone-the men

,re were women who remained with us,
t these not of the best.  To see our
ves go was very strange to us; it was
. thing we wished most to see, the
,men and children in safety; yet it was
strange sensation to see them go. For
A, who had the charge of all on my hands,
relief was beyond description-yet was
strange; I cannot describe it. Then
:alled upon M. Barbou, who was trem-
ng like a leaf, and gathered the chief of
citizens about me, including M. le Cure,
it we should consult together what we
ould do.
I know no words that can describe our
Lte in the strange circumstances we were
w placed in.  The women and the
ildren were safe: that was much. But
--we were like an army suddenly formed,
t without arms, without any knowledge of

t forth by forces no man could resist-to 
left outside, with the doors of our own
uses closed upon us-to be confronted
nothing-by a mist, a silence, a dark-
ss,-this was enough to paralyse the
art of any man. And it did so, more or
;s, according to the nature of those who
ere exposed to the trial. Some altogether i
led us, and fled, carrying the news into
e country, where most people laughed at
em, as we understood afterwards. Some
uld do nothing but sit and gaze, huddled 
gether in crowds, at the cloud over
:mur, from which they expected to see
e burst and consume the city altogether.
nd a few, I grieve to say, took possession

3charges his duties as adjoint satisfactorily
ough (though, it need not be added, a
iod Maire who is acquainted with his
[ties, makes the office of adjoint of but
tie importance), was now found entirely
eless. He could not forget how he had
:en spun round and tossed forth from the
:y gates. When I proposed to put him
the head of a patrol, he had an attack of
e nerves. Before nightfall he deserted
e altogether, going off to his country-
ruse, and taking a number of his neigh-
>urs with him. ' How can we tell when

But I do not think he was capable of
derstanding me. Fortunately, I found
M. le Curd a much more trustworthy
adjutor. He was indefatigable; he had
e habit of sitting up to all hours, of being
lied at all hours, in which our bourgeoisie,

it deny that this was a matter of great

The arrangements I have described gave
occupation; and this had a happy effect
ion us in distracting our minds from what
.d happened; for I think that if we had

on have gone mad, as some did. In

ir eyes-sights which made even the
avest quail. The strangest of them was
e boats that would go down and up the

ir town, sometimes with sails perfectly
sll managed, sometimes impelled by oars,
it with no one visible in them-no one

)ats impelled up the stream, with no rower
sible, was a wonderful sight.  M. de

>mething about a magnetic current; but

[ERE are few who have not heard some-

en less terrible-but what was there that
L could do ? Fortunately (though I do
t deny that I felt each desertion) our
nd grew less and less every day. Hour

mn another, dispersing themselves among
e villages near, in which many had
ends. The accounts which these men
ve were, I afterwards learnt, of the most
gue description. Some talked of wonders
ey had seen, and were laughed at-and
me spread reports of internal division
iong us. Not till long after did I know
the reports that went abroad. It was
id that there had been fighting in Semur,
d that we were divided into two factions,
e of which had gained the mastery, and
iven the other out. This was the story

from M. le Maire anything that was dis-
respectful to religion.' Heaven forbid that
I should be disrespectful to religion at any
time of life, but then it was impossible
to me. I remembered after that the tale
of which I speak, which had so seized
upon me, was in the sacred writings; but
those who know me will understand that
no sneer at these writings or intention of
wounding the feelings of M. le Cure was
in my mind.
I was seated one day upon a little
inequality of the ground, leaning my back
against a half-withered hawthorn, and doz-
ing with my head in my hands, when a
soothing, which always diffuses itself from
her presence, shed itself over me, and
opening my eyes, I saw my Agnes sitting
by me.   She had come with some food
and a little linen, fresh and soft like her
own touch. My wife was not gaunt and
worn like me, but she was pale and as thin
as a shadow. I woke with a start, and
seeing her there, there suddenly came a

ead over me that she would pass away
fore my eyes, and go over to Those who
ere within Semur. I cried 'Non, mon
gnes; non, mon Agnes. before you ask,
o !' seizing her and holding her fast in
is dream, which was not altogether a
eam. She looked at me with a smile,
at smile that has always been to me as the
;ing of the sun over the earth.
'Mon ami,' she said surprised, 'I ask
)thing, except that you should take a
tle rest and spare thyself.' Then she
ded, with haste, what I knew she would
y, 'Unless it were this, mon ami. If I
ere permitted, I would go into the city-
would ask those who are there what is
eir meaning: and if no way can be found
-no act of penitence.-Oh ! do not answer
haste ! I have no fear; and it would be
save thee.'
A strong throb of anger came into my
roat. Figure to yourself that I looked
my wife with anger, with the same feel-
g which had moved me when the deserters

ized her soft hands and crushed them in

Tou would desert your husband.  You

'O Martin, say not so,' she cried, with
irs. 'Not enemies. There is our little
arie, and my mother, who died when I
is born.'
'You love these dead tyrants. Yes,' I
id, 'you love them best. You will go to
-the majority, to the strongest. Do not
eak to me! Because your God is on
eir side, you will forsake us too.'
Then she threw herself upon me and en-
rcled me with her arms. The touch of
em stilled my passion; but yet I held
er, clutching her gown, so terrible a fear
.me over me that she would go and come
ick no more.
' Forsake thee!' she breathed out over

ways does, but, with the tears falling
)m her white cheeks, fixed upon me the
ost piteous look. 'Mon ami,' she said,

'Let me not see thee here again!' I

cried. 'Would you make me mad in the
midst of my trouble? No! I will not
have you look that way. Go home! go
home!' Then I took her into my arms
and wept, though I am not a man given to
tears. 'Oh! my Agnes,' I said, 'give me
thy counsel. What you tell me I will do;
but rather than risk thee, I would live thus
for ever, and defy them.'
She put her hand upon my lips. ' I will
not ask this again,' she said, bowing her
head; 'but defy them-why should you
defy them? Have they come for nothing?
Was Semur a city of the saints?  They
have come to convert our people, Martin

Some one had come up behind as we

smiled, notwithstanding my despair. It
is natural that the Church should come
the woman's aid. But I would not re-

oved himself a man, had he been ten
nes a priest.
'I have not heard what Madame has

ho first found his voice should be the last
ho had any right to give an opinion.
'ho should it be but Jacques Richard? 
i. le Maire,' cried the fellow, 'speaks at
s ease-but who will thus risk himself ?'
robably he did not mean that his grum-
ing should be heard, but in the silence
'ery sound was audible; there was a gasp,
:atching of the breath, and all turned their
,es again upon me. I did not pause to 
ink what answer I should give. '  I 
ied. 'Here stands one who will risk 
mself, who will perish if need be--'
Something stirred behind me. It was
gnes who had risen to her feet, who stood
ith her lips parted and quivering, with
zr hands clasped, as if about to speak.
ut she did not speak.  Well! she had
'oposed to do it. Then why not I ?
'Let me make the observation,' said
iother of our fellow-citizens, Bordereau
e banker, 'that this would not be just.

'Why send a messenger ?' said another,
lilip Leclerc. ' Do we know that these
essieurs will admit any one ? and how
a you speak, how can you parley with
3se-' and he too, was seized with a
iver-' whom you cannot see ?'
Then there came another voice out of
e crowd.  It was one who would not
ow himself, who was conscious of the
)ckery in his tone. 'If there is any one
nt, let it be M. le Cure,' it said.
M. le Cure stepped forward. His pale
unterance flushed red. 'Here am I,' he
id, 'I am  ready; but he who spoke
eaks to mock me. Is it befitting in this
esence ?'
There was a struggle among the men.
'hoever it was who had spoken (I did
it wish to know), I had no need to
ndemn the mocker; they themselves

voice that was husky. What are men

Lnd I.'  There was well-nigh a tumult
consent; and this made me angry.
fords were on my lips which it might
.ve been foolish to utter, when M. de
ois-Sombre, who is a man of judgment,
terfered. 
'M. le Maire,' he said, 'as there are none
us here who would show disrespect to
e Church and holy things-that is under-
:od-it is not necessary to enter into
tails.  Every restriction that would
ound the most susceptible is withdrawn;

have been indifferent in the past, but for
the future you will agree with me that
everything shall be changed. The ambas-
sador-whoever he may be-' he added
with a catching of his breath, 'must be
empowered to promise-everything-sub-
mission to all that may be required.'
Here the women could not restrain them-
selves; they all rose up with a cry, and many
of them began to weep. 'Ah!' said one with
a hysterical sound of laughter in her tears.
'Sainte Mere! it will be heaven upon earth.'
M. le Cure said nothing; a keen glance
of wonder, yet of subdued triumph, shot
from under his eyelids. As for me, I
wrung my hands: 'What you say will be
superstition; it will be hypocrisy,' I cried.
But at that moment a further incident
occurred. Suddenly, while we deliberated,
a long loud peal of a trumpet sounded into
the air.  I have already said that many
sounds had been heard before; but this was
different; there was not one of us that did
not feel that this was addressed to himself.

e agitation was extreme; it was a
nmons, the beginning of some distinct
nmunication. The crowd scattered; but
myself, after a momentary struggle, I 
nt forward resolutely. I did not even
k back at my wife. I was no longer
Lrtin Dupin, but the Maire of Semur, the
'iour of the community.  Even Bois-
mbre quailed: but I felt that it was in me
lold head against death itself; and before
lad gone two steps I felt rather than saw
.t M. le Curd had come to my side. We
nt on without a word; gradually the
ers collected behind us, following yet
aggling here and there upon the inequal-
s of the ground.
Before us lay the cloud that was Semur,
iarkness defined by the shining of the
nmer day around, the river escaping
m that gloom as from a cavern, the
vers piercing through, but the sunshine
own back on every side from that dark-
5s. I have spoken of the walls as if we

was as the calling of our names. We

When suddenly, in a moment, the trumpet

round like a straw tossed on the winds.
To know them so near, those mysterious
sitors-to feel them, to hear them, was 
it that enough ? But, to see! who could
:ar it? Our voices rang like broken l
ords, like a tearing and rending of sound.
)me covered their faces with their hands;:
r our very eyes seemed to be drawn out
their sockets, fluttering like things with
separate life.
Then there fell upon us a strange and
rnderful calm.  The figure advanced
)wly; there was weakness in it.  The
ep, though solemn, was feeble; and if you
n figure to yourself our consternation, the
.use, the cry-our hearts dropping back
it might be into their places-the sudden
op of the wild panting in our breasts: when
ere became visible to us a human face well
lown, a man as we were. ' Lecamus!'
cried; and all the men round took it up,
owding nearer, trembling yet delivered
om  their terror; some even laughed

the relief. There was but one who had
air of discontent, and that was M. le
ire.  As he said 'Lecamus!' like the
st, there was impatience, disappointment,
ger in his tone.
And I, who had wondered where Le-
mus had gone; thinking sometimes that
was one of the deserters who had left us !
ut when he came nearer his face was as
e face of a dead man, and a cold chill
me over us. His eyes, which were cast
)wn, flickered under the thin eyelids in
hich all the veins were visible. His face
is gray like that of the dying. 'Is he
.ad?' I said. But, except M. le Cure;
one knew that I spoke.
'Not even so,' said M. le Cur6, with a
ortification in his voice, which I have
ever forgotten.  'Not even so.  That
ight be something. They teach us not
j angels-by the fools and offscourings of
e earth.'
And he would have turned away. It
as a humiliation.  Was not he the

' Lecamus,' I said, my voice trembling int

'I live,' he said; then looked around
th tears upon the crowd. 'Good neigh-
ours, good friends,' he said, and put ou

'M. Lecamus,' said I, 'we are here in

CHAPTER V.
THE NARRATIVE OF PAUL LECAMUS.
. LE MAIRE having requested me, on his
itrance into Semur, to lose no time in
awing up an account of my residence in
e town, to be placed with his own narrative,
have promised to do so to the best of myf
,ility, feeling that my condition is a very 
ecarious one, and my time for explana-
)n may be short. Many things, needless
enumerate, press this upon my mind. 
was a pleasure to me to see my neigh-,
)urs when I first came out of the city; 
it their voices, their touch, their vehe-
ence and eagerness wear me out. From
y childhood up I have shrunk from close
ntact with my fellow-men.  My mind
.s been busy with other thoughts; I have 
sired to investigate the mysterious and 
seen. When I have walked abroad I
':R

have heard whispers in the air; I have felt
the movement of wings, the gliding of un-
seen feet.  To my comrades these have
been a source of alarm and disquiet, but
not to me; is not God in the unseen with
all His angels ? and not only so, but the
best and wisest of men. There was a time
indeed, when life acquired for me a charm.
There was a smile which filled me with
blessedness, and made the sunshine more
sweet. But when she died my earthly joys
died with her. Since then I have thought
of little but the depths profound, into which
she has disappeared like the rest.
I was in the garden of my house on that
night when all the others left Semur. I
was restless, my mind was disturbed. It
seemed to me that I approached the crisis
of my life. Since the time when I led M.
le Maire beyond the walls, and we felt both
of us the rush and pressure of that crowd,
a feeling of expectation had been in my
mind. I knew not what I looked for-but
something I looked for that should change

ould it be a matter of wonder that the

ow one can go away who loves you, and 
ver return, nor speak, nor send any,

avens should bend down and the gates:
Paradise roll back, and those who have,;

irvel to me how they could be kept away. 
could not stay in-doors on this strange-
ght. My mind was full of agitation. I:
me out into the garden though it was
rk. I sat down upon the bench under 
e trellis -she loved it.  Often had I
ent half the night there thinking of her.
It was very dark that night: the sky all
iled, no light anywhere -a night like
ovember. One would have said there
Is snow in the air. I think I must have

currences have always been veiled in
;ep), and when I woke suddenly it was
find myself, if I may so speak, the sub-
:t of a struggle. The struggle was with-
me, yet it was not I. In my mind there
is a desire to rise from where I sat and
I away, I could not tell where or why;
.t something in me said stay, and my
ibs were as heavy as lead. I could not
ove; I sat still against my will; against
.e part of my will-but the other was
istinate and would not let me go. Thus
combat took place within me of which I
lew not the meaning. While it went on
began to hear the sound of many feet,
e opening of doors, the people pouring
tt into the streets.  This gave me no
rprise; it seemed to me that I understood
hy it was; only in my own case, I knew
)thing. I listened to the steps pouring
Lst, going on and on, faintly dying away
the distance, and there was a great still-
.ss. I then became convinced, though I
,nnot tell how, that I was the only living

Ln left in Semur; but neither did this-
)uble me. The struggle within me came:
an end, and I experienced a great calm.
I cannot tell how long it was till I per-;
ived a change in the air, in the darkness 
und me. It was like the movement of 
ne one unseen. I have felt such a sen-
;ion in the night, when all was still,;
fore now.  I saw nothing.   I heardi
thing. Yet I was aware, I cannot tell '
w, that there was a great coming and:
ing, and the sensation as of a multitude
the air. I then rose and went into my :
use, where Leocadie, my old house-
eper, had shut all the doors so carefully
ien she went to bed. They were now 
open, even the door of my wife's room
which I kept always the key, and where 
) one entered but n:myself; the windows:
so were open. I looked out upon the,:i
rande Rue, and all the other houses weref
:e mine. Everything was open, doorsi
id windows, and the streets were full. 
here was in them a flow and movement
i:i

the unseen, without a sound, sensible
.ly to the soul. I cannot describe it, for
neither heard nor saw, but felt. I have
ten been in crowds; I have lived in
iris, and once passed into England, and
alked about the London streets.  But
:ver, it seemed to me, never was I aware
so many, of so great a multitude.  I
ood at my open window, and watched as
a dream. M. le Maire is aware that his
>use is visible from mine. Towards that
stream seemed to be always going, and
the windows and in the doorways was a
nsation of multitudes like that which I
tve already described. Gazing out thus
)on the revolution which was happening
:fore my eyes, I did not think of my own
)use or what was passing there, till sud-
:nly, in a moment, I was aware that some
Le had come in to me. Not a crowd as
sewhere; one. My heart leaped up like
bird let loose; it grew faint within me
ith joy and fear. I was giddy so that I
iuld not stand. I called out her name,

ce. Besides was it needed, when heart
2ady spoke to heart ?
[ had no answer, but I needed none. I 
I myself down on the floor where her
t would be. Her presence wrapped me 
ind and round. It was beyond speech. 
zither did I need to see her face, nor to
ich her hand. She was more near to
:, more near, than when I held her in my 
ns. How long it was so, I cannot tell; -
was long as love, yet short as the draw- i
X of a breath. I knew nothing, felt
thing but Her, alone; all my wonder
d desire to know departed from me. 
e said to each other everything without
)rds-heart overflowing into heart.  It
is beyond knowledge or speech.
But this is not of public signification that
;hould occupy with it the time of M. le
aire.
After a while my happiness came to an 
d. I can no more tell how, than I can
1 how it came.  One moment, I was



<pb n="137"/>
irm in her presence; the next, I was
ne. I rose up staggering with blindness
d woe-could it be that already, already
was over ? I went out blindly following
;er her. My God, I shall follow, I shall
low, till life is over. She loved me; but
e was gone.
Thus, despair came to me at the very
)ment when the longing of my soul was
tisfied and I found myself among the
iseen; but I cared for knowledge no
nger, I sought only her. I lost a portion
my time so. I regret to have to confess
to M. le Maire. Much that I might
Lve learned will thus remain lost to my
[low-citizens and the world.  We are
ade so. What we desire eludes us at the
oment of grasping it-or those affections
hich are the foundation of our lives pre-
:cupy us, and blind the soul. Instead of
ideavouring to establish my faith and
ilighten my judgment as to those
.ysteries which have been my life-long
udy, all higher purpose departed from me;

From this also I awakened as out of a

nsible among spirits, if it was action, I
nnot tell. But the energy, the force, the
*ing that was in them, that could no one
isunderstand.  I stood in the streets,
gging and feeble, scarcely able to wish,
uch less to think. They pushed against

e unseen world described by a poet whom
. le Maire has probably heard of, the
an who traverses Purgatory (to speak of
other place) is seen by all, and is a
onder to all he meets-his shadow,
s breath separate him from those around
m.   But whether the unseen life has
[anged, or if it is I who am not worthy
.eir attention, this I know that I stood in
ir city like a ghost, and no one took any
eed of me. When there came back upon
e slowly my old desire to inquire, to
nderstand, I was met with this difficulty
t the first-that no one heeded me.  I

elf known. But the stream went along
e soft air, like the flowing of a river,
ting me aside from time to time, as the
will displace a straw, or the water a

guor nor lingering.  I was the only

ills as in a winding sheet; but within,

irase, in a word half breathed, a sudden
.rrier would rise. For a time I laboured
ter their meaning, trying hard and vainly
understand; but afterwards I perceived
at only when they spoke of Semur, of
mu who were gone forth, and of what was
Wing done, could I make it out. At first
is made me only more eager to hear;

mnt along, sang that song: 'Our brothers

was only after a time that I ventured
on this. And whether I spoke, and was
ird; or if it was read in my heart, I
mot tell.  There was a pause made
ind me as if of wondering and listening,
I then, in a moment, in the twinkling of
eye, a face suddenly turned and looked
o my face.
M. le Maire, it was the face of your
her, Martin Dupin, whom I remember
well as I remember my own father. He
s the best man I ever knew. It appeared

all the bands waiting to speak, men and

another the same tale. One voice was
tall and soft like a child's; it spoke of

her, M. le Maire, he too joined in, and
d: ' We went to him-but he could not

it they had no commission from on high,
it they were but permitted-that it was

night, which did not re-assure us, it is un-
necessary to say. A chill was in the air,
of night and mist. We shivered, not with
the nerves only but with the cold. And as
all was dark, so all was still. I had ex-
pected to feel the presence of those who
were there, as I had felt the crowd of the
invisible before they entered the city. But
the air was vacant, there was nothing but
darkness and cold. We went on for a
little way with a strange fervour of expect-
ation. At each moment, at each step, it
seemed to me that some great call must be
made upon my self-possession and courage,
some event happen; but there was nothing.
All was calm, the houses on either side of
the way were open, all but the office of the
octroi which was black as night with its
closed door. M. le Cure has told me since
that he believed Them to be there, though
unseen. This idea, however, was not in
my mind. I had felt the unseen multitude;

beating of my own pulses loudly work-
in my ears, yet it was less terrible than
first. A city when asleep is wonderful

If I record here an incident of another

lowed. As we passed by the hospital 
St. Jean, we heard distinctly, coming

patient voice. The sound revived for

SUPPLEMENT BY M. DE BOIS-SOMBRE.
HEN M. le Maire disappeared within the
ist, we all remained behind with troubled
arts. For my own part I was alarmed for
y friend. M. Martin Dupin is not noble.
e belongs, indeed, to the haute bourgeoisie,
d all his antecedents are most respect-
le; but it is his personal character and
mirable qualities which justify me in
lling him my friend. The manner in
hich he has performed his duties to his
[low-citizens during this time of distress
Is been sublime. It is not my habit to
ke any share in public life; the unhappy
-cumstances of France have made this
ipossible for years.  Nevertheless, I put

)posed an assault upon the place. Our 
id forefathers, though I would speak of

The moment at which I assumed the
;hority was one of great discouragement
I depression.  The men were tired to
ath. Their minds were worn out as
11 as their bodies. The excitement and

a startling sensation. Up to the last

pulse of alarm.  I myself was so far

a sudden panic. For if any catastrophe 
I happened, how could I ever have for-

, devotion, following him to the very
ge of the darkness ? I do not think, so
eply possessed was he by his mission,
it he saw her. Dupin is very determined
his way; but he is imaginative and 
oughtful, and it is very possible that, as 
required all his powers to brace him for
is enterprise, he made it a principle

r two representatives, Madame Dupin
epped forth, a thrill ran through us all.
)me would have called to her, for I heard
any broken exclamations; but most of us
=re too much startled to speak.  We
ought nothing less than that she was
,out to risk herself by going after them
to the city. If that was her intention-

e was stopped, it is most likely, by that
rious inability to move a step farther

might be in token of farewell to her
isband), then, instead of returning, seat
.rself on the road on the edge of the
irkness. It was a relief to all who were
oking on to see her there.
In the reaction after that excitement I

If any one thinks, however, that we, who
ere under the shelter of the roof of La

is that we were parted from them, not
lowing what suffering, what exposure they
ight have to bear, and knowing that they
ould not accept, as most of us were will-
g to accept, the interpretation of the
ystery; but there was a certain comfort
the fact that we had to be very busy,

eding the others. La Clairiere is a little
runtry house, not a great chateau, and it

;s of the connection between the late
narkable exhibition 'of the power of

od Sisters of St. Jean by the administra-

Divine Providence, and which refuses
en now to right the wrongs of the Sisters
St. Jean; though, if it may be permitted
me to say it, as his mother, it was very
-tunate in the late troubles that Martin
upin found himself at the head of the
ommune of Semur-since who else could
ve kept his self-control as he did?-caring
r all things and forgetting nothing; who
;e would, with so much courage, have
tered the city? and what other man, being

and as for the fasts and vigils, who thinks of
them? who attends to those sacred moments
of penitence ? Scarcely even a few ladies
are found to do so, instead of the whole
population, as in duty bound. I have even
seen it happen that my daughter-in-law and 
myself, and her friend Madame de Bois-
Sombre, and old Mere Julie from the
market, have formed the whole congrega-
tion. Figure to yourself the bon Dieu and
all the blessed saints looking down from
heaven to hear-four persons only in our 
great Cathedral! I trust that I know that
the good God does not despise even two or
three; but if any one will think of it-the
great bells rung, and the candles lighted, 
and the cure in his beautiful robes, and all
the companies of heaven looking on--and
only us four! This shows the neglect of
all sacred ordinances that was in Semur.
While, on the other hand, what grasping
there was for money; what fraud and deceit;
what foolishness and dissipation ! Even the

Clairiere, and a man for whom we have

pose upon me about the wood for the
iter's use, the very night before these

*er to me, has it been permitted either
see or to hear.  Bien! it has been so
ered. Agnes, my daughter-in-law, is a

inst her; and if there are moments
en my heart rebels, when I ask myself

which I could best serve both those of

ieving the watchers, there was for a

d yet more dear, because he is his father's

e but thee ?' But while my heart swelled
th this cry, suddenly it became apparent
me how many there were holding up
air hands helplessly to him, clinging to

;e could they turn? He was the one
long all who preserved his courage, who
ither feared nor failed. When those

I many more with me-though my
art was wrung with straining my ears to
:en if there was not a voice for me too,
t at the same time this thought was
,rking in my heart. There was a poor
iman close to me with little children
nging to her; neither did she know
tat those voices said. Her eyes turned
im Semur, all lost in the darkness, to
e sky above us and to me beside her, all
afused and bewildered; and the children

.il which is endless-the trouble of
ildhood which does not know why it is

ch as we could not understand, and

it which was so terrible, upon my home

which she had not satisfied my mind, as
iave before said. She was the mother
Jacques Richard, who was a good-for-

Ls done, but had established herself in

st bed in it, where she kept her place

votion for St. Jean; and the Sisters of
e Hospital had been very kind to her, and
;o to her vaurien of a son, who was
deed, in some manner, the occasion of all
ir troubles-being the first who complained
the opening of the chapel into the chief
ird, which was closed up by the adminis-
ation, and thus became, as I and many
hers think, the cause of all the calamities
at have come upon us. It was her bed

was at first supposed to be. 'Their

ssieurs had been converted, and made

chamber, and all cried out that they
re convinced, that they were ready to

od and looked at them with a look which
prised me, which was of pity rather than
npathy. As there was no one else to
.ak, I took the word, being the mother
the present Maire, and wife of the last,
I in part mistress of the house. Had
Tnes spoken I would have yielded to
-, but as she was silent I took my

which we must rest if we are to be

But it was with difficulty that I could in-

is reasonable. When, however, we had
lieted the agitation, and persuaded the
rod women to repose themselves, it was
) longer possible for me to rest. I pro-
ised to myself a little moment of quiet, for
y heart longed to be alone. I stole out
quietly as I might, not to disturb any
Le, and sat down upon the bench outside

)thing visible, so that if any one should
.ze and gaze down the valley, it was not

sing my eyes, lo, tears began to steal
o them like rain when there has been a
'er of heat. I have wept in my time
ny tears, but the time of weeping is over
th me, and through all these miseries I
d shed none. Now they came without
ding, like a benediction refreshing my
es. Just then I felt a soft pressure upon
{ shoulder, and there was Agnes coming
)se, putting her shoulder to mine, as was
r way, that we might support each other.
'You weep, ma mere,' she said.
'I think it is one of the angels Mere

'God bless thee, my child,' I said.
' Thanks, thanks, ma mbre!' she cried.

eak to Martin-of something in my

'What will you do, my child ?' I said, for
the light increased I could see the
eaning in her face, and that it was
rought up for some great thing.  ' Be-
ire, Agnes; risk not my son's happiness

' He loves thee dearly, mother,' she said.

ew would be so grateful to my son. I

was wrong to close up the chapel, to de-
ive the sick of the benefit of the holy
ass. But yet I could not but reflect that 
e bon Diez had suffered still more great
andals to take place without such a

i all that has been done by those who
Lve no cares of this world as we have,
it are brides of Christ, and upon all they

yself how many and great are the powers
evil, and that, save in us poor women
ho can do so little, the Church has few
lends: then it came back to me how
.inous was the offence that had been
immitted, and that it might well be that
e saints out of heaven should return to
Irth to take the part and avenge the cause
the weak.   My husband would have

came clear to me as I sat and pondered,

Lich are as precious gold, on the summits
the mountains-for at La Clairiere we are
arer the mountains than at Semur.
The house was more still than usual, and
slept to a later hour because of the agita-

ther towards the hills than to the valley,
;ing so deep in my thoughts that I did
)t look, as it was our constant wont to
ok, if any change had happened over Se-

lifted my eyes-but not with expectation

the gardens, to every spot from whence
at blessed sight was visible; for there

are the beautiful towers of Semur, the
ithedral with all its pinnacles, that are as
they were carved out of foam, and the
lid tower of St. Lambert, and the others,
'ery one. They told me after that I flew,
ough I am past running, to the farmyard
call all the labourers and servants of the
rm, bidding them prepare every carriage
id waggon, and even the charrettes, to

)uld not walk to the city.
'The men will be wild with privation
id trouble,' I said to myself; 'they will
ant the sight of their little children, the
)mfort of their wives.'
I did not wait to reason nor to ask my-
elf if I did well; and my son has told me
nce that he scarcely was more thank-

M. LE MAIRE CONCLUDES HIS RECORD.
IE narratives which I have collected from

I in their accounts there are naturally dis-

bject. But all are agreed that a strange

ment which might have led to very dis-
astrous consequences. Fortunately I had
foreseen this. I have always been con-
sidered to possess great knowledge of
human nature, and this has been matured
by recent events. I sent off messengers
instantly to bring home the women and
children, and called around me the men in
whom I could most trust. Though I need
not say that the excitement and suffering
of the past three days had told not less
upon myself than upon others, I abandoned
all idea of rest. The first thing that I did,
aided by my respectable fellow-townsmen,
was to take possession of all cabarets and
wine-shops, allowing indeed the proprietors
to return, but preventing all assemblages
within them.   We then established a
patrol of respectable citizens throughout
the city, to preserve the public peace.  I
calculated, with great anxiety, how many
hours it would be before my messengers
could reach La Clairiere, to bring back the
women--for in such a case the wives are

the best guardians, and can exercise an
influence more general and less suspected
than that of the magistrates; but this was
not to be hoped for for three or four hours
at least. Judge, then, what was my joy and
satisfaction when the sound of wheels (in
itself a pleasant sound, for no wheels had
been audible on the high-road since these
events began) came briskly to us from the
distance; and looking out from the watch-
tower over the Porte St. Lambert, I saw
the strangest procession. The wine-carts
and all the farm vehicles of La Clairiere,
and every kind of country waggon, were 
jolting along the road, all in a tumult and
babble of delicious voices; and from under
the rude canopies and awnings and roofs
of vine branches, made up to shield them
from the sun, lo! there were the children
like birds in a nest, one little head peeping 
over the other. And the cries and songs, 
the laughter, and the shoutings! As they
came along the air grew sweet, the world :
was made new.    Many of us, who had 



<pb n="247"/>
borne all the terrors and sufferings of
the past without fainting, now felt their
strength fail them. Some broke out into
tears, interrupted with laughter.  Some
called out aloud the names of their little
ones. We went out to meet them, every
man there present, myself at the head.
And I will not deny that a sensation of
pride came over me when I saw my
mother stand up in the first waggon,
with all those happy ones fluttering
around her. ' My son,' she said, 'I have
discharged the trust that was given me.
I bring thee back the blessing of God.'
'And God bless thee, my mother!' I
cried. The other men, who were fathers,
like me, came round me, crowding to kiss
her hand.  It is not among the women
of my family that you will find those
who abandon their duties.
And then to lift them down in armfuls,
those flowers of paradise, all fresh with the
air of the fields, all joyous like the birds!
We put them down by twos and threes,

some of us sobbing with joy. And to see
them dispersing hand in hand, running
here and there, each to its home, carrying ;
peace, and love, and gladness, through the
streets-that was enough to make the most
serious smile.  No fear was in them, or
care.  Every haggard man they met-
some of them feverish, restless, beginning
to think of riot and pleasure after forced
abstinence-there was a new shout, a rush
of little feet, a shower of soft kisses. The
women were following after, some packed
into the carts and waggons, pale and worn,
yet happy; some walking behind in groups; 
the more strong, or the more eager, in
advance, and a long line of stragglers
behind. There was anxiety in their faces, 
mingled with their joy.  How did they 
know what they might find in the houses
from which they had been shut out ? And
many felt, like me, that in the very return,
in the relief, there was danger. But the
children feared nothing; they filled the 
streets with their dear voices, and happi-

emed to throb with the sound that rolled

er risen from Semur in the memory of

When this wonderful moment was over,

irs shining above, and all the friendly

ade remarks full of justice and feeling.

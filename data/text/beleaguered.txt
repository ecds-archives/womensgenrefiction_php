<p>CHAPTER I. THE NARRATIVE OF M. LE MAIRE:  THE CONDITION OF THE CITY.</p>
<p>I, MARTIN DUPIN (de la Clairie*re), had the honour of holding the office of Maire in the town of Semur, in the Haute Bourgogne, at the time when the following events occurred. It will be perceived, therefore, that no one could have more complete knowledge of the facts--at once from my official position, and from the place of eminence in the affairs of the district generally which my family has held for many generations--by what citizen-like virtues and unblemished integrity I will not be vain enough to specify. Nor is it necessary; for no one who knows Semur can be ignorant of the position held by
<pb n="2 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the Dupins, from  father to son.  The estate La Clairie*re has been so long in the family 
that we might very well, were we disposed, add its name to our own, as so many families in France do; and, indeed, I do not prevent my wife (whose prejudices I respect) from making this use of it upon her cards.  But, for myself, bourgeois I was born and bourgeois I mean to die. My residence, like that of my father and grand- father, is at No. 29 in the Grande Rue, opposite, the Cathedral, and not far from the Hospital of St. Jean. We inhabit the first floor, along with the rez-de-chausse*e, which has been turned into domestic offices suitable for the needs of the family. My mother, holding a respected place in my household, lives with us in the most perfect family union.  My wife (ne*e de Champ- fleurie) is everything that is calculated to render a household happy; but, alas! one only of our two children survives to bless us. I have thought these details of my private circumstances necessary, to explain
<pb n="3 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the following narrative; to which I will also add, by way of introduction, a simple sketch of the town itself and its general conditions before these remarkable events occurred.</p>

<p>It was on a summer evening about sunset, the middle of the month of June, that my attention was attracted by an incident of no importance which occurred in the street, when I was making my way home, after an inspection of the young vines in my new vineyard to the left of La Clairie*re. All were in perfectly good condition, and none of the many signs which point to the arrival of the insect were apparent. I had come back in good spirits, thinking of the prosperity which I was happy to believe I had merited by a conscientious performance of all my duties. I had little with which to blame myself: not only my wife and relations, but my dependants and neighbours, approved my conduct as a man; and even myfellow-citizens, exacting as they are, had confirmed in my favour the good
<pb n="4 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

opinion which my family had been fortunate enough to secure from father to son. These thoughts were in my mind as I turned the corner of the Grande Rue and approached my own house.  At this moment the tinkle of a little bell warned all the bystanders of the procession which was about to pass, carrying the rites of the Church to some dying person. Some of the women, always devout, fell on their knees. I did not go so far as this, for I do not pretend, in these days of progress, to have retained the same attitude of mind as that which it is no doubt becoming to behold in the more devout sex; but I stood respectfully out of the way, and took off my hat, as good breeding alone, if nothing else, demanded of me. Just in front of me, however, was Jacques Richard, always a troublesome individual, standing doggedly, with his hat upon his head and his hands in his pockets, straight in the path of M. le Cure*. There is not in all France a more obstinate fellow. He stood there, notwith-
<pb n="5 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

standing the efforts of a good woman to draw him away, and though I myself called to him. M. le Cure* is not the man to flinch; and as he passed, walking as usual very quickly and straight, his soutane brushed against the blouse of Jacques.  He gave one quick glance from beneath his eyebrows at the profane interruption, but he would not distract himself from his sacred errand at such a moment. It is a sacred errand when any one, be he priest or layman, carries the best he can give to the bedside of the dying. I said this to Jacques when M. le Cure* had passed and the bell went tinkling on along the street.  'Jacques,' said I, 'I do not call it impious, like this good woman, but I call it inhuman.  What! a man goes to carry help to the dying, and you show him no respect !'</p>

<p>This brought the colour to his face; and I think, perhaps, that he might have become ashamed of the part he had played; but the women pushed in again, as they are so fond of doing. 'Oh, M. le Maire, he
<pb n="6 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

does not deserve that you should lose your words upon him!' they cried; 'and, besides, is it likely he will pay any attention to you when he tries to stop even the bon Dieu?' 'The bon Dieu' cried Jacques. 'Why doesn't He clear the way for himself? Look here. I do not care one farthing for your bon Dieu. Here is mine; I carry him about with me.' And he took a piece of a hundred sous out of his pocket (how had it got there?) 'Vive l'argent!' he said. 'You know it yourself, though you will not say so.  There is no bon Dieu but money. With money you can do anything. L'argent c'est le bon Dieu.'</p>

<p>'Be silent,' I cried, 'thou profane one!' And the women were still more indignant than I. 'We shall see, we shall see; when he is ill and would give his soul for something to wet his lips, his bon Dieu will not do much for him,' cried one; and another said, clasping her hands with a shrill cry, 'It is enough to make the dead rise out of their graves!'</p>
<pb n="7 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>'The dead rise out of their graves!' These words, though one has heard them before, took possession of my imagination. I saw the rude fellow go along the street as I went on, tossing the coin in his hand. One time it fell to the ground and rang upon the pavement, and he laughed more loudly as he picked it up. He was walking towards the sunset, and I too, at a distance after. The sky was full of rose- tinted clouds floating across the blue, floating high over the grey pinnacles of the Cathedral, and filling the long open line of the Rue St. Etienne down which he was going.  As I crossed to my own house I caught him full against the light, in his blue blouse, tossing the big silver piece in the air, and heard him laugh and shout 'Vive l'argent!  This is the only bon Dieu.' Though there are many people who live as if this were their sentiment, there are few who give it such brutal expression; but some of the people at the corner of the street laughed too. 'Bravo, 
Jacques!' they
<pb n="8 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

cried; and one said, 'You are right, mon ami, the only god to trust in nowadays.' 'It is a short credo, M. le Maire,' said another, who caught my eye. He saw I was displeased, this one, and his countenance changed at once. </p>

<p>'Yes, Jean Pierre,' I said, 'it is worse than short--it is brutal. I hope no man who respects himself will ever countenance it.  It is against the dignity of human nature, if nothing more.'</p>

<p>'Ah, M. le Maire!' cried a poor woman, one of the good ladies of the market, with entrenchments of baskets all round her, who had been walking my way; 'ah, M. le Maire! did not I say true ? it is enough to bring the dead out of their graves.'</p>

<p>'That would be something to see,' said Jean Pierre, with a laugh; 'and I hope, ma bonne femme, that if you have any interest with them, you will entreat these gentlemen to appear before I go away.'</p>

<p>'I do not like such jesting,' said I. 'The dead are very dead and will not disturb
<pb n="9 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

anybody, but even the prejudices of respectable persons ought to be respected. A ribald like Jacques counts for nothing, but I did not expect this from you.'</p>

<p>'What would you, M. le Maire ?' he said, with a shrug of his shoulders. 'We are made like that. I respect prejudices as you say. My wife is a good woman, she prays for two--but me! How can I tell that Jacques is not right after all? A grosse pie*ce of a hundred sous, one sees that, one knows what it can do--but for the other!'  He thrust up one shoulder to his ear, and turned up the palms of his hands.</p>

<p>'It is our duty at all times to respect the convictions of others,' I said, severely; and passed on to my own house, having no desire to encourage discussions at the street corner. A man in my position is obliged to be always mindful of the example he ought to set. But I had not yet done with this phrase, which had, as I have said, caught my ear and my imagination. My mother was in the great salle of the rez-de-
<pb n="10 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

chause*e, as I passed, in altercation with a peasant who had just brought us in some loads of wood. There is often, it seems to me, a sort of refrain in conversation, which one catches everywhere as one comes and goes.  Figure my astonishment when I heard from the lips of my good mother the same words with which that good-for-nothing Jacques Richard had made the profession of his brutal faith. 'Go!' she cried, in anger; 'you are all the same.  Money is your god.  De grosses pie*ces, that is all you think of in these days.'</p>

<p>'Eh, bien, madame,' said the peasant; and if so, what then ? Don't you others, gentlemen and ladies, do just the same?  What is there in the world but money to think of? If it is a question of marriage, you demand what is the dot; if it is a question of office, you ask, Monsieur Untel, is he rich ? And it is perfectly just. We know what money can do; but as for le bon Dieu, whom our grandmothers used to talk about--'</p>
<pb n="11 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>And lo! our gros paysan made exactly the same gesture as Jean Pierre. He put up his shoulders to his ears, and spread out the palms of his hands, as who should say, There is nothing further to be said.</p>

<p>Then there occurred a still more remarkable repetition.  My mother, as may be supposed, being a very respectable person, and more or less de*vote, grew red with indignation and horror.</p>

<p>'Oh, these poor grandmothers!' she cried; 'God give them rest! It is enough to make the dead rise out of their graves.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I will answer for les morts! They will give nobody any trouble,' he said with a laugh. I went in and reproved the man severely, finding that, as I supposed, he had attempted to cheat my good mother in the price of the wood.  Fortunately she had been quite as clever as he was. She went upstairs shaking her head, while I gave the man to understand that no one should speak to her but with the profoundest respect in my house. 'She has
<pb n="12 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

her opinions, like all respectable ladies,' I said, 'but under this roof these opinions shall always be sacred.' And, to do him justice, I will add that when it was put to him in this way Gros-Jean was ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>When I talked over these incidents with my wife, as we gave each other the narrative of our day's experiences, she was greatly distressed, as may be supposed. 'I try to hope they are not so bad as Bonne Maman thinks. But oh, mon ami!' she said, 'what will the world come to if this is what they really believe?'</p>

<p>'Take courage,' I said; 'the world will never come to anything much different from what 
it is. So long as there are des anges like thee to pray for us, the scale will not go down 
to the wrong side.'</p>

<p>I said this, of course, to please my Agne*s, who is the best of wives; but on thinking it over after, I could not but be struck with the extreme justice (not to speak of the beauty of the sentiment) of
<pb n="13 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

this thought. The bon Dieu--if, indeed, that great Being is as represented to us by the Church--must naturally care as much for one-half of His creatures as for the other, though they have not the same weight in the world; and consequently the faith of the women must hold the balance straight, especially if, as is said, they exceed us in point of numbers. This leaves a little margin for those of them who profess the same freedom of thought as is generally accorded to men-a class, I must add, which I abominate from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>I need not dwell upon other little scenes which impressed the same idea still more upon my mind. Semur, I need not say, is not the centre of the world, and might, therefore, be supposed likely to escape the full current of worldliness. We amuse ourselves little, and we have not any opportunity of rising to the heights of ambition; for our town is not even the chef-lieu of the department,--though this is
<pb n="14 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

a subject upon which I cannot trust myself to speak.  Figure to yourself that La Rochette--a place of yesterday, without either the beauty or the antiquity of Semur--has been chosen as the centre of affairs, the residence of M. le Pre*fet! But I will not enter upon this question. What I was saying was, that, notwithstanding the fact that we amuse ourselves but little, that there is no theatre to speak of, little society, few distractions, and none of those induce- ments to strive for gain and to indulge the senses, which exist, for instance, in Paris--that capital of the world--yet, nevertheless, the thirst for money and for pleasure has increased among us to an extent which I cannot but consider alarming. Gros-Jean, peasant, toils for money, and hoards; Jacques, who is a cooper and maker of wine casks, gains and drinks; Jean Pierre snatches at every sous that comes in his way, and spends it in yet worse dissipations. He is one who quails when he meets my eye; he sins en cachette; but Jacques is
<pb n="15 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

bold, and defies opinion; and Gros-Jean  is firm in the belief that to hoard money is the highest of mortal occupations. These three are types of what the population is at Semur. The men would all sell their souls for a grosse pie*ce of fifty sous-indeed, they would laugh, and express their delight that any one should believe them to have souls, if they could but have a chance of selling them; and the devil, who was once supposed to deal in that commodity, would be very welcome among us. And as for the bon Dieu-pouff! that was an affair of the grandmothers--le bon Dieu c'est l'argent. This is their creed. I was very near the beginning of my official year as Maire when my attention was called to these matters as I have described above. A man may go on for years keeping quiet himself--keeping out of tumult, religious or political--and make no discovery of the general current of feeling; but when you are forced to serve your country in any official capacity, and when your eyes are opened to the state
<pb n="16 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

of affairs around you, then I allow that an inexperienced observer might well cry out, as my wife did, 'What will become of the world?' I am not prejudiced myself--unnecessary to say that the foolish scruples of the women do not move me. But the devotion of the community at large to this pursuit of gain--money without any grandeur, and pleasure without any refinement--that is a thing which cannot fail to wound all who believe in human nature. To be a millionaire--that, I grant, would be pleasant.  A man as rich as Monte Christo, able to do whatever he would, with the equipage of an English duke, the palace of an Italian prince, the retinue of a Russian noble--he, indeed, might be excused if his money seemed to him a kind of god. But Gros-Jean, who lays up two sous at a time, and lives on black bread and an onion; and Jacques, whose grosse pie*ce but secures him the headache of a drunkard next morning--what to them could be this miserable deity ? As for myself, however, it was my business, as
<pb n="17 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

Maire of the commune, to take as little notice as possible of the follies these people might say, and to hold the middle course between the prejudices of the respectable and the levities of the foolish. With this, without more, to think of, I had enough to keep all my faculties employed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II. THE NARRATIVE OF M. LE MAIRE CONTINUED:  BEGINNING OF THE LATE REMARKABLE EVENTS.</p>

<p>I do not attempt to make out any distinct connection between the simple incidents above recorded, and the extraordinary events that followed. I have  related them as they happened; chiefly by way of showing the state of feeling in the city, and the sentiment which pervaded the community--a sentiment, I fear, too common in my country. I need not say that to encourage superstition is far from my wish. I am a man of my century, and proud of being so; very little disposed to yield to the domination of the clerical party, though desirous of showing all just tolerance for conscien-
<pb n="19 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

tious faith, and every respect for the prejudices of the ladies of my family. I am, moreover, all the more inclined to be careful of giving in my adhesion to any prodigy, in consequence of a consciousness that the faculty of imagination has always been one of my characteristics. It usually is so, I am aware, in superior minds, and it has procured me many pleasures unknown to the common herd. Had it been possible for me to believe that I had been misled by  this faculty, I should have carefully refrained from putting upon record any account of my individual impressions; but my attitude here is not that of a man recording his personal experiences only, but of one who is the official mouthpiece and representative of the commune, and whose duty it is to render to government and to the human race a true narrative of the very wonderful facts to which every citizen of Semur can bear witness. In this capacity it has become my duty so to arrange and edit the different accounts of
<pb n="20 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the mystery, as to present one coherent and trustworthy chronicle to the world.</p>

<p>To proceed, however, with my narrative.  It is not necessary for me to describe what summer is in the Haute Bourgogne.  Our generous wines, our glorious fruits, are sufficient proof, without any assertion on my part.  The summer with us is as a perpetual fe*te--at least, before the insect appeared it was so, though now anxiety about the condition of our vines may cloud our enjoyment of the glorious sunshine which ripens them hourly before our eyes. Judge, then, of the astonishment of the world when there suddenly came upon us a darkness as in the depth of winter, falling, without warning, into the midst of the brilliant weather to which we are accustomed, and which had never failed us before in the memory of man! It was the month of July, when, in ordinary seasons, a cloud is so rare that it is a joy to see one, merely as a variety upon the brightness. Suddenly, in the midst of our summer delights, this
<pb n="21 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

darkness came. Its first appearance took us so entirely by surprise that life seemed to stop short, and the business of the whole town was delayed by an hour or two; nobody being able to believe that at six o'clock in the morning the sun had not risen. I do not assert that the sun did not rise; all I mean to say is that at Semur it was still dark, as in a morning of winter, and when it gradually and slowly became day many hours of the morning were already spent. And never shall I forget the aspect of day when it came. It was like a ghost or pale shadow of the glorious days of July with which we are usually blessed. The barometer did not go down, nor was there any rain, but an unusual greyness wrapped earth and sky. I heard people say in the streets, and I am aware that the same words came to my own lips: 'If it were not full summer, I should say it was going to snow.' We have much snow in the Haute Bourgogne, and we are well acquainted with this aspect of the skies. Of the depressing effect which this
<pb n="22 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

greyness exercised upon myself personally, I will not speak. I have always been noted as a man of fine perceptions, and I was aware instinctively that such a state of the atmosphere must mean something more than was apparent on the surface. But, as the danger was of an entirely unprecedented character, it is not to be wondered at that I should be completely at a loss to divine what its meaning was. It was a blight some people said; and many were of opinion that it was caused by clouds of animalculae coming, as is described in ancient writings, to destroy the crops, and even to affect the health of the population. The doctors scoffed at this; but they talked about malaria, which, as far as I could understand, was likely to produce exactly the same effect.  The night closed in early as the day had dawned late; the lamps were lighted before six o'clock, and daylight had only begun about ten!  Figure to yourself, a July day! There ought to have been a moon almost
<pb n="23 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

at the full; but no moon was visible, no stars--nothing but a grey veil of clouds, growing darker and darker as the moments went on; such I have heard are the days and the nights in England, where the seafogs so often blot out the sky. But we are unacquainted with anything of the kind in our plaisant pays de France. There was nothing else talked of in Semur all that night, as may well be imagined. My own mind was extremely uneasy. Do what I would, I could not deliver myself from a sense of something dreadful in the air which was neither malaria nor animalculae, I took a promenade through the streets that evening, accompanied by M. Barbou, my adjoint, to make sure that all was safe; and the darkness was such that we almost lost our way, though we were both born in the town and had known every turning from our boyhood. It cannot be denied that Semur is very badly lighted. We retain still the lanterns slung by cords across the streets which once were general
<pb n="24 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

in France, but which, in most places, have been superseded by the modern institution of gas. Gladly would I have distinguished my term of office by bringing gas to Semur.  But the expense would have been great, and there were a hundred objections. In summer generally, the lanterns were of little consequence because of the brightness of the sky; but to see them now, twinkling dimly here and there, making us conscious how dark it was, was strange indeed. It was in the interests of order that we took our round, with a fear, in my mind at least, of I knew not what. M. l'Adjoint said nothing, but no doubt he thought as I did.</p>

<p>While we were thus patrolling the city with a special eye to the prevention of all seditious assemblages, such as are too apt to take advantage of any circumstances that may disturb the ordinary life of a city, or throw discredit on its magistrates, we were accosted by Paul Lecamus, a man whom I have always considered as something of a visionary, though his conduct is
<pb n="25 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

irreproachable, and his life honourable and industrious. He entertains religious convictions of a curious kind; but, as the man is quite free from revolutionary sentiments, I have never considered it to be my duty to interfere with him, or to investigate his creed. Indeed, he has been treated generally in Semur as a dreamer of dreams--one who holds a great many impracticable and foolish opinions--though the respect which I always exact for those whose lives are respectable and worthy has been a protection to him. He was, I think, aware that he owed something to my good offices, and it was to me accordingly that he addressed himself.</p>

<p>'Good evening, M. le Maire,' he said; 'you are groping about, like myself, in this strange night.'</p>

<p>'Good evening M. Paul,' I replied. 'It is, indeed, a strange night. It indicates, I fear, that a storm is coming.'</p>

<p>M. Paul shook his head. There is a solemnity about even his ordinary appear-
<pb n="26 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

ance.  He has a long face, pale, and adorned with a heavy, drooping moustache, which adds much to the solemn impression made by his countenance. He looked at me with great gravity as he stood in the shadow of the lamp, and slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>'You do not agree with me? Well! the opinion of a man like M. Paul Lecamus is always worthy to be heard.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' he said, 'I am called visionary.  I am not supposed to be a trustworthy witness. Nevertheless, if M. Le Maire will come with me, I will show him something that is very strange--something that is almost more wonderful than the darkness-- more strange,' he went on with great earnestness, 'than any storm that ever ravaged Burgundy.'</p>

<p>'That is much to say. A tempest now when the vines are in full bearing--'</p>

<p>'Would be nothing, nothing to what I can show you. Only come with me to the Porte St. Lambert.'</p>

<p>'If M. le Maire will excuse me,' said M.
<pb n="27 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

Barbou, 'I think I will go home. It is a little cold, and you are aware that I am always afraid of the damp.' In fact, our coats were beaded with a cold dew as in November, and I could not but acknowledge that my respectable colleague had reason.  Besides, we were close to his house, and he had, no doubt, the sustaining consciousness of having done everything that was really incumbent upon him. 'Our ways lie together as far as my house,' he said, with a slight chattering of his teeth.  No doubt it was the cold. After we had walked with him to his door, we proceeded to the Porte St. Lambert. By this time almost everybody had re-entered their houses. The streets were very dark, and they were also very still. When we reached the gates, at that hour of the night, we found them shut as a matter of course. The officers of the octroi were standing close together at the door of their office, in which the lamp was burning. The very lamp seemed oppressed by the heavy
<pb n="28 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

air; it burnt dully, surrounded with a yellow haze.  The men had the appearance of suffering greatly from cold. They received me with a satisfaction which was very gratifying to me. 'At length here is M. le Maire himself,' they said.</p>

<p>'My good friends,' said I, 'you have a cold post tonight.  The weather has changed in the most extraordinary way. I have no doubt the scientific gentlemen at the Muse*e will be able to tell us all about it--M. de Clairon--'</p>

<p>'Not to interrupt M. le Maire,' said Riou, of the octroi, ' I think there is more in it than any scientific gentleman can explain.'</p>

<p>'Ah! You think so. But they explain everything,' I said, with a smile. 'They tell us how the wind is going to blow.'</p>

<p>As I said this, there seemed to pass us, from the direction of the closed gates, a breath of air so cold that I could not restrain a shiver. They looked at each other. It was not a smile that passed between them --they were too pale, too cold, to smile:
<pb n="29 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

but a look of intelligence. 'M. le Maire,' said one of them, 'perceives it too;' but they did not shiver as I did. They were like men turned into ice who could feel no more.</p>

<p>'It is, without doubt, the most extraordinary weather,' I said.  My teeth chattered like Barbou's.  It was all I could do to keep myself steady. No one made any reply; but Lecamus said, 'Have the goodness to open the little postern for foot-passengers: M. le Maire wishes to make an inspection outside.'</p>

<p>Upon these words, Riou, who knew me well, caught me by the arm. 'A thousand pardons,' he said,  'M. le Maire; but I entreat you, do not go. Who can tell what is outside? Since this morning there is something very strange on the other side of the gates. If M. le Maire would listen to me, he would keep them shut night and day till that is gone, he would not go out into the midst of it. Mon Dieu! a man may be brave. I know the courage of M.
<pb n="30 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

le Maire; but to march without necessity into the jaws of hell: mon Dieu!' cried the poor man again. He crossed himself, and none of us smiled. Now a man may sign himself at the church door--one does so out of respect; but to use that ceremony for one's own advantage, before other men, is rare--except in the case of members of a very decided party. Riou was not one of these. He signed himself in sight of us all, and not one of us smiled.</p>

<p>The other was less familiar--he knew me only in my public capacity--he was one Gallais of the Quartier St. Me*don.  He said, taking off his hat: 'If I were M. le Maire, saving your respect, I would not go Out into an unknown danger with this man here, a man who is known as a pietist, as a clerical, as one who sees visions--'</p>

<p>'He is not a clerical, he is a good citizen,' I said; 'come, lend us your lantern. Shall I shrink from my duty wherever it leads me? Nay, my good friends, the Maire of a French commune fears neither man nor
<pb n="31 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

devil in the exercise of his duty. M. Paul, lead on.' When I said the word 'devil' a spasm of alarm passed over Riou's face.  He crossed himself again. This time I could not but smile. 'My little Riou,' I said, 'do you know that you are a little imbecile with your piety? There is a time for everything.'</p>

<p>'Except religion, M. le Maire; that is never out of place,' said Gallais.</p>

<p>I could not believe my senses. 'Is it a conversion?' I said. 'Some of our Carmes de*chausse*s must have passed this way.'</p>

<p>'M. le Maire will soon see other teachers more wonderful than the Carmes de*chausse*s,' said Lecamus. He went and took down the lantern from its nail, and opened the little door. When it opened, I was once more penetrated by the same icy breath; once, twice, thrice, I cannot tell how many times this crossed me, as if some one passed.  I looked round upon the others--I gave way a step. I could not help it. In spite of me, the hair seemed to
<pb n="32 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

rise erect on my head. The two officers stood close together, and Riou, collecting his courage, made an attempt to laugh. 'M. le Maire perceives,' he said, his lips trembling almost too much to form the words, 'that the winds are walking about.' 'Hush, for God's sake!' said the other, grasping him by the arm.</p>

<p>This recalled me to myself; and I followed Lecamus, who stood waiting for me holding the door a little ajar.  He went on strangely, like--I can use no other words to express it—a man making his way in the face of a crowd, a thing very surprising to me. I followed him close; but the moment I emerged from the doorway something caught my breath. The same feeling seized me also. I gasped; a sense of suffocation came upon me; I put out my hand to lay hold upon my guide.  The solid grasp I got of his arm re-assured me a little, and he did not hesitate, but pushed his way on. We got out clear of the gate and the shadow of the wall, keeping close
<pb n="33 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

to the little watch-tower on the west side.  Then he made a pause, and so did I. We stood against the tower and looked out before us. There was nothing there. The darkness was great, yet through the gloom of the night I could see the division of the road from the broken ground on either side; there was nothing there.  I gasped, and drew myself up close against the wall, as Lecamus had also done. There was in the air, in the night, a sensation the most strange I have ever experienced. I have felt the same thing indeed at other times, in face of a great crowd, when thousands of people were moving, rustling, struggling, breathing around me, thronging all the vacant space, filling up every spot. This was the sensation that overwhelmed me here--a crowd: yet nothing to be seen but the darkness, the indistinct line of the road. We could not move for them, so close were they round us. What do I say?  There was nobody--nothing--not a form to be seen, not a face but his and mine. I am obliged
<pb n="34 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

to confess that the moment was to me an awful moment. I could not speak. My heart beat wildly as if trying to escape from my breast--every breath I drew was with an effort. I clung to Lecamus with deadly and helpless terror, and forced myself back upon the wall, crouching against it; I did not turn and fly, as would have been natural. What say I? did not! I could not! they pressed round us so. Ah! you would think I must be mad to use such words, for there was nobody near me--not a shadow even upon the road.</p>

<p>Lecamus would have gone farther on; he would have pressed his way boldly into the midst; but my courage was not equal to this.  I clutched and clung to him, dragging myself along against the wall, my whole mind intent upon getting back. I was stronger than he, and he had no power to resist me.  I turned back, stumbling blindly, keeping my face to that crowd (there was no one), but struggling back again, tearing the skin off my hands as I
<pb n="35 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

groped my way along the wall.  Oh, the agony of seeing the door closed! I have buffeted my way through a crowd before now, but I may say that I never before knew what terror was. When I fell upon the door, dragging Lecamus with me, it opened, thank God! I stumbled in, clutching at Riou with my disengaged hand, and fell upon the floor of the octroi, where they thought I had fainted. But this was not the case. A man of resolution may give way to the overpowering sensations of the moment.  His bodily faculties may fail him; but his mind will not fail.  As in every really superior intelligence, my forces collected for the emergency. While the officers ran to bring me water, to search for the eau-de vie which they had in a cupboard, I astonished them all by rising up, pale, but with full command of myself. 'It is enough,' I said, raising my hand.  'I thank you, Messieurs, but nothing more is necessary;' and I would not take any of their restoratives. They were impressed, as was only
<pb n="36 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

natural, by the sight of my perfect self-possession: it helped them to acquire for themselves a demeanour befitting the occasion; and I felt, though still in great physical weakness and agitation, the consoling consciousness of having fulfilled my functions as head of the community.</p>

<p>'M. le Maire has seen a--what there is outside?' Riou cried, stammering in his excitement; and the other fixed upon me eyes which were hungering with eagerness--if, indeed, it is permitted to use such words.</p>

<p>'I have seen-nothing, Riou,' I said.</p>

<p>They looked at me with the utmost wonder. 'M. le Maire has seen--nothing?' said Riou. 'Ah, I see! you say so to spare us.  We have proved ourselves cowards; but if you will pardon me, M. le Maire, you, too, re-entered precipitately--you too! There are facts which may appal the bravest--but I implore you to tell us what you have seen.'</p>

<p>'I have seen nothing,' I said.  As I
<pb n="37 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

spoke, my natural calm composure returned, my heart resumed its usual tranquil beating. 'There is nothing to be seen--it is dark, and one can perceive the line of the road for but a little way--that is all. There is nothing to be seen--'</p>

<p>They looked at me, startled and incredulous. They did not know what to think. How could they refuse to believe me, sitting there calmly raising my eyes to them, making my statement with what they felt to be an air of perfect truth? But, then, how account for the precipitate return which they had already noted, the supposed faint, the pallor of my looks? They did not know what to think.</p>

<p>And here, let me remark, as in my conduct throughout these remarkable events, may be seen the benefit, the high advantage, of truth. Had not this been the truth, I could not have borne the searching of their looks. But it was true. There was nothing--nothing to be seen; in one sense, this was the thing of all others which over-
<pb n="38 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

whelmed my mind. But why insist upon these matters of detail to unenlightened men?  There was nothing, and I had seen nothing.  What I said was the truth.</p>

<p>All this time Lecamus had said nothing.  As I raised myself from the ground, I had vaguely perceived him hanging up the lantern where it had been before; now he became distinct to me as I recovered the full possession of my faculties.  He had seated himself upon a bench by the wall.  There was no agitation about him; no sign of the thrill of departing excitement, which I felt going through my veins as through the strings of a harp. He was sitting against the wall, with his head drooping, his eyes cast down, an air of disappointment and despondency about him--nothing more.  I got up as soon as I felt that I could go away with perfect propriety; but, before I left the place, called him. He got up when he heard his name, but he did it with reluctance. He came with me be-
<pb n="39 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

cause I asked him to do so, not from any wish of his own. Very different were the feelings of Riou and Gallais. They did their utmost to engage me in conversation, to consult me about a hundred trifles, to ask me with the greatest deference what they ought to do in such and such cases, pressing close to me, trying every expedient to delay my departure. When we went away they stood at the door of their little office close together, looking after us with looks which I found it difficult to forget; they would not abandon their post; but their faces were pale and contracted, their eyes wild with anxiety and 
distress.</p>

<p>It was only as I walked away, hearing my own steps and those of Lecamus ringing upon the pavement, that I began to realise what had happened.  The effort of recovering my composure, the relief from the extreme excitement of terror (which, dreadful as the idea is, I am obliged to confess I had actually felt), the sudden
<pb n="40 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

influx of life and strength to my brain, had pushed away for the moment the recollection of what lay outside. When I thought of it again, the blood began once more to course in my veins. Lecamus went on by my side with his head down, the eyelids drooping over his eyes, not saying a word.  He followed me when I called him: but cast a regretful look at the postern by which we had gone out, through which I had dragged him back in a panic (I confess it) unworthy of me. Only when we had left at some distance behind us that door into the unseen, did my senses come fully back to me, and I ventured to ask myself what it meant. 'Lecamus,' I said--I could scarcely put my question into words--'what do you think? what is your idea?--how do you explain--' Even then I am glad to think I had sufficient power of control not to betray all that I felt.</p>

<p>'One does not try to explain,' he said slowly; 'one longs to know--that is all. If M. le Maire had not been--in such
<pb n="41 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

haste--had he been willing to go farther--to investigate--'</p>

<p>'God forbid!' I said; and the impulse to quicken my steps, to get home and put myself in safety, was almost more than I could restrain. But I forced myself to go quietly, to measure my steps by his, which were slow and reluctant, as if he dragged himself away with difficulty from that which was behind.</p>

<p>What was it?  'Do not ask, do not ask!' Nature seemed to say in my heart.  Thoughts came into my mind in such a dizzy crowd, that the multitude of them seemed to take away my senses. I put up my hands to my ears, in which they seemed to be buzzing and rustling like bees, to stop the sound.  When I did so, Lecamus turned and looked at me--grave and wondering. This recalled me to a sense of my weakness. But how I got home I can scarcely say. My mother and wife met me with anxiety. They were greatly disturbed about the Hospital of St. Jean, in respect to which it had been recently
<pb n="42 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

decided that certain changes should be made. The great ward of the hospital, which was the chief establishment for the sick in the town, had hitherto been so placed in communication with the chapel that mass was heard daily by all the patients--a thing which some had complained of as an annoyance disturbing their rest. So many, indeed, had been the complaints received, that we had come to the conclusion either that the opening should be built up, or the office suspended.  Against this decision, it is needless to say, the Sisters of St. Jean were moving heaven and earth. Equally unnecessary for me to add, that having so decided in my public capacity, as at once the representative of popular opinion and its guide, the covert reproaches which were breathed in my presence, and even the personal appeals made to me, had failed of any result. I respect the Sisters of St. Jean. They are good women and excellent nurses, and the commune owes them much. Still, justice must
<pb n="43 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

be impartial; and so long as I retain my position at the head of the community, it is my duty to see that all have their due.  My opinions as a private individual, were I allowed to return to that humble position, are entirely a different matter; but this is a thing which ladies, however excellent, are slow to allow or to understand.</p>

<p>I will not pretend that this was to me a night of rest. In the darkness, when all is still, any anxiety which may afflict the soul is apt to gain complete possession and mastery, as all who have had true experience of life will understand. The night was very dark and very still, the clocks striking out the hours which went so slowly, and not another sound audible.  The streets of Semur are always quiet, but they were more still than usual that night. Now and then, in a pause of my thoughts, I could hear the soft breathing of my Agne*s in the adjoining room, which gave me a little comfort. But this was only by intervals, when I was able to escape from the grasp of the recollections
<pb n="44 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

that held me fast. Again I seemed to see under my closed eyelids the faint line of the high road which led from the Porte St. Lambert, the broken ground with its ragged bushes on either side, and no one--no one there--not a soul, not a shadow: yet a multitude! When I allowed myself to think of this, my heart leaped into my throat again, my blood ran in my veins like a river in flood. I need not say that I resisted this transport of the nerves with all my might. As the night grew slowly into morning my power of resistance increased; I turned my back, so to speak, upon my recollections, and said to myself, with growing firmness, that all sensations of the body must have their origin in the body. Some derangement of the system--easily explainable, no doubt, if one but held the clue--must have produced the impression which otherwise it would be impossible to explain. As I turned this over and over in my mind, carefully avoiding all temptations to excitement--which is the only
<pb n="45 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

wise course in the case of a strong impression on the nerves--I gradually became able to believe that this was the cause.  It is one of the penalties, I said to myself, which one has to pay for an organization more finely tempered than that of the crowd.</p>

<p>This long struggle with myself made the night less tedious, though, perhaps, more terrible; and when at length I was overpowered by sleep, the short interval of unconsciousness restored me like a cordial.  I woke in the early morning, feeling almost able to smile at the terrors of the night. When one can assure oneself that the day has really begun, even while it is yet dark, there is a change of sensation, an increase of strength and courage. One by one the dark hours went on. I heard them pealing from the Cathedral clock--four, five, six, seven--all dark, dark. I had got up and dressed before the last, but found no one else awake when I went out--no one stirring in the house,--no one
<pb n="46 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

moving in the street. The Cathedral doors were shut fast, a thing I have never seen before since I remember. Get up early who will, Pe*re Laserques the sacristan is always up still earlier. He is a good old man, and I have often heard him say God's house should be open first of all houses, in case there might be any miserable ones about who had found no shelter in the dwellings of men. But the darkness had cheated even Pe*re Laserques. To see those great doors closed which stood always open gave me a shiver, I cannot well tell why. Had they been open, there was an inclination in my mind to have gone in, though I cannot tell why; for I am not in the habit of attending mass, save on Sunday to set an example. There were no shops open, not a sound about.  I went out upon the ramparts to the Mont St. Lambert, where the band plays on Sundays.  In all the trees there was not so much as the twitter of a bird. I could hear the river flowing swiftly below the wall, but I
<pb n="47 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

could not see it, except as something dark, a ravine of gloom below, and beyond the walls I did not venture to look.  Why should I look?  There was nothing, nothing, as I knew. But fancy is so uncontrollable, and one's nerves so little to be trusted, that it was a wise precaution to refrain. The gloom itself was oppressive enough; the air seemed to creep with apprehensions, and from time to time my heart fluttered with a sick movement, as if it would escape from my control.   But everything was still, still as the dead who had been so often in recent days called out of their graves by one or another. 'Enough to bring the dead out of their graves.'  What strange words to make use of! It was rather now as if the world had become a grave in which we, though living, were held fast.</p>

<p>Soon after this the dark world began to lighten faintly, and with the rising of a little white mist, like a veil rolling upwards, I at last saw the river and the fields beyond.
<pb n="48 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

To see anything at all lightened my heart a little, and I turned homeward when this faint daylight appeared. When I got back into the street, I found that the people at last were stirring. They had all a look of half panic, half shame upon their faces.  Many were yawning and stretching themselves.  'Good morning, M. le Maire,' said one and another; 'you are early astir.' 'Not so early either,' I said; and then they added, almost every individual, with a look of shame, 'We were so late this morning; we overslept ourselves--like yesterday. The weather is extraordinary.' This was repeated to me by all kinds of people. They were half frightened, and they were ashamed.   Pe*re Laserques was sitting moaning on the Cathedral steps. Such a thing had never happened before. He had not rung the bell for early mass; he had not opened the Cathedral; he had not called M. le Cure*. 'I think I must be going out of my senses,' he said; 'but then, M. le Maire, the weather! Did any-
<pb n="49 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

one ever see such weather? I think there must be some evil brewing. It is not for nothing that the seasons change-that winter comes in the midst of summer.'</p>

<p>After this I went home. My mother came running to one door when I entered, and my wife to another. 'O mon fils!' and 'O mon ami!' they said, rushing upon me.  They wept, these dear women. I could not at first prevail upon them to tell me what was the matter. At last they confessed that they believed something to have happened to me, in punishment for the wrong done to the Sisters at the hospital. 'Make haste, my son, to amend this error,' my mother cried, 'lest a worse thing befall us!' And then I discovered that among the women, and among many of the poor people, it had come to be believed that the darkness was a curse upon us for what we had done in respect to the hospital. This roused me to indignation. 'If they think I am to be driven from my duty by their magic,' I
<pb n="50 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

cried; 'it is no better than witchcraft!' not that I believed for a moment that it was they who had done it. My wife wept, and my mother became angry with me; but  when a thing is duty, it is neither wife nor mother who will move me out of my way.</p>

<p>It was a miserable day. There was not light enough to see anything--scarcely to see each other's faces; and to add to our alarm, some travellers arriving by the diligence (we are still three leagues from a railway, while that miserable little place, La Rochette, being the chef-lieu, has a terminus) informed me that the darkness only existed in Semur and the neighbourhood, and that within a distance of three miles the sun was shining. The sun was shining! was it possible? it seemed so long since we had seen the sunshine; but this made our calamity more mysterious and more terrible. The people began to gather into little knots in the streets to ta1k of the strange thing that was happening. In the course of the day M. Barbou<pb n="51 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>came to ask whether I did not think it would be well to appease the popular feeling by conceding what they wished to the Sisters of the hospital. I would not hear of it. 'Shall we own that we are in the wrong? I do not think we are in the wrong,' I said, and I would not yield. 'Do you think the good Sisters have it in their power to darken the sky with their incantations ?'  M. l'Adjoint shook his head.  He went away with a troubled countenance; but then he was not like myself, a man of natural firmness. All the efforts that were employed to influence him were also employed with me; but to yield to the women was not in my thoughts.</p>

<p>We are now approaching, however, the first important incident in this narrative. The darkness increased as the afternoon came on; and it became a kind of thick twilight, no lighter than many a night. It was between five and six o'clock, just the time when our streets are the most crowded, when, sitting at my window, from which I
<pb n="52 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

kept a watch upon the Grande Rue, not knowing what might happen--I saw that  some fresh incident had taken place. Very dimly through the darkness I perceived a crowd, which increased every moment, in front of the Cathedral. After watching it for a few minutes, I got my hat and went out. The people whom I saw--so many that they covered the whole middle of the Place, reaching almost to the pavement on the other side--had their heads all turned towards the Cathedral.  'What are you gazing at, my friend?' I said to one by whom I stood. He looked up at me with a face which looked ghastly in the gloom. 'Look, M. le Maire!' he said; 'cannot you see it on the great door?'</p>

<p>'I see nothing,' said I; but as I uttered these words I did indeed see something which was very startling. Looking towards the great door of the Cathedral, as they all were doing, it suddenly seemed to me that I saw an illuminated placard attached to it headed with the word 'Sommation' in
<pb n="53 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

gigantic letters. 'Tiens!' I cried; but when I looked again there was nothing. What is this? it is some witchcraft!' I said, in spite of myself. 'Do you see anything, Jean Pierre?'</p>

<p>'M. le Maire,' he said, 'one moment one sees something--the next, one sees nothing. Look! it comes again.' I have always considered myself a man of courage, but when I saw this extraordinary appearance the panic which had seized upon me the former night returned, though in another form. Fly I could not, but I will not deny that my knees smote together. I stood for some minutes without being able to articulate a word--which, indeed, seemed the case with most of those before me.  Never have I seen a more quiet crowd.  They were all gazing, as if it was life or death that was set before them--while I, too, gazed with a shiver going over me.  It was as I have seen an illumination of lamps in a stormy night; one moment the whole seems black as the wind sweeps over
<pb n="54 A BELEAGUERED CITY. "/>

it, the next it springs into life again; and thus you go on, by turns losing and discovering the device formed by the lights.  Thus from moment to moment there appeared before us, in letters that seemed to blaze and flicker, something that looked like a great official placard. 'Sommation!'--this was how it was headed. I read a few words at a time, as it came and went; and who can describe the chill that ran through my veins as I made it out?  It was a summons to the people of Semur by name--myself at the head as Maire (and I heard afterwards that every man who saw it saw his own name, though the whole facade of the Cathedral would not have held a full list of all the people of Semur)--to yield their places, which they had not filled aright, to those who knew the meaning of life, being dead. NOUS AUTRES MORTS--these were the words which blazed out oftenest of all, so that every one saw them. And 'Go!' this terrible placard said-'Go! leave this place to us who
<pb n="55 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

know the true signification of life.' These words I remember, but not the rest; and even at this moment it struck me that there was no explanation, nothing but this vraie signification de la vie. I felt like one in a dream: the light coming and going before me; one word, then another, appearing--sometimes a phrase like that I have quoted, blazing out, then dropping into darkness.  For the moment I was struck dumb; but then it came back to my mind that I had an example to give, and that for me, eminently a man of my century, to yield credence to a miracle was something not to be thought of. Also I knew the necessity of doing something to break the impression of awe and terror on the mind of the people. 'This is a trick,' I cried loudly, that all might hear. 'Let some one go and fetch M. de Clairon from the Muse*e. He will tell us how it has been done.' This, boldly uttered, broke the spell. A number of pale faces gathered round me. 'Here is M. le Maire--he will clear it up,' they cried, making
<pb n="56 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

room for me that I might approach nearer.'M. le Maire is a man of courage--he has judgment. Listen to M. le Maire.' It was a relief to everybody that I had spoken.  And soon I found myself by the side of M. le Cure*, who was standing among the rest, saying nothing, and with the air of one as much bewildered as any of us. He gave me one quick look from under his eyebrows to see who it was that approached him, as was his way, and made room for me, but said nothing. I was in too much emotion myself to keep silence--indeed, I was in that condition of wonder, alarm, and nervous excitement, that I had to speak or die; and there seemed an escape from something too terrible for flesh and blood to contemplate in the idea that there was trickery here. 'M. le Cure*,' I said, 'this is a strange ornament that you have placed on the front of your church. You are standing here to enjoy the effect. Now that you have seen how successful it has been, will not you tell me in confidence how it is done?'
</p><pb n="57 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>I am conscious that there was a sneer in my voice, but I was too much excited to think of politeness. He gave me another of his rapid, keen looks.</p>

<p>'M. le Maire,' he said, 'you are injurious to a man who is as little fond of tricks as yourself.'</p>

<p>His tone, his glance, gave me a certain sense of shame, but I could not stop myself. 'One knows,' I said, 'that there are many things which an ecclesiastic may do without harm, which are not permitted to an ordinary layman--one who is an honest man, and no more.'</p>

<p>M. le Cure* made no reply. He gave me another of his quick glances, with an impatient turn of his head. Why should I have suspected him? for no harm was known of him. He was the Cure*, that was all; and perhaps we men of the world have our prejudices too. Afterwards, however, as we waited for M. de Clairon--for the crisis was too exciting for personal resentment--M. le Cure* himself let drop some-
<pb n="58 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>
 
thing which made it apparent that it was the ladies of the hospital upon whom his suspicions fell. 'It is never well to offend women, M. le Maire,' he said. 'Women do not discriminate the lawful from the unlawful: so long as they produce an effect, it does not matter to them.' This gave me a strange impression, for it seemed to me that M. le Cure* was abandoning his own side. However, all other sentiments were, as may be imagined, but as shadows compared with the overwhelming power that held all our eyes and our thoughts to the wonder before us. Every moment seemed an hour till M. de Clairon appeared.  He was pushed forward through the crowd as by magic, all making room for him; and many of us thought that when science thus came forward capable of finding out everything, the miracle would disappear. But instead of this it seemed to glow brighter than ever.  That great word 'Sommation' blazed out, so that we saw his figure waver against the light as if giving way before the flames that
<pb n="59 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

scorched him. He was so near that his outline was marked out dark against the glare they gave. It was as though his close approach rekindled every light.  Then, with a flicker and trembling, word by word and letter by letter went slowly out before our eyes.</p>

<p>M. de Clairon came down very pale, but with a sort of smile on his face. 'No, M. le Maire,' he said, 'I cannot see how it is done. It is clever. I will examine the door further, and try the panels. Yes, I have left some one to watch that nothing is touched in the meantime, with the permission of M. le Cure*--'</p>
<p>'You have my full permission,' M. le Cure* said; and M. de Clairon laughed, though he was still very pale. 'You saw my name there,' he said. 'I am amused--I who am not one of your worthy citizens, M. le Maire. What can Messieurs les Morts of Semur want with a poor man of science like me? But you shall have my report before the evening is out.'</p>
<pb n="60 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>
 
<p>With this I had to be content. The darkness which succeeded to that strange light seemed more terrible than ever. We all stumbled as we turned to go away, dazzled by it, and stricken dumb, though some kept saying that it was a trick, and some murmured exclamations with voices full of terror. The sound of the crowd breaking up was like a regiment marching --all the world had been there. I was thankful, however, that neither my mother nor my wife had seen anything; and thoughthey were anxious to know why I was so serious, I succeeded fortunately in keeping  the secret from them.</p><p>M. de Clairon did not appear till late, and then he confessed to me he could make nothing of it. 'If it is a trick (as of course it must be), it has been most cleverly done,' he said; and admitted that he was baffled altogether.  For my part, I was not surprised.  Had it been the Sisters of the hospital, as M. le Cure* thought, would they have let the opportunity pass of
<pb n="61 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

preaching a sermon to us, and recommending their doctrines? Not so; here there were no doctrines, nothing but that pregnant phrase, la vraie signification de la vie. This made a more deep impression upon me than anything else. The Holy Mother herself (whom I wish to speak of with profound respect), and the saints, and the forgiveness of sins, would have all been there had it been the Sisters, or even M. le Cure*.  This, though I had myself suggested an imposture, made it very unlikely to my quiet thoughts. But if not an imposture, what could it be supposed to be?

<p>CHAPTER III. EXPULSION OF THE INHABITANTS.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to give any detailed account of the state of the town during this evening. For myself I was utterly worn out, and went to rest as soon as M. de Clairon left me, having satisfied, as well as I could, the questions of the women. Even in the intensest excitement weary nature will claim her dues. I slept. I can even remember the grateful sense of being able to put all anxieties and perplexities aside for the moment, as I went to sleep. I felt the drowsiness gain upon me, and I was glad. To forget was of itself a happiness.</p>

<p>I woke up, however, intensely awake, and in perfect possession of all my faculties, while it was yet dark; and at once got up
<pb n="63 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

and began to dress. The moment of hesitation which generally follows waking--the little interval of thought in which one turns over perhaps that which is past, perhaps that which is to come--found no place within me. I got up without a moment's pause, like one who has been called to go on a journey; nor did it surprise me at all to see my wife moving about, taking a cloak from her wardrobe, and putting up linen in a bag. She was already fully dressed; but she asked no questions of me any more than I did of her. We were in haste, though we said nothing. When I had dressed, I looked round me to see if I had forgotten anything, as one does when one leaves a place. I saw my watch suspended to its usual hook, and my pocketbook, which I had taken from my pocket on the previous night. I took up also the light overcoat which I had worn when I made my rounds through the city on the first night of the darkness. 'Now,' I said, 'Agne*s, I am ready.' I did not speak to
<pb n="64 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

her of where we were going, nor she to me.  Little Jean and my mother met us at the door. Nor did she say anything, contrary to her custom; and the child was quite quiet. We went downstairs together without saying a word.  The servants, who were all astir, followed us. I cannot give any description of the feelings that were in my mind. I had not any feelings. I was only hurried out, hastened by something which I could not define--a sense that I must go; and perhaps I was too much astonished to do anything but yield. It seemed, however, to be no force or fear that was moving me, but a desire of my own; though I could not tell how it was, or why I should be so anxious to get away. All the servants, trooping after me, had the same look in their faces; they were anxious to be gone--it seemed their business to go--there was no question, no consultation.  And when we came out into the street, we encountered a stream of processions similar to our own. The children went quite
<pb n="65 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

steadily by the side of their parents. Little Jean, for example, on an ordinary occasion would have broken away--would have run to his comrades of the Bois-Sombre family, and they to him. But no; the little ones, like ourselves, walked along quite gravely.  They asked no questions, neither did we ask any questions of each other, as, 'Where are you going?' or, What is the meaning of a so early promenade?' Nothing of the kind:  my mother took my arm, and my wife, leading little Jean by the hand, came to the other side. The servants followed. The street was quite full of people; but there was no noise except the sound of their footsteps. All of us turned the same way--turned towards the gates--and though I was not conscious of any feeling except the wish to go on, there were one or two things which took a place in my memory.  The first was, that my wife suddenly turned round as we were coming out of the porte-coche*re, her face lighting up.  I need not say to any one who knows
<pb n="66 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

Madame Dupin de la Clairie*re, that she is a beautiful woman. Without any partiality on my part, it would be impossible for me to ignore this fact: for it is perfectly well known and acknowledged by all. She was pale this morning--a little paler than usual; and her blue eyes enlarged, with a serious look, which they always retain more or less.  But suddenly, as we went out of the door, her face lighted up, her eyes were suffused with tears--with light--how can I tell what it was?--they became like the eyes of angels.  A little cry came from her parted lips--she lingered a moment, stooping down as if talking to some one less tall than herself, then came after us, with that light still in her face. At the moment I was too much occupied to enquire what it was; but I noted it, even in the gravity of the occasion. The next thing I observed was M. le Cure*, who, as I have already indicated, is a man of great composure of manner and presence of mind, coming out of the door of the Presbytery. There was a strange look on
<pb n="67 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

his face of astonishment and reluctance.  He walked very slowly, not as we did, but with a visible desire to turn back, folding his arms across his breast, and holding himself as if against the wind, resisting some gale which blew behind him, and forced him on. We felt no gale; but there seemed to be a strange wind blowing along the side of the street on which M. le Cure*was. And there was an air of concealed surprise in his face--great astonishment, but a determination not to let any one see that he was astonished, or that the situation was strange to him. And I cannot tell how it was, but I, too, though preoccupied, was surprised to perceive that M. le Cure* was going with the rest of us, though I could not have told why.</p>

<p>Behind M. le Cure* there was another whom I remarked.  This was Jacques Richard, he of whom I have already spoken. He was like a figure I have seen somewhere in sculpture. No one was near him, nobody touching him, and yet it was
<pb n="68 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

only necessary to look at the man to perceive that he was being forced along against his will. Every limb was in resistance; his feet were planted widely yet firmly upon the pavement; one of his arms was stretched  out as if to lay hold on anything that should come within reach. M. le Cure* resisted passively; but Jacques resisted with passion, laying his back to the wind, and struggling not to be carried away. Notwithstanding his resistance, however, this rough figure was driven along slowly, struggling at every step. He did not make one movement that was not against his will, but still he was driven on. On our side of the street all went, like ourselves, calmly. My mother uttered now and then a low moan, but said nothing. She clung to my arm, and walked on, hurrying a little, sometimes going quicker than I intended to go. As for my wife, she accompanied us with her  light step, which scarcely seemed to touch the ground, little Jean pattering by her side. Our neighbours were all round us.
<pb n="69 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

We streamed down, as in a long procession, to the Porte St. Lambert. It was only when we got there that the strange character of the step we were all taking suddenly occurred to me. It was still a kind of grey twilight, not yet day. The bells of the Cathedral had begun to toll, which was very startling--not ringing in their cheerful way, but tolling as if for a funeral;and no other sound was audible but the noise of footsteps, like an army making a silent march into an enemy's country. We had reached the gate when a sudden wondering came over me. Why were we all going out of our houses in the wintry dusk to which our July days had turned?  I stopped, and turning round, was about to say something to the others, when I became suddenly aware that here I was not my own master. My tongue clave to the roof of my mouth; I could not say a word.  Then I myself was turned round, and softly, firmly, irresistibly pushed out of the gate.  My mother, who clung to me, added a
<pb n="70 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

little, no doubt, to the force against me, whatever it was, for she was frightened, and opposed herself to any endeavour on my part to regain freedom of movement; but all that her feeble force could do against mine must have been little. Several other men around me seemed to be moved as Iwas.  M. Barbou, for one, made a still more decided effort to turn back, for, being a bachelor, he had no one to restrain him.  Him I saw turned round as you would turn a roulette. He was thrown against my wife in his tempestuous course, and but that she was so light and elastic in her tread, gliding out straight and softly like one of the saints, I think he must have thrown her down. And at that moment, silent as we all were, his 'Pardon, Madame, mille pardons, Madame,' and his tone of horror at his own indiscretion, seemed to come to me like a voice out of another life.  Partially roused before by the sudden im- pulse of resistance I have described, I was yet more roused now.  I turned round,
<pb n="71 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

disengaging myself from my mother. 'Where are we going ? why are we thus cast forth ? My friends, help!' I cried.  I looked round upon the others, who, as I have said, had also awakened to a possibility of resistance. M. de Bois-Sombre, without a word, came and placed himself by my side; others started from the crowd. We turned to resist this mysterious impulse which had sent us forth. The crowd surged round us in the uncertain light.</p>

<p>Just then there was a dull soft sound, once, twice, thrice repeated. We rushed forward, but too late.  The gates were closed upon us.  The two folds of the great Porte St. Lambert, and the little postern for foot-passengers, all at once, not hurriedly, as from any fear of us, but slowly, softly, rolled on their hinges and shut--in our faces. I rushed forward with all my force and flung myself upon the gate. To what use? it was so closed as no mortal could open it. They told me after, for I was not aware at the moment, that I burst
<pb n="72 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

forth with cries and exclamations, bidding them 'Open, open in the name of God!' I was not aware of what I said, but it seemed to me that I heard a voice of which nobody said anything to me, so that it would seem to have been unheard by the others, saying with a faint sound as of a trumpet, 'Closed--in the name of God.' It might be only an echo, faintly brought back to me, of the words I had myself said.</p>

<p>There was another change, however, of which no one could have any doubt. When I turned round from these closed doors, though the moment before the darkness was such that we could not see the gates closing, I found the sun shining gloriously round us, and all my fellow-citizens turning with one impulse, with a sudden cry of joy, to hail the full day.</p>

<p>Le grand jour! Never in my life did I feel the full happiness of it, the full sense of the words before. The sun burst out into shining, the birds into singing. The sky stretched over us--deep and unfathom-
<pb n="73 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

able and blue,--the grass grew under our feet, a soft air of morning blew upon us, waving the curls of the children, the veils of the women, whose faces were lit up by the beautiful day. After three days of darkness what a resurrection! It seemed to make up to us for the misery of being thus expelled from our homes. It was early, and all the freshness of the morning was upon the road and the fields, where the sun had just dried the dew. The river ran softly, reflecting the blue sky. How black it had been, deep and dark as a stream of ink, when I had looked down upon it from the Mont St. Lambert! and now it ran as clear and free as the voice of a little child.  We all shared this moment of joy--for to us of the South the sunshine is as the breath of life, and to be deprived of it had been terrible. But when that first pleasure was over, the evidence of our strange position forced itself upon us with overpowering reality and force, made stronger by the very light. In the dimness it had not
<pb n="74 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

seemed so certain; now, gazing at each other in the clear light of the natural morning, we saw what had happened to us.  No more delusion was possible. We could not flatter ourselves now that it was a trick or a deception. M. de Clairon stood there like the rest of us, staring at the closed gates which science could not open. And there stood M. le Cure*, which was more remarkable still. The Church herself had not been able to do anything. We stood, a crowd of houseless exiles, looking at each other, our children clinging to us, our hearts failing us, expelled from our homes. As we looked in each other's faces we saw our own trouble. Many of the women sat down and wept; some upon the stones in the road, some on the grass. The children took fright from them, and began to cry too. What was to become of us? I looked round upon this crowd with despair in my heart. It was I to whom every one would look--for lodging, for direction--everything that human creatures want. It was
<pb n="75 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

my business to forget myself, though I also had been driven from my home and my city. Happily there was one thing I had left. In the pocket of my overcoat was my scarf of office. I stepped aside behind a tree, and took it out, and tied it upon me. That was something. There was thus a representative of order and law in the midst of the exiles, whatever might happen.  This action, which a great number of the crowd saw, restored confidence. Many of the poor people gathered round me, and placed themselves near me, especially those women who had no natural support. When M. le Cure* saw this, it seemed to make a great impression upon him. He changed colour, he who was usually so calm. Hitherto he had appeared bewildered, amazed to find himself as others. This, I must add, though you may perhaps think it superstitious, surprised me very much too. But now he regained his self-possession. He stepped upon a piece of wood that lay in front of the gate. 'My child-
<pb n="76 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

ren'--he said. But just then the Cathedral bells, which had gone on tolling, suddenly burst into a wild peal. I do not know what it sounded like. It was a clamour of notes all run together, tone upon tone, without time or measure, as though a multitude had seized upon the bells and pulled all the ropes at once. If it was joy, what strange and terrible joy! It froze the very blood in our veins. M. le Cure* became quite pale.  He stepped down hurriedly from the piece of wood. We all made a hurried movement farther off from the gate.</p>

<p>It was now that I perceived the necessity of doing something, of getting this crowd disposed of, especially the women and the children. I am not ashamed to own that I trembled like the others; and nothing less than the consciousness that all eyes were upon me, and that my scarf of office marked me out among all who stood around, could have kept me from moving with precipitation as they did.  I was enabled,
<pb n="77 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

however, to retire at a deliberate pace, and being thus slightly detached from the crowd, I took advantage of the opportunity to address them. Above all things, it was my duty to prevent a tumult in these unprecedented circumstances. ' My friends,' I said, 'the event which has occurred is beyond explanation for the moment. The very nature of it is mysterious; the circumstances are such as require the closest investigation. But take courage. I pledge myself not to leave this place till the gates are open, and you can return to your homes; in the meantime, however, the women and the children cannot remain here. Let those who have friends in the villages near, go and ask for shelter; and let all who will, go to my house of La Clairie*re. My mother, my wife! recall to yourselves the position you occupy, and show an example. Lead our neighbours, I entreat you, to La Clairie*re.'</p>

<p>My mother is advanced in years and no longer strong, but she has a great heart.
<pb n="78 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

"I will go,' she said. ' God bless thee, my son! There will no harm happen; for if this be true which we are told, thy father is in Semur.'</p>

<p>There then occurred one of those incidents for which calculation never will prepare us. My mother's words seemed, as it were to open the flood-gates; my wife came up to me with the light in her face which I had seen when we left our own door. 'It was our little Marie--our angel,' she said. And then there arose a great cry and clamour of others, both men and women pressing round.  'I saw my mother,' said one, 'who is dead twenty years come the St. Jean.' 'And I my little Rene*,' said another.  'And I my Camille, who was killed in Africa.' Andlo, what did they do, but rush towards the gate in a crowd--that gate from which they had but this moment fled in terror--beating upon it, and crying out, 'Open to us, open to us, our most dear! Do you think we have forgotten you? We have
<pb n="79 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

never forgotten you!' What could we do with them, weeping thus, smiling, holding out their arms to--we knew not what? Even my Agne*s was beyond my reach. Marie was our little girl who was dead. Those who were thus transported by a knowledge beyond ours were the weakest among us; most of them were women, the men old or feeble, and some children. I can recollect that I looked for Paul Lecamus among them, with wonder not to see him there. But though they were weak, they were beyond our strength to guide. What could we do with them? How could we force them away while they held to the fancy that those they loved were there? As it happens in times of emotion, it was those who were most impassioned who took the first place. We were at our wits' end.</p>

<p>But while we stood waiting, not knowing what to do, another sound suddenly came from the walls, which made them all silent in a moment. The most of us ran to this point and that (some taking flight alto-
<pb n="80 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

gether; but with the greater part anxious curiosity and anxiety had for the moment extinguished fear), in a wild eagerness to see who or what it was. But there was nothing to be seen, though the sound came from the wall close to the Mont St. Lambert, which have already described. It was to me like the sound of a trumpet, and so I heard others say; and along with the trumpet were sounds as of words, though I could not make them out. But those others seemed to understand--they grew calmer--they ceased to weep. They raised their faces, all with that light upon them--that light I had seen in my Agne*s. Some of them fell upon their knees. Imagine to yourself what a sight it was, all of us standing round, pale, stupefied, without a word to say! Then the women suddenly burst forth into replies--'Oui, ma che*rie!  Oui, mon ange!' they cried. And while we looked they rose up; they came back, calling the children around them. My Agne*s took that place which I had bidden
<pb n="81 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

her take. She had not hearkened to me, to leave me--but she hearkened now; and though I had bidden her to do this, yet to see her do it bewildered me, made my heart stand still. ' Mon ami,' she said, 'I must leave thee; it is commanded: they will not have the children suffer.' What could we do? We stood pale and looked on, while all the little ones, all the feeble, were gathered in a little army.  My mother stood like me--to her nothing had been revealed. She was very pale, and there was a quiver of pain in her lips. She was the one who had been ready to do my bidding: but there was a rebellion in her heart now. When the procession was formed (for it was my care to see that everything was done in order), she followed, but among the last. Thus they went away, many of them weeping, looking back, waving their hands to us. My Agne*s covered her face, she could not look at me; but she obeyed. They went some to this side, some to that, leaving us gazing. For a
<pb n="82 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

long time we did nothing but watch them, going along the roads. What had their angels said to them. Nay, but God knows. I heard the sound; it was like the sound of the silver trumpets that travellers talk of; it was like music from heaven. I turned to M. le Cure*, who was standing by.  'What is it?' I cried, 'you are their director--you are an ecclesiastic--you  know what belongs to the unseen. What is this that has been said to them?'  I have always thought well of M. le Cure*.  There were tears running down his cheeks. 'I know not,' he said. 'I am a miserable like the rest. What they know is between God and them. Me! I have been of the world, like the rest.'</p>

<p>This is how we were left alone--the men of the city--to take what means were best to get back to our homes. There were several left among us who had shared the enlightenment of the women, but these were not persons of importance who could put themselves at the head of affairs. And
<pb n="83 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

there were women who remained with us, but these not of the best.  To see our wives go was very strange to us; it was the thing we wished most to see, the women and children in safety; yet it was a strange sensation to see them go. For me, who had the charge of all on my hands, the relief was beyond description--yet was it strange; I cannot describe it. Then I called upon M. Barbou, who was trembling like a leaf, and gathered the chief of the citizens about me, including M. le Cure*, that we should consult together what we should do.</p>

<p>I know no words that can describe our state in the strange circumstances we were now placed in.  The women and the children were safe: that was much. But we--we were like an army suddenly formed, but without arms, without any knowledge of how to fight, without being able to see our enemy. We Frenchmen have not been without knowledge of such perils. We have seen the invader enter our doors; we
<pb n="84 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

have been obliged to spread our table for him, and give him of our best. But to be put forth by forces no man could resist--to be left outside, with the doors of our own houses closed upon us--to be confronted by nothing--by a mist, a silence, a darkness,--this was enough to paralyse the heart of any man. And it did so, more or less, according to the nature of those who were exposed to the trial. Some altogether failed us, and fled, carrying the news into the country, where most people laughed at them, as we understood afterwards. Some could do nothing but sit and gaze, huddled together in crowds, at the cloud over Semur, from which they expected to see fire burst and consume the city altogether. And a few, I grieve to say, took possession of the little cabaret, which stands at about half a kilometre from the St. Lambert gate, and established themselves there, in hideous riot, which was the worst thing of all for serious men to behold. Those upon whom I could rely I formed into patrols to go
<pb n="85 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

round the city, that no opening of a gate, or movement of those who were within, should take place without our knowledge.  Such an emergency shows what men are.  M. Barbou, though in ordinary times hedischarges his duties as adjoint satisfactorily enough (though, it need not be added, a good Maire who is acquainted with his duties, makes the office of adjoint of but little importance), was now found entirely useless. He could not forget how he had been spun round and tossed forth from the city gates. When I proposed to put him at the head of a patrol, he had an attack of the nerves. Before nightfall he deserted me altogether, going off to his country-house, and taking a number of his neighbours with him. 'How can we tell when we may be permitted to return to the town?' he said, with his teeth chattering. 'M. le Maire, I adjure you to put yourself in a place of safety.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' I said to him, sternly, 'for one who deserts his post there is no place of safety.'</p>
<pb n="86 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>But I do not think he was capable of understanding me. Fortunately, I found in M. le Cure* a much more trustworthy coadjutor. He was indefatigable; he had the habit of sitting up to all hours, of beingcalled at all hours, in which our bourgeoisie, I cannot but acknowledge, is wanting.  The expression I have before described of astonishment--but of astonishment which he wished to conceal never left his face.  He did not understand how such a thing could have been permitted to happen while he had no share in it; and, indeed, I will not deny that this was a matter of great wonder to myself too.</p>

<p>The arrangements I have described gave us occupation; and this had a happy effect upon us in distracting our minds from what had happened; for I think that if we had sat still and gazed at the dark city we should soon have gone mad, as some did. In our ceaseless patrols and attempts to find a way of entrance, we distracted ourselves from the enquiry, Who would dare to go in
<pb n="87 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

if the entrance were found? In the meantime not a gate was opened, not a figure was visible. We saw nothing, no more than if Semur had been a picture painted upon a canvas. Strange sights indeed met our eyes--sights which made even the bravest quail. The strangest of them was the boats that would go down and up the river, shooting forth from under the fortified bridge, which is one of the chief features of our town, sometimes with sails perfectly well managed, sometimes impelled by oars, but with no one visible in them--no one conducting them. To see one of these boats impelled up the stream, with no rower visible, was a wonderful sight.  M. de Clairon, who was by my side, murmured something about a magnetic current; but when I asked him sternly by what set in motion, his voice died away in his moustache. M. le Cure* said very little: one saw lipps move as he watched with us the passage of those boats. He smiled when it was proposed by some one to fire upon them.
<pb n="88 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

He read his Hours as he went round at the head of his patrol. My fellow townsmen and I conceived a great respect for him; and he inspired pity in me also. He had been the teacher of the Unseen among us, till the moment when the Unseen was thus, as it were, brought within our reach; but with the revelation he had nothing to do; and it filled him with pain and wonder. It made him silent; he said little about his religion, but signed himself, and his lips moved. He thought (I imagine) that he had displeased Those who are over all.</p>

<p>When night came the bravest of us were afraid. I speak for myself. It was bright moonlight where we were, and Semur lay like a blot between the earth and the sky, all dark: even the Cathedral towers were lost in it; nothing visible but the line of the ramparts, whitened outside by the moon. One knows what black and strange shadows are cast by the moonlight; and it seemed to all of us that we did not know what might be lurking behind every tree. The
<pb n="89 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

shadows of the branches looked like terrible faces. I sent all my people out on the patrols, though they were dropping with fatigue. Rather that than to be mad with terror. For myself, I took up my post as near the bank of the river as we could approach; for there was a limit beyond which we might not pass. I made the experiment often; and it seemed to me, and to all that attempted it, that we did reach the very edge of the stream; but the next moment perceived that we were at a certain distance, say twenty metres or thereabout. I placed myself there very often, wrapping a cloak about me to preserve me from the dew. (I may say that food had been sent us, and wine from La Clairie*re and many other houses in the neighbourhood, where the women had gone for this among other reasons, that we might be nourished by them.) And I must here relate a personalcident, though I have endeavoured not to egotistical. While I sat watching, I distinctly saw a boat, a boat which belonged
<pb n="90 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

to myself, lying on the very edge of the shadow. The prow, indeed, touched the moonlight where it was cut clean across by the darkness; and this was how I discovered that it was the Marie, a pretty pleasure-boat which had been made for my wife. The sight of it made my heart beat; for what could it mean but that some one who was dear to me, some one in whom I took an interest, was there? I sprang up from where I sat to make another effort to get nearer; but my feet were as lead, and would not move; and there came a singing in my ears, and my blood coursed through my veins as in a fever. Ah! was it possible? I, who am a man, who have resolution, who have courage, who can lead the people, I was afraid! I sat down again and wept like a child. Perhaps it was my little Marie that was in the boat. God, He knows if I loved thee, my little angel! but I was afraid. O how mean is man! though we are so proud. They came near to me who were my own, and it was borne in upon my 
<pb n="91 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

spirit that my good father was with the child; but because they had died I was afraid. I covered my face with my hands. Then it seemed to me that I heard a long quiver of a sigh; a long, long breath, such as sometimes relieves a sorrow that is beyond words. Trembling, I uncovered my eyes. There was nothing on the edge of the moonlight; all was dark, and all was still, the white radiance making a clear line across the river, but nothing more.</p>

<p>If my Agnes had been with me she would have seen our child, she would have heard that voice! The great cold drops of moisture were on my forehead. My limbs trembled, my heart fluttered in my bosom. I could neither listen nor yet speak. And those who would have spoken to me, those who loved me, sighing, went away. It is not possible that such wretchedness should be credible to noble minds; and if it had not been for pride and for shame, I should have fled away straight to La Clairie*re, to put myself under shelter, to have some one
<pb n="92 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

near me who was less a coward than I. I, upon whom all the others relied, the Maire of the Commune! I make my confession. I was of no more force than this.</p>

<p>A voice behind me made me spring to my feet--the leap of a mouse would have driven me wild. I was altogether demoralised. 'Monsieur le Maire, it is but I,' said some one quite humble and frightened. 'Tiens!--it is thou, Jacques!' I said. I could have embraced him, though it is well known how little I approve of him. But he was living, he was a man like myself. I put out my hand, and felt him warm and breathing, and I shall never forget the ease that came to my heart. Its beating calmed. I was restored to myself.</p>

<p>'M. le Maire,' he said, 'I wish to ask you something. Is it true all that is said about these people, I would say, these Messieurs? I do not wish to speak with disrespect, M. le Maire.'</p>

<p>'What is it, Jacques, that is said?'  I had called him 'thou' not out of contempt,
<pb n="93 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

but because, for the moment, he seemed to me as a brother, as one of my friends.</p>

<p>'M. le Maire, is it indeed les morts that are in Semur?'</p>

<p>He trembled, and so did I. 'Jacques,' I said, 'you know all that I know.'</p>

<p>'Yes, M. le Maire, it is so, sure enough. I do not doubt it. If it were the Prussians, a man could  fight. But ces Messieurs la*! What I want to know is: is it because of what you did to those little Sisters, those good little ladies of St. Jean?'</p>

<p>'What I did? You were yourself one of the complainants. You were of those who said, when a man is ill, when he is suffering, they torment him with their mass; it is quiet he wants, not their mass. These were thy words, vaurien. And now you say it was I!'</p>

<p>'True, M. le Maire,' said Jacques; 'but look you, when a man is better, when he has just got well, when he feels he is safe, then you should not take what he says for gospel. It would be strange if one had a
<pb n="94 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

new illness just when one is getting well of the old; and one feels now is the time to enjoy one's self, to kick up one's heels a little, while at least there is not likely to be much of a watch kept up there--the saints forgive me,' cried Jacques, trembling and crossing himself, 'if I speak with levity at such a moment! And the little ladies were very kind. It was wrong to close their chapel, M. le Maire.  From  that comes all our trouble.'</p>

<p>'You good-for-nothing!' I cried, 'it is you and such as you that are the beginning of our trouble. You thought there was no watch kept up there; you thought God would not take the trouble to punish you; you went about the streets of Semur tossing a grosse pie*ce of a hundred sous, and calling out, "There is no God--this is my god; l'argent, c'est le bon Dieu."'</p>

<p>'M. le Maire, M. le Maire, be silent, I implore you! It is enough to bring down a judgment upon us.'</p>

<p>'It has brought down a judgment upon
<pb n="95 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

us. Go thou and try what thy grosse pie*ce will do for thee now--worship thy god. Go, I tell you, and get help from your money.'</p>

<p>'I have no money, M. le Maire, and what could money do here? We would do much better to promise a large candle for the next festival, and that the ladies of St. Jean--'</p>

<p>'Get away with thee to the end of the world, thou and thy ladies of St. Jean!' I cried; which was wrong, I do not deny it, for they are good women, not like this good-for-nothing fellow. And to think that this man, whom I despise, was more pleasant to me than the dear souls who loved me! Shame came upon me at the thought. I too, then, was like the others, fearing the Unseen--capable of understanding only that which was palpable. When Jacques slunk away, which he did for a few steps, not losing sight of me, I turned my face towards the river and the town. The moonlight fell upon the water, white
<pb n="96 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

as silver where that line of darkness lay, shining, as if it tried, and tried in vain, to penetrate Semur; and between that and the blue sky overhead lay the city out of which we had been driven forth--the city of the dead. 'O God,' I cried, 'whom I know not, am not I to Thee as my little Jean is to me, a child and less than a child? Do not abandon me in this darkness. Would I abandon him were he ever so disobedient? And God, if thou art God, Thou art a better father than I.' When I had said this, my heart was a little relieved. It seemed to me that I had spoken to some one who knew all of us, whether we were dead or whether we were living. That is a wonderful thing to think of, when it appears to one not as a thing to believe, but as something that is real. It gave me courage. I got up and went to meet the patrol which was coming in, and found that great good-for-nothing Jacques running close after me, holding my cloak. 'Do not send me away, M. le Maire,' he said,' I

dare not stay by myself with them so near.' Instead of his money, in which he had trusted, it was I who had become his god now.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.OUTSIDE THE WALLS.</p>

<p>THERE are few who have not heard something of the sufferings of a siege. Whether within or without, it is the most terrible of all the experiences of war.  I am old enough to recollect the trenches before Sebastopol, and all that my countrymen and the English endured there.  Sometimes I endeavoured to think of this to distract me from what we ourselves endured. But how different was it! We had neither shelter nor support. We had no weapons, nor any against whom to wield them. We were cast out of our homes in the midst of our lives, in the midst of our occupations, and left there helpless, to gaze at each other, to blind our eyes trying to penetrate
<pb n="99 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the darkness before us. Could we have done anything, the oppression might have been less terrible--but what was  there that we could do? Fortunately (though I do not deny that I felt each desertion) our band grew less and less every day. Hour by hour some one stole away--first one, then another, dispersing themselves among the villages near, in which many had friends. The accounts which these men gave were, I afterwards learnt, of the most vague description. Some talked of wonders they had seen, and were laughed at--and some spread reports of internal division among us. Not till long after did I know all the reports that went abroad. It was said that there had been fighting in Semur, and that we were divided into two factions, one of which had gained the mastery, and driven the other out. This was the story current in La Rochette, where they are always glad to hear anything to the discredit of the people of Semur; but no credence could have been given to it by
<pb n="100 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

those in authority, otherwise M. le Pre*fet, however indifferent to our interests, must necessarily have taken some steps for our relief.  Our entire separation from the world was indeed one of the strangest details of this terrible period. Generally the diligence, though conveying on the whole few passengers, returned with two or three, at least, visitors or commercial persons, daily--and the latter class frequently arrived in carriages of their own; but during this period no stranger came to see our miserable plight. We made shelter for ourselves under the branches of the few trees that grew in the uncultivated ground on either side of the road--and a hasty erection, half tent half shed, was put up for a place to assemble in, or for those who were unable to bear the heat of the day or the occasional chills of the night.  But the most of us were too restless to seek repose, and could not bear to be out of sight of the city. At any moment it seemed to us the gates might open, or some loophole be
<pb n="101 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

visible by which we might throw ourselves upon the darkness and vanquish it. This was what we said to ourselves, forgetting how we shook and trembled whenever any contact had been possible with those who were within. But one thing was certain, that though we feared, we could not turn our eyes from the place. We slept leaning against a tree, or with our heads on our hands, and our faces toward Semur. We took no count of day or night, but ate the morsel the women brought to us, and slept thus, not sleeping, when want or weariness overwhelmed us. There was scarcely an hour in the day that some of the women did not come to ask what news. They crept along the roads in twos and threes, and lingered for hours sitting by the way weeping, starting at every breath of wind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all was not silent within Semur. The Cathedral bells rang often, at first filling us with hope, for how familiar was that sound! The first time, we all
<pb n="102 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

gathered together and listened, and many wept. It was as if we heard our mother's voice. M. de Bois-Sombre burst into tears. I have never seen him within the doors of the Cathedral since his marriage; but he burst into tears. 'Mon Dieu! if I were but there!' he said. We stood and listened, our hearts melting, some falling on their knees. M. le Cure* stood up in the midst of us and began to intone the psalm: [He has a beautiful voice. It is sympathetic, it goes to the heart.] 'I was glad when they said to me, Let us go up--' And though there were few of us who could have supposed themselves capable of listening to that sentiment a little while before with any sympathy, yet a vague hope rose up within us while we heard him, while we listened to the bells. What man is there to whom the bells of his village, the carillon of his city, is not most dear?  It rings for him through all his life; it is the first sound of home in the distance when he comes back--the last that
<pb n="103 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

follows him like a long farewell when he goes away. While we listened, we forgot our fears. They were as we were, they were also our brethren, who rang those bells. We seemed to see them trooping into our beautiful Cathedral. Ah! only to see it again, to be within its shelter, cool and calm as in our mother's arms! It seemed to us that we should wish for nothing more.</p>

<p>When the sound ceased we looked into each other's faces, and each man saw that his neighbour was pale.  Hope died in us when the sound died away, vibrating sadly through the air. Some men threw themselves on the ground in their despair.</p>

<p>And from this time forward many voices were heard, calls and shouts within the walls, and sometimes a sound like a trumpet, and other instruments of music. We thought, indeed, that noises as of bands patrolling along the ramparts were audible as our patrols worked their way round and round.  This was a duty which I never allowed to be neglected, not because I put
<pb n="104 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

very much faith in it, but because it gave us a sort of employment. There is a story somewhere which I recollect dimly of an ancient city which its assailants did not touch, but only marched round and round till the walls fell, and they could enter. Whether this was a story of classic times or out of our own remote history, I could not recollect. But I thought of it many times while we made our way like a procession of ghosts, round and round, straining our ears to hear what those voices were which sounded above us, in tones that were familiar, yet so strange. This story got so much into my head (and after a time all our heads seemed to get confused and full of wild and bewildering expedients) that I found myself suggesting--I, a man known for sense and reason--that we should blow trumpets at some time to be fixed, which was a thing the ancients had done in the strange tale which had taken possession of me. M. le Cure* looked at me with disapproval. He said, ' I did not expect
<pb n="105 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

from M. le Maire anything that was disrespectful to religion.' Heaven forbid that I should be disrespectful to religion at any time of life, but then it was impossible to me. I remembered after that the tale of which I speak, which had so seized upon me, was in the sacred writings; but those who know me will understand that no sneer at these writings or intention of wounding the feelings of M. le Cure* was in my mind.</p><p>I was seated one day upon a little inequality of the ground, leaning my back against a half-withered hawthorn, and dozing with my head in my hands, when a soothing, which always diffuses itself from her presence, shed itself over me, and opening my eyes, I saw my Agne*s sitting by me. She had come with some food and a little linen, fresh and soft like her own touch. My wife was not gaunt and worn like me, but she was pale and as thin as a shadow. I woke with a start, and seeing her there, there suddenly came a
<pb n="106 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

dread over me that she would pass away before my eyes, and go over to Those who were within Semur. I cried 'Non, mon Agne*s; non, mon Agne*s: before you ask,No!' seizing her and holding her fast in this dream, which was not altogether a dream. She looked at me with a smile, that smile that has always been to me as the rising of the sun over the earth.</p>

<p>'Mon ami,' she said surprised, 'I ask nothing, except that you should take a little rest and spare thyself.' Then she added, with haste, what I knew she would say, 'Unless it were this, mon ami. If I were permitted, I would go into the city--I would ask those who are there what is their meaning: and if no way can be found--no act of penitence.--Oh! do not answer in haste! I have no fear; and it would be to save thee.'</p>

<p>A strong throb of anger came into my throat. Figure to yourself that I looked at my wife with anger, with the same feeling which had moved me when the deserters
<pb n="107 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

left us; but far more hot and sharp. I seized her soft hands and crushed them in mine. 'You would leave me!' I said. 'You would desert your husband.  You would go over to our enemies!'</p>

<p>'O Martin, say not so,' she cried, with tears. 'Not enemies. There is our little Marie, and my mother, who died when I was born.'</p><p>'You love these dead tyrants. Yes,' I said, 'you love them best. You will go to--the majority, to the strongest. Do not speak to me! Because your God is on their side, you will forsake us too.'</p><p>Then she threw herself upon me and encircled me with her arms. The touch of them stilled my passion; but yet I held her, clutching her gown, so terrible a fear came over me that she would go and come back no more.</p>

<p>'Forsake thee!' she breathed out over me with a moan. Then, putting her cool cheek to mine, which burned, ' But I would die for thee, Martin.'</p>
<pb n="108 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>'Silence, my wife: that is what you shall not do,' I cried, beside myself. I rose up; I put her away from me. That is, I know it, what has been done. Their God does this, they do not hesitate to say--takes from you what you love best, to make you better--you ! and they ask you to love Him when He has thus despoiled you! 'Go home, Agne*s,' I said, hoarse with terror. 'Let us face them as we may; you shall not go among them, or put thyself in peril. Die for me! Mon Dieu!  and what then, what should I do then ? Turn your face from them; turn from them; go! go! and let me not see thee here again.'</p>

<p>My wife did not understand the terror that seized me. She obeyed me, as she always does, but, with the tears falling from her white cheeks, fixed upon me the most piteous look. 'Mon ami,' she said, 'you are disturbed, you are not in possession of yourself; this cannot be what you mean.'</p>

<p>'Let me not see thee here again!' I
<pb n="109 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

cried. 'Would you make me mad in the midst of my trouble? No! I will not have you look that way. Go home! go home!' Then I took her into my arms and wept, though I am not a man given to tears. 'Oh! my Agne*s,' I said, 'give me thy counsel. What you tell me I will do; but rather than risk thee, I would live thus for ever, and defy them.'</p>

<p>She put her hand upon my lips. ' I will not ask this again,' she said, bowing her head; 'but defy them--why should you defy them? Have they come for nothing? Was Semur a city of the saints? They have come to convert our people, Martin--thee too, and the rest. If you will submit your hearts, they will open the gates, they will go back to their sacred homes: and we to ours. This has been borne in upon me sleeping and waking; and it seemed to me that if I could but go, and say, "Oh! my fathers, oh! my brothers, they submit," all would be well. For I do not fear them, Martin. Would they harm
<pb n="110 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

me that love us ? I would but give our Marie one kiss--'</p>

<p>'You are a traitor!' I said. 'You would steal yourself from me, and do me the worst wrong of all--'</p>

<p>But I recovered my calm. What she said reached my understanding at last. 'Submit!' I said, 'but to what? To come and turn us from our homes, to wrap our town in darkness, to banish our wives and our children, to leave us here to be scorched by the sun and drenched by the rain,--this is not to convince us, my Agne*s. And to what then do you bid us submit--?'</p>

<p>'It is to convince you, mon ami, of the, love of God, who has permitted this great tribulation to be, that we might be saved,' said Agne*s. Her face was sublime with faith. It is possible to these dear women; but for me the words she spoke were but words without meaning. I shook my head. Now that my horror and alarm were passed, I could well remember often to have heard words like these before.</p>
<pb n="111 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>'My angel!' I said, 'all this I admire, I adore in thee; but how is it the love of God?--and how shall we be saved by it? Submit! I will do anything that is reasonable; but of what truth have we here the proof--?'</p>

<p>Some one had come up behind as we were talking. When I heard his voice I smiled, notwithstanding my despair. It was natural that the Church should come to the woman's aid. But I would not refuse to give ear to M. le Cure*, who had proved himself a man, had he been ten times a priest.</p>

<p>'I have not heard what Madame has been saying, M. le Maire, neither would I interpose but for your question. You ask of what truth have we the proof here? It is the Unseen that has revealed itself. Do we see anything, you and I? Nothing, nothing, but a cloud. But that which we cannot see, that which we know not, that which we dread--look! it is there.'</p>

<p>I turned unconsciously as he pointed
<pb n="112 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

with his hand. Oh, heaven, what did I see! Above the cloud that wrapped Semur there was a separation, a rent in the darkness, and in mid heaven the Cathedral towers, pointing to the sky. I paid no more attention to M. le Cure*. I sent forth a shout that roused all, even the weary line of the patrol that was marching slowly with bowed heads round the walls; and there went up such a cry of joy as shook the earth.  'The towers, the towers!' I cried. These were the towers that could be seen leagues off, the first sign of Semur; our towers, which we had been born to love like our father's name. I have had joys in my life, deep and great. I have loved, I have won honours, I have conquered difficulty; but never had I felt as now. It was as if one had been born again.</p>

<p>When we had gazed upon them, blessing them and thanking God, I gave orders that all our company should be called to the tent, that we might consider whether any new step could now be taken: Agne*s with
<pb n="113 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the other women sitting apart on one side and waiting. I recognised even in the excitement of such a time that theirs was no easy part. To sit there silent, to wait till we had spoken, to be bound by what we decided, and to have no voice-yes, that was hard. They thought they knew better than we did: but they were silent, devouring us with their eager eyes. I love one woman more than all the world; I count her the best thing that God has made; yet would I not be as Agne*s for all that life could give me. It was her part to be silent, and she was so, like the angel she is, while even Jacques Richard had the right to speak. Mon Dieu! but it is hard, I allow it; they have need to be angels. This thought passed through my mind even at the crisis which had now arrived. For at such moments one sees everything, one thinks of everything, though it is only after that one remembers what one has seen and thought. When my fellow-citizens gathered together (we were now less
<pb n="114 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

than a hundred in number, so many had gone from us), I took it upon myself to speak. We were a haggard, worn-eyed company, having had neither shelter nor sleep nor even food, save in hasty snatches. I stood at the door of the tent and they below, for the ground sloped a little. Beside me were M. le Cure*, M. de Bois-Sombre, and one or two others of the chief citizens. 'My friends,' I said, 'you have seen that a new circumstance has occurred. It is not within our power to tell what its meaning is, yet it must be a symptom of good. For my own part, to see these towers makes the air lighter. Let us think of the Church as we may, no one can deny that the towers of Semur are dear to our hearts.'</p>

<p>'M. le Maire,' said M. de Bois-Sombre, interrupting, 'I speak I am sure the sentiments of my fellow-citizens when I say that there is no longer any question among us concerning the Church; it is an admirable institution, a universal advantage--'</p>
<pb n="115 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said the crowd, 'yes, certainly!' and some added, 'It is the only safeguard, it is our protection,' and some signed themselves. In the crowd I saw Riou, who had done this at the octroi. But the sign did not surprise me now.</p>

<p>M. le Cure* stood by my side, but he did not smile. His countenance was dark, almost angry. He stood quite silent, with his eyes on the ground. It gave him no pleasure, this profession of faith.</p>

<p>'It is well, my friends,' said I, 'we are all in accord; and the good God has permitted us again to see these towers. I have called you together to collect your ideas. This change must have a meaning. It has been suggested to me that we might send an ambassador--a messenger, if that is possible, into the city--'</p>

<p>Here I stopped short; and a shiver ran through me--a shiver which went over the whole company. We were all pale as we looked in each other's faces; and for a moment no one ventured to speak. After
<pb n="116 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

this pause it was perhaps natural that he who first found his voice should be the last who had any right to give an opinion. Who should it be but Jacques Richard?  'M. le Maire,' cried the fellow, 'speaks at his ease--but who will thus risk himself?' Probably he did not mean that his grumbling should be heard, but in the silence every sound was audible; there was a gasp, a catching of the breath, and all turned their eyes again upon me. I did not pause to think what answer I should give.'  I cried. 'Here stands one who will risk himself, who will perish if need be--'</p>

<p>Something stirred behind me. It was Agne*s who had risen to her feet, who stood with her lips parted and quivering, with her hands clasped, as if about to speak. But she did not speak.  Well! she had proposed to do it. Then why not I?</p>

<p>'Let me make the observation,' said another of our fellow-citizens, Bordereau the banker, 'that this would not be just. Without M. le Maire we should be a mob
<pb n="117 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

without a head. If a messenger is to be sent, let it be some one not so indispensable--'</p>

<p>'Why send a messenger?' said another, Philip Leclerc. 'Do we know that these Messieurs will admit any one ? and how can you speak, how can you parley with those--' and he too, was seized with a shiver--'whom you cannot see ?'</p>

<p>Then there came another voice out of the crowd.  It was one who would not show himself, who was conscious of the mockery in his tone. 'If there is any one sent, let it be M. le Cure*,' it said.</p>

<p>M. le Cure* stepped forward. His pale countenance flushed red. 'Here am I,' he said, 'I am ready; but he who spoke speaks to mock me. Is it befitting in this presence?'</p>

<p>There was a struggle among the men. Whoever it was who had spoken (I did not wish to know), I had no need to condemn the mocker; they themselves silenced him; then Jacques Richard (still
<pb n="118 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

less worthy of credit) cried out again with a voice that was husky. What are men made of? Notwithstanding everything, it was from the cabaret, from the wine shop, that he had come. He said, 'Though M. le Maire will not take my opinion, yet it is this. Let them reopen the chapel in the hospital. The ladies of St. Jean--'</p>

<p>'Hold thy peace,' I said, 'miserable!' But a murmur rose. 'Though it is not his part to speak, I agree,' said one. 'And I.' 'And I.'  There was well-nigh a tumult of consent; and this made me angry. Words were on my lips which it might have been foolish to utter, when M. de Bois-Sombre, who is a man of judgment, interfered.</p>

<p>'M. le Maire,' he said, 'as there are none of us here who would show disrespect to the Church and holy things--that is under- stood--it is not necessary to enter into details. Every restriction that would wound the most susceptible is withdrawn; not one more than another, but all. We
<pb n="119 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

have been indifferent in the past, but for the future you will agree with me that everything shall be changed. The ambassador--whoever he may be--' he added with a catching of his breath, 'must be empowered to promise--everything--submission to all that may be required.'</p>

<p>Here the women could not restrain themselves; they all rose up with a cry, and many of them began to weep. 'Ah!' said one with a hysterical sound of laughter in her tears. 'Sainte Me*re! it will be heaven upon earth.'</p><p>M. le Cure* said nothing; a keen glance of wonder, yet of subdued triumph, shot from under his eyelids. As for me, I wrung my hands: 'What you say will be superstition; it will be hypocrisy,' I cried.</p>

<p>But at that moment a further incident occurred. Suddenly, while we deliberated, a long loud peal of a trumpet sounded into the air.  I have already said that many sounds had been heard before; but this was different; there was not one of us that did not feel that this was addressed to himself.
<pb n="120 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

The agitation was extreme; it was a summons, the beginning of some distinct communication. The crowd scattered; but for myself, after a momentary struggle, I  went forward resolutely. I did not even look back at my wife. I was no longer Martin Dupin, but the Maire of Semur, the saviour of the community.  Even Bois-Sombre quailed: but I felt that it was in me to hold head against death itself; and before I had gone two steps I felt rather than saw that M. le Cure* had come to my side. We went on without a word; gradually the others collected behind us, following yet straggling here and there upon the inequalities of the ground.</p>

<p>Before us lay the cloud that was Semur, a darkness defined by the shining of the summer day around, the river escaping from that gloom as from a cavern, the towers piercing through, but the sunshine thrown back on every side from that darkness. I have spoken of the walls as if we saw them, but there were no walls visible,
<pb n="121 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

nor any gate, though we all turned like blind men to where the Porte St. Lambert was. There was the broad vacant road leading up to it, leading into the gloom. We stood there at a little distance. Whether it was human weakness or an invisible barrier, how can I tell?  We stood thus immovable, with the trumpet pealing out over us, out of the cloud. It summoned every man as by his name. To me it was not wonderful that this impression should come, but afterwards it was elicited from all that this was the feeling of each. Though no words were said, it was as the calling of our names. We all waited in such a supreme agitation as I cannot describe for some communication that was to come.</p>

<p>When suddenly, in a moment, the trumpet ceased; there was an interval of dead and terrible silence; then, each with a leap of his heart as if it would burst from his bosom, we saw a single figure slowly detach itself out of the gloom. 'My God!' I cried.
<pb n="122 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

My senses went from me; I felt my head go round like a straw tossed on the winds.</p>

<p>To know them so near, those mysterious visitors--to feel them, to hear them, was not that enough? But, to see! who could bear it? Our voices rang like broken chords, like a tearing and rending of sound. Some covered their faces with their hands; for our very eyes seemed to be drawn out of their sockets, fluttering like things with a separate life.</p>

<p>Then there fell upon us a strange and wonderful calm.  The figure advanced slowly; there was weakness in it.  The step, though solemn, was feeble; and if you can figure to yourself our consternation, the pause, the cry--our hearts dropping back as it might be into their places--the sudden stop of the wild panting in our breasts: when there became visible to us a human face well known, a man as we were. 'Lecamus!' I cried; and all the men round took it up, crowding nearer, trembling yet delivered from  their terror; some even laughed
<pb n="123 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

in the relief. There was but one who had an air of discontent, and that was M. le Cure*.  As he said 'Lecamus!' like the rest, there was impatience, disappointment, anger in his tone.</p>

<p>And I, who had wondered where Lecamus had gone; thinking sometimes that he was one of the deserters who had left us! But when he came nearer his face was as the face of a dead man, and a cold chill came over us. His eyes, which were cast down, flickered under the thin eyelids in which all the veins were visible. His face was gray like that of the dying. 'Is he dead?' I said. But, except M. le Cure*; no one knew that I spoke.</p>

<p>'Not even so,' said M. le Cure*, with a mortification in his voice, which I have never forgotten. 'Not even so.  That might be something. They teach us not by angels--by the fools and offscourings of the earth.'</p>

<p>And he would have turned away. It was a humiliation. Was not he the
<pb n="124 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

representative of the Unseen, the vice-gerent, with power over heaven and hell? but something was here more strong than he. He stood by my side in spite of himself to listen to the ambassador. I will not deny that such a choice was strange, strange beyond measure, to me also.</p>

<p>'Lecamus,' I said, my voice trembling in my throat,' have you been among the dead, and do you live?'</p>

<p>'I live,' he said; then looked around with tears upon the crowd. 'Good neighbours, good friends,' he said, and put out his hand and touched them; he was as, much agitated as they.</p>

<p>'M. Lecamus,' said I, 'we are here in very strange circumstances, as you know;  do not trifle with us. If you have indeed been with those who have taken the control of our city, do not keep us in suspense. You will see by the emblems of my office that it is to me you must address yourself; if you have a mission, speak.' 
<pb n="125 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

It is just,' he said, 'it is just--but bear with me one moment. It is good to behold those who draw breath; if I have not loved you enough, my good neighbours, forgive me now!'</p>

<p>'Rouse yourself, Lecamus,' said I with some anxiety. 'Three days we have been suffering here; we are distracted with the suspense. Tell us your message--if you have anything to tell.'</p>

<p>'Three days!' he said, wondering; 'I should have said years.  Time is long when there is neither night nor day.' Then, uncovering himself, he turned towards the city. 'They who have sent me would have you know that they come, not in anger but in friendship: for the love they bear you, and because it has been permitted--'</p>

<p>As he spoke his feebleness disappeared. He held his head high; and we clustered closer and closer round him, not losing a half word, not a tone, not a breath.</p>
<p>'They are not the dead. They are the
<pb n="126 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

immortal. They are those who dwell--elsewhere. They have other work, which has been interrupted because of this trial. They ask, "Do you know now--do you know now?" this is what I am bidden to say.'</p>

<p>'What'--I said (I tried to say it, but my lips were dry), 'What would they have us to know ?'</p>

<p>But a clamour interrupted me. 'Ah! yes, yes, yes!' the people cried, men and women; some wept aloud, some signed themselves, some held up their hands to the skies. 'Never more will we deny religion,' they cried, 'never more fail in our duties. They shall see how we will follow every office, how the churches shall be full, how we will observe the feasts and the days of the saints! M. Lecamus,' cried two or three together; 'go, tell these Messieurs that we will have masses said for them, that we will obey in everything. We have seen what comes of it when a city is without piety. Never more will we neglect the
<pb n="127 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

holy functions; we will vow ourselves to the holy Mother and the saints--'</p>

<p>'And if those ladies wish it,' cried Jacques Richard, 'there shall be as many masses as there are priests to say them in the Hospital of St. Jean.'</p>

<p>'Silence, fellow!' I cried; 'is it for you to promise in the name of the Commune?' I was almost beside myself. 'M. Lecamus. is it for this that they have come?'</p>

<p>His head had begun to droop again, and a dimness came over his face. 'Do I know ?' he said. 'It was them I longed for, not to know their errand; but I have not yet said all. You are to send two--two whom you esteem the highest--to speak with them face to face.'</p>

<p>Then at once there rose a tumult among the people--an eagerness which nothing could subdue. There was a cry that the ambassadors were already elected, and we were pushed forward, M. le Cure* and myself, towards the gate. They would not hear us speak. 'We promise,' they cried,
<pb n="128 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

'we promise everything; let us but get back.' Had it been to sacrifice us they would have done the same; they would have killed us in their passion, in order to return to their city--and afterwards mourned us and honoured us as martyrs. But for the moment they had neither ruth nor fear.  Had it been they who were going to reason not with flesh and blood, it would have been different; but it was we, not they; and they hurried us on as not willing that a moment should be lost. I had to struggle, almost to fight, in order to provide them with a leader, which was indispensable, before I myself went away. For who could tell if we should ever come back? For a moment I hesitated, thinking that it might be well to invest M. de Bois-Sombre as my deputy with my scarf of office; but then I reflected that when a man goes to battle, when he goes to risk his life, perhaps to lose it, for his people, it is his right to bear those signs which distinguish him from  common men, which
<pb n="129 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

show in what office, for what cause, he is ready to die.</p>

<p>Accordingly I paused, struggling against the pressure of the people, and said in a loud voice, 'In the absence of M. Barbou, who has forsaken us, I constitute the excellent M. Felix de Bois-Sombre my representative. In my absence my fellow-citizens will respect and obey him as myself.' There was a cry of assent. They would have given their assent to anything that we might but go on. What was it to them? They took no thought of the heaving of my bosom, the beating of my heart. They left us on the edge of the darkness with our faces towards the gate. There we stood one breathless moment. Then the little postern slowly opened before us, and once more we stood within Semur.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V. THE NARRATIVE OF PAUL LECAMUS.</p>

<p>M. LE MAIRE having requested me, on his entrance into Semur, to lose no time in drawing up an account of my residence in the town, to be placed with his own narrative, I have promised to do so to the best of my ability, feeling that my condition is a very precarious one, and my time for explanation may be short. Many things, needless to enumerate, press this upon my mind. It was a pleasure to me to see my neighbouurs when I first came out of the city; but their voices, their touch, their vehemence and eagerness wear me out. From my childhood up I have shrunk from close contact with my fellow-men. My mind has been busy with other thoughts; I have desired to investigate the mysterious and unseen. When I have walked abroad I'
<pb n="131 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

have heard whispers in the air; I have felt the movement of wings, the gliding of unseen feet. To my comrades these have been a source of alarm and disquiet, but not to me; is not God in the unseen with all His angels? and not only so, but the best and wisest of men. There was a time indeed, when life acquired for me a charm. There was a smile which filled me with blessedness, and made the sunshine more sweet. But when she died my earthly joys died with her. Since then I have thought of little but the depths profound, into which she has disappeared like the rest.</p>

<p>I was in the garden of my house on that night when all the others left Semur. I was restless, my mind was disturbed. It seemed to me that I approached the crisis of my life. Since the time when I led M. le Maire beyond the walls, and we felt both of us the rush and pressure of that crowd, a feeling of expectation had been in my mind. I knew not what I looked for--but something I looked for that should change
<pb n="132 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the world.  The 'Sommation' on the Cathedral doors did not surprise me. Why should it be a matter of wonder that the dead should come back? the wonder is that they do not. Ah! that is the wonder. How one can go away who loves you, and never return, nor speak, nor send any message--that is the miracle: not that the heavens should bend down and the gates of Paradise roll back, and those who have left us return. All my life it has been a marvel to me how they could be kept away. I could not stay in-doors on this strange night. My mind was full of agitation. I came out into the garden though it was dark. I sat down upon the bench under the trellis--she loved it.  Often had I spent half the night there thinking of her.</p>

<p>It was very dark that night: the sky all veiled, no light anywhere--a night like November. One would have said there was snow in the air. I think I must have slept toward morning (I have observed throughout that the preliminaries of these
<pb n="133 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

occurrences have always been veiled in sleep), and when I woke suddenly it was to find myself, if I may so speak, the subject of a struggle. The struggle was within me, yet it was not I. In my mind there was a desire to rise from where I sat and go away, I could not tell where or why; but something in me said stay, and my limbs were as heavy as lead. I could not move; I sat still against my will; against one part of my will--but the other was obstinate and would not let me go. Thus a combat took place within me of which I knew not the meaning. While it went on I began to hear the sound of many feet, the opening of doors, the people pouring out into the streets.  This gave me no surprise; it seemed to me that I understood why it was; only in my own case, I knew nothing. I listened to the steps pouring past, going on and on, faintly dying away in the distance, and there was a great stillness. I then became convinced, though I cannot tell how, that I was the only living
<pb n="134 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

man left in Semur; but neither did this trouble me. The struggle within me came to an end, and I experienced a great calm.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how long it was till I perceived a change in the air, in the darkness round me. It was like the movement of some one unseen. I have felt such a sensation in the night, when all was still, before now. I saw nothing. I heard nothing. Yet I was aware, I cannot tell how, that there was a great coming and going, and the sensation as of a multitude in the air. I then rose and went into my house, where Leocadie, my old housekeeper, had shut all the doors so carefully when she went to bed. They were now all open, even the door of my wife's room of which I kept always the key, and where no one entered but myself; the windows also were open. I looked out upon the Grande Rue, and all the other houses were like mine. Everything was open, doors and windows, and the streets were full. There was in them a flow and movement
<pb n="135 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

of the unseen, without a sound, sensible only to the soul. I cannot describe it, for I neither heard nor saw, but felt. I have often been in crowds; I have lived in Paris, and once passed into England, and walked about the London streets.  But never, it seemed to me, never was I aware of so many, of so great a multitude.  I stood at my open window, and watched as in a dream. M. le Maire is aware that his house is visible from mine. Towards that a stream seemed to be always going, and at the windows and in the doorways was a sensation of multitudes like that which I have already described. Gazing out thus upon the revolution which was happening before my eyes, I did not think of my own house or what was passing there, till suddenly, in a moment, I was aware that some one had come in to me. Not a crowd as elsewhere; one. My heart leaped up like a bird let loose; it grew faint within me with joy and fear. I was giddy so that I could not stand. I called out her name,
<pb n="136 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

but low, for I was too happy, I had no voice. Besides was it needed, when heart already spoke to heart?</p>

<p>I had no answer, but I needed none. I laid myself down on the floor where her feet would be. Her presence wrapped me round and round. It was beyond speech. Neither did I need to see her face, nor to touch her hand. She was more near to me, more near, than when I held her in my arms. How long it was so, I cannot tell; it was long as love, yet short as the drawing of a breath. I knew nothing, felt nothing but Her, alone; all my wonder and desire to know departed from me. We said to each other everything without words--heart overflowing into heart.  It was beyond knowledge or speech.</p>

<p>But this is not of public signification that I should occupy with it the time of M. le Maire.</p>

<p>After a while my happiness came to an end. I can no more tell how, than I can tell how it came.  One moment, I was
<pb n="137 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

warm in her presence; the next, I was alone. I rose up staggering with blindness and woe--could it be that already, already it was over? I went out blindly following after her. My God, I shall follow, I shall follow, till life is over. She loved me; but she was gone.</p>

<p>Thus, despair came to me at the very moment when the longing of my soul was satisfied and I found myself among the unseen; but I cared for knowledge no longer, I sought only her. I lost a portion of my time so. I regret to have to confess it to M. le Maire. Much that I might have learned will thus remain lost to my fellow-citizens and the world. We are made so. What we desire eludes us at the moment of grasping it--or those affections which are the foundation of our lives pre-occupy us, and blind the soul. Instead of endeavouring to establish my faith and enlighten my judgment as to those mysteries which have been my life-long study, all higher purpose departed from me;
<pb n="138 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

and I did nothing but rush through the city, groping among those crowds, seeing, nothing, thinking of nothing--save of One.</p>

<p>From this also I awakened as out of a dream. What roused me was the pealing of the Cathedral bells.  I was made to pause and stand still, and return to myself. Then I perceived, but dimly, that the thing which had happened to me was that which I had desired all my life. I leave this explanation of my failure1* in public duty to the charity of M. le Maire.</p>

<p>The bells of the Cathedral brought me back to myself--to that which we call reality in our language; but of all that was around me when I regained consciousness, it now appeared to me that I only was a dream. I was in the midst of a world where all was in movement. What the current was which flowed around me I
*1 The reader will remember that the ringing of the Cathedral bells happened in fact very soon after the exodus of the citizens; so that the self-reproaches of M. Lecamus had less foundation than he thought.
<pb n="139 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

know not; if it was thought which becomes sensible among spirits, if it was action, I cannot tell. But the energy, the force, the living that was in them, that could no one misunderstand.  I stood in the streets, lagging and feeble, scarcely able to wish, much less to think. They pushed against me, put me aside, took no note of me. In the unseen world described by a poet whom M. le Maire has probably heard of, the man who traverses Purgatory (to speak of no other place) is seen by all, and is a wonder to all he meets--his shadow, his breath separate him from those around him. But whether the unseen life has changed, or if it is I who am not worthy their attention, this I know that I stood in our city like a ghost, and no one took any heed of me. When there came back upon me slowly my old desire to inquire, to understand, I was met with this difficulty at the first--that no one heeded me. I went through and through the streets, sometimes I paused to look round, to
<pb n="140 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

implore that which swept by me to make itself known. But the stream went along like soft air, like the flowing of a river, setting me aside from time to time, as the air will displace a straw, or the water a stone, but no more.  There was neither languor nor lingering.  I was the only passive thing, the being without occupation. Would you have paused in your labours to tell an idle traveller the meaning of our lives, before the day when you left Semur? Nor would they: I was driven hither and thither by the current of that life, but no one stepped forth out of the unseen to hear my questions or to answer me how this might be.</p>

<p>You have been made to believe that all was darkness in Semur. M. le Maire, it was not so. The darkness wrapped the walls as in a winding sheet; but within, soon after you were gone, there arose a sweet and wonderful light--a light that was neither of the sun nor of the moon; and presently, after the ringing of the bells,
<pb n="141 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

the silence departed as the darkness had departed. I began to hear, first a murmur, then the sound of the going which I had felt without hearing it--then a faint tinkle of voices--and at the last, as my mind grew attuned to these wonders, the very words they said. If they spoke in our language or in another, I cannot tell; but I understood. How long it was before the sensation of their presence was aided by the happiness of hearing I know not, nor do I know how the time has passed, or how long it is, whether years or days, that I have been in Semur with those who are now there; for the light did not vary--there was no night or day. All I know is that suddenly, on awakening from a sleep (for the wonder was that I could sleep, sometimes sitting on the Cathedral steps, sometimes in my own house; where sometimes also I lingered and searched about for the crusts that Leocadie had left), I found the whole world full of sound. They sang going in bands about the streets;
<pb n="142 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

they talked to each other as they went along every way.  From the houses, all open, where everyone could go who would, there came the soft chiming of those voices. And at first every sound was full of gladness and hope. The song they sang first was like this: 'Send us, send us to our father's house. Many are our brethren, many and dear.  They have forgotten, forgotten, forgotten! But when we speak, then will they hear.'  And the others answered: 'We have come, we have come to the house of our fathers. Sweet are the homes, the homes we were born in. As we remember, so will they remember.  When we speak, when we speak, they will hear.' Do not think that these were the words they sang; but it was like this. And as they sang there was joy and expectation everywhere.  It was more beautiful than any of our music, for it was full of desire and longing, yet hope and gladness; whereas among us, where there is longing, it is always sad. Later a great singer, I know
<pb n="143 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

not who he was, one going past as on a majestic soft wind, sang another song, of which I shall tell you by and by. I do not think he was one of them. They came out to the windows, to the doors, into all the streets and byways to hear him as he went past.</p>

<p>M. le Maire will, however, be good enough to remark that I did not understand all that I heard. In the middle of a phrase, in a word half breathed, a sudden barrier would rise. For a time I laboured after their meaning, trying hard and vainly to understand; but afterwards I perceived that only when they spoke of Semur, of you who were gone forth, and of what was being done, could I make it out. At first this made me only more eager to hear; but when thought came, then I perceived that of all my longing nothing was satisfied. Though I was alone with the unseen, I comprehended it not; only when it touched upon what I knew, then I understood.</p>

<p>At first all went well. Those who were
<pb n="144 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

in the streets, and at the doors and windows of the houses, and on the Cathedral steps, where they seemed to throng, listening to the sounding of the bells, spoke only of this that they had come to do. Of you and you only I heard. They said to each other, with great joy, that the women had been instructed, that they had listened, and were safe. There was pleasure in all the city. The singers were called forth, those who were best instructed (so I judged from what I heard); to take the place of the warders on the walls; and all, as they went along, sang that song: 'Our brothers have forgotten; but when we speak, they will hear.' How was it, how was it that you did not hear? One time I was by the river porte in a boat; and this song came to me from the walls as sweet as Heaven. Never have I heard such a song. The music was beseeching, it moved the very heart. 'We have come out of the unseen, 'they sang; 'for love of you; believe us, believe us! Love brings us back to earth;
<pb n="145 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

believe us, believe us!' How was it that you did not hear? When I heard those singers sing, I wept; they beguiled the heart out of my bosom. They sang, they shouted, the music swept about all the walls: 'Love brings us back to earth, believe us!' M. le Maire, I saw you from the river gate; there was a look of perplexity upon your face; and one put his curved hand to his ear as if to listen to some thin far-off sound, when it was like a storm, like a tempest of music!</p>

<p>After that there was a great change in the city. The choirs came back from the walls marching more slowly, and with a sighing through all the air. A sigh, nay, something like a sob breathed through the streets. 'They cannot hear us, or they will not hear us.' Wherever I turned, this is what I heard: 'They cannot hear us.' The whole town, and all the houses that were teeming with souls, and all the street, where so many were coming and going, was full of wonder and dismay. (If you will take my opinion, they know pain as
<pb n="146 A BELEAGUERED CITY.">

well as joy, M. le Maire, Those who are in Semur. They are not as gods, perfect and sufficing to themselves, nor are they all-knowing and all-wise, like the good God. They hope like us, and desire, and are mistaken; but do no wrong. This is my opinion. I am no more than other men, that you should accept it without support; but I have lived among them, and this is what I think.) They were taken by surprise; they did not understand it any more than we understand when we have put forth all our strength and fail. They were confounded, if I could judge rightly. Then there arose cries from one to another: 'Do you forget what was said to us?' and, 'We were warned, we were warned.' There went a sighing over all the city: 'They cannot hear us, our voices are not as their voices; they cannot see us. We have I taken their homes from them, and they know not the reason.' My heart was wrung for their disappointment. I longed to tell them that neither had I heard at once; but
<pb n="147 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

it was only after a time that I ventured upon this. And whether I spoke, and was heard; or if it was read in my heart, I cannot tell.  There was a pause made round me as if of 
wondering and listening, and then, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, a face suddenly turned and looked into my face.</p>

<p>M. le Maire, it was the face of your father, Martin Dupin, whom I remember as well as I remember my own father. He was the best man I ever knew. It appeared to me for a moment, that face alone, looking at me with questioning eyes.</p>

<p>There seemed to be agitation and doubt for a time after this; some went out (so I understood) on embassies among you, but could get no hearing; some through the gates, some by the river. And the bells were rung that you might hear and know; but neither could you understand the bells. I wandered from one place to another, listening and watching-till the unseen became to me as the seen, and I thought
<pb n="148 A BELEAGUERED CITY."/>

of the wonder no more. Sometimes there came to me vaguely a desire to question them, to ask whence they came and what was the secret of their living, and why they were here? But if I had asked who would have heard me? and desire had grown faint in my heart; all I wished for was that you should hear, that you should understand; with this wish Semur was full. They thought but of this. They went to the walls in bands, each in their order, and as they came all the others rushed to meet them, to ask, 'What news?' I following, now with one, now with another, breathless and footsore as they glided along. It is terrible when flesh and blood live with those who are spirits. I toiled after them. I sat on the Cathedral steps, and slept and waked, and heard the voices still in my dream. I prayed, but it was hard to pray. Once following a crowd I entered your house, M. le Maire, and went up, though I scarcely could drag myself along. There many were assembled

And asall was dark, so all was still. I had ex-pected to feel the presence of those whowere there, as I had felt the crowd of theinvisible before they entered the city.

I have always been con-sidered to possess great knowledge ofhuman nature, and this has been maturedby recent events. I sent off messengersinstantly to bring home the women andchildren, and called around me the men inwhom I could most trust. Though I neednot say that the excitement and sufferingof the past three days had told not lessupon myself than upon others, I abandonedall idea of rest. The first thing that I did,aided by my respectable fellow-townsmen,was to take possession of all cabarets andwine-shops, allowing indeed the proprietorsto return, but preventing all assemblageswithin them.   We then established apatrol of respectable citizens throughoutthe city, to preserve the public peace.  Icalculated, with great anxiety, how manyhours it would be before my messengerscould reach La Clairiere, to bring back thewomen--for in such a case the wives are<pb n="246"/>

Judge, then, what was my joy andsatisfaction when the sound of wheels (initself a pleasant sound, for no wheels hadbeen audible on the high-road since theseevents began) came briskly to us from thedistance; and looking out from the watch-tower over the Porte St. Lambert, I sawthe strangest procession. The wine-cartsand all the farm vehicles of La Clairiere,and every kind of country waggon, were jolting along the road, all in a tumult andbabble of delicious voices; and from underthe rude canopies and awnings and roofsof vine branches, made up to shield themfrom the sun, lo! there were the childrenlike birds in a nest, one little head peeping over the other. And the cries and songs, the laughter, and the shoutings! As theycame along the air grew sweet, the world :was made new.    Many of us, who had <pb n="247"/>
borne all the terrors and sufferings ofthe past without fainting, now felt theirstrength fail them. Some broke out intotears, interrupted with laughter.  Somecalled out aloud the names of their littleones. We went out to meet them, everyman there present, myself at the head.And I will not deny that a sensation ofpride came over me when I saw mymother stand up in the first waggon,with all those happy ones flutteringaround her. ' My son,' she said, 'I havedischarged the trust that was given me.I bring thee back the blessing of God.''And God bless thee, my mother!' Icried. The other men, who were fathers,like me, came round me, crowding to kissher hand.

And to seethem dispersing hand in hand, runninghere and there, each to its home, carrying ;peace, and love, and gladness, through thestreets-that was enough to make the mostserious smile.  No fear was in them, orcare.  Every haggard man they met-some of them feverish, restless, beginningto think of riot and pleasure after forcedabstinence-there was a new shout, a rushof little feet, a shower of soft kisses. Thewomen were following after, some packedinto the carts and waggons, pale and worn,yet happy; some walking behind in groups; the more strong, or the more eager, inadvance, and a long line of stragglersbehind. There was anxiety in their faces, mingled with their joy.  How did they know what they might find in the housesfrom which they had been shut out ? Andmany felt, like me, that in the very return,in the relief, there was danger. But thechildren feared nothing; they filled the streets with their dear voices, and happi-And<pb n="249"/>

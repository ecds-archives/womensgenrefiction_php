They will assert, with much indignant emphasis, that thecharacter of 'Lord Carlyon' is an impossible one, and that such a 'cad' as heis shown to be never existed. Anticipating these remarks, I have to say inreply that the two chief personages in my story, namely, 'Lord Carlyon' and hiswife, are drawn strictly from the life; and, that though both the originalshave some years since departed from this scene of earthly contest andmisunderstanding, so that my delineation of their characters can no longergrieve or offend either, the 'murder of Delicia' <pb n="vi     Introductory Note"/>wasconsummated at the hands of her husband precisely in the way I have depictedit.</p><p>There are thousands of such 'murders' daily happening among us--murderswhich are not considered 'cruelty' in the eyes of the law. There are any numberof women who work night and day with brain and hand to support useless andbrainless husbands; women whose love never falters, whose patience never tires,and whose tenderness is often rewarded only by the most callous neglect andingratitude. I do not speak of the countless cases among the hard-workingmillions whom we elect to call the 'lower classes,' where the wife, workingfrom six in the morning till ten at night, has to see her hard earningssnatched from her by her 'better' half and spent at the public-house in strongdrink, despite the fact that there is no food at home, and that innocent littlechildren are starving. These instances are so frequent that they have almostceased to awaken our interest, much less our sympathy. In my story I alludeprincipally to the 'upper' ranks, where <pb n="vii     Introductory Note"/>thelazy noodle of an aristocrat spends his time, first, in accumulating debts, andthen in looking about for a woman with money to pay them--a woman upon whoseincome he can afterwards live comfortably for the rest of his worthless life.To put it bluntly and plainly, a great majority of the men of the present daywant women to keep them.

And in cases where the woman'sintellectual ability is brought into play, and where the financial results ofher brain work are such that they enable the husband to live as he likes,surrounded with every ease and comfort, then it is that at the dubs, or in anyother place where he can give himself sublime airs of independence, he willfrequently express regret, in grandiloquent terms, that there should be anywomen who 'want to be clever': thev are alwavs 'unsexed.'

Just when the sunshine crowned her, as the sunshine had a way of doingat that particular hour of the morning, she was very busy finishing the lastchapter of a book which had occupied all her energies during the past fourmonths. She wrote rapidly, and the small, well-shaped, white hand that guidedthe pen held that dangerous intellectual weapon firmly, with a close andsomewhat defiant grip, suggestive of the manner of a youthful warrior graspinga light spear and about to hurl it in the face of a foe.

She carefully considered the needs of the poor, and helpedthem accordingly, in secret, and without the petty presumption of placardingher charities to the world through the medium of a 'bazaar' or hypocritical'entertainment at the East End.'

It was a night never to be forgotten- by Delicia, at least; a nightwhen Shakespeare's elves might have been abroad, playing mischief with theflowers and scattering wonder-work- ing charms upon the air-a true ' MidsummerNight's Dream' which descended, full-visioned in silver luminance, straightfrom Paradise for Delicia's sake.

Delicia astonished and irritated several members of her own sex bythe extreme simplicity of her dress on the occasion. She always managedsomehow, quite unintentionally, to astonish and irritate her sweet 'sisters' inwomanhood, who, forced to admit her intellectual superiority to themselves,loved her accordingly. Thus her very wedding garment was an affront to them,being only a classic gown of softly-draped white silk crepe-de-chine, withoutany adornment of either lace or flowers. Then her bridal veil was a vexatiousthing, because it was so un- usually becoming-it was made of white chiffon, <pb n="29"/>Murderof Delicia I. irreverent than for a woman of position fortune to take hermarriage-vows before altar of the Most High without wearing a court train ordiamonds!

A considerablylarge crowd, moved by feelings of sincere appreciation for the union of theprofessions of War and Literature, waited outside the church to give the bridea cheer as she stepped into her carriage, and some of them, hustling a littlein advance of the policemen on duty, and peering up towards the entrance of thesacred edifice, were rewarded by seeing the Most Distinguished Personage in therealm, smiling his ever-cordial smile, and shaking hands with the fair'celebrity' just wedded. At this sight a deafening noise broke out from thethroats of the honest 'masses,' a noise which became almost tumultuous when theDistinguished Personage walked by the side of the newly- married pair down thered-carpeted pavement from the church to the nuptial carriage-door, and liftedhis hat again and again to the 'huzzas' which greeted him. But the Dis-tinguished Personage did not get all the. applause by any means. Delicia gotthe most of it, and many of the crowd pelted her with flowers which they hadbrought with them for the purpose. For she was one of the few 30 <pb n="31"/>TheMurder of Delicia S, 'beloved women' that at rare intervals are born toinfluence nations-so few they are and so precious in their lives and examplesthat it is little wonder nations make much of them when they find them. Therewere people in the crowd that day who had wept and smiled over Delicia'swritings, and who had, through her teaching, grown better, happier and morehumane men and women; and there was a certain loving jealousy in these whichgrudged that she should stoop from her lofty height of fame, to marry, like anyother ordinary woman. They would have had her exempt from the common lot, andyet they all desired her happiness. So in half-gladness, half-regret, theycheered her and threw roses and lilies at her, for it was the month of June;and she with her veil thrown back, and the sunshine glinting on her gold hair,smiled bewitchingly as she bowed right and left to the clamorous throng of herassembled admirers; then, with her glorious six feet of husband, she steppedinto her carriage and drove away to the sound of a final cheer.

Unable to obtain admit- tance toher house, they took refuge in scandal, and invented lies and slandersconcerning her, all of which fell flat owing to her frankly open life ofdomestic peace and contentment. Sneers and false rumours were inserted abouther in the journals; she ignored them, and quietly lived them down, tillfinally the worst thing anyone could find to say of her was that she was'idiotically in love' with her own husband.

To whichDelicia would reply tranquilly, 'Did you? I hope he was amusing himself.'

They had alawyer of their own, whose business it was to arrange the disputes of the club,should occasion require his services, and they also had a doctor, a humorousand very clever little man, who was fond of strolling about the premises in theevening, and taking notes for the writing of a medical treatise to be entitled'Literary Dyspepsia, and the Passion' of Envy considered in its Action on theSpleen and Other Vital Organs,' a book which he justly con- sidered wouldexcite a great deal of interest among his professional compeers.

*   The Murder of Delicia


She sank into a profound reverie.   Her


brain was dear, logical and evenly balanced,


and she had none of the flighty, fantastical,


hysterical notions common to many of her


sex. She had been trained, or rather, she


had trained herself, in the splendid school of


classic philosophy; and in addition to this,


she was a devout Christian, one of the old-


world type, who would have willingly en-


dured martyrdom   for the faith had it been


necessary. She was not a church-goer, and


she belonged to no special 'sect;' she had no


vulgar vices to hide by an ostentatious dis-


play of public charities, but she had the

She changed her riding habit for oneof her simple white morning gowns, and went into her study to open and read hernumerous letters, and mark them in order for her secretary to answer. She wasstill engaged in this occupation when Lord Carlyon came down, slowly, sleepily,and in no very good humour. 'Oh, there you are at last, Will!' she said,looking up at him brightly. 'You came home late last night, I suppose, and aretired?' He stood still for a moment, wondering within himself why she did notgive him her usual good-morning kiss.

'Spartan seems to be turning crusty,' he remarked as heunfolded the journal. 'Last night, when I knocked at your door, he showed histeeth and growled at me. I didn't know he had such an uncertain temper.'Delicia looked round at her canine friend with a pretty air of remonstrance.'Oh, Spartan! What is this I hear?' she said, whereat Spartan hung his head andtucked his tail well under his haunches. 'Don't you know your master when hecomes home late?

Carlyon flushed, and began to butter a piece of toast in nervoushaste. 'Why, there was no need for defence,' he stammered.

' At least, so say some of our sage instructors; and if itbe indeed a fact that mortal things are but the passing shadow of immortalones, it is natural enough that we should gradually outlive the temporal in ourdesire for the eternal.'

'Well, this morning, at any rate, you appear to betired of me,' said Carlyon, irritably. ' So I suppose I'd better get out ofyour way!' She made no answer whatever.

Because it is 'the thing' to talk slang, they pollute thenoble English language with coarse expressions copied from stable conversation;and because it is considered 'swagger' to make love to other men's wives, theyenter into this base form of vulgar intrigue almost as if it were a necessarypoint of dignity and an added grace to manhood.

Delicia looked at him steadily, and Robson stammeredon, giving her more information. 'Since the grand dinner his lordship gave herelast week, he has only called in for his letters; he has been staying withfriends.' Delicia glanced around her at the picturesque hall with its heraldicemblems, stained-glass windows and rare old oak furniture, all of which she hadcollected herself and arranged with the taste of a perfect artist, and a faintchill crept over her as she thought that perhaps even her home-the home she hadbuilt and planned and made beautiful out of the work of her own brain-had beendese- crated by the company of her husband's <pb n="216"/>' The Murder ofDelicia the other servants out for the day.

'What people dined here? Do I know any of them?' 'Not that I am awareof, my lady,' said Robson, with an injured air. 'I should say it wasn't at alllikely you knew any of them; they were very loud in their ways, very loudindeed. Two of the females-I beg pardon- ladies, stayed to sleep-one young one,and one old.'

' Thankyou !' But as she spoke she quivered with rage and shame-her very servantpitied her; even he had had more decency and thought for her than the man shehad wedded. Was it possible to drain much deeper the dregs of humiliation? Shewent upstairs to her own bedroom and looked nervously about her. Had 'Madame deGascon and Miss de Gascon,' whoever they were, slept there?

Emily, the maid, who was fortunately in the adjoining dressing- room,heard her fall, and rushed at once to her assistance. With the aid of coldwater and smelling-salts, she shudderingly revived and gazed about her inpitiful wonderment. 'Emily, is it you?' she asked feebly. 'What is the matter?Did I faint? What a strange thing for me to do! I remember now; it was adreadful pain that came at my heart. I thought I was dying-' She paused,shivering violently. 'Shall I send for the doctor, my lady?' asked thefrightened Emilv. 'You look very <pb n="219"/>The Murder of Delicia 6, Emily,after lingering about a little, left the room at last, with some uneasiness;and when she had gone, Delicia leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes.'That was a horrible, horrible pain!' she thought. ' I wonder if there isanything wrong with my heart ? To-morrow I will see a doctor; to-night I shallwant all my strength, physical and moral, to help me to look with calmness onmy husband's face.' Gradually she grew better; her breathing became easier andthe nervous trembling of her limbs ceased. When the maid came up with the teashe was almost herself again, and smiled at her attendant's anxious face in aperfectly reassuring manner. sa AdrM Io: tor 7&quot;:1.T ' a \A <pb n="220"/>'The Murder of Delicia asked Emily, beginning to regain her wits and composure.'Oh, the very grandest, of course,' said Delicia, with a little laugh. 'The onewith the embroidered train, which you say looks as if it were sewn all overwith diamonds.' Emily's bright face grew more radiant; the care of this specialgown was her delight; her mistress had only worn it once, and then had lookedsuch a picture of ethereal loveliness as might have made 'Oberon, the fairyking,' pause in his flight over flowers to wonder at her; and while the willing'Abigail' busied herself in preparing the adornments of the evening, Deliciasipped her tea and reclined in her chair restfully, thinking all the while L.._L--L- Loo ._-1 ... *B <pb n="221"/>The Murder of Delicia L would be scatteredas gifts among his favourites, and I doubt if even my poor, faithful Spartanwould find a home for his old age!

Fortunately the law, which is generally so unjust towomen, has been forced into permitting our unhappy sex to have at least anindividual right over our own money, whether earned or inherited; formerly wewere not allowed to have any property apart from our lords and masters!

That is a mistake! You should not have any expres- sion; it is &quot;bad form&quot; to look interested, surprised, or indignant.

But being a successful rival with men in thestruggle for fame, they vent their spite by calling you a fool. And you are afool, my dear, to have ever married one of them!' Smiling at herselfdisdainfully, she gathered up her fan and gloves, and descended to hercarriage.

'Delicia looked at her in a haughty silence. The other woman laughed. 'I supposeyou think it pretty cool of me making remarks on your clothes,' she said; 'butI'm a &quot;celebrity,&quot; you see, and I always say what I like and do whatI like.

Why, I've read all your books, and cried overthem, I can tell you! Well now, to think of it!' And her hard, brilliant facewas momentarily softened in sudden interest. 'Why, all these swagger people areasked to meet you here to-night, and I'm the paid artiste. I'm to have fortyguineas to dance twice before the assembled company! Tra-la-la!' and sheexecuted a sudden lively pirouette. 'I am pleased! I'd rather dance before youthan the Queen !'

She bowed to him serenely, with a charming smile and playful air, asif she had only just left his company, then passed him by, entering at onceinto conversation with an artist of note, who came eagerly forward to presenthis young wife to her. Carlyon, quite taken aback, stared at her half-angrily, half-obsequiously,for there <pb n="231"/>The Murder of Delicia /. and elegantly-wordedcompliments, and the more he watched her, the more morose and ill-humoured hebecame.

She has no fault whatever to find with me in the eyes of the law !'He had always been vain of his personality, and it irritated him curiously tonotice that she never glanced once in his direction. No one could possibly denyhis outward attractiveness -he was distinctly what is called a ' beautifulman.'

'Flushing with annoyance, he moved from the position he had taken up near thegrand piano and strolled by himself through the rooms, picking out here andthere a few of his own friends to speak to, who, however, seemed to havenothing much to say except, 'How charming Lady Carlyon looks this evening!' aphrase which irritated rather than pleased him, simply because ' <pb n="233"/>TheMurder of Delicia 6 because he was forced to understand that she, his wife, haddetermined that so he should be left.

The worthy clergyman of the parish in which her great house was thechiefest of the neigh- bourhood, shut his eyes to her sins and opened them toher cheques; so all went well and merrily with her. Her entrance into LadyDexter's drawing-room was the signal for a com- plete change in the attitude ofthe fashionable throng. Everybody craned their necks to look at her and commenton her dress and diamonds; people began to whisper to each other the newestbits of scandal about her, and Delicia, with her fair face and unsulliedcharacter, was soon deserted and forgotten. <pb n="235"/>The Murder of Delicia5. regret the loss of cleanliness. I think she is a worse type than &quot;LaMarina,&quot; for &quot;La Marina&quot; does not pretend to be good; but thiswoman's whole life is occupied in the despicable art of feigning virtue.' Sheremained in her quiet nook looking at the restless, talking, giggling throng,and now and then turning her eyes towards the flowers in the conservatory-talllilies, brilliant azaleas, nowy Cape jessamine, drooping passion flowers -_11exquisite creations of perfect beauty, yet silent and seemingly unconscious oftheir own carms. 'How much more lovely and worthy of love flowers are thanhuman beings!' she thought. 'If I had been the Creator, I think <pb n="236"/>WThe Murder of Delicia hard lines which vice and self-indulgence had drawn onthat fair face were scarcely per- ceptible in the softened light, and herlittle low laugh of coquettish pleasure at some remark of Lord Carlyon'ssounded musical enough even to Delicia, who, though she knew and detested thewoman's character, could not refrain from looking after her half in wonder- ment,half in aversion. Within a few paces of where she sat they stopped,-LordCarlyon placed a chair for his fair companion near a giant palm, which toweredup nearly to the I roof of the conservatory, and then, drawing another to herside, sat down himself. 'At last in my wretched life I am allowed a moment'spleasure!' he said, conveying into <pb n="237"/>The Murder of Delicia 5-| 'Theonly man in the world to be really envied is your husband,' he said morosely.Delicia, hidden by the protecting curtain, kept herself quite still. A smile ofdisdain came on her proud mouth as she thought within herself, 'What liars menare! I have heard him say often that Lord Brancewith ought to be hounded out ofthe clubs for allowing his wife to dishonour his name! And now he declares himto be the only man in the world to be really envied!' But Carlyon was speakingagain, and some force stronger than herself held her there motionless, anunwilling listener. 'You have never been kind to me,' he complained, theBeautiful Sullenness look <pb n="238"/>' The Murder of Delicia 'And you areawfully impertinent,' she said, smiling. 'Don't you remember you are a marriedman?' 'I do, to my cost,' he answered. 'And you are a married woman!' 'Oh, butI am so different,' she declared naively. 'You see, you have got a wonder- fulcelebrity for a wife-clever and brilliant, and all that. Now, poor Brancewithis a dreadful, dear old dunce, and I should really die if I hadn't some otherman to speak to sometimes-' 'Or several other men!' he put in, taking her fan fromher hand and beginning to wave it to and fro. She laughed. <pb n="239"/>TheMurder of Delicia 6t was quite the centre of attraction till you came in. Then,of course, it was a case of a small star paling before the full moon in all hersplendour!' 'How sweetly poetical! But please don't break my fan,' and she tookthe delicate toy in question from him. 'It cost twenty guineas, and it isn'tpaid for yet.' 'Let me settle the bill,' said Carlyon, look- ing adoringly intoher eyes, 'or any amount of bills!' A faint tremor ran through Delicia's body,as though a cold wind were playing on her nerves. Bending a little forward, shelistened more intently. 'Generous man!' laughed Lady Brancewith. <pb n="240"/>'0The Murder of Delicia 'I want to see your wife; do introduce me to her! I have oftenbeen on the point of meeting her, but never have done so. Sihe doesn't know thepeople I know, and I don't know the people she knows, so we've always missedeach other. She is such a genius! Dunce as you are, you must have sense enoughto be very proud of her! ' Carlyon looked dubious. Then he suddenly said,-'Well, I don't know! I think a clever woman-a writer of books, you know, likemy wife-is a mistake. She is always un- sexed.' As the word passed his lips,Delicia rose, pale, fair and calm in her glistening robes, <pb n="241"/>TheMurder of Delicia 5 gracious and ungrateful churl who owed all he possessed inthe world to her tenderness and bounty; then coldly, quietly, and with anunshaken grace of bearing and queenliness of movement, she turned away, hersoft satin train sweeping them by as she moved forward into the crowded roomsand disappeared. 'Who was that wonderful-looking woman ?' asked LadyBrancewith, eagerly. Carlyon flushed, anon grew deadly pale. 'That wasDelicia-my wife,' he answered curtly. 'That! That the novelist!' almostscreamed Lady Brancewith. 'Why didn't you say so? Why didn't you introduce me?I had no idea she was like that! I thought all literary <pb n="242"/>4/ TheMurder of Delicia and at that time he did not mind it. But now, consideringthat he was 'Lord' Carlyon, he did not care to be addressed as 'Billy,' and hisresentment showed itself pretty plainly on his darkened countenance. But LadyBrancewith was too much excited to heed his annoyance. 'The idea!' shecontinued. 'If she was sitting there all the while she must have heardeverything! A nice mess you have made of it! If I were in her place, I'd throwyou off like a pair of old shoes ! ' 'I haven't the least doubt you would,' hesaid with temper. 'It's the way you behave with most men who have the honour of<pb n="243"/>The Murder of Delicia s the gossips right on that point-I shalltell everybody it is she who is to be pitied for marrying a militarynonentity!' With a light laugh at her own sarcasm she left him, and started ona voyage of discovery after Delicia. The people were wedged to- gether ingroups at every available point to watch the dancing of &quot;La Marina,&quot;who had commenced her performance, and who was announced for that evening as'Mademoiselle Violet de Gascon' out of deference to the 'proprieties,' whomight possibly have been shocked had they been too openly told that thefigurante was the 'Empire's' famous 'Marina,' though they were quite aware ofthe fact all the timP Prn. ;n +,- z.. l- <pb n="244"/>&quot;'% The Murder ofDelicia at all, you are at liberty to give her poor name over to the dogs ofslander to rend at will; but if she is a countess or a duchess, you mustentirely condone her vulgar vices. Think of her title! Think of her familyconnections! Think of the manner in which her influence might be brought tobear on some little matter in which you personally have an interest! LadyBrancewith knew all this well enough; she knew exactly how to play her cards,and she was sufficiently a woman of the world to salute ' La Marina' with apretty bow and compliment as soon as her dance was finished, and to express theplaintive wish, uttered sighingly, ' How glad I should be if I were half soclever ! ' Whereat Marina sniffed the air dubiously and <pb n="245"/>The Murderof Delicia 5c some of whom whispered to each other that she was 'going off' abit, simply because they could not see much above her slender ankles. Sheherself, however, cared nothing for what they said or thought, and at theconclusion of her dance she boldly asked her hostess where Lady Carlyon was. 'Shehas gone home, I am sorry to say,' was the reply. 'She is not very well, shetells me; and she found the heat of the room rather trying.' 'Are you speakingof the guest of the evening - Lady Carlyon ? ' inquired Lady Brancewith,sweetly. 'Yes.

'You wild cat!' he said savagely. 'If you havedared-' 'Puss, puss ! Pretty puss !' laughed Marina. 'Cats have claws, my LordBill, and they scratch occasionally !'

For there is no degradation that can befall a woman which man will notexcuse and condone; equally there is no elevation or honour she can win whichhe will not grudge and oppose with all the force of his nature! For man lovesto hold a strangulation-grip on the neck of <pb n="248"/>o9' The Murder ofDelicia the height of their true and capable dignity, where should he go to forhis so-called 'fun'? Some thoughts of this kind were in Lord Carlyon's head ashe threw on his opera-coat and prepared to leave the scene of revelry at theDexters. The pale, noble face of Delicia haunted him; the disdain of her cleareyes still rankled in his soul; and he was actually indignant with her for whathe considered 'that offensive virtue of hers,' which shamed him, and which had,for a moment at least, made 'the most distinguished Lady Brance- with' seemnothing but a common drab, daubed with paint and powder. Even as he thought ofher thus, the fair and faithless Lily approached him, smiling, with a coaxingand <pb n="249"/>The Murder of Delicia L(r) undoubtedly very lovely, despiteher artificial flesh tints and distinctly dyed hair. 'All right!' he said witha stand-offish manner of coldness and indifference, 'I don't mind seeing youhome.' 'How sweet and condescending of you!' and Lady Brancewith threw on hermantle gleaming with iridescent jewels and showered with perfumed lace. 'Sogood of you to bore yourself with my company!' Her eyes flashed; she was in adanger- ous mood, and Carlyon saw it. In silence he piloted her through theranks of attendant flunkeys, and when her carriage came bowling up to the doorassisted her into it. 'Good-night!' he then said, raising his hat <pb n="250"/>sThe Murder of Delicia proper!' Then, putting out her hand, she caught him bythe coat-sleeve. ' Do you know what I wish for you?' she said slowly. 'Can'timagine!' he responded carelessly. 'Something nasty, no doubt.' 'Yes, it issomething nasty!' She laughed under her breath as she spoke. 'Something nasty,yet very commonplace, too. I wish your wife may discover the kind of man youare,-and stop your allowances! Good-night!' She smiled brilliantly; the horsesstarted suddenly and he drew back, smothering an angry oath. Another moment andthe carriage had rolled away, leaving him alone staring at the pavement. Hestood for a little lost in gloomy meditation; then, summoning a hansom, <pb n="251"/>TheMurder of Delicia L. think I know the best way to go to work.' Here he smiled.'Poor little woman! I dare- say she feels awfully sore; but I know hercharacter-a few loving words and plenty of kisses and embraces, and she'll bejust the same as ever she was, and-and-by Jove! I'll see if I can't turn over anew leaf. It'll be infernally dull, but I'll try it!' And perfectly satisfiedwith the plan he had formulated in his own mind for setting things straight, hearrived at his own house. The door was opened to him by Robson, who informedhim that her ladyship had returned about an hour ago and was waiting to see himin her study. 'In her study, did you say?' he repeated. <pb n="252"/>CHAPTER XIDELICIA was at her desk, writing. She had taken off her rich evening costumeand was clad in a loose robe of white cashmere that fell down to her feet,draping her after the fashion of one of Fra Angelico's angels. Her hair wasunbound from its ' dress coiffure' of elaborate twists and coils, and wasmerely thrust out of her way at the back of her head in one great knot of gold.She rose <pb n="253"/>The Murder of Delicia al she said, in a low voice thatvibrated with intense passion. 'There is no longer any need of them. You haveshown me your- self as you are, in your true colours-the mask has fallen, andyou need not stoop to pick it up and put it on again. It is mere waste of time!' He stared at her, foolishly pulling at his moustache and still trying tosmile. 'You called me &quot;unsexed&quot; to-night,' she went on, neverremoving her steadfast gaze from his face. 'Do you know what the word means? Ifnot, I will tell you. It is to be like the women you admire !-to be like&quot;La Marina,&quot; who strips her body to the gaze of the nublic withouteither shame or <pb n="254"/>-'' The Murder of Delicia 'I didn't say you were&quot;unsexed,&quot; he stammered awkwardly. 'I said clever women were, as arule, unsexed.' 'Pardon me,' she interrupted him coldly. 'You said &quot;womenwho write books, like my wife.&quot; Those were your exact words. And, Irepeat, what have I done to deserve them? Have I ever dishonoured your name?Have you not been the one thought, the one pride, the one love of my life? Hasnot every beat of my heart, together with every stroke of my pen, been for youand you only? While all the time to me you have played traitor-your very lookshave been lies, you have deceived and destroyed all my most sacred beliefs andhopes; you have murdered <pb n="255"/>The Murder of Delicia 56 can't you forgetand forgive?' And unde- terred by the chill aversion in her face, he held outhis arms. 'Come, I am sure your )wn heart cannot tell you to be unkind to ne !You do love me-' 'Love you !' she cried, recoiling from him; I hate you! Yourvery presence is hideous :o my sight; and just as I once thought you :henoblest of men, so I think you now the owest, the meanest! You have been afool, you say; oh, if you were only that! Only ifool! There are so many ofthem! Some )f them such good fellows, too, in their folly. Fools there are inplenty who, nevertheless, lo manage to preserve some cleanliness in their ives;who would not wrong a woman or insult I r . _ _I <pb n="256"/>? The Murder ofDelicia my metier,' she said. 'I leave that to the poor &quot;Marina,&quot;when you have dosed her with too much champagne. There is no need to go overthe cause of our present conflict; what I have to say can be said in very fewwords. Your &quot;unsexed&quot; wife, who has had the honour of maintaining youever since your union with her, by the ungrudging labour of her brain and hand,has sufficient sense of justice and self- respect to continue no longer in thateminently unpractical mode of action. We must for the future live apart; for I cannotconsent to share your attentions with one stage artiste or any number of stageartistes. I do not choose to pay for their jewels; and your generous offer tosettle Lady Brancewith's bills for her does <pb n="257"/>The Murder of Deliciah, ,ecause they will not lower themselves to the nan's brute level. Nothing ismore un- iatural from a man's point of view than that x woman should havebrains,-and with those )rains make money and position often superior to his,and at any rate manage to be inde- pendent of him. What men prefer is that:heir wives should be the slaves of their humour, and receive a five-pound notewith ieep thankfulness whenever they can get it, shutting their eyes to thefact that people like &quot;Marina&quot; get twenty pounds to their five fromthe same quarter. But you,-you have had nothing to complain of in the way of apecuniary position, though I, as bread- winner, might readily have comportedmyself <pb n="258"/>4 The Murder of Delicia For it was distinctly your businessto chastise the writer of that lying paragraph in the paper; but you left me tobe defended by one who shares with me the drawback of being a &quot;publiccharacter,&quot; and with whom I have no connection whatever beyond that offriendship, as you perfectly well know. Why, I have heard of men, well-born, too,and of considerable social attainment, who have been willing enough to fightfor the so-called j &quot;honour&quot; of an admitted demi-mondaine; but for anhonest woman and faithful wife, who is there in these days that will stir afinger to defend her from slander! Very few; least of all her husband! To sucha height has nineteenth - century morality risen! I, who <pb n="259"/>TheMurder of Delicia oi do think of it; and thinking, I wonder at myself and you!'He dropped lazily into a chair and looked at her. 'I suppose your temper willbe over presently,' he said, 'and you will see things in a more reasonablelight. You must re- member I have given you a great position, Delicia; I thinkour marriage has been one of perfect mutual benefit. &quot;Literary&quot; womenhardly ever get a chance of marrying at all, you know; men are afraid ofthem-won't marry them on any account ;-would rather have a barmaid, really-andwhen a &quot;literary&quot; woman gets into the aristocracy and all that- well,by Jove !-it's a splendid thing for her, you know, and gives her a great lift!As for being <pb n="260"/>4 The Murder of Delicia 'I think I have admitted it!' she said ironic-. ally. 'Fully and freely! For I have given everything;equally you have taken everything ! That is plain enough. And now you insult meafresh by the suggestion that it was really a condescension on your part tomarry me at all, I being &quot;literary&quot; ! If I had been a music- halldancer, of course you would have been much prouder of me; it would have beensomething indeed worth boasting of, to say your wife had originally been famousfor a break-down or can-can at the &quot;Empire !&quot; But because I follow,with what force and ability I can, the steps of the truly great, who havehelped to mould the thoughts and feelings of men and nations, it is quiteextraordinary I <pb n="261"/>The Murder of Delicia L. to the peerage putshimself on an equality with rou, whether you like it or not. But betweenne-untitled Delicia Vaughan-and the self- Dame peer of the ale-cask, there is agreat gulf ixed; and not all his wealth can put him on an :quality with me, orwith any author who has )nce won the love of nations. And so, Lord Carlyon,permit me to return your title, for I ,hall not wear it. When we separate Ishall ceep to my own name simply; thus I shall owe you nothing, not even prestige!' Carlyon suddenly lifted his fine eyes and flashed them effectively at her.'You are talking nonsense, Delicia,' he said impatiently. 'You know you don'treally mean that we are ton ePnarat Whr ' th;i <pb n="262"/>' The Murder ofDelicia 'Don't touch me,' she cried wildly. 'Don't dare to come near me! Icannot answer for myself if you do; this shall defend me from you ifnecessary!' And almost before he could realise it she had snatched a small,silver-mounted pistol from its case on a shelf hard by, and, holding it in herhand, she stood as it were at bay. He gave a short, embarrassed laugh. ' Youhave gone mad, Delicia!' he said. 'Put down that thing. It isn't loaded, ofcourse; ' but it doesn't look pretty to see you with it.' 'No, it doesn't lookpretty,' she responded slowly. ' But it is loaded! I took care of that beforeyou came in ! I don't want to injure either you or myself; but I swear to you <pb n="263"/>TheMurder of Delicia 69 I have gone mad, you think ? ' she went on. 'If I had,would it be wonderful? To have one's dearest hopes ruined, one's heart broken,one's life made waste-is that not something of a cause for madness? But I amnot mad; I am simply resolved that your lips, which have bestowed their kisseson &quot;la Marina,&quot; shall never touch mine again; that your arms, whichhave embraced her, shall never embrace me, and that, come what will, I willkeep my self- respect if I die for it! Now you know my mind, you will go yourway; I mine. I cannot divorce you; for though you have murdered my very soul inme, brutally and pitilessly, you have not been &quot; cruel &quot; according tolegal oninion- Rut T can senarate from <pb n="264"/>' The Murder of Delicia'You actually mean to say you want a judi- cial separation ?' he inquired atlast, sullenly She bent her head in the affirmative. 'Well, you can get that,of course. But 1 must say, Delicia, of all the ungrateful, heart- less women,you are the very worst ! I should never have thought it of you ! I imagined youhad such a noble nature! So sweet and loving and forgiving! Good heavens! Afterall, what have I done ? Just had a bit of fun with a dancing girl ! Quite acommon amuse- ment with men of my class ! ' I have no doubt of it,' sheanswered; 'Very common ! All the same, I do not choose to either tolerate it orpay for it. Ungrateful, L_,.I c ....., ! &quot; 11&quot;,L,. :A . .t..., ....t <pb n="265"/>TheMurder of Delicia l. in a very short space of time you will be free of mycompany for ever. Shall we say good-bye now ?' She raised her eyes,-her goldhair shone about her like an aureole, and a sudden sweet- ness softened herface, though its gravity was unchanged. A sharp pang of remorse and sor- rowstabbed him through and through, and he looked at her in mingled abasement andyearning. ' Delicia-must we part?' He whispered the question, half in hope halfin fear. She regarded him steadily. 'Dare you ask it? Can you imagine I :ouldlove you again after what has passed? Some women micrht ran qc--T rnilrl nn' <pb n="266"/>4The Murder of Delicia she,-this woman, whose whole life and devotion he had hadso recently in his keeping,-had suddenly fathomed his true nature and cast himfrom her as something contemptible, and that she-she had the power to maintainher- self free of him in wealth and ease, whilst he, if she were at allmalevolently inclined, would have to return to the state of semi-poverty and'living on tick,' which had been his daily and yearly lot before he met her.In- wardly he cursed ' la Marina,' Lily Brance- with and everybody, excepthimself. He never thought of including his own vices in the general big 'Damn!' he was mentally utter- ing. And as he hesitated, shuffling one foot againstthe other, a prey to the most dis- <pb n="267"/>The Murder of Delicia 5rubbish, and give yourself airs and graces, but I am a poor devil of a fellowalways getting into a hole; and it isn't to be supposed that I am going to takemy dismissal in this way, just as if I were a lackey. I am your husband, youknow; you can't undo that!' 'Not at present,' said Delicia, drawing back fromhim quickly, the tenderness passing from her face and leaving it coldlydisdainful. ' But it is very possible the Gordian knot of marriage may be cutfor me sooner or later. Death may befriend me in this matter, if nothing elsewill.' 'Death! Nonsense! I am not likely to die, nor are you. And I don't seewhat you want to get a separation for. I will go away for a time if vou like. Iwill make any nro- <pb n="268"/>' The Murder of Delicia 'Do you hear me?' herepeated querul- ously. 'I sha'n't say good-bye.'i She did not speak; her penmoved swiftly over the paper before her, but otherwise she never moved. 'I amsure it is no wonder,' he continued crossly, 'that the Government protestsagainst too much independence being allowed to women! What tyrants they wouldall be- come if they could have everything their own way as much as you can !Women ought to be gentle and submissive; and if they are fortunate enough to bewealthy, they ought to use their wealth for their husbands' benefit.

She looked as if during the past fewminutes she had risen above and beyond him to a purer atmosphere than that ofearth. The majority of men hate women who look so; and Carlyon was painfullyconscious that he had suddenly grown to hate Delicia. She had entirely changed,he thought. From a loving, tender idolator of his manly graces and perfections,she had become a proud, cynical, fault-finding, unforgiving 'virago.' Thislatter term did not suit her at all, but he considered that it did; for, asusual, by the aid of man's logic, he deemed himself the injured party and shethe injuring. And irritated beyond measure at the queenly tran- quillitv of herdemeanour, he muttered some- <pb n="270"/>CHAPTER XII NEXT day Delicia was tooweak and broken in body and spirit to leave her bedroom, which she had managedto reach by herself on recovering from her swoon. Her husband sent her a briefnote of farewell by one of the servants. He was leaving London im- mediatelyfor Paris, he said, and when all this nonsense had blown over,' he wouldreturn. Till then he was 'hers affectionately.' She crumpled the note in herhand and lay still, <pb n="271"/>The Murder of Delicia , finished! If I hadnever known the mean- ing of love; if I had never thought and believed thatlove was truly mine, how much better it would have been for me! I should haveworked on contentedly; I should not have missed what I had no experience of,and I might-yes, I might have been really great. Now there is no hope for anymore attainment-Love has murdered me !' She rested in bed all day, dozing anddreaming and thinking; all night between the slow-pacing hours she had longwaking in- tervals of strange, half-troubled, half-mystic musings. She sawherself, so she imagined, dead ;-laid out in her coffin with flowers round her;but as she looked at her own <pb n="272"/>/ The Murder of Delicla is not deadbecause of human treachery;' Love is immortal, unconquerable, unchange-. able,and waits for thee elsewhere, Delicia!' Come and see!' And so persistently wasshe haunted by the impression that something new and strange awaited her, thatalmost unconsciously to her- self she began to be expectant of a sudden changein her destinies, though what that change might be she could not by herselfdetermine. When she rose from her bed to resume her daily work an idea flashedupon her,-an idea bold and new, and suggesting itself forcibly for brief andbrilliant literary treatment. Seized by this fresh inspiration, she shut her- <pb n="273"/>TheMurder of Delicia l leaving cards which were not responded to, and 'society'began to whisper that 'it was rather singular, my dear, that Lord Carlyonshould suddenly have left London and gone by him- self to Paris, while thatextremely peculiar wife of his remained at home shut up as closely as if shehad the small-pox.' 'Per- haps she had the small-pox,' suggested the Noodlesection of opinion, deeming the remark witty. Whereupon Lady Brancewith,joining in the general chitter-chatter, ventured upon the scathing observationthat ' if she had, it would make her more popular in society, as no one couldthen be angry with her for her good looks.' Which suggestion was voted'charming' of Lady Brancewith; and <pb n="274"/>4 The Murder of Delicia themonotony of its joyless round-so that there ; was no one in town whom sheparticularly cared to see. And, like the enchanted 'Lady of Shalott,' she satin her own small study weav- ing her web of thought, or, as her husband hadonce put it, 'spinning cocoons.' Only on one special day was there a break inher self-imposed routine. This occurred when two elderly gentlemen ofbusiness-like demeanour arrived carrying small black bags. They were lawyers,and were shown up to the famous author's study at once, where they re- mainedin private converse with her for the greater part of the afternoon. When theycame down again to the dining- room, where wine and biscuits were prepared <pb n="275"/>TheMurder of Delicia h ( to say so, I congratulate you, Lady Carlyon, on yourstrength of mind. Had the other will remained in force, your hardly-earnedfortune would have soon been squandered.' She answered nothing. After a littlepause she spoke again. 'You quite understand that, in the event of my death,you yourself take possession of my last manuscript, and place it personally inthe hands of my publishers?' 'Quite so. Everything shall be carried out inexact accordance with your instructions.' 'You think,' she went onhesitatingly- 'that I have given him enough to live upon?' 'More thanenough-more than he deserves,' said the lnwver- 'Tn he the nn.eq.<nr of two              ><pb n="276"/>40 The Murder of Delicia Delicia, meditatively. 'Yes, I think it is sufficient.He cannot starve, and he is sure to marry again.' 'But you talk as if you weregoing to leave us at once and for ever, Lady Carlyon,' and the old lawyerlooked somewhat concerned as he observed the extreme pallor of her face and thefeverish splendour of her eyes. 'You will live for many and many a long day yetto enjoy the fruit of your own intellectual labours--' 'My dear sir, pray donot talk of my &quot;intellectual labours!&quot; In the opinion of my husbandand of men generally, especially unsuccessful men, these very labours haverendered me &quot;unsexed.&quot; I am not a woman <pb n="277"/>The Murder ofDelicia q5 had actually heard. Men are naturally fickle; and my experience isthat they always take benefits badly, thinking all good fortune their right.You made a mistake, I con- sider, to trust Lord Carlyon so completely.' 'Whatwould you have of me?' asked Delicia, simply. 'I loved him!' There followed asilence. Nothing could be said to this, and the two men of the law munchedtheir biscuits and drank their wine hastily, conscious of a sudden excitementstirring in them,-a strange impulse, moving them both to the desire ofthrashing Lord Carlyon, which would be an action totally inconsistent withlegal custom and procedure. But the sight of the fair, grave, patient .. . . .. . .. <pb n="278"/>1 The Murder of Delicia kindliness would have moved her,but now she was so strung up with feverish excite- ment and eagerness to finishthe work she had begun, that external things made very little impression uponher. She returned to her writing with renewed zest; Spartan was her chiefcompanion; and only her maid Emily began to notice how ill she was looking. Shehad intended to consult a doctor about her health; but, absorbed in her work,she put it off from day to day, promis- ing herself that she would do so whenher book was finished. She received no news whatever from her husband; he wastrying the effect of a lengthy absence and sustained silence on her always sensitivemind. <pb n="279"/>The Murder of Delicia S and deeply-thinking mind, which hadbeen hers in a very great degree before her marriage, when, as single-heartedDelicia Vaughan, she had astonished the world by her genius, came back to hernow, and the clouds of trouble and perplexity seemed suddenly to clear andleave her life as blank and calm and pure as though the shadow of a false lovehad never darkened it. The sun fell warmly across her desk, flickering over thepens and paper; and Spartan stretched himself full length in his usual place inthe window-nook with a deep sigh of absolute content. And with radiance in hereyes and a smile on her lips, Delicia sat down and wrote her ' conclusion.'

' He had committed no crime. Oh, no,' said society, beginning to waverin its former adora- tion of his manly perfections, 'but he broke his wife'sheart! Yes, that was it!

No one elsethought it in the least like him-but she did.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>She had all sorts of fancies about this husband of hers-fancies both prettyand passionatethough she had none about herself. She was only a worker; onewhom certain distinguished noodles on the Press were accustomed to sneer atfrom their unintellectual and impecunious standpoint as 'a lady novelist' notmeriting the name of 'author,' and who, despite sneers and coarse jesting, wasone of the most celebrated women of her time, as well as one of the wealthiest.The house she lived in, built from her own designs, furnished with every luxuryand filled with valuable pictures, curios and art-treasures, was one of thematerial results of her brilliant brain-work ; the perfectlyordered menage, theadmirably-trained servants, the famous 'table' at which many of London's mostfastidious gourmets had sat and gorged themselves to repletion, were all owingto her incessant and unwearying labour. She did everything; she paideverything, from the taxes down<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>2<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delici.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>to the wages of the scullery-maid ; she managed everything, from theadvantageous disposal of her own manuscripts down to the smallest detail oftaste and elegance connected with the dail, serving of her husband's dinner.She was ncve idle, and in all her literary efforts had never yet failed toscore a triumph above her compeers.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>As a writer, she stood quite apart from the rank and file of modernfictionists. Something of the spirit of the Immortals was in her blood -thespirit that moved Shakespeare, Shelley and Byron to proclaim truths in the faceof a world of lies-some sense of the responsibility and worth of Literature-andwith these emotions existed also the passionate desire to rouse and exalt herreaders to the perception of the things she herself knew and instinctively feltto be right and just for all time. The public responded to her voice and clamouredfor her work, and, as a natural result of this, all ambitious and aspiringpublishers were her very humble suppliants. Whatsoever munificent andglittering 'terms ' are dreamed of by authors in their wildest conceptions of aliterary El Dorado, were hers to command; and yet she was neither vain norgreedy.

Shewrote rapidly, and the small, well-shaped, whitc hand that guided the pen heldthat dangerous intellectual weapon firmly, with a close and somewhat defiantgrip, suggestive of the manner of a youthful warrior grasping a light spear andabout to hurl it in the face of a foe. Her very attitude in writing indicatedmental force and health ; no 'literary stoop' disfigured her supple back andshoulders, no sign of 'fag' or 'brainmuddle' clouded the thoughtful yetanimated expression of her features. Her eyes were bright, her cheeksdelicately flushed. She had no idea of her own poetic and unique loveliness,which was utterly unlike all the various admitted types of beauty in woman. Shescarcely knew that her eyes were of that divinely rare, dark violet colourwhich in certain lights looks almost black, that her skin was white as a<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>4<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>snowdrop, or that her hair, in its long, glistening masses of brown-gold,was a wonder and an envy to countless numbers of her sex who presentedthemselves to the shrewdly-grinning gaze of the world with dyed 'fronts' andfalse 'back coils.' She truly never thought of these things. She had grown tounderstand, from current 'smart' newspaper talk, that all authoresses, withoutexception, were bound to be judged as elderly and plain, even hideous, in thematter of looks, according to the accepted conventional standard of 'press'ethics, and though she was perfectly aware that she was young, and not asrepulsive in her personal appearance as she ought to be for the profession ofletters, she took very little trouble to assert herself, and made no attemptwhatever to ' show off her points,' as the slang parlance hath it, though those'points' outnumbered in variety and charm the usual attractions of attractivewomen. Admirers of her genius were too dazzled by that genius to see anythingbut the glow of the spiritual fire burning about her like the Deiphic flamesaround Apollo's priestess, and the dainty trifles of personality, which areordinarily all a woman has to boast of were in her case lost sight of.<o:p></o:p></p><p>; The Murder of Delici<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Compliments and flatteries, however, were distasteful to her, except when onrare occasions she received them from her husband. Then her sweet soul kindledwithin her into a warm glow of rapture and gratitude, and she wondered what shehad done to deserve praise from so lord1<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>and perfect a being.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>There was something very touching as well as beautiful in the way Deliciabent her proud intellect and prouder spirit to the will of her chosen mate. Forhim, and for him only, she strove to add fresh glory to the lustre of her name;for him she studied the art of dressing perfectly, loving best to drape herselfin soft white stuffs that clung in close, artistic folds round her light andlissom figure, and made her look like a Greuze or a Romney picture; for him shetook pains to twist the rich treasure of her hair in cunning braids andlove-locks manifold, arranging it in a soft cluster on her fair forehead afterthe fashion of the ancient Greeks, and scattering here and there one or twodelicate rings about her finely-veined temples, as golden suggestions of kissesto be pressed thereon. For him she cased her little feet in fascinatingbrodequins of deftest Paris make<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>r.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The .HrHrof I)CiCiLL.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>for him she moved like a sylph and smiled like an angel; for him she sang,when the evenings fell, old tender songs of love and home, in her rich, softcontralto; for him indeed she lived, breathed and-worked. She was the hivingbee-he the luxurious drone that ate the honey. And it never occurred to him toconsider the position as at all unnatural.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Certainly Delicia loved her work-of that there could be no doubt. Sheenjoyed it with every fibre of her being. She relished the keen competition ofthe literary arena, where her rivals, burning with jealousy, endeavoured vainlyto emulate her position ; and she valued her fame as the means of bringing herinto contact with all the leading men and women of her day. She was amused atthe small spites and envies of the malicious and unsuccessful, and maintainedher philosophical and classic composure under all the trumpery slights,ignorant censures and poor scandals put upon her by the less gifted of her ownsex. Her career was one of triumph, and being sane and healthy, she enjoyedthat triumph to the full. But more than triumph, more than fame or the rewardsof<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>fame, more indeed than all things in the world ever devised, measured orpossessed, she loved her husband,-a strange passion for a woman in these wilddays when matrimony is voted 'out of date' by certain theory-mongers, and a'nobleman' can be found ready to give a money-bribe to any couple ofnotoriety-hunters who will consent to be married in church according to theholy ordinance, and who will afterwards fling a boorish insult in the face ofReligion by protesting publicly against the ceremony. Delicia had been marriedthree years, and those three years had passed by like three glittering visionsof Paradise, glowing with light, colour, harmony and rapture. Only one griefhad clouded the pageant of her perfect joy, and this was the death of herchild, a tiny mortal of barely two months old, which had, as it were, droppedout of her arms like a withered blossom slain by sudden frost. Yet, toDelicia's dreamy and sensitive temperament, the sadness of this loss butdeepened her adoration for him round whom her brilliant life twined like aluxurious vine full of blossom and fruit-the strong, splendid, bold, athletic,masterful creature who was hers-hers only! For she knew-her<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>I<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>own heart told her this that no other woman shared his tenderness, and thatnever, never had his faith to her been shaken by so much as one unruly thought!<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>And thus it was that Delicia often said of herself that she was the happiestwoman in the world, and that her blessings were so many and so various that shewas ashamed to pray. 'For how can I, how dare I ask God for anything else whenI have so much?' she would inwardly reflect. 'Rather let me be constant in thegiving of thanks for all the joys so lavishly bestowed upon me, which I solittle deserve!' And she would work on with redoubled energy, striving afterperfection in all she did, and full of a strange ardour combined with a yet strangerhumility. She never looked upon her work as a trouble, and never envied thoseof her own sex whose absolute emptiness of useful occupation enabled them tofritter away their time in such 'delightful ' amusements as bicycling, rinking,skirt-dancing and other methods of man-hunting at present in vogue among thefair feminine animals whose sole aim of existence is marriage, and after that-nullity. Her temperament was eminently<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>9<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>practical as well as idealistic, and in tJe large amounts of money sheannually earned she never lost a penny by rash speculation or foolishexpenditure. Lavish in her hospitalities, she was never ostentatious, andthough perfect in her dress, she was never guilty of the wild and wickedextravagance to which many women in her position and with her means would haveyielded without taking a moment's thought. She carefully considered the needsof the poor, and helped them accordingly, in secret, and without the pettypresumption of placarding her charities to the woild through the medium of a 'bazaar' or hypocritical 'entertainment at the East End.' She felt the deeptruth of the saying, 'Unto whom much is given, even from him shall much berequired,' and gave her largesse with liberal tenderness and zeal. On one pointalone did she outrun the measure of prudence in the scattering of her wealth,and this was in the consideration of her husband. For him nothing was too good,nothing too luxurious, and any wish he expressed, even by the merest chance,she immediately set herself. with pride and joy, to gratify. As a matter offact, he had not really a penny to call his<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>I '<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia ;..<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>own, though his private banking account always showed a conveniently largesurplus, thanks to Delicia's unfailing care. Wilfred de Tracy Gifford Canyon,to give him all his names in full, was an officer in the Guards, the youngerson of a nobleman who had, after a career of wild extravagance, died abankrupt. He had no other profession than the military, and though a man ofgood blood and distinguished descent, he was absolutely devoid of all ambition,save a desire to have his surname pronounced correctly. 'Carlee-on,' he wouldsay with polite emphasis, 'not Car-ly-on. Our name is an old, historical one,and like many of its class is spelt one way and pronounced another.'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Now, without ambition, the human organisation becomes rather like a heavycart stuck fast in the mud-rut it has made for itself, and it frequently needsa strong horse to move it and set it jogging on again. In this case, Deliciawas the horse; or, to put it more justly, the high-spirited mare, gallopingswiftly along an open road to a destined end, and scarcely conscious of thecart she drew at such a rattling pace behind her. How indignant<o:p></o:p></p><p>''' The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>she would have been had she overheard any profane person using thisirreverent cart simile in connection with her one supremely Beloved! Yet suchwas the true position of things as recognised by most people around her; andonly he and she were blind to the disproportionate features of their union ;she with the rare and beautiful blindness of perfect love, he with the commonevery-day blindness of male egotism.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>That he had exceptional attractions of his own wherewith to captivate andsubdue the fair sex was beyond all question. The qualities of 'race,' derivedfrom a long ancestral line of warriors and statesmen, had blossomed out in himphysically if not mentally. He had a fine, admirablymoulded figure, fit for aTheseus or a Hercules, a handsome face and a dulcet voice, rich with manygradations of persuasive and eloquent tone. Armed with these weapons ofconquest, he met Delicia at the moment when her small foot had touched thetopmost peak of Fame, and when all the sharp thorns and icicles of the strangecrown wherewith Art rewards her chosen children were freshly set among hermaiden hair. Society thought her<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>a chilly vestal-shrank from her, indeed, somewhat in vague fear; for herdivine, violet eyes had a straight way of looking through thecunningly-contrived mask of the social liar, and, like the 'Röntgen rays,'taking a full impression of the ugly devil behind it. Society refused torecognise her ethereal and half elfin type of beauty. It 'could see nothing inher.' She was to it 'a curious sort of woman, difficult to get on with,'-andbehind her back it said of her the usual mysterious nothings, such as, 'Ah! onenever knows what those kind of persons are!' or, 'Who was she?' and, 'Wheredoes she get her strange ideas from?' -slobbering its five o'clock tea andmunching its watercress sandwiches over these scrappy suggestions of scandalwith a fine relish only known to the 'upper class' matron and the Whitechapelwasherwoman. For however much apart these two feminine potentialities may be incaste, they are absolutely one in their love of low gossip and slander.Nevertheless, the dashing Guards officer, who H had been flung into anexpensive regiment at the reckless whim of his late father, found severalengaging qualities in Delicia, which appealed to 13<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>him partly on account of their rarity, and partly because he, personally,had never been able to believe any woman capable of possessing them. Perhapsthe first of the various unique characteristics he recognised in her, andmarvelled at, was her total lack of vanity. He had never in all his life beforemet a pretty woman who attached so little importance to her own good looks; andhe had certainly never come across a really 'famous' personage who wore the laurelsof renown so unconsciously and unassumingly. He had once in his life had thehonour of shaking hands with an exceedingly stout and florid poetess, who spokein a deep, masculine voice, and asked him what he thought of. her last book,which, by-the-bye, he had never heard of, and he had also lunched in thedistinguished company of a 'sexual fictionist,' a very dirty anddyspeptic-looking man, who had talked of nothing else but the excellence andvirtue of his own unsavoury productions all through the course of the meal. ButDelicia !-Delicia, the envy of all the struggling, crowding climbers upParnassus,-the living embodiment of an almost phenomenal triumph in art andletters<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>) 4<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia .<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Delicia said nothing about herself at all. She assumed no 'airs ofsuperiority;' she talked amusing trifles like other less brilliant and morefrivolous people; she was even patient with the ubiquitous 'society idiot,' anddrew him out with a tactful charm which enabled him to display all his most glaringpoints to perfection; but when anyone began to praise her gifts of authorship,or ventured to comment on the wide power and influence she had attained throughher writings, she turned the conversation instantly, without brusquerie butwith a gentle firmness that won for her the involuntary respect of even theflippant and profane.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>This unpretentious conduct of hers, so exceptional in 'celebrities,' who, inthese days of pushand-scramble have no scruples about giving themselves what iscalled in modern parlance 'any amount of side,' rather astonished the gallant'Beauty Canyon,' as he was sometimes nicknamed by his fellow officers; and, asit is necessary to analyse his feelings thoroughly, it must also be concededthat another of his sensations on being introduced<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>to the woman whose opinions and writings<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'5<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>- '-1<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>were the talk of London, was one of unmitigated admiration mingled with envyat the thought of the fortune she had made and was still making. What !-soslight a creature, whose waist he could span with his two hands, whose slenderneck could be wrung as easily as that of a singing-bird, and whose head seemedtoo small for its glistening weight of gold hair-she, to be the possessor of aname and fame reaching throughout every part of the British Empire, and faracross the wide Atlantic, and the independent mistress of such wealth as madehis impecunious mouth water! Ten thousand pounds for her last book!-paid downwithout a murmur, even before the work was finished !-surely 'these beexcellent qualities,' he mused within himself, afterwards falling into a stillmore profound reverie when he heard on unimpeachable authority that theroyalties alone on her already-published works brought her in an income of overfive thousand a year. Her first book had been produced when she was butseventeen, though she had feigned, when asked, to be several years older, inorder to ensure attention from publishers; and she had gone on steadily risingin the<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>0<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>scale of success till now-when she was twentyseven, and famous with a famesurpassing that of all her men contemporaries. No doubt much money had been putby during those ten triumphal years<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Taking all these matters into consideration, it was not to be wondered atthat the penniless Guardsman thought often and deeply concerning thepossibilities and advantages of Delicia as a wife, and that, during the time heformed one of the house-party among whose members she was the most honouredguest, he should seize every opportunity of making himself agreeable to her. Hebegan to study her from a physical point of view, and very soon discovered inher a charm which was totally unlike the ordinary attractiveness of ordinarywomen. In strict fairness to him, it must be admitted that his realisation ofDelicia's fine and delicate nature was due to distinctly sincere feeling on hispart, and was not inspired by any ulterior thought of Mammon. He liked the wayshe moved ; her suave, soft step and the graceful fold and flow of her garmentspleased him; and once, when she raised her eyes suddenly to his in quickresponse to some question, he<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>B 17<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>was startled and thrilled by the glamour and sweet witchery of those darkpurple orbs, sparkling with such light as can only be kindled from a puresoul's fire. Gradually he, six feet of man, nobly proportioned, with a headwhich might be justly termI classic, even heroic, though it lacked certainbumps which phrenology deems desirable for human perfectionfell desperately inlove, and here his condition must be very positively emphasised, lest theslightest doubt be entertained of it hereafter. To speak poetically, the feverof love consumed him with extraordinary violence night and day ; and thestrongest form of that passion known to men, namely, the covetous greed ofpossession, roused him to the employment of all his faculties in the task ofsubduing the Dian - like coldness and crystalline composure of Delicia'soutward seeming nature to that tenderness and warmth so eminently desirable ina woman who is, according to the dictum of old Genesis, meant to be a man'shelpmate, though the antique record does not say she is to be so far helpful asto support him altogether.

When the Beautiful Sullenness wasupon him he had a very noble appearance; the delicate, proud curve of his upperlip was prominent,-his long, silky lashes, darkly drooping, gave a shadow ofstern sweetness to his eyes<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>and Delicia, glancing at him timidly, would feel her heart beat fast, likethe fluttering wing of a frightened bird, if he chanced to raise those eyesfrom their musing gloom and fix them halfardently, half-reproachfully on herface. As for the Dark Despair, the sublimity of aspect he managed to attain inthat particular mood could never be described in ordinary language ; perhaps,in the world's choicest galleries of art, one might find such a wronged andsuffering greatness in the countenance of one of the sculptured gods or heroes,but surely not elsewhere. However, it was the Passionate<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>0utbreak,-the lightning-like fury and determm<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>iof mere manhood, springing forth despite the man himself, and making havocof all his preconceived intentions, that won his<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'9<o:p></o:p></p><p>' The-Murder-of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>cause for him at last. The moment camethe one moment which, truly speaking,comes but once to any human life; the pre-ordained, divine moment, brief as thesparkle of foam on a breaking wave,-the glimpse of Heaven that vanishes almostbefore we have looked upon it. It was a night never to be forgottenby Delicia,at least; a night when Shakespeare's elves might have been abroad, playingmischief with the flowers and scattering wonder-working charms upon the airatrue 'Midsummer Night's Dream' which descended, full-visioned in silverluminance, straight from Paradise for Delicia's sake. She was, at that time,the guest of certain 'great' people; the kind of 'great' who say they 'musthave a celebrity or two, you know !-they are such queer, dear things!'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Delicia, as a 'queer, dear thing,' was one of the celebrities thusentertained, and Pablo de Sarasate, also as a 'queer, dear thing,' was another.A number of titled and 'highlyconnected' personages, who had the merit of being'queer' without being in the least 'dear,' made up the rest of the party. Theplace they were staying at was a lordly pile, anciently the 'summer pleasaunce'and favourite resort of a<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>20<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder _of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>great Norman baron in the days of Richard the Lion-hearted, and the groundsextending round and about it were of that deep-shadowed, smooth-lawned andbeautifully sylvan character which only the gardens of old, historic Englishhomes possess. Up and down, between a double hedge of roses, and under theradiance of a golden harvest moon, Delicia moved slowly with Carlyon at herside; and from the open drawing-room windows of the house floated the pure,penetrating voice of Sarasate's violin. Something mystic in the air ; somethingsubtle in the scent of the roses; a stray flash of light on the falling dropsof the fountain close by, which perpetually built and unbuilt again itsglittering cupola of spray, or some other little nothing of the hour, broughtboth man and woman to a sudden pause,-a conscious pause, in which they eachfancied they could hear their own hearts beating loudly above the music of thedistant violin. And the man,-the elected son of Mars, who had never yet liftedhis manhood to the height of battle, there to confront horror upon horror,shock upon shock,-now sprang up full-armed in the lists of love, and, strongwith a strength he had hardly been aware<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>of as existing in himself before, he swiftly and boldly grasped his prize.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Delicia P he whispered-' Delicia, I love you!'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>There was no audible answer. Sarasate's violin discoursed suitablelove-passages, and the moon smiled as if she would have spoken, but Delicia wassilent. She had no need of speech -her eyes were sufficiently eloquent. Shefelt herself drawn with a passionate force into her lover's strong arms, andclasped firmly, even jealously, to his broad breast; and like a dove, whichafter long journeyings finds its home at last, she thought she had found hers,and folding her spirit-wings, she nestled in and was content.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Clinging to this great and generous protector who thus assumed theguardianship of her life, she marvelled innocently at her own good fortune, andasked herself what she had done to deserve such ineffable happiness. And he? Hetoo, at this particular juncture, may be given credit for nobler emotions thanthose which ordinarily swayed him. He was really very much in love; and Love,for the time being, governed his nature and made him a<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>22<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia i<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>less selfish man than usual. When he held Delicia in his arms, and kissedher dewy lips and fragrant hair for the first time, he was filled with astrange ecstasy, such as might have moved the soul of Adam when, on rising fromdeep sleep, he found embodied Beauty by his side as ' helpmeet' through hislife for ever. He was conscious that in Delicia he had won not only a sweetwoman, but a rare intelligence<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>a spirit far above the average,-a character tempered and trained to finestissues,-and from day to day he studied the grace of her form, the fairness ofher skin, the lustre of her eyes, with an ever-deepening intensity of delightwhich imparted a burning, masterful ardour to the manner of his wooing, andbrought her whole nature into a half-timid, halfjoyous subjection - the kind ofsubjection which might impel a great queen to take off her crown and lay it atthe feet of some splendid warrior, in order that he might share her throne andkingdom. And in this case the splendid warrior was only too ready to accept theoffered sovereignty. Certainly he loved Delicia ; loved her with very real andalmost fierce passion,-the passion that leaps up<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>23<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>like a tall, bright flame, and dies down to a dull ember; but he couldhardly be altogether insensible to the advantages he personally gained byloving her. He could not but exult at the thought that he, with nothing but hishandsome appearance and good birth to recommend him, had won this woman whosevery name was a lode-star of intellectual attraction over half the habitableglobe, and, in the very midst of the ardent caresses he lavished upon her, hewas unable to entirely forget the fortune she had made, and which she wasadding to every day. Then she was charming in herself, too-lovely, though notat all so according to the accepted 'musichall' standard of height and fleshyprominence ; she was more like the poet's dream of 'Kilmeny in Fairyland' thanthe 'beauty' of eighteenpenny-photograph fame; but she was, as Carlyon himselfsaid, 'as natural as a rose-no paint, no dye, no purchased hair cut from theheads of female convicts, no sickly perfumes, no padding, nothing in the leastartificial about her.' And hearing this, his particular ' chum' in the GuardsClub said,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Lucky dog! You don't deserve such a &quot;draw&quot; in the matrimoniallottery !'<o:p></o:p></p><p>The-Murder-of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>And Canyon, smiling a superior smile, looked in a conveniently hear mirror,and replied,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Perhaps not! But-'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>A flash of the fine eyes, and a touch of the Beautiful Sullenness mannerfinished the sentence. It was evident that the gallant officer was not at allin doubt as to his own value, however much other folks might be disposed toconsider the pecuniary and other advantages of his marriage as altogetherexceeding his merits.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Yet, on the whole, most people, with that idiotic inconsistency whichcharacterises the general social swarm, actually pitied him when they heardwhat was going to happen. They made round eyes of astonishment, shook theirheads and said, 'Poor Carlyon !' Why they made round eyes or shook their heads,they could not themselves have explained, but they did so. 'Poor,' Canyoncertainly was ; and his tailor's bill was an appalling one. But 'they,'-thefive-o'clock-tea gossips, knew nothing about the tailor's bill-that was aprivate affair,-one of those indecent commonplaces of life which are more orless offensive to persons of high distinction, who always find something<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>2<o:p></o:p></p><p>409 The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>curiously degrading in paying their tradesmen. 'They' saw Canyon as heappeared to themsuperb of stature, proud of bearing, and Greekly 'god-like' offeature-and that he was always irreproachably dressed was sufficient for them,though not for the unpaid tailor who fitted him so admirably. Looking at him inall his glory, 'they' shuddered at the thought that he-this splendid specimenof manhood-was actually going to marry a-what?<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'A novelist, my dear ! just think of it !' feebly screamed Mrs Tooksey overher Queen Anne silver teapot.

'Authoresses always are, aren't they?<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'This one isn't,' put in the One Man, who through some persecuting fatealways manages to turn up in a jaded and gloomy condition at these kind of'afternoon teas.' 'She's pretty. That's the worst of it. Of course she'll leadCarlyon a devil of a life!'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Of course!' groaned Mrs Snooksey and Mrs Tooksey in melancholy duet. 'Whatelse can you expect of a-of a public character? Poor, dear Carlyon!

The marriage of a Guards officer isalways a pretty sight, but when the fame of Delicia was added to the<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>27<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>fame of the regiment, it was no wonder the affair created a sensation and aflutter in the world of fashionable news and ladies' pictorials. Deliciaastonished and irritated several members of her own sex by the extremesimplicity of her dress on the occasion. She always managed somehow, quiteunintentionally, to astonish and irritate her sweet 'sisters' in womanhood,who, forced to admit her intellectual superiority to themselves, loved heraccordingly. Thus her very wedding garment was an affront to them, being only aclassic gown of softly-draped white silk crépe-de-chine, without any adornmentof either lace or flowers. Then her bridal veil was a vexatious thing, becauseit was so unusually becoming-it was made of white chiffon, and draped her, likea moonlight mist, from head to foot, a slender chaplet of real orangeblossomsbeing worn with it. And that was all-no jewels, no bouquet-she only carried asmall ivory prayerbook with a plain gold cross mounted on the cover. She lookedthe very picture of a Greek vestal virgin, but in the eyes of the fashion-platemakers there was a deplorable lack of millinery about her. What would God thinkof it Could anything be<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>28<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>more irreverent than for a woman of position and fortune to take her marriage-vowsbefore the altar of the Most High without wearing either a court train ordiamonds! And the bridesmaids made no great 'show'-they were only little girls,none of them over ten years of age. There were eight of these small damsels,clad in blush-pink like human roses, and very sweet they looked following thelissom, whiteveiled form of Delicia as she moved with her own peculiarlygraceful step and ethereal air between the admiring rows of the selected men ofher husband's regiment, who lined either side of the chancel in honour of theoccasion. The ceremony was brief; but those who were present somehow felt it tobe singularly impressive. There was a faint suggestion of incongruity in thebridegroom's eloquently-pronounced declaration-' With all my worldly goods Ithee endow,' which provoked one of his brother officers to profanely whisper inthe ear of a friend, 'By Jove! I don't think he's got anything to give her buthis hair-brushes. They were a present; but most of his other things are on tick!'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>This young gentleman's unbecoming observations were promptly quashed, andthe holy<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>29<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delici<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>ordinance was concluded to the crashing strains of Mendelssohn. Aconsiderably large crowd, moved by feelings of sincere appreciation for theunion of the professions of War and Literature, waited outside the church togive the bride a cheer as she stepped into her carriage, and some of them,hustling a little in advance of the policemen on duty, and peering up towardsthe entrance of the sacred edifice, were rewarded by seeing the MostDistinguished Personage in the realm, smiling his ever-cordial smile, andshaking hands with the fair 'celebrity' just wedded. At this sight a deafeningnoise broke out from the throats of the honest 'masses,' a noise which becamealmost tumultuous when the Distinguished Personage walked by the side of thenewlymarried pair down the red-carpeted pavement from the church to the nuptialcarriagedoor, and lifted his hat again and again to the 'huzzas' which greetedhim. But the Distinguished Personage did not get all the applause by any means.Delicia got the most of it, and many of the crowd pelted her with flowers whichthey had brought with them for the purpose. For she was one of the few<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>30<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of_Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'beloved women' that at rare intervals are born to influence nations-so fewthey are and so precious in their lives and examples that it is little wondernations make much of them when they find them. There were people in the crowdthat day who had wept and smiled over Delicia's writings, and who had, throughher teaching, grown better, happier and more humane men and women ; and therewas a certain loving jealousy in these which grudged that she should stoop fromher lofty height of fame, to marry, like any other ordinary woman. They wouldhave had her exempt from the common lot, and yet they all desired herhappiness. So in half-gladness, half-regret, they cheered her and threw rosesand lilies at her, for it was the month of June; and she with her veil thrownback, and the sunshine glinting on her gold hair, smiled bewitchingly as shebowed right and left to the clamorous throng of her assembled admirers; then,with her glorious six feet of husband, she stepped into her carriage and droveaway to the sound of a final cheer. The Distinguished Personage got into hisbrougham and departed. The brilliantly-attired guests dispcrsed slowly,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>3'<o:p></o:p></p><p>'IThe Murder of Delici:i<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>and with much chatting and gaiety, in their different directions, and allwas over. And the One Man whose earthly lot it was to appear at various'afternoon teas,' stood under the church portico and muttered gloomily to anacquaintance,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Fancy that simple-looking creature being actually the famous DeliciaVaughan !

The verger of the church came out, glowered suspiciously atstragglers, picked up a few bridal flowers from the red carpet, and shut thechurch gates. There had been a wedding, he said condescendingly to one or twonursemaids who had just arrived breathlessly on the scene, wheelingperambulators in front of them, but it was over; the company had gone home. TheDistinguished Personage had gone home too. Thus there was nothing to see, andnothing to wait for. Depart, disappointed nursemaids! The vow that binds two inone-that ties Intellect to Folly, Purity to Sensuality, Unselfishness toEgotism-has been taken before the Eternal ; and, so far as we can tell, theEternal has accepted it.

Happiness had made the time fly on swift wings, and her dream oflove had as yet lost nothing of its heavenly glamour. Her marriage had causedno very perceptible change in her fortunes - she worked a little harder andmore incessantly, that was all. Her husband deserved all the luxuries andenjoyments of life that she could give him-so she considered-and she wasdetermined he should never have to complain of her lack of energy. Her famesteadily increasedshe was at the very head and front of her profession-peoplecame from far and near to have the privilege of seeing her and speaking withher, if only for a few minutes. But popular admiration was nothing to her, andshe attached no importance whatever to the daily tributes she received, fromall parts of the world, testifying to her genius and the influence her writingshad upon the minds of thousands. Such things passed her by as the merest idlewind of rumour, and all her interests were concentrated on her work-first, forthe work's own sake, and next, that she might be a continual glory andexhaustless gold mine to her husband.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Certainly Canyon had nothing to desire or to<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>34<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia .<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>complain of in his destiny.

Delicia neverplayed the domestic tyrant over him ; he was free to do as he liked, go wherehe would and see whom he chose. She never catechised him as to the nature ofhis occupations or amusements, and he, on his part, was wise enough to draw aline between a certain 'fast set' he personally favoured, and the kind ofpeople he introduced to her, knowing well enough that were he to commit thefolly of bringing some 'shady' character within his wife's circle ofacquaintance, it would be only once that the presence of such a person would betolerated by her.

Unable to obtain admittance to her house, they took refuge in scandal, andinvented 1i and slanders concerning her, all of which fell flat owing to herfrankly open life of domestic peace and contentment. Sneers and false rumourswere inserted about her in the journals; she ignored them, and quietly livedthem down, till finally the worst thing anyone could find to say of her wasthat she was 'idiotically in love' with her own husband.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'She's a perfect fool about him!' exclaimed the Tookseys and Snookseys,angrily.

Hedrove 'tandem' in the Row with two of the most superb horses ever seen in thatfashionable thoroughfare. In the early spring mornings he was seen cantering upand down on a magnificent Arab, which for breed and action was the envy ofprinces. He had his own four-in-hand coach, which he drove to Ranelagh, Hurlingham,and the various race meetings of the year, with a party of 'select' people ontop-the kind of 'select' whom Delicja never knew or cared to know, consistingof actresses, betting men, 'swells 37<o:p></o:p></p><p>-09 The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>about town,' and a sprinkling of titled dames, who had frankly thrown overtheir husbands in order to drink brandy privately, and play the female Don Juanpublicly.

But it is a man's privilege to entertain himself in his own fashion,even with &quot;odd&quot; people if he likes. &quot;Odd&quot; people are alwaysinfinitely diverting, owing to their never being able to recognise their ownabnormal absurdity.

And on the morning when the sunshine placed a crown on her head, andhurled a javelin of light full in the cold eyes of the marble Antinous, she wasin one of her brightest, most radiant moods, satisfied with her lot, gratefulfor the blessings which she considered were so numerous, and as unconscious asever that there was anything upside down in the arrangement which had resultedin her being obliged to 'love, honour, obey,' keep, and clothe, six feet ofbeautiful man, by her own unassisted toil, while the said six feet of beautifulman did nothing but enjoy himself.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>The quaint' Empire' clock, shaped as a world,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>40<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>with a little god of love pointing to the hours numbered on its surface,chimed two from its golden bracket on the wall before she laid down her pen forthe day.

Sheread their thoughts and smiled, but did not care. She reserved her salutationsfor Royalty itself, not for the imitation of it. And now that she was a'ladyship,' she obtained a good deal of amusement out of the study of characteramong her various ' friends' who envied and grudged her the trumpery honour. TheTookseys and Snookseys of society could scarcely contain themselves for spitewhen they learned that for the future they would have to speak of the 'femaleauthoress' as Lady Canyon. The Casual Caller and the One Man began to allude toher as 'Delicia, Lady Canyon,' rolling the sweet, quaint name of 'Delicia' ontheir tongues with a keener sense of enjoyment than usual in its delicateflavour, thereby driving the Tookseys and Snookseys into a more feverishcondition then ever.

Everything she didwas watched and commented upon-her manners, her dress, her gestures, the veryturn of her head, and the slow, supple movements of her body. And society wasfor ever on the lookout for a glance, a sigh, a word which might indicate the'dropping of the handkerchief' to Paul Valdis. But the closest espionage failedto discover anything compromising in Delicia's way of life or daily conduct.This caused the fury of the Tookseys and Snookseys to rage unabatedly, while,so far as Delicia herself was concerned, she had no thought beyond the usual twosubjects which absorbed her existence-her work and her husband.

Now and thenhe became gloomy and curt of speech, and at such moments, Mrs Lefroy, watchinghim, felt that she would have given worlds to stay on and hide herselfsomewhere behind a curtain that she might see how he was going to comporthimself after the gabbling crowd had gone. But she had already stayed more thanan hour-she would get no more chance of talking to Dlicia -she was obliged togo home and dress for a dinner-party that evening ; so finally she reluctantlymade the best of a bad business, and glided up to her hostess to say good-bye.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'So sorry to be going!' she murmured.

Her artistic eye quickly took noteof the attractive points of his face and figure, and, with the perception of astudent of character, she appreciated the firm and manly lines of thewell-shaped hand that rested on Spartan's head, but it was with the admirationwhich she would have given to a fine picture more readily than to a livingbeing. Something, however, troubled her as she looked, for she saw that he wassuppressing some strong emotion in her presence, and her first thought was thatthe English version of 'Ernani' was going to prove a failure.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'You speak bitterly, Mr Valdis,' she said, after a pause, 'and yet you oughtnot to do so, considering the brilliancy of your position and your immensepopularity.'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Does a brilliant position and immense popu<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>64<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>larity satisfy a man, do you think?' he asked, not looking at her, butkeeping his gaze on the honest brown eyes of Spartan, who, with the quaintconceit of a handsome dog who knows his own value, vent on wagging his tail,under the impression that the conversation was addressed to him alone. 'ThoughI suppose it ought to satisfy an actor, who, by some folks, is consideredhardly a man at all.

'Ah, but I cannot quite agreewith you!

And that is why I consider onecannot be too grateful for a little kindness from one's fellow-creatures whileone is living; though, if you ask the Press people, they will tell you it's avery bad sign of your quality as an author if you succeed.

What would Lord Canyon be without you, evenwere he twenty times a lord! He owes everything to you, and to your brain work;he is nothing in himself, and less than nothing!

Delicia was deeply displeased ; yet with herdispleasure there was mingled a vague sense of uneasiness and fear. She foundit difficult to maintain her selfpossession; there was something in the defiantlook and attitude of Valdis that almost moved her to give way to a sudden,undignified outburst of anger. She was tempted to cry out to him, 'What is ityou are hiding from me There is something-tell me all you know!'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>But she bit her lips hard, and laid her hand on Spartan's collar to somewhatconceal its trembling.

The simple words were hisdismissal, and he knew it. Because he had, in that unguarded moment, spoken aword in dispraise of the glorious six feet of husband, the doors of Delicia'shouse would henceforth be closed to him, and the fair presence of Dliciaherself would be denied to his sight. It was a blow-but he was a man, and hetook his punishment manfully.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Good-bye, Lady Canyon,' lie said.

But hedesperately caught that hand, and kissed it with the ardour of an Ernani andRomeo intermingled, then he turned and left the room. Delicia listened to hisretreating footsteps as he descended the stairs and passed into the hall below,then she heard the street door close. A great sigh of relief broke from herlips ; he was gone,-this impertinent actor who had presumed to say<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>that her husband was 'nothing, and less than nothing '-he was gone, and hewould probably never come back. She looked down at Spartan, and found the dog'seyes were turned up to hers in inquiring wonder and sadness. As plainly as anyanimal could speak by mere expression, he was saying,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'AThat is the matter with Valdis?

It was a tear,-a bright tear, fallen from thebeautiful eyes of his mistress,_' in anxious haste he pressed his rough bodyclose against her with a mute caress of inquiring sympathy. In very truthDelicia was crying,-quietly and in a secret way, as though ashamed toacknowledge her emotion even to herself. As a rule, she liked to be able togive a reason for her feelings, but on this occasion she found it impossible tomake any analysis of the cause of her tears. Yet they fell fast, and she wipedthem away quickly with a little filmy handkerchief as fine as a cobweb, whichSpartan, moved by a sudden desire to provide her with some harmless distractionfrom melancholy, made uncouth attempts to secure as a plaything. He succeededso far in his clumsy gambols as to bring the flicker of a smile on her face atlast, whereat he rejoiced exceedingly, and wagged his tail with a violence thatthreatened to entirely dislocate that useful member. In a few minutes she wasquite herself again, and when her husband returned to dinner, met him with theusual beautiful composure that always distinguished her bearing, though therewas an air of thoughtful resolve 73<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>about her which accentuated the delicate lines of her features and made herlook more intellectually classic than ever. When she took her seat at tablethat evening, her statuesque serenity, combined with her fair face, steadfasteyes, and rich hair knotted loosely at the back of her well-shaped head, gaveher so much the aspect of something far superior to the ordinary run of mortalwomen, that Canyon, fresh from a game of baccarat, where he had lost over threehundred pounds in a couple of hours, was conscious of a smarting sense ofundefinable annoyance.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>I wish you could keep our name out of the papers,' he said suddenly, whendessert was placed before them, and the servants had withdrawn; 'it is mostannoying to me to see it constantly cropping up in all manner of vulgar societyparagraphs.'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>She looked at him steadfastly.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'You used not to mind it so much,' she answered, 'but I am sorry you arevexed.

Delicia, meantime, went todress for the Premier's reception, and soon slipped into the robe she had haddesigned for herself by a famous firm of Indian embroiderers-a garment ofsoftest white satin, adorned with gold and<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>silver thread, and pearls thickly intertwined, so as to present theappearance of a mass of finelywrought jewels.

The opinions of the 'Bohemian,'-the airilyidiotic theories with which the members disported themselves, and furnishedfood for laughter to the profane-were occasionally quoted in the newspapers,which of course gave the club a certain amount of importance in its own eyes,if in nobody else's. And the committee put on what is called a considerableamount of 'side'; now and then affecting to honour some halfand-half celebrityby asking him to a FiveShilling dinner, and dubbing him the 'guest of theevening,' he meantime gloomily taking note of the half-cold, badly-cookedpoorness of the meal, and debating within himself whether it would be possibleto get away in time to have a chop 'from the grill' somewhere on his way home.The 'Bohemian' had been a long time getting started, owing to the manner inwhich the gentlemen who were 'in' persistently black-balled every new aspirantfor the honours of membership. The cause of this arose from the chronic stateof nervous jealousy in which the 'Bohemians' lived. To a certain extent and asfar as their personal animosities would permit, they were a ' MutualAdmiratioti 89<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Society,' and dreaded the intrusion of any stranger who might set himself todiscover 'their tricks and their manners.' They had a lawyer of their own,whose business it was to arrange the disputes of the club, should occasionrequire his services, and they also had a doctor, a humorous and very cleverlittle man, who was fond of strolling about the premises in the evening, andtaking notes for the writing of a medical treatise to he entitled 'LiteraryDyspepia, and the Passion of Envy considered in its Action on the Spleen andOther Vital Organs,' a book which he justly considered would excite a greatdeal of interest among his professional compeers.

The greateditor of the journal, being half his time away shooting, golfing, or otherwiseamusing himself, didn't know anything about either Grovelyn or Brown, anddidn't care. And the public, seeing Grovelyn described as a Shakespeare,promptly concluded he must be a humbug, and avoided his books as cautiously asthough they had been labelled 'Poison.' Hence Brown - Aubrey - Grovelyn'schronic yellow melancholy-his poems wouldn't 'sell.'

She had a whole list of orders to execute for him, from cravatsand hosiery up to a new and expensive 'coach-luncheonbasket,' to which he hadtaken a sudden fancy ; and besides this, she was looking about in all thejeweller's shops for some tasteful and valuable thing to give him as a souvenirof the approaching anniversary of their marriage day. Pausing at last in frontof one glittering window, she saw a rather quaint set of cuff-studs which shethought might possibly answer her purpose, and she went inside the shop toexamine them more closely. The jeweller, not knowing her personally, butjudging from the indifferent way in which she took the announcement<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>107<o:p></o:p></p><p>oç The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>of his rather stiff prices, that she must be a tolerably rich woman, beganto show her some of his most costly pieces of workmanship, hoping thereby totempt her into the purchase of something for herself. She had no very greatlove for jewels, but she had for artistic design, and she gratified thejeweller by her intelligent praise of some particularly choice bits, the meritsof which could only be fully recognised by a quick eye and cultivated taste.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'That is a charming pendant,' she said, taking up a velvet case, in whichrested a dove with outspread wings, made of the finest diamonds, carrying inits beak the facsimile of a folded letter in finely-wrought gold, with thewords, 'Je t'adore ma mie!' set upon it in lustrous rubies. 'The idea isgraceful in itself, and admirably carried out.'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>The jeweller smiled.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Ah, that's a very unique thing,' he said,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>but it's not for sale.

And in another minute she smiled at herself, wonderingwhy she had been so startled, for, of course, her husband had ordered thispretty piece of jewellery as a gift for her, on the very anniversary she waspreparing to celebrate by a gift to him! Meanwhile the jeweller, who was of anopen mind, and rather fond of confiding bits of gossip to stray customers, tookthe diamond dove out of its satin-lined nest, and held it up in the sunlight toshow the lustre of the stones.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'It's a lovely design ! ' he said enthusiastically; 'It will cost LordCanyon a little over five hundred pounds. But gentlemen of his sort never mindwhat they pay, so long as they can please the lady they are after.

'Well, now, as a matter of fact, in our trade,when we get special orders from gentlemen for valuable jewels, they are neverby any chance intended for the gentlemen's wives.

However, there's no accounting fortastes. I suppose Lady Carlyon's too clever, or else plain in her personalappearance ; and that's why this diamond dove is going to La Marina instead ofto her.

The fashionablepageant of the Park 'season' seemed to her a mere chaotic whirl ; and severaleager admirers of her beauty and her genius raised their hats to her invain-she never perceived them. A curious numbness had crept over her; shewondered, as she felt the movement of the carriage, whether it was not ahearse, and she the dead body within it being carried to her grave ! Then,quite suddenly, she raised herself and sat upright, glancing about at the richfoliage of the trees, the gay flower-beds and the up-anddown moving throng ofpeople; a bright flush reddened her face, which for the past few minutes hadbeen deadly pale, and as two or three of her acquaintances passed her in theircarriages or on foot, she saluted them with her usual graceful air of mingledpride and sweetness, and seemed almost herself again. But she was not long ableto endure the strain she put upon her nerves, and after one or two turns in theRow, she bade her coachman drive home. &quot;4<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia &quot;o.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Arrived there, she found a telegram from her husband, running thus<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Shall not return to dinner.

She had been trained, or rather, she had trainedherself, in the splendid school of classic philosophy; and in addition to this,she was a devout Christian, one of the oldworld type, who would have willinglyendured martyrdom for the faith had it been necessary. She was not achurch_goer, and she belonged to no special 'sect;' she had no vulgar vices tohide by an ostentatious display of public charities, but she had the mostabsolute and passionate belief in, and love for Christ, as the one DivineMessenger from God to man; and now she was bringing both her faith and herphilosophic theories to bear on the present unexpected crisis in her life.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'If I were a low woman, a vulgar woman, a virago in domestic life, or whatthe French call une femme impossible, I could understand his seeking a changefrom my detestable company anywhere and everywhere,' she mentally argued; 'butas things are, what have I done ii6<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>that he should descend from me to La Marina?

That is, she had drunk a great deal more champagnethan was good for her, and had afterwards exhibited a tendency to throw wineglasses at her admirers.

Itwas really too bad!-enough to sting the lofty spirit of a Canyon! And such isthe curious self-pity and egotism of some men at their worst, that 'hislordship' felt himself to be a positively injured man as he settled his'god-like' head upon his lonely pillow, and fell into an uneasy slumber,disturbed by very unpleasant dreams of his losses at baccarat, and the tipsyrages of Marina.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>123<o:p></o:p></p><p>CHAPTER V<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>NEXT morning Delicia rose at about six o'clock and went out riding in theRow long before the fashionable world was astir.

In spite of inward grief andperplexity, she had slept well; for to a clear conscience and pure heart,combined with a healthy state of body, sleep is never denied. Mother Naturespecially protects her straightforward and cleanly children; she keeps theirfaces young, their eyes bright, their spirits elastic, their tempers equable,and for the soothing of Delicia's trouble this morning, the sunbeams dancedabout her in a golden waltz of pleasure, the leaves rustled in the wind, theflowers ex<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>124<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>haled their purest fragrance and the birds sang. Riding easily on herbeautiful mare 'Phillida' _who was almost as much a personal friend of hers asSpartan himself, and whom she had purchased out of the 'royalties' accumulatingon one of her earlier works-she found herself more than usually receptive ofthe exquisite impressions of natural loveliness. She was aware of everything ;from the white clouds that were heaped in snowy, mountainous ranges along thefurthest visible edge of the blue sky, to the open-hearted daisies in the grassthat stared up at the lately-risen sun with all the frankness of old friendshipand familiarity. The fresh morning air and the exhilarating exercise sent alovely colour to her cheeks, and as her graceful form swayed lightly to thehalf-coquettish, gay cantering of 'Phillida,' who was also conscious that itwas a very agreeable morning, she felt as if the information she had sounexpectedly and reluctantly received in the jeweller's shop in Bond Street onthe previous day was a bad dream and nothing more. After about an hour's ridingshe returned home at a quick trot, and on entering the house heard that<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>125<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>her 'lord and master' had not yet risen. She changed her riding habit forone of her simple white morning gowns, and went into her study to open and readher numerous letters, and mark them in order for her secretary to answer.

If we admit that men are the superiorand stronger sex, what a pitiable thing it is to note how little their moralforces assist in the elevation of woman, their tendency being to drag her downas low as possible!

Then he went up into Delicia's studyto give Spartan some dinner. Spartan received the plateful brought to him withmajestic indifference, and an air which implied that he would attend to itpresently. He had a little white glove of Delicia's between his paws, and manifestedno immediate desire to disturb himself. He had his own canine ideas of love andfidelity; and though he was only a dog, it may be he had a higher conception ofhonour and truth than is attained by men, who, in the excess of selfindulgence,take all the benefits of love and good fortune as their 'rights,' and aredestitute of even the saving grace of gratitude.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>K '45<o:p></o:p></p><p>CHAPTER VI<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>IT was no impetus of feminine recrimination or spite that had caused Deliciato go out on that particular evening, and thus deprive her husband of hersociety in the same abrupt fashion with which he had so often deprived her ofhis. Mr and Mrs Cavendish were old friends of hers. They had known her when shewas a little orphan girl with no brothers or sisters-no companions of her ownage to amuse her-nothing, in fact, but her own pensive and romantic thoughts,which had, though she then knew it not, helped to weave her now brilliantdestiny. They were elderly, childless people, and they had always been devotedto Delicia, so that when Mrs Cavendish paid an unexpected call in the afternoonand stated that she and her husband were 'mopy,' and that they would take itvery kindly if Delicia would come and dine 146<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of_Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>with them, and afterwards accompany them to the 'Empire,' for which they hada box near the stage, Delicia readily accepted the proposition as a welcomechange from her own uncomfortable and unprofitable thoughts. To begin with, shehad grown so accustomed now to her husband's telegrams announcing that he wouldnot be back to dinner, that she accepted his absence as a far greaterprobability than his home-returning. Therefore she was glad of the chance ofdining in friendly company. Next, the idea of going to the 'Empire' filled herwith a certain sense of pained curiosity and excitement. La Marina was thechief attraction there, and she had never seen her. So she shut up her books andpapers, put on a simple black skirt, and a pretty blouse of soft pink chiffon,daintily adorned with a shoulder-knot of roses, tied her rich hair tip, in thefashion of the picture of Madame Ic Brun, with a strip of pink ribbon, badegood-bye to Spartan, gave him her glove to guard by way of consolation, andthen went with her old friend, leaving for her husband,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>case he should return, the brief note<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'47<o:p></o:p></p><p>° The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>that had vexed his high mightiness so seriously. And it was with a strainedanticipation and sharp unrest that she sat in the box at the 'Empire,'withdrawn from view as much as possible, and waited for the appearance of thefamous dancer, whose performance was advertised on the programme as 'MarvellousEvolution! The Birth of a Butterfly! La Marina!' The music-hall was crowded,and looking down on the densely-packed arena, she saw rows and rows of men,smoking, grinning, whispering in each other's ears,-some sitting squat in theirfauteuils, with the bulging appearance of over-filled flour sacks, the extendedfeet beyond the sacks, and the apoplectically swelled heads on the topsthereof, suggestive of the full meals just enjoyed,others, standing up withopera glasses levelled at the promenade, or else leering in the same directionwithout glasses at all. There were young men, sodden and stupid with smoke anddrink,and old men, blear-eyed and weak-jointed, painfully endeavouring toassume the airs of joyous juvenility. There were fast women, with eye<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>149<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>lashes so darkened with kohl as to give them the appearance at a distance ofhaving no eyes at all, but only black sockets ;-middleaged frowsy femininetopers, whose very expression of face intimated a 'looking forward to the nextglass,'-and a few almost palsy-stricken antiquities of womanhood, the possibleruins of fifty-year-ago ballet-girls and toe-and-heel stage 'fairies,' who satin the stalls twisting their poor old mouths into the contortion of acoquettish smile - a contortion dreadfully reminding one of the way a skullgrins when some careless gravedigger throws it out of the mould where it hashidden its ghastly mirth for perhaps twenty years. All this seething witches'cauldron of life, Delicia looked down upon with a mingling of shame and sorrow.Were these low - looking creatures real humanity?-the humanity which Godcreated and redeemed? Surely not! They were more like apes than humanbeings-how was it?-and why was it?

But now the musical prelude to the wonderful 'Birthof a Butterfly' began, and the low shivering of the violins responded to themelodious complaints of the deepertoned 'cellos, as the lights of the 'Empire'were darkened, and over the crowded audience the kindly veil of asemi-obscurity fell, hiding the play of mean and coarse emotions on many adegraded face, and completely shadowing the wicked devilry of eyes so bereft ofhonesty, that had hell itself needed fresh sparks to kindle flame, those uglyhuman glances might have served the purpose. The curtain rose, displaying anexquisitely-painted scene called the 'Garden of Aurora,' where, in the rosyradiance of a deftly-simulated 'dawn of day,' the green trees trembled to themurmur of the subdued orchestral music, and roses-admirable creations of calicoand gauze-hung from the wings in gay clusters, looking almost as if they werereal. In the middle of the stage, on a broad green leaf that glittered with athousand sparkles of imitation dew, lay a large golden cocoon, perfect in shapeand shining gloriously in the beams of the mimic sun, and<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>52<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>to this central object the gaze of everyone in the audience was drawn andfixed. The music now grew wilder and sharper, the violins began to scream, the'cellos to swear, and Sound itself, torn into shreds of impatient vibration,was beginning to protest discordantly at the whole representation, when lo!-the golden cocoon grew slowly more and more transparent, as if some invisiblehand were winding oW the silken treasure of the spinning, and the white form ofa woman was dimly, delicately seen through the halfopaque covering. Loudmurmurs of applause began, which swelled into a rapturous roar of ecstasy aswith a sudden, sharp noise, which was echoed and repeated in the orchestra, thecocoon split asunder, and La Marina bounded forward to the footlights. Clad indiaphanous drapery, which scarcely concealed her form, and spreading forth twowhite butterfly wings, illumined in some mysterious way by electricity, shecommenced her gliding dance-an intricate whirl of wonderful sinuous movements,every one of which might have served as a study for a sculptor. Her feet movedflyingly without sound ; her face, artistically tinted<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'53<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>for stage-effect, was beautiful; her hair of reddish-brown, lit weirdly byconcealed electric dewdrops, flowed about her in a cloud that resembled asmouldering fire; and as she danced, she smiled as sweetly and with as perfectan imitation of childlike innocence as though she had in very truth been newlyborn in fairyland that night, just as she seemed,-a creature of light, love andmirth, with no idea at all of the brandy awaiting her by her own order in herdressingroom off the 'wings.' And Delicia, frozen into a kind of unnaturalcalm, watched her steadily, coldly, critically ; and watching, realised thatthe Bond Street jeweller had not spoken without knowledge, for there, onMarina's panting bosom, gleamed the diamond dove carrying the golden love-token,which said, ',7e t'adore ma mie ! ' Flashing brilliantly with every toss andwhirl of the dancer's pliant body, it was to Delicia the proof-positive of herhusband's dishonour. And yet she found it difficult to grasp the truth at once; she was not aware of any particular emotion of hurt, or rage, or grief; sheonly felt very cold and sick, and she could not put so strong a control<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>154<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Mu of Del icia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>herself as to quite hide these physical sensations altogether, for MrsCavendish, glanc-ing at her in alarm, exclaimed,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>, Delicia, you are not well!

Herwhite wings were irradiated with all sorts of wonderful tintsnow crimson, nowblue, now green-..and in the midst of all the glitter and play of light shoneMarina's face, smiling '55<o:p></o:p></p><p>.o The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>with its sweetly simulated expression of innocence, while the diamond dovesparkled beneath her rounded chin. And as Delicia glanced from her to the arenato see the effect of the performance on the audience, she started, and in theextreme tension of her nerves almost screamed,-for there,-looking straight upat her, was her husband ! Their eyes met ; the crowded space of the auditoriumand the brilliantly-lit stage, with the swaying figure of the popular dancergliding to and fro upon it, severed them-the visible and outward signs of awider separation to come. Lord Canyon surveyed his wife with a lofty andoffended air, and quickly understanding the expression on his features, Deliciacould have laughed aloud, had she been less stunned and miserable. For he wasassuming an aspect of injured virtue, which, considering the actual state ofaffairs, had something ludicrous about it; and for a moment Delicia studied himwith a curiously calm and critical analysis, just as if he were a subject forliterary treatment and no more. She saw, from his very look upward at her, thathe considered her to have outraged the proprieties by visiting 156<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'l I<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Del jcja<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>the 'Empire' at all, even though she was accompanied by two of her oldestand most familiar friends ; and of his own guilt in connection with La Marinait was highly probable he never thought at all. Men are judged to be excellentlogicians, superseding in that particular branch of knowledge all the feebleefforts of womankind ; and undoubtedly they have a very peculiar form ofarguing out excuses for their own vices, which must be acknowledged asexceedingly admirable. Before La Marina's gyrations were over, and while themale part of the audience was exhausting itself in frantic salvos of applause,Delicia was moved by such a keen and pungent appreciation of the comedy side ofthe situation that she could not help smiling. There was a wide wound in herheart; but it was so deep and deadly that as yet the true anguish of it was notbetrayed-the throbbing ache had not begun, and she herself was scarcely as yetaware of her own mortal hurt.

She had had her turn of social life longyears ago, and had got thoroughly tired of its vapid folly and hypocrisy, butshe had managed to find a good husband, and for that was daily and hourlythankful. The great sorrow of her life was that she had not been blessed withchildren, arid it was partly this shadow. on her otherwise happy and tranquillot, whicn made her attachmerit to Delicia peculiarly tender. Had thatbrilliant and popular novelist been her own daughter, she could not have lovedher more, i6o<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>and there was an uneasy sense of foreboding in her good, motherly soul thatnight which kept her awake for a long time, thinking and wondering as to whatwould happen if certain rumours concerning Lord Canyon turned out to be true.She knew Delicia's character better than most people ; she was aware thatbeneath that apparently pliant, sweet nature, there was a resolute spirit,strong as iron, firm as adamant-a spirit which would assuredly make for rightand justice whenever and however tested and tried<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>but she could not foresee in what way Delicia would resent a wrong,supposing she had cause for such resentment. She looked slight as a reed anddelicate as a lily ; but appearances are deceptive ; and nothing can well bemore foolish than to estimate a person's mental capacity by his or her outwardbearing. A rapier is a thin, light weapon, but it can nevertheless kill; anightingale has nothing to boast of in its plumage, but its singing surpassesthat of all the other birds in creation. Only the purely barbaric mind judgesthings or individuals by surface appearances.

No one would have given her credit for such virtues as strongselfrestraint, courage, determination, and absolute indifference to opinions ;yet all these she had in no small degree, combined with an extraordinarydirectness and swiftness of action which is commendable enough when itdistinguishes a man, but is somewhat astonishing when discovered in thenaturally capricious composition of a woman. This direct method of conductimpelled her now; for while Mrs Cavendish lay awake worrying about her, sheherself, on returning home that evening, had fully made up her mind as to whatshe meant to do. Going into her study, she sat down and wrote a letter to herhusband, in which, with concise and uncomplaining brevity, she told him all.She concluded her epistle thus :<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'I am unable to tell you my own feelings on this matter, as I have not yethad time to realise them even to myself.

Twisting up her hair in a loose knot, she lay down on the bed andtried to sleep, but only succeeded in falling into an uneasy doze for about anhour. Ill and restless as she felt, however, she was up and dressed when hermaid came to her in the morning, and before eleven o'clock she had left thehouse, with Spartan sitting beside her on the floor of the brougham which tookher to the station, from whence she started for Broadstairs. She left noinstructions with her household, beyond impressing once again upon Robson theurgent necessity of giving Lord Carlyon the letter she had written for him as soonas he returned. Robson promised implicit obedience, and watched thedisappearance of the carriage containing his lady, her maid and her dog, withfeelings of mingled curiosity and uneasiness.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>t7<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Something's in the wind, I'm pretty sure,' he mused ; 'she has never goneaway in this way, sudden-like, before.

This was the case with Canyon when he returned to his home at aboutluncheon time on the day Delicia departed seawards. He was not merelyirritable, but he took a fantastic pleasure in knowing himself to be irritable,and in keeping his temper up to the required pitch of spleen. He was really angrywith himself, but he managed to pretend that he was angry with '73<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>3'.<o:p></o:p></p><p>c) The Murder of Delieja<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Delicia. He had seen something in one of the papers about her which hejudged as quite sufficient ground of offence to go upon, though he knew it wasan attempt to vilify her fair name, which he, as her husband, should haveinstantly resented. In his own mind he was perfectly cognisant that, had heacted a manly part in the matter, he should have taken his riding-whip, andwith it dealt a smart cut across the face of the literary liar who hadpublished the false rumour, and yet, though he was aware of this, he hadmanaged to work himself up into such a peculiar condition of self-pity that hecould see nothing at all on his limited horizon but himself, his own feelingsand his own perfections; and though he was partially and shamedly conscious ofhis own vices as well, he found such a number of excuses for these, that by thetime he reached his own door he had, by dint of many soothing modern doctrines,and comfortable progressive moralist arguments, almost decided that he, takingmen as they were, was really an exceptional paragon and pattern of virtue.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'I must really speak very seriously to<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>174<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of 1)CliCia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Delicia,' he said to himself.

The blinds weredown, the room was deserted, and only the marble 'Antinous' stared at him witha cold smile.

Guilt, shame and remorse fought for the mastery of his feelings,and during the space of two or three minutes he thought he would at once followDelicia, throw himself on her mercy, declare everything, and ask herforgiveness. But what would be the use of that? She might forgive, but shewould never forget. And her blind adoration of him, her passionate love, herdevout confidence? He had sense enough to realise that these fair feelings oftenderness and reverence in her for him were dead for ever!<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Pulling at his handsome moustache fretfully, he surveyed his position andwondered whether it was likely that she would sue for a divorce? And if so,would she get it? No, for she could not prove cruelty or desertion. There wasno cruelty in his having an 'affair' with Marina, or a dozen Marinas if helikednot in the eyes of the law. There was not even any cruelty, legallyspeaking, in his spending his wife's earnings on Marina, if his wife gave himmoney to do as he liked with. To get a divorce legally, Delicia would have toprove not only infidelity but cruelty and desertion as well for two years andupwards.

All she desired for the moment was rest-a space ofsilence in which to think calmly and to brace her spirit up to the necessaryfortitude required for the realisation of what she must expect to endure forthe remainder of her life. She took some quiet rooms facing the sea,telegraphed her address to her husband, and then prepared to settle down for afew days of serious meditation. She began to consider her position with alogical steadiness worthy of any and all or her 'dear old Pagans,' as shecalled Socrates and the rest of his school,-and with a mingling of timidity andresolve tried the measure of her feminine strength, as a warrior might try hisweapon, against the opposing evils which confronted her. The greatest loss thatcan befall a woman had befallen her-the loss of love. Her love had been deepand passionate, but the object of that love had proved himself unworthy-hencelove was dead and would never revive again. This was the first clause of theargument, and it had to be mastered thoroughly. Next came the fact that,notwithstanding the death of love, she, Delicia, was bound to the corpse ofthat i8z<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>perished passion-bound by the marriage tie arid also by the law, which hasgenerously provided that a husband may be guilty of infidelity to his wifeevery day and every hour of the day, without her having any right to punish orto leave him unless he treats her with 'cruelty,' his unfaithfulness not beingjudged by the so admirable law as 'cruel.' By no means-oh, no !-not at all!When it comes to blows, face-scratching and hairtearing, then 'cruelty' can becomplained of; but the slow breaking of a heart, the torturing of delicatenerve-fibres on the rack of mental and moral outrage, the smile which is aninsult, the condescending tolerance which is an affront, the conventionalkeeping up of appearances which is a daily lie-all this has no touch of 'cruelty'at all about it-not in the very least!<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Therefore,' argued Delicia, with a fine disdain, 'unless he ever takes itinto his head to beat me, or fire a pistol at me, I have no cause of complaintagainst him, and must not complain.

They do not like to confess that, in their love ofpleasure and their devotion to race-meetings and shooting-parties, it oftenhappens that the very porters guarding the doors of their offices know moreabout the staff than they do. The porter can tell exactly the hour that MrB-----comes in to the office at night, the shortness of the time he staysthere, and the precipitate hurry with which he goes hcme to bed.

But as long as editors andproprietors prefer to caper about at the heels of 'swagger' society instead ofattending strictly to their duties and to the grave responsibilities ofjournalism, so long will the British Press be corrupted by underlings, and'used' for purposes which are neither honourable nor national, nor in any wayexact, as reflecting the real current of public opinion. Delicia knew all thisof old, hence her indifference to the press generally. She had always beenentertained and surprised at the naïve delight with which certain society'belles' had shown her descriptions of themselves in certain fashionablejournals, where their personal attractions were enumerated and discussed as ifthey were nothing more than cattle in a market. She could never understand whatpleasure there was in the vulgar compliments of the cheap paragraphist. And inthe same way she never thought it worth while to attach importance to thescurrilities that appeared in similar quarters concerning all those women whostood aloof from self-advertisement and dedined to 'give themselves away' byconsenting to the maudlin puffery of the 'ladies' paper.'<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>210<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia '<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>So that the lofty tone of injury her husband assumed in his letter not onlystruck her as mean, but infinitely grotesque as well.

When she was notengaged in creative composition, she turned to the study of books with almostas much ardour as had possessed her when, at the age of twelve, she hadpreferred to shut herself up alone and read Shakespeare to any other form ofentertainment. And gradually, almost unconsciously to herself, the tone andtemper of her mind changed and strengthened; she began to reconcile herself tothe idea of the lonely lot which would henceforward be her portion. Turning thematter practically over in her mind, she decided that the best course to adoptwould be that of a 'judicial separation.'

And in a few minutes the fashionable crowd assembled at LadyDexter's stirred and swayed with excitement as all eyes were turned on thesylph-like vision of a fair woman in gleaming white and jewels, with a paleface and dark violet eyes, whose name was announced through the length andbreadth of the great drawing-rooms by the servantsin-waiting as 'Lady Canyon,'but whom all the world of intelligence and culture present<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>whispered of as 'the famous Delicia Vaughan' For a handle to one's name is apoor thing in comparison to the position of genius; and that the greatestemperor ever crowned is less renowned throughout the nations than plain'William Shakespeare, is as it should be, and serves as a witness of theeternal supremacy of truth and justice amid a world of shams.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>229<o:p></o:p></p><p>CHAPTER X<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>THE first person Delicia saw after her hostess on entering the rooms was herhusband. She bowed to him serenely, with a charming smile and playful air, asif she had only just left his company, then passed him by, entering at onceinto conversation with an artist of note, who came eagerly forward to presenthis young wife to her. Canyon, quite taken aback, stared at her half-angrily,half-obsequiously, for there was something very queenly in the way she moved,something very noble in the manner she carried her proud little head, on whichthe diamond star she wore shone like Venus on a frosty night.

To this old gentleman Delicia talked in her mostcharming manner, and Canyon, as his eyes wandered about the room, suddenlycaught the mischievous and mocking glance of 'La Marina '-a glance which saidas plainly as words, 'What a fool you are! ' Flushing with annoyance, he movedfrom the position he had taken up near the grand piano and strolled by himselfthrough the rooms, picking out here and there a few of his own friends to speakto, who, however, seemed to have nothing much to say except, 'How charming LadyCanyon looks this evening!' a phrase which irritated rather than pleased him,simply because it was true. It was true that Delicia looked lovely; it was truethat she eclipsed every woman in the room by her intelligence, grace of mannerand brilliancy of conversation; and it was true that for a time at least shewas the centre of attraction and absorbed the whole interest of everyonepresent. And Canyon was distinctly vexed at the sensation she made, because hehad no part in it, because he felt himself left out in the cold, and, moreover,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>232<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia .c<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>because he was forced to understand that she, his wife, had determined thatso he should be left. He would not-perhaps by some defect of brain he couldnot-realise that he had himself forfeited all claim to her consideration orrespect, and he was glad when the arrival of another celebrity was announced,who at once distracted the attention of the frivolous throng from Deliciaaltogether-a lady of brilliant beauty, and of exalted rank, who haddistinguished herself by becoming a demi-mondaine of the most open andshameless type, but who, nevertheless, continued to 'move in society,' as thephrase goes, with a considerable amount of éclat, simply because she had money,and was wont to assist churches with it and shower pecuniary benefits onpenniless clerics. Deity (through the said clerics) blessed her in spite of hermoral backslidings ; and instead of denouncing her as it should have done, theChurch went to her garden-parties. Lady Brancewith was a clever woman in herway, as well as a beautiful one ; she loved her own vices dearly, and wasprepared to sacrifice anything for the indulgence of them-husband, children,name, fame, honour; but she took a<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>233<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>great deal of pains to keep in with 'pious' people, and she knew that thebest way to do that was continually to give largesse all round. The worthyclergyman of the parish in which her great house was the chiefest of theneighbourhood, shut his eyes to her sins and opened them to her cheques ; soall went well and merrily with her. Her entrance into Lady Dexter'sdrawing-room was the signal for a complete change in the attitude of thefashionable throng. Everybody craned their necks to look at her and comment onher dress and diamonds ; people began to whisper to each other the newest bitsof scandal about her, and Delicia, with her fair face and unsullied character,was soon deserted and forgotten. She was rather glad of this, and she sat downin a retired corner to rest, near the entrance to the great conservatory, wherethe curtains shaded her from the light, and where she could see without beingseen. She watched the smiles and gestures of Lady Brancewith with a good dealof inward pain and contempt.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'That is the kind of &quot;society woman&quot; men like,' she mused, 'Onewho will go down into the mud with them and never<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>234<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>regret the loss of cleanliness.

LadyBrancewith was on his arm, evidently delighted to be seen in the company of sophysically handsome a person. The little diamonds sewn on her priceless laceflashed in Delicia's eyes like sparks of light; the faint, sickly odour ofpatchouli was wafted from her garments as she moved; the<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>235<o:p></o:p></p><p>or, -q<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>hard lines which vice and self-indulgence had drawn on that fair face werescarcely perceptible in the softened light, and her little low laugh ofcoquettish pleasure at some remark of Lord Canyon's sounded musical enough evento Delicia, who, though she knew and detested the woman's character, could notrefrain from looking after her half in wonderment, half in aversion. Within afew paces of where she sat they stopped,-Lord Canyon placed a chair for hisfair companion near a giant palm, which towered up nearly to the roof of theconservatory, and then, drawing another to her side, sat down himself.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'At last in my wretched life I am allowed a moment's pleasure!' he said,conveying into his fine eyes a touch of the Beautiful Sullenness expressionwhich he generally found answer so well with women.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Lady Brancewith laughed, unfurling her fan.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Dear me, how very tragic !' she said.

'Jewlia Muggins,'alias 'Violet de Gascon,' knew a thing or two, and was not to be taken in byLady Brancewith or any of her set. She was keenly disappointed. Delicia had notbeen present to see her dance, and she had very much wished to create afavourable impression on that ' sweet thing in white' as she called her. Shehad danced her best, gracefully, and with an exquisite modesty; too exquisitefor many of the gentlemen assembled,<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Deli<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>some of whom whispered to each other that she was 'going off' a bit, simplybecause they could not see much above her slender ankles.

This latter term did not suit herat all, but he considered that it did ; for, as usual, by the aid of man'slogic, he deemed himself the injured party and she the injuring.

Till then he was 'hers affectionately.' Shecrumpled the note in her hand and lay still, her fair head fallen wearily backamong her pillows, and a great sense of exhaustion and fatigue numbing all herfaculties.

She saw no visitors and went nowhere ; hermorning ride was all the relaxation she permitted herself; and she grew palerand paler as she toiled unremittingly with her pen, and lived a life of almostunbroken solitude all through the height of the London 'season.'

Thisoccurred when two elderly gentlemen of business-like demeanour arrived carryingsmall black bags.

But the sight of the fair, grave, patientwoman who had worked so hard, who held such a high position of fame, and whowas so grievously wronged in her private life, had a powerful effect upon eventhe practical and prosaic disposition of the two men born to considerations ofred tape and wordy documents; and when they took their leave of her it was witha profound deference and sympathy which she did not fail to notice.

Shehad intended to consult a doctor about her health; but, absorbed in her work,she put it off from day to day, promising herself that she would do so when herbook was finished. She received no news whatever from her husband ; he wastrying the effect of a lengthy absence and sustained silence on her alwayssensitive mind.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>And so the days went on, through all bright June and the warm beginning ofJuly, till one morning she entered her room prepared to write the last portionof what she instinctively felt and knew would lift her higher among the coldpinnacles of fame than she had ever been. She was aware of a soft lassitudeupon her,-a sense of languor that was more delightful than unpleasing; thebeautiful repose that distinguishes a studious 278<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>and deeply-thinking mind, which had been hers in a very great degree beforeher marriage, when, as single-hearted Delicia Vaughan, she had astonished theworld by her genius, came back to her now, and the clouds of trouble andperplexity seemed suddenly to clear and leave her life as blank and calm andpure as though the shadow of a false love had never darkened it. The sun fellwarmly across her desk, flickering over the pens and paper; and Spartanstretched himself full length in his usual place in the window-nook with a deepsigh of absolute content. And with radiance in her eyes and a smile on herlips, Delicia sat down and wrote her 'conclusion.' Her brain had never beenclearer,-the thoughts came quickly, and with the thoughts were evoked new andfelicitous modes of expression, which wrote themselves, as it were, without aneffort on her own part.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>Suddenly she started to her feet ;-a great and solemn sound was in her ears,like the stormy murmur of a distant sea, or the beginning of a grand organchant, gravely sustained. Listening, she looked wildly up at the dazzlingsunlight streaming through<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>270<o:p></o:p></p><p>° The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>her window pane. What strange, what distant Glory did she see, that all thelight and all the splendour of the summer day should seem, for that one moment,to be mirrored in her eyes? Then-she gave a sharp, choking cry,<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'Spartan ! Spartan V<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>With one bound the great dog obeyed the call, and sprang up against her,putting his huge, soft paws upon her breast. Convulsively she clasped themclose,-as she would have clasped the hands of an only friend,-and fell backheavily in her chair-dead!<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>So they found her an hour later,-her cold hands still holding Spartan'srough paws to her bosom,-while he, poor faithful beast, imprisoned in that death-grip,sat patiently watching his mistress with anxious and loving eyes, waiting tillshe should wake. For she looked as if she had merely fallen asleep for a fewminutes<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>a smile was on her lips,-the colour had not quite left her face,-and herbody was yet warm. For some time no one dared touch the dog, and only at lastby dint of sheer force and close muzzling could they drag him away and<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>280<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia ..<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>lock him up in the yard, where he filled the surrounding neighbourhood withhis desolate howling. He was 'only a dog;' he had not the beautiful reasoningability of a man, who is able to console himself easily for the death offriends by making new ones. He had a true heart, poor Spartan! It is anunfashionable commodity, and useless, too, since it cannot be bought or sold.And when all the newspapers had headings -'Death of Delicia Vaughan,' withaccounts of the 'sudden heart failure,' which had been the cause of herunexpected end, Lord Canyon returned in haste to town to attend the funeral andto hear the will. But he found his presence scarcely needed,-for the greatpublic, seized by a passionate grief for the loss of one of its favouriteauthors, took it upon itself to make the obsequies of this 'unsexed ' woman asimposing as any that ever attended king or emperor. Thousands followed thecoffin to the quiet Mortlake cemetery, where Delicia had long ago purchased herown grave<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>hundreds among these thousands wept, and reminded each other of the goodactions, the many kindnesses that had made her suddenly-ended life a blessingand consolation to the sick and<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>281<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>the afflicted, and many wondered where they should again find so true andsympathetic a friend. And when it came to be publicly known that all her fortune,together with all future royalties to be obtained from her books, was left inequal shares among the poverty-stricken of certain miserable London districts,with full and concise instructions as to how it was to be paid and when,-thencallous hearts melted at the sound of her name, and eyes unaccustomed toweeping shed soft tears of gratitude and spoke of her with a wonderingtenderness of worship and reverence as though she had been a saint. The Pressmade light of her work, and had scarce a word of sympathy for her untimelydemise; their general 'tone' being that adopted by the late Edward Fitzgerald,who wrote of one of England's greatest poets thus :-' Mrs Barrett Browning isdead. Thank God we shall have no more &quot;Aurora Leighs &quot; ' It is theusual manner assumed by men who have neither the brain nor the feeling to writean 'Aurora Leigh' themselves. All the same, the public rushed,' in its usualimpulsive fashion, for the last book Delicia had written, and when<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>282<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicia .o.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>they got it, such a chorus of enthusiasm arose as entirely overwhelmed theordinary press cackle and brought down the applauding verdict of such reasoningreaders and sober judges who did not waste their time in writing newspaperparagraphs. Delicia's name became greater in death than in life ; and only oneperson spoke of her with flippant ease and light disparagement ; this was herhusband. His indignation at finding her fortune entirely disposed of among'charities' was too deep and genuine to be concealed. He considered hisallowance of two hundred and fifty a year an 'insult,' and he became an ardentsupporter of the tyrannic theories of the would-be little Nero of Germany, whopermits a law to be in active force which unjustly provides that all the earningsof wives shall belong to their husbands. He considered the painter poet-composer- autocrat of the Fatherland an extremely sensible person, and wishedsuch a law might be carried into effect in England. He forgot all Delicia'stenderness, all her beauty, all her intelligence, all her thoughtfulness andconsideration for his personal comfort ; and all her love counted 283<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Murder of Delicja 11<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>as nothing when set against the manner in which he considered he had been'done' in the results of his marriage with an 'unsexed' woman of genius. Butgradually, very gradually, by some mysterious means, probably best known toLady Brancewith, who had never forgiven the slight inflicted on her by his lookand manner when he suddenly refused to drive home with her after promising todo so, rumour began to whisper the story of his selfishness, and to commentupon it.<o:p></o:p></p><p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p>'He had committed no crime. Oh, no,' said society, beginning to waver in itsformer adoration of his manly perfections, 'but he broke his wife's heart!'Yes, that was it! How he did it nobody quite knew; there was something aboutthe &quot; Marina&quot; woman at the &quot;Empire,&quot; but nothing was quitecertain.

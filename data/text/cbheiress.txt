<hi rend="center">CHAPTER I.</hi>

<p>"WHAT are the bells ringing for, Sinclair?" asked Miss Trafford, as she bent her head to listen. "I have not heard them ring so merrily for many years."</p>
<p>"They are joy-bells, ma'am," was the maid's answer.</p>
<p>"Surely in this sorrowful world little happens that should cause joy-bells to ring!"</p>
<p>"Pleasant things do happen at times, ma'am," urged the maid.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; I do not suppose everyone to be old and gray and broken-hearted Tell me why the bells are ringing."</p>
<p>"You will not be pleased when you hear the reason, ma'am You do not like us to speak of such things to you."</p>
<p>"I wish to know now," said Miss Trafford, firmly. "Because I disliked a thing yesterday, it does not follow that I should dislike it to-day."</p>
<p>"Certainly not, ma'am," answered the maid, "Well, since you wish to know I will tell you--the vicar's wife, Mrs. Darrell, had a little daughter this mornin'."</p>
<p>A profound silence followed this announcement. A curious quiver passed over Miss Trafford's faded face, and, when the spoke again, there was a strange ring in her voice.</p>
<p>"Is it possible," she asked, "that anyone can be found anxious to have joy-bells rung because another unfortunate human being is born into this world of misery?"</p>
<p>"It is not a world of misery to all who live in it, ma'am," returned the maid.</p>
<p>"Ah, true-true! Some are fair, young, and happy. It is well to be born with a fair face. I would rather have been beautiful than have had a large fortune, Sinclair."</p>
<p>"I would rather not, ma'am. 'Beauty is fleeting, but gold is lasting,'" quoted the maid.</p>
<p>"A fair face--a fair face!" murmured Miss Trafford. "I lost all that life held most dear because of one. Sinclair. I wonder if the child for whom those bells are ringing has a fair face?"</p>
<p>"Most likely, ma'am," answered the maid, carelessly; "the vicar and his wife are both good looking."</p>
<p>Again there was a silence, and, when Miss Trafford broke It once more, her face and voice had changed.</p>
<p>"Sinclair." she said, " how many years is it since I saw a little child?"</p>
<p>"More than I care to count, ma'am," was the brief reply.</p>
<p>"It must be twenty. It is twenty years since I went out into the world, twenty years since I saw a child. I loved children long ago. No doubt it is a foolish fancy; but I should like to see a little child once again."</p>
<p>The maid laughed as she replied.</p>
<p>"It is a foolish fancy, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Ah me, how different my whole life would have been if I had but had a child to love me and to love!" exclaimed Miss Trafford. Then she added, abruptly, "Sinclair, I should like to see this little girl who was born to-day-born on this bright May day. That should augur well for her. I should certainly like to see her."</p>
<p>The maid looked up in wonder.</p>
<p>"Why, ma'am," she said, "you have not been outside the Priory gates for twenty years?"</p>
<p>"No; and I may never go again. It seems a foolish wish, I know; but my heart yearns for the sight of a child's face, and I shall know no rest until I have seen one."</p>
<p>"Then why not have your wish, ma'am?" said the maid.</p>
<p>"I will. I will go to the Vicarage and see the little baby girl. It Is twenty years since the carriage was locked away in the coach-house. and since Johnson has driven me out. Now tell him to prepare the carriage and put to the horses, for I want to go at once. Do it quickly, Sinclair, lest I should change my mind."</p>
<p>It caused a great sensation in Hilldrop Priory when it became known that its mistress, after twenty years' seclusion, was going out. The grooms, who had grown stout during their life of idleness, hoped devoutly that Miss Trafford was not going to take to active ways again. The maids were pleased, for the prospect of any break in the dull monotony of their existence was welcome to them. And all the commotion was caused by the fact that the mistress of Hilldrop Priory was going out for the first time for twenty years--that she had yielded to a longing to look once more upon the face of a child.</p>
<p>Comparatively old, Miss Trafford was yet the survivor of a tragedy--a woman the light of whose life had died long since, yet from whose heart all traces of love had not been entirely obliterated. There are many sad love stories in the world, some of min's treachery, some of women's folly.</p>
<p>The story of Philippa Trafford--not a long story--was one that told of the inconstancy of men, how a human heart was broken and a life wrecked.</p>
<p>She was the only child of all old sea-captain, with whom she lived near the great naval station of Portsmouth. Her mother was dead. and her only relative was a distant cousin, who resided at Hilldrop Priory. At eighteen she fell in love with a handsome young soldier, a captain in one of the regiments then stationed at Portsmouth. No one could understand why Captain Marcus Hill had chosen Philippa Trafford. She was no beauty: she had neither loveliness of face nor comeliness of figure. Her eyes were fine, and she had a profusion of rich, dark hair--there her beauty ended. Added to her plainness of face, she was shy in manner, and often awkward in gesture: but she had an artist's soul and a loving, trusting heart. She had none of the graceful allurements of pretty girlhood: she had no sweet musical voice no merry girlish laugh; but there were times when the plain face grew positively beautiful under the influence of passionate emotion. Perhaps Marcus Hill had found out the nobility of heart and soul that lay beneath the plain exterior, for certainly he loved her with a great love, and had chosen her from 
<pb n="2 THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP."/>

among a bevy of pretty girls. She had no fortune, no high connections; she could in no way advance his material interests in life: nevertheless he had chosen her, and paid her all the attentions of the most devoted lover. He had asked her to be his wife and, although no particular time had been appointed for their marriage, their engagement was a well-known fact.</p>
<p>Philippa's father was well pleased with the engagement; but he would not hear of an early marriage. Philippa was not nineteen, and nothing, he declared, marred ,a young man's prospects so much as an early an improvident marriage. They must wait a few years and see what time did for them. Captain Trafford had no money to leave his daughter, and Captain Marcus Hill had little beyond his regimental pay. So the lovers agreed to wait.</p>
<p>Captain Hill spent all his leisure time with his betrothed. Nothing could be more sincere than his great affection of her.</p>
<p>"How can you love me so much, Marcus?" she said to him one day. "I have neither beauty nor grace."</p>
<p>"You have both in my eyes," was his answer. "There may be women who are fairer, but I cannot see it. To me you are beautiful because I love you."</p>
<p>"But," she asked, as they passed a group of pretty girls, "do you never contrast me with others, Marcus?"</p>
<p>If I do, it is to your advantage," he replied. "I see no beauty in anyone but you, Philippa."</p>
<p>"I ought to be content--I am content," she said; Rod there was a rapture of delight in her voice. "I am the happiest girl in the world." And she believed it. Her handsome young lover was all that her heart desired, and for one whole year she was perfectly happy.</p>
<p>While she lived she retained a vivid remembrance of that year that was full of half pleasure, half-pain--a dream of golden sunsets, of quiet moonlit evenings. Nothing pleased the young soldier better than rowing his lady-love about on the summer-sea, taking her far from the shore and talking of his love for her amidst the plash of the waves.</p>
<p>The golden hours passed all too soon, for orders came for Captain Hill's regiment to go India.</p>
<p>"Never mind the few years' absence," said Captain Trafford to the young soldier; "it means promotion to you."</p>
<p>The question was once raised as to whether the marriage should take place before Marcus Hill set sail; but the old sea-captain would not hear of it. He repeated that it would mar the young soldier's career; therefore no more was said about it.</p>
<p>At length the day came when the two lovers had to say farewell; and a trying time it was for them. Their only consolation lay in the knowledge that there was no shadow of doubt in the heart of either. They had implicit faith in each other and their faith was strengthened by the intensity of their love.</p>
<p>So the vessel sailed away, and Philippa Trafford went back to her father's house, there to wait patiently until her lover returned. With his departure it seemed to her as though the light had gone from the sun, and all gladness from the earth. During the first year of her lover's absence an important event occurred. The distant cousin whom neither father nor daughter knew died, and left Hilldrop Priory, with four thousand pounds per annum, to Philippa Trafford.</p>
<p>There could have been no greater surprise than this to the old captain and his daughter. They had never seen the cousin who had lived at the Priory, and neither father nor daughter had thought it possible that she might remember them in her will; and what seemed equally strange to them was the fact that the money and estate should be left to the daughter rather than to the father.</p>
<p>When Philippa heard that she was heiress of Hilldrop Priory her first sensation was one of acute pain that such good fortune had not befallen her before.</p>
<p>Marcus need never have gone in search of honor and fortune could we have foreseen this," she said, bitterly.</p>
<p>But her father would not agree with her.</p>
<p>"It will do him good, Philippa. Hardships bring out all that is noble in a young man's character. It is all for the best."</p>
<p>But Philippa could not see it. Her inheritance and her large fortune were as nothing to her unless Marcus shared them. She wrote to him, telling him the news, adding that she would derive no happiness from her wealth unless he were with her; and she gave him at the same time a delicate hint that, if he would retire from the service and return hone, she would have nothing left to wish for. But the young soldier resisted the temptation. He had to win his spurs, to gain honor and distinction; and to return to England to marry a rich woman and live upon her money did not seem to him a very heroic proceeding. He told her frankly that, since they had gone through the pain of parting, and he was in India, he would stay there for a time a least, in the hope of making a name for himself; then, after a few years of service he should feel justified in returning to share her wealth.</p>
<p>If that letter grieved Philippa Trafford, she never said so. She respected the sentiments of the writer; she admired him all the more for his independence; but her love was just a little wounded, her heart a little sore. She said to herself that he might have served his queen and his country at home. He might have found ample occupation in superintending her large estate; he might have gone into Parliament; still, if he preferred the army in India, she would not interfere.</p>
<p>That was the first chill that came over the glowing warmth of her love.</p> <p>Father and daughter took possession of Hilldrop; and a magnificent place they found it. To Philippa Trafford it all seemed like a dream--the change from a six-roomed house to Hilldrop, from an income of two hundred to four thousand pounds per annum, was so great.</p>
<p>It was not long before the old captain and his daughter were as perfectly at home in the grand roomy mansion as they had been in their small house. The captain had known little of the luxuries of life, and to find himself master of a well-stocked cellar, and with a comfortable carriage to drive out in was something marvellous to him. He lived for three years after his removal to the Priory, and at his death was buried in the church-yard at Ravelston. When he lay dying it was at the close of a bright July day--Philippa, who was kneeling by his side, faithful and loving to him to the last, bent over him and said:</p>
<p> "Papa, shall I send for Marcus now? I shall be alone in the world when you are gone."</p>
<p>The dying man raised his eyes to hers, and regarded her for a moment with a look of mingled love and pity.</p>
<p>"No," he answered; "do not send for him, Philippa. Let him finish his career out there. When he comes, let it be of his own free will. Do not send."</p>
<p>Once more she gave her lover a delicate hint in her letters that, as she was now all alone, she would be so happy when he returned. She told him of the old man's death and funeral, and added, "Now I have nothing to do but wait for you, love--wait for you." And she did wait for him, as hundreds of brave and faithful women have waited before for the men they loved.</p>
<p>All the news that came to her from India was good. Marcus Hill told greatly distinguished himself by his valor, and his valuable service had been rewarded. He was Major Hill now, and there was hope of still further preferment for him.</p>
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 3"/>

<p>"Do not spoil your career for me," she wrote to him. "But I am all alone, and, oh, my love, I shall be so happy when you come back!"</p>
<p>The words did not hasten his return by one hour.</p>
<p>Philippa was nineteen when her lover sailed for India; she was was twenty-nine when he returned, and during all that time she had thought of no one but him. She had had several offers of marriage. As is often the case with plain girls, she became handsomer as she grew older, and at twenty-nine she was a fine-looking woman. But, though she had many eligible suitors for her hand, there was only one man in the world for her.</p>
<p>For ten years she had waited patiently for her lover's return; and now he was coming home. He had written to say that he should be in England toward the end of June, and that he should come straight to her. The letter was written just before he started, and it told her also how he counted the hours that must elapse before he saw her, how he thanked and blessed her for her long, patient love, and how happy they would be together. When she read it the loving, faithful woman wept happy tears; and that letter she kept next to her heart.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER II.</hi>

<p>PHILIPPA TRAFFORD was standing among the roses and lilies of her garden when the letter came which told her that her that her lover would be at Hilldrop on the twenty-third of June. When she had read it, she kissed it and stood for some minutes in silence. Her face had grown pale as a lily and almost beautiful it its tremulous happiness. The bright sunlight played around her, the summer wind gently stirred the green leaves; in this, the supreme moment of her life, when her long, and faithful love was to be crowned at last, her heart went up in gratitude to Heaven.</p>
<p>Great as was her happiness, she yet wanted sympathy, and for this site sought her maid. She walked slowly back to the house, and, ringing for Sinclair, told her that the friend from India whom she had been so long expecting would be with her on the twenty third.</p>
<p>The maid's face flushed and tears came into her eyes. She showed more emotion than her mistress had done.</p>
<p>"Then, Miss Philippa," she said, "If you will forgive me, we may hope to have a wedding soon?"</p>
<p>Philippa Trafford's face grew radiantly bright as she answered:</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>It was touching to see the calm content that made the plain face of Philippa Trafford almost beautiful. There was a glad look in her eyes, a brightness in her smile that was never see again.</p>
<p>"Call use early to-morrow, Sinclair." said Miss Trafford, on the eve of the twenty-third; and the maid smiled.</p>
<p>"You will be up with the sun, miss," she said.</p>
<p>And so it happened. There was no need to call her from her slumbers on the day that her lover was corning home. She had parted from him with tears--Heaven only knew how bitter; she would meet him with smiles. She had parted from him in the simple little parlor at home, clad in a dress of plain serge; she would meet him on the threshold of a magnificent mansion, clad in velvet.</p>
<p>Ah, the dark, wistful eyes that looked into the mirror as she dressed to receive him! Her maid never thought of them afterwards, without tears. Philippa had chosen a black velvet dress--a dress that suited her well--with a few choice pearl ornaments.</p>
<p>Do I look as well as I can be made to look, Sinclair?" she asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>"You look young and handsome, miss," was the consolatory reply; and Miss Trafford was comforted.</p>
<p>It was a still, hot, and drowsy noon. Miss Trafford had gone to the drawing-room to give it those last touches which should make it beautiful in his eyes, and she was there when he arrived. As had happened in her dreams a hundred times, she heard a loud peal at the bell, then there was a brief silence, then the closing of the hall-door. There was another pause, followed by the foot steps of a servant hastening along the corridor. It seemed to her as though she had gone through it all before. She stood up, calm and erect, but her hands were tightly locked and burned feverishly. The footman announced him--"Major Hill." The only point in which the reality differed was this. In her dreams he had rushed into the room, caught her in his arms, and kissed her with passionate kisses; now he did not hasten into the room--the footman stood waiting.</p>
<p>"Show Major Hill in here," she said, in a clear, calm voice.</p>
<p>She controlled the passionate beating of her heart, she kept back the cry of joy that, rose to her lips. This was the moment for which she had waited ten long years, and it had come at last.</p>
<p>A tall, bronzed, and bearded man entered the room. There was no trace of the fair-haired, laughing young fellow in this stalwart, handsome man. She did not wait to notice his manner, but flew to his arms. For a moment, she could not utter a sound either of welcome or of joy: but she threw her arms around his neck, and laid her head on his breast. At last--at last!</p>
<p>"I--I can hardly speak to you," she gasped, "the joy of seeing you is so great. A thousand times welcome home!"</p>
<p>He drew her nearer to him and kissed her; but it was not with the fond kiss of her dream. Then, quite suddenly she raised her head and looked him straight in the face. What she saw there who shall say? But her own grew white and cool, her arms fell nerveless by her side, a long, low moan carne from her lips. He moved uneasily; his eyes fell before her steady gaze.</p>
<p>"I--I knew you would find it out," he said; but, Philippa, I could not help it--it was not my fault. I knew those clear eyes of yours would read my secret at once."</p>
<p>All the color left her cheeks, she seemed suddenly to have grown old and haggard. It needed but one look to tell her that he had ceased to love her.</p>
<p>"Tell me all about it," she said, huskily; "be quick, that I may know the worst."</p>
<p>"Philippa," he began, "I have come back to marry you--if you will."</p>
<p>A rush of color swept over her face, a deep sigh broke from her lips. Ah, then it was not so bad.</p>
<p>"To marry me!" she echoed. "Then what is it?"</p>
<p>"Let us talk quietly. Philippa," he said, gently. "Let me bring a chair for you; I have much to tell you."</p>
<p>"You have come home to marry me?" she questioned.</p>
<p>"Yes, if you will consent, after hearing what I have to say."</p>
<p>"Say it quickly!" she cried.</p>
<p>She wrung her hands, her whole frame quivered with impatience. He seemed unwilling or unable to speak, while she, in her desperate anxiety, felt she could have forced the words from his lips. At last he led her to a chair, and stood beside her.</p>
<p>"In your presence, Philippa," he said, "I feel myself a recreant, a coward."</p>
<p>"I have been true to you," she returned, in a low, dull voice, curiously unlike her own; "for the whole ten years I have lived for you, and you only."</p>
<p>"I know it, and it is that which makes me mis-

<hi rend="center">THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP.</hi>

erable. If you were less noble, less true, I could tell you more easily."</p>
<p>For souse minutes it seemed to him as though she were distraught. She rose from her seat and, standing in front of him, placed her trembling hands on his shoulders, and looked searchingly into his face.</p>
<p>Is it really you, Marcus, come back to me? I seem to be awaking from a dream. Ten years is a long time and I have wished for you through every day of it! I have pictured this scene a hundred times--how you would hasten to take me its your arms, how you would rain kisses on my cheek. But it is all so different, and I seem to be awaking from a heavy sleep."</p>
<p>The sight of her anguish brought tears into his eyes. Gently and kindly he placed her in her chair again.</p>
<p>"I will tell you all that has happened to me," he said, "and you shall decide my fate. If, when you have heard it, you say 'Yes,' we will be married."</p>
<p>She looked at him with haggard eyes.</p>
<p>"I know," she faltered--"I know what you are going to tell me. I read it your eyes. You have learned to love another!"</p>
<p>"That is my misfortune, Philippa," he replied, moodily.</p>
<p>"Then it is true?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"It is perfectly true," he answered, with a sigh.</p>
<p>She clasped her hands with a gesture of wild despair.</p>
<p>"You are going to tell me about it," she said hoarsely. "Wait for a few minutes. I shall hear it soon enough, and I shall hear nothing afterward." She put up her hands as though to ward off a blow, "Just a few minutes," she went on. "I have waited ten years--for this! Let use try to forget if only for a moment, that my lover is false, and only remember that you are here." She sat silent for sometime, then quite suddenly she turned her face to his. "Do you remember that one year," she asked, before you went away, how happy we were? Do you remember the many sunsets we watched over the sea."</p>
<p>"Heaven help me, I do," he answered with a groan.</p>
<p>"Do you remember," she continued, "how you would row me out to sea to tell me how much you loved me, and how we used to cross the fields on Sunday morning while the church-bells were ringing, and you would tell use how merrily they should ring on our wedding-day?"</p>
<p>I remember, Philippa," he replied.</p>
<p>"For ten years," she went on passionately, "I have waited for you and lived for you--for you alone. For you I have made my home beautiful; to please you," she added, with unconscious pathos, "I chose my prettiest dress to-day. I have prayed for you every morning, and every night--indeed my life has been one long prayer for you. Now--now," she added, in a changed voice, "tell me what you have to say."</p>
<p>Major Hill hardly glanced round the tastefully furnished room in which he found himself. The pictures, the flowers, the ornaments had no attraction for him; his eyes could not leave the pale tortured face of the woman who loved him. He was ashamed, and hesitated to tell his story; yet something seemed to urge him on.</p>
<p>"Philippa," he began, "I have faced death almost as often as any man; I have been in the midst of perils that would have made even the bravest quail; but I have never known fear until now."</p>
<p>"And you are afraid of me!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"You are right; I am afraid of you," he returned, because, I have injured you deeply. Let me tell you, Philippa, I had every intention of being true to you. During the ten years that I was in India I do not believe that one thought of mine ever swerved from you. My profession was everything to me; its details occupied my mind to the complete exclusion of everything but yourself. I never cared for balls, parties, picnics, or flirtation; I never sought young girls' society. It was well known to all my fellow-officers that I was engaged to be married. During the whole ten years I had not, I assure you, Philippa, on the honor of a gentleman, even the least approach to a flirtation. My heart was true to you, so were my thoughts. I had no other plan in life, no other desire, than to come house and marry you and be happy. I dreamed of you waiting for me in this beautiful home of yours, and I was glad when the time came for me to return. It is hard for a man to confess to a weakness: I am ashamed to own mine. I went on board the P. and O. steamer which was to bring us home, thinking only of you. There was a girl on board--"</p>
<p>He saw her start; but, as she made no remark, he continued, with a hot flush:

</p>
<p>"A girl who was called Belle--a most beautiful creature. Her hair shone like gold, her eyes were blue as the waters of an Italian lake, her mouth was perfect, and to see her lips was to covet a kiss from them. She had a voice that was soft, sweet, and clear, and a laugh that stirred a man's pulses."</p>
<p>"The very opposite of me," she said, in a low, pained voice; and he was quite unconscious of his cruelty when he answered, eagerly:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Philippa," he continued, "I had no thought of treachery to you; but the moment my eyes rested on that girl's face I fell madly in love with her; and then, when I experienced the fever, the passion of love, I knew that I had never really loved you. The fierce love I had for this girl differed from my calm affection for you, as a seething torrent differs front a softly rippling brook. Do not think I yielded without a struggle. No man ever fought a harder fight with himself than I did, but I might as well have stood on the shore and bidden the waves recede as the tide rolled in, as try to quench the ardent love that consumed me. And my love was returned. I found out by accident that, she loved me--I need not tell you how--and, but for that discovery I should never have breathed a word to her of my passion. Oh, Philippa, only those who have loved can form ever so faint an idea--"</p>
<p>"You loved her as I loved you," interrupted Philippa, and he moved uneasily.</p>
<p>"Yes, such was the case. When I found that she loved me, I told her about you, Philippa--that I was engaged to marry you, that you had waited ten years for me; and she wept until I thought her heart would break. 'What shall we do?' she asked me. 'Would she--this woman who loves you--die, do you think, if you left her?' I answered 'No'--that I hoped not."</p>



<p>"No," broke in Philippa, with a low bitter laugh; "I shall not die. My happiness, my love will die; but not myself."</p>
<p>She will not die,' Belle said; 'but I am sure I shall.' Philippa," he went on, with some embarrassment, "it was Belle who sent me to you. She said, 'The woman who loves you, Marcus, is good and noble. She loves you more than herself; she values your happiness more than she values her own. Go to her, tell her how dearly we love each other, and ask her to set you free.' That was Belle's message to you, Philippa."</p>
<p>"Belle's message!" she repeated, with a bitter laugh. "And you--what of you?"</p>
<p>"I leave my fate in your hands. Philippa. If you say that I must keep my promise and marry you, I will do so, even should it cause the death of Belle. If you give me my freedom, I shall say that you are the most generous of women."</p>
<p>"You want me to sacrifice myself," she said, with a hard, cold voice.</p>
<p>"I want you, Philippa, to do just as you will," he answered. "If you wish it, I will keep to my engagement, and we will be married; but I am afraid we should not be happy. It--it grieves me to utter the words--I love Belle, and life would never be tolerable to me without her."</p>
<p>"And if I give you what you ask," she said--"your freedom?"</p>
<p>She saw how his face brightened at the word, and her heart died within her.</p>
<p>I shall marry Belle, and we shall both be your true friends, and bless you for your generosity while we live."</p>
<p>"You my true friend!" she exclaimed scornfully. "A false lover can never be a true friend. If we part, it is forever. There call be no looking back, no pretence of friendship; we part forever."</p>
<p>But the "forever" which would part him from Philippa would give him Belle. and that thought shone plainly enough in his eyes."</p>
<p>"I might have deceived you, Philippa," he said; "I might have come back to you, and kept my love for Belle secret; but you have the right to know and to judge, to decide what is best."</p>
<p>Ten long years had she waited and watched--all for this! She had prayed and labored and loved--all for this!</p>
<p>"I almost wish that you had deceived me," she said, with a despairing gesture, "and that I had died before I knew the truth."</p>
<p>"I hate myself for the pain I have inflicted on you," he said huskily.</p>
<p>How old is she Marcus?" asked Philippa. "I am twenty-nine, that is old, quite old; and I am ugly, too. How old is she?"</p>
<p>"Nineteen," he replied; and his face crimsoned.</p>
<p>"Nineteen! " she repeated. "That was my age when you went away. She is young and beautiful. Alas, alas, what chance have I?" She stood up before him and looked earnestly into the face that had been her loadstar for years. "I will give you your freedom," she said; "I cannot do otherwise. You force me, after a fashion, to sign my own death-warrant--I sign it. You are free!"</p>
<p>He stepped forward to clasp her hands; but she drew back with a haughty gesture.</p>
<p>"Nay," she cried, "spare me that! Do not let me see how pleased you are. It would only add to the cruelty. Show some little regret. You might affect some little sorrow after all these year's."</p>
<p>He quailed before the passion in her face and voice.</p>
<p>"Heaven knows I do regret it," he said, earnestly. "I would give up all I had in the world rather than pain you."</p>
<p>"Except your inclination and your fancy. You are free. To my lover, Marcus Hill, I bid an eternal farewell; to you, Major Hill, soon happily to wed a fair young bride, I bid good-day."</p>
<p>She turned away, and would have left the room without further remark, but he followed her crying:</p>
<p>"Philippa, do not leave me in that fashion! Bid me a kind farewell. I cannot bear that we should part thus, after all these years."</p>
<p>She raised her miserable face to his.</p>
<p>"How can I ?" she asked, coldly. "I gave you my love, and you have broken my heart; must I thank you for that? For ten years I have waited for your home-coming, and now you have deserted me for a fairer, fresher face. You must go. Do not ask me for kindness. Even men do not kiss the hand that smites them."</p>
<p>"Oh, Philippa," he implored, "stay one minute!"</p>
<p>"No," she answered, hurriedly, "it will be better not. In spite of the wrong you have done me, I love you so dearly that, if I remain here, where I can see and hear you, I shall be unable to conceal the anguish I feel. I have so much to say to you, so much to show you, but that will not interest you now. I was anxious to show you how everything had been arranged for you--for you only: My servants are preparing dinner for you; I must stop them. I must go from you now, and you are free to return to the girl with the golden hair and blue eyes."</p>
<p>She had reached the door by this time; and he was so paralyzed by her passionate outburst that he was powerless to speak.</p>
<p>"Good-by," she said. "I pass out of your life forever; but remember that no other woman will love you as I have done. Good-by!"</p>
<p>The next moment she had closed the door, and he was alone. Never did man feel more miserable, contemptible, base. He despised himself for the part he had played, yet he was so completely under the spell of blue-eyed Belle, that he could not resist the love that held him in thrall.</p>
<p>He waited some minutes to see if she would return, or send any message; then he took up his hat and went; and Hilldrop Priory saw Major Hill no more.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER III.</hi>

<p>HALF an hour later the bell from Miss Trafford's room rung, and was answered by her maid. No one had seen Major Hill leave the house, and the servants believed that he was still in the drawing-room with Miss Trafford. When, therefore, Sinclair entered her mistress' room, and saw her standing there deathly white, and with a cold hard expression on her face, she was shocked and astonished.</p>
<p>"Are you ill, miss?" she asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>"No; I rang for you. I want to say a few words. There will be no wedding. No master will ever come to Hilldrop Priory. Let all the preparations be stopped at once, and do not let a word of all that is said reach me." She turned away so that Sinclair could not see her face. "Go down-stairs at once and give the necessary instructions," added Miss Trafford, in a low voice, and without looking round; "and yon need not return until I ring."</p>
<p>Sinclair carried out her mistress' orders, spreading wonder and consternation among the whole household.</p>
<p>"They have quarrelled and parted." said one and all. "Poor Miss Trafford!"</p>
<p>Sinclair waited anxiously for the sound of the bell, but it never rang; and. when night came and there had been no summons, she grew alarmed. She ventured to disobey the orders she had received, and took some tea up-stairs. She knocked at the door, but there was no response. She went in without further delay, feeling frightened and distressed. Miss Trafford was just where she had left her in the afternoon, and there was the same set expression on her white face, the same proud look in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I told you not to come until I rang," she said, haughtily; "and I have not rung."</p>
<p>"I could not help it, miss. I hope yon will not be angry with me: I have listened for hours for the sound of the bell, and I had grown frightened."</p>
<p>" There is nothing to fear," returned Miss Trafford, coldly. "I will drink the tea. You need not return: I shall want nothing more until tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>In vain did the maid plead to remain with her; Miss Trafford was firm, and, assuring her that she would be much better alone, she dismissed her.</p>
<p>How that night passed, what sufferings the owner of Hilldrop passed, endured, no one will ever know; but, when the maid went to her mistress on the following morning, she found her lying on the floor like one dead, and the dark hair

had turned gray during the night. Miss Trafford was ill for some weeks. She had been a strong, healthy woman before this happened: when she left her room, she was feeble, haggard, and gray. From that time she never smiled; nor did she ever mention the name of the man who had so cruelly wronged her. She would not allow any newspapers to be brought to her, lest there should be any reference to him in them. She never again entered the drawing-room where she had bidden him farewell, and she firmly refused to receive visitors.</p>
<p>"I am dead to the world," she would say, "and do not want to hear anything of it."</p>
<p>So twenty long years went by, and everyone had grown used to her strange mode of life. Not once during that time had she passed beyond the Priory gates; nor had she gazed on any other faces save those of her own household, except one day--a time never to be forgotten--when the vicar, the Reverend Abel Darrell, almost forced his way into her presence: but he never repeated the attempt. She had never expressed the least wish to see anyone, never shown the slightest interest in anything until the overpowering desire came upon her to see a little child.</p>

<p>No wonder then that the utmost surprise was felt in the household! The old order of things would cease and a new one begin, if Miss Trafford was going to lead an ordinary life, to pay visits and receive them. She would be a very different person from the Miss Trafford who had been shut up in two rooms.</p>
<p>Philippa Trafford drove along the roads she had once known so well, until the carriage stopped before the Vicarage. The inmates were astounded when they heard who was the visitor. The vicar himself went to the door to receive her.</p>
<p>She looked at him with eyes that were dim with unshed tears.</p>
<p>"I have heard," she said, gently, "that you had a little daughter born today. I should like to see her, if you will permit me to do so."</p>
<p>The vicar declared, as well as his surprise would allow him, that he was delighted to receive Miss Trafford, and that he would be most proud to show her the baby. He had the good taste to look upon her visit as a matter of course, and not to allude to her twenty years of seclusion. He talked cheerfully to her; but the sad expression of her face touched him deeply, and it was with difficulty that he refrained front showing his sympathy.</p>
<p>Miss Trafford took her seat in the bay-window of the little drawing-room. Her worn face, gray hair, and sombre attire contrasted strongly with the glow and brightness outside.</p>
<p>"It is twenty years," said Miss Trafford, in a tremulous voice, "since I have looked upon the face of a little child; I should like to see yours."</p>
<p>The vicar was puzzled by the strange request of his visitor. He went to the nurse and consulted her. The worthy woman decided that in the circumstances all ordinary rules should be relaxed, and that miss Trafford should be invited to see the proud mother and the little babe.</p>
<p>"It will make her heart human again, sir." said the nurse, earnestly. "It will be better than all the teaching and preaching in the world."</p>
<p>When Mrs. Darrell was told that Miss Trafford wanted to see her and the little one, she was as surprised as she was pleased.</p>
<p>The room into which Miss Trafford was shown was a comfortable old-fashioned bed-chamber. The tall, dark figure, looking neither to the right nor to the left, came straight up to the bed on which lay the mother and child. Philippa bent over Mrs. Darrell, and kissed her. and, as she spoke, her voice softened with emotion.</p>
<p>"My dear" she said, "I am a loveless, joyless woman. I pursed a sorrow for twenty years, and a longing has come to me to look again upon the face of a little child."</p>
<p>"I hope the sight of mine may bring you, comfort," answered Mrs. Darrell, feebly, but fervently.</p>
<p>The nurse carefully took up the beautiful little baby-girl, who was enveloped in wraps amid soft white lace, and placed her in Miss Trafford's arms.</p>
<p>A tender look came into the haggard face; the lips that had not smiled for so many years quivered with emotion; tears gathered in her dark eyes. She stood watching the tiny face nestling near her bosom. The bright blue eyes opened once and looked at her, then closed sleepily.</p>
<p>"And I might have been a happy wife and mother," she said, unconscious that she was speaking loud: but--"</p>
<p>She paused abruptly. The sight was a touching one, the prematurely old sad-faced woman contrasting so forcibly with the fair young mother and the smiling babe.</p>
<p>"It does me good, my dear," she said suddenly to Mrs. Darrell. "My heart is softening. I have not cried for twenty years; "and then her tears fell like rain. "What name do you intend to give the little one?" she asked presently.</p>
<p>"I have not thought of it yet," answered Mrs. Darrell, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Miss Trafford looked up eagerly.</p>
<p>"Should you mind--would you object to give her my name?" she said, falteringly. "It is Philippa." She trembled with a strange repressed passion. "I should like," she went on, "a sweet little girl like yours to bear my name--Philippa. How I should love her."</p>
<p>The sound of her voice, as she uttered the words, brought tears to the nurse's eyes.</p>
<p>"I--I hope she will have a happy life," she continued, tremulously. I hope she will be happier than I have been. Are you willing, my dear?"</p>
<p>Quite willing," replied the vicar's young wife. "I shall be pleased and proud to give her your name."</p>
<p>The nurse and the housekeeper were in the roost, and to them Miss Trafford now turned.</p>
<p>"Bear witness to what I say," she said. "If this child bears my name, the name of the most forlorn woman who ever lived, I will give her Hilldrop Priory, with everything that belongs to me, when I die."</p>
<p>Exclamations of wonder and surprise broke from the listener's lips. They were incapable for the moment of realizing the full meaning of the words. And such was the first of the strange series of events that occurred in connection with Hilldrop Priory.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER IV.</hi>

<p>"I DO not know," said Miss Trafford, addressing Mrs. Darrell, "what Heaven may have in store for me. I am older than you. I may die soon, or I may live until I have suffered the full measure of human pain, but, when I die, all I have in the world will go to the child who bears my name--to your little girl."</p>
<p>"You are very good," said Mrs. Darrell, who was intensely surprised at Miss Trafford's decision to make her little baby-girl the heiress of Hilldrop Priory; but have you no relatives who have a stronger claim?"</p>
<p>"No; I am alone in the world. I have no kith or kin, and the child whose face has touched my heart shall be the one to inherit my fortune. I may never come here again, Mrs. Darrell, but you will send your child to me when she is old enough, and you will teach her to love me? Do you think," she added, pathetically, "that I am too crabbed and ugly for a child to love?"</p>
<p>"I do not," replied Mrs. Darrell. "Kind and good as you are, it will be easy to teach my little one to love you."</p>
<p>Miss Trafford went away as she came. She re-
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 7"/>

turned to her seclusion; but after a little time her life was enlivened by the smiles, the prattle, and the pretty ways of the lovely, fair-haired child who had been named after her. The poor lady seemed to hunger for little Philippa's presence, and missed no opportunity of having her at the Priory. She would have had her with her altogether; but she could not persuade the vicar and his wife to give her up. They would not part with the child; they allowed her, however, to spend as much time as she liked at the Priory.</p>
<p>Years passed on without any material change. Another little daughter was born at the Vicarage; but Miss Trafford never took the least interest in her, never made any allusion to her. Philippa was all in all to her; her love and interest were centred in Philippa; and the child repaid her with an almost passionate affection.</p>
<p>Miss Trafford lived until the girl reached her fifteenth year--until she was old enough to understand the sad story of her benefactress' love and blighted life. If Philippa Darrell had ever met Major Hill, she would have greatly astonished that gentleman by giving him her opinion of his conduct; and throughout her life she retained a feeling of scorn and resentment toward him.</p>
<p>Miss Trafford was consistent to the last. She would see no lawyer--she would consult no one about the terms of her will; she made it herself. It ran thus:</p>
<p>"I, Philippa Trafford, spinster, of Hilldrop Priory, in the county of Kent, do hereby give an bequeath the mansion called Hilldrop Priory, with all that it contains, also all the land belonging thereto, and all the moneys possessed by me at the time of my death, together with everything I have, to Philippa Darrell, the eldest daughter of Abel and Louisa Darrell, of the Vicarage at Ravelston;--and I pray Heaven that the child whom I thus enrich may be happier than I have been!"</p>
<p>Not one word was said as to what Philippa Darrell herself was to do with the property--how, in her turn, she was to dispose of it. It was entirely hers, to do with as she would. The revenues amounted to four thousand pounds per annum. The vicar decided that, until Philippa reached her twenty-first year, she should remain with him at the Vicarage; her money, except what she required for necessary expenses, should accumulate. When she attained her majority, perhaps she would divide this accumulated money, keeping half of it for herself, and giving the other half to her sister, Elena. Hilldrop Priory could in the meantime be kept up, all the old servants being retained.</p>
<p>Miss Trafford's will caused no surprise, for it was well known how the property was to be disposed of. A few people did express astonishment that the vicar and his wife should remain at the Vicarage, until he said that not one stone of the Priory belonged to him; it was all Philippa's.</p>
<p>It was a curious household at the Vicarage--the father and mother possessing but narrow means, the eldest daughter a wealthy heiress, the second daughter without any dowry, except that which her sister might choose to give her. Two sisters, so nearly of an age, yet with prospects so different! They differed, too, greatly in character and features.</p>
<p>Philippa was a queenly blonde, with fair shining hair and bright blue eyes. She was indeed one of Nature's favorites, for, in additition to her beauty of face and grace of figure, she possessed an exalted mind and a generous and kindly heart. Elena was tall, with a dark vivacious face and one of the most restless spirits ever given to woman. Her one idea of bliss was to travel, to see the world. As for home-life, domestic pleasures, or marriage, Elena never thought of them.</p>
<p>So the little household remained, until an unforeseen event happened. Sir Cyril Laurayne returned from a long residence abroad, and took up his abode at Broome.</p>
<p>Broome was the name of the estate lying on the other side of Ravelston, and at a distance of ten miles from Hilldrop Priory.</p>
<p>To Broome Sir Cyril Lauraynereturned after an absence of several years; and It, was soon after his arrival that lie fell deeply in love with the vicar's fair daughter, Philippa Darrell.</p>
<p>He was still a young man, not more than twenty-eight, tall and handsome, frank, generous, and hospitable. He had returned to England, determined to make his estate a model, and to perform all the duties devolving upon an English gentleman and landlord.</p>
<p>The young baronet was not more deeply in love with Philippa Darrell than she was with him. They were engaged, and the match was pronounced on all sides to be a most suitable one. The country people said it was a lucky thing for the vicar and his wife; and as they were both very popular, no one begrudged them the good fortune that had befallen them.</p>
<p>There was one unusual proceeding in connection with the happy event--Philippa would agree to no marriage-settlements being made. As the vicar and his wife were simple honest people, it seemed to them that she had a right to please herself in such a matter.</p>
<p>"Cyril has Broome and I have Hilldrop," Philippa would say. "What need is there for settlements? All that I have in I the world is his, all that he has is mine. Why trouble about jointures and lawyers?"</p>
<p>Sir Cyril would not interfere with her decision. He said simply:</p>
<p>"A shall be just as you please."</p>
<p>Sir Cyril and Philippa were married, and after the honeymoon, went to reside at Broome and for some months all went merrily as a marriage-bell. Then the vicar died, and his wife did not long survive him; and Elena Darrell went to live with her sister.</p>
<p>She was very happy at Broome, and it was during her stay there that she met her fate in the person of a handsome young Spanish captain named Pablo Suarez. That they should fall in love with each other was not remarkable, for they had much in common. The captain liked travel and excitement, had no taste for domestic pleasures, did not understand the meaning of the word "home," and cared for nothing but change and adventure. Captain Suarez and Elena Darrell admitted laughingly that they must have been made for each other. and on their marriage decided to visit the Continent, travel through Spain and Italy, explore Germany, and linger in the spots they most admired. In short, they sketched for themselves an ideal life: and they carried out their programme in every detail until war broke out in Spain, and then Captain Suarez was compelled to rejoin his regiment. They had one daughter, a pretty dark-eyed child, Mercedes, who was placed at school at Seville while her mother accompanied her husband through the whole of the war.</p>
. . . . . . . . .
<p>It was a lovely June morning; "the hills were tipped with gold," and the sun was shining gloriously on the yellow patches of Broome. Nothing could have looked fairer than the grand old mansion and the beautiful grounds that surrounded it. The long windows of the drawing-room opened on to a lawn where two stately cedars stood. Under the drooping boughs of one was a little group-Sir Cyril Laurayne, reading a newspaper and smoking a cigar; Lady Laurayne, a fair, graceful woman of queenly presence, who was sitting near him, and a lovely, fair-haired child, who was close by her side.</p>
<p>Constance Laurayne was tall for her age, being
<pb n="8 THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP."/>

only eight years old. Her long fair hair lay in child-like fashion over her shoulders, a mass of rippling gold; her pretty blue dress showed to perfection the graceful limbs. And this fair-haired little damsel was heiress of Hilldrop--the girl whose life was to be an eventful one.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril and Lady Laurayne often lamented that they had no other children. They certainly combined to worship the child and impress upon her that she was heiress of Hilldrop. In her innocent fashion, little Constance enjoyed her dignity. Lady Laurayne was always speaking to her of Philippa Trafford. Constance was too young to understand a love-story, but she knew that the lonely mistress of Hilldrop had died because some one had been very cruel to her.</p>
<p>She gave Hilldrop Priory to me, just as I shall give it to you, Constance," Lady Laurayne would say; and the child would look up at her with great wondering eyes.</p>
<p>On this fair June day Sir Cyril wished Lady Laurayne to drive over to Hilldrop with him; but she declined, though the day was so clear and bright--she did not feel well; and how often afterwards Sir Cyril remembered, with a bitterness of mortal pain, that that was the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>"I will not go with you, Cyril, this morning," she said. "I feel fatigued, and will rest. You go, dear, and take Connie with you."</p>
<p>Both parents looked at the graceful little figure beneath the spreading boughs of the cedar.</p>
<p>"The heiress of Hilldrop," lauged Sir Cyril, "and a lovely little heiress she is."</p>
<p>She has the sweet, serious face that is given to angels by the old Italian masters," said Lady Laurayne. "I have a strange fancy about the child. I hope she will have a happy life."</p>
<p>So do I; and I see no reason why it should be otherwise. Philippa. Connie," cried Sir Cyril, "would you like to ride over to Hilldrop with me? You call have your pony, and I will ride Kitty--she wants exercise."</p>
<p>The child turned to him with a glowing face, her blue eyes beaming with delight.</p>
<p>"I should love it, papa," she answered. "But will not mamma go with us?"</p>
<p>"Not this morning, darling," said the gentle voice. "I am tired."</p>
<p>The next moment the child's arms were round her mother's neck, and her loving lips kissing the fair, pale face.</p>
<p>"If you are tired, I will not leave you," she said, affectionately, tightening the clasp of her arms.</p>
<p>But Lady Laurayne laughed, and bade her go, remarking that she would be better when they returned.</p>
<p>"You look very pale, and not at all well," said Sir Cyril. "We will not go to-day."</p>
<p>But Lady Laurayne would not hear of their staying with her.</p>
<p>"The ride will do you both good." she said, and I shall be ready to welcome you home."</p>
<p>So Sir Cyril and his daughter consented to go; and, as they rode away, Lady Laurayne watched them front the lawn, her eyes beaming with pride and affection.</p>
<p>Along the lovely country lanes Sir Cyril and his little daughter rode together, chatting pleasantly till they reached Hilldrop.</p>
<p>Never had the old Priory looked fairer than on this bright morning. Sir Cyril took the child, as he had often done before, through all the rooms; and the little heiress' sweet face seemed to brighten the place, and for the moment to banish the gloom that reigned there.</p>
<p>This will be your home some day, Constance," said Sir Cyril.</p>
<p>"But you and mamma must live with me, or it will not be home," she answered, pouting.</p>
<p>Then Sir Cyril took his daughter into the grounds. They climbed a hill front which they could obtain a glimpse of the sunlit sea. The scene was strikingly picturesque--the old house nestling among the the trees, the grand sweep of lordly elms and oaks, the outline of the distant hills. Sir Cyril held the little hand tightly to his own.</p>
<p>Some day my dear," he said, all t his will be yours--a fair inheritance indeed; and I hope that when it falls into your hands you will make good use of it."</p>
<p>But she was too young to comprehend the full meaning of the words.</p>
<p>"Papa," she said, "must I live here all my life?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell, my dear," he answered, gently.</p>
<p>"Who will have it when I die?" she asked, wonderingly.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril smiled half sadly.</p>
<p>"I cannot see into futurity," he replied; "but I do know that my Constance is heiress of Hilldrop."</p>
<p>Young as she was, the child never forgot that visit or those words.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER V.</hi>

<p>WHEN Sir Cyril and his daughter returned from their ride, they did not find Lady Laurayne ready to welcome them. She had gone to her room, feeling very ill, and she never left it again.</p>
<p>She was suffering from a severe attack of typhoid fever, and from the first there was but little prospect of recovery. Sir Cyril sent to London for skilled physicians and trained nurses: no precaution was neglected. But it was all in vain; for the cruel fever continued to gain ground. and the sweet woman who had made everyone around her so happy grew weaker day by day. Sadness and gloom reigned in the household, tearful, pallid faces were visible at every turn. Her ladyship was greatly beloved. Her husband worshipped her; Constance loved her with all the passionate ardor of her young nature: her friends, dependents, and servants had the truest affection and esteem for her. The news of her fatal illness cast a deep gloom over the neighborhood, and universal sympathy was felt for Sir Cyril in his trouble, for it was well known how devoted he was to his young wife.</p>
<p>Nothing could save the poor lady; and she died at the close of a fair July day--died in her husband's arms, her head on his breast and her child clinging to her--died happy, with full love and trust. Shortly before her death she whispered to Sir Cyril:</p>
<p>"I had no settlement, you know; all that was mine was yours; but you will see that Constance has Hilldrop--you will make it all right, dear?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I will leave it to her, by will. There shall be no mistake about it, my darling. It is your present to your child; but it shall come through me."</p>
<p>Constance, clinging to the dearly-loved mother who was so soon to pass out of her life, heard and remembered the words.</p>
<p>An hour afterward the heart-rending wailing of a desolate child, mingled with the deep-drawn, passionate sobs of a man, was heard, and gloom, desolation, and sorrow reigned supreme in the mansion at Broome.</p>
<p>Lady Laurayne was not buried in the great gloomy vault where the Lauraynes for many generations had been laid to rest. "Let my grave be where the wind may blow over it," she said, "where the rain and the dew may fall upon it, and the leaves drop over it." Sir Cyril let her have her wish; and Philippa, Lady Laurayne, sleeps under the lime-trees in the old church-yard at Ravelston, and the wind that sweeps through the green boughs sings the requiem of one of the sweetest and must lovable of women.</p>
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 9"/>

<p>No man could have mourned for his wife more deeply or more sincerely than did Sir Cyril Laurayne. He grew thin, pale, and silent; he was interested in nothing but his little daughter Constance, whom he would hardly allow out of his sight. At last he fell ill--not dangerously. Yet ill enough seriously to alarm his friends. He was advised to seek change of air and scene; but he clung fondly to his desolate home and motherless child.</p>
<p>He refused many kind and urgent invitations; but at length he received a very pressing one from Lady Aston, a distant cousin of his. She begged him to visit Aston Hall for a few weeks, and to bring his little daughter with him.</p>
<p>At first he refused--he would not entertain the idea for a moment; but it was suggested to him that the change would be beneficial to the child. Then he relented, and finally consented to go.</p>
<p>Aston Hall was a charming modern mansion standing a few miles from the large and fashionable watering-place of Brightstone. It seemed the very place for Sir Cyril. He could have the quiet of the country when he preferred it, and, when he wished, all the life and animation of Brightstone. Lady Aston told him also that, although her house was generally filled with visitors, he could be as much alone as he chose.</p>
<p>Lady Aston herself was an elderly lady who had spent a long and brilliant life in the world of fashion, and, despite her advanced years, she enjoyed all its gayeties and festivities as much as ever she had done. She was tall and stately and, though her hair was white her dark eyes were keen and bright, and, when attired in her black velvet and point-lace, she still looked strikingly handsome. She delighted in visitors and match-making, and she had already decided in her own mind that, for a young and handsome man like Sir Cyril, to spend the remainder of his life in grief and mourning would be positively wicked.</p>
<p>"He has had one good wife, and has lost her," she would say: "now it is his duty to make some other woman happy. We must none of us be selfish."</p>
<p>If anyone reminded her that she had not carried out her theory, that she had not married again, Lady Aston would answer, with a twinkle in her eye, that she had not been so sure of making anyone happy.</p>
<p>The journey was a sad one both for father and child. It was the first ever taken without the beloved wife and mother; and it was not until they reached Aston hall that the gloom was dispelled.</p>
<p>Lady Aston received her visitors very kindly. She cook Constance in her arms and affectionately kissed the fair sad face; she welcomed Sir Cyril warmly.</p>
<p>"I sent all my guests out to-day," she said, "so that the house night be quiet when you arrived. When you came here last, Philippa was with you; and I knew you must get over that," she added, meaningly.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril stood for some moments as though transfixed.</p>
<p>You are right," he answered, at last; "I have been thinking of that visit during the journey."</p>
<p>"Forget it now," she said, briskly. "I know there is no comfort for a grief like yours. Time is the only healer. But you will find consolation in this sweet little girl."</p>
<p>Constance turned to tier father, and whispered that she would be his comfort, that she loved him with her whole heart.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Sir Cyril went out for a ramble. He had asked Constance to go with him; but Lady  Aston advised, as the child looked pale and tired, that she should rest indoors for a while.</p>
<p>"Let her stay here and play," she urged. "She does not look like a child who has ever known what it is to play."</p>
<p>When Sir Cyril had left the house, she turned to Constance and said:</p>
<p>"My dear, you should cheer papa and try to make him happy, instead of looking sadly at him with those great melancholy eyes."</p>
<p>"How can we be happy," questioned the child, "when mamma is dead?"</p>
<p>"If your mamma could see you now, the first thing she would wish you to do would be to look bright and happy for your papa's sake."</p>
<p>"Do you think so, Lady Aston?" Constance asked, wonderingly. "I would do anything to please mamma. Oh, dear mamma!" And the child's fair head seemed bent with the weight of her sorrow.</p>
<p>Tears rose to her ladyship's eyes at sight of such grief.</p>
<p>"Go to the blue boudoir, my dear," she said. "You will find some toys there."</p>'
<p>And Constance went, little dreaming what she should find there.</p>
<p>The blue boudoir was one of the prettiest rooms in Aston Hall. It was ordinarily set aside for the use of lady-visitors, and was the perfection of comfort. The carpet was blue, the rich hangings were of the same color, and the furniture was upholstered to blue silk and velvet. A few exquisite water-colors hung upon the walls; choice flowers stood in the <hi rend="italic">jardini&egrave;res</hi>.</p>
<p>The sunlight was streaming in through the lace curtains as Constance entered, and in the midst of the glow sat a lady busily engaged in writing. She was not more than thirty, and was a truly beautiful woman. She had that strange combination of dark eyes and golden hair which is so charming and so rare. Her features were delicate and refined, and her hair was plainly dressed so as to show its abundance. Her gown was the perfection of elegant simplicity, her white fingers glittered with gems, and as she bent over the table her attitude was one of exceptional grace.</p>
<p>In Lady Tollemache, widow of the late Sir Alfred Tollemache, one saw a perfect woman of the world, beautiful, graceful, and amiable--a woman completely devoted to herself and her own interests. Although there was a great difference between them in point of age, she and Lady Aston were good friends. Lady Tollemache had been a widow for two years, the first of which she had spent in mourning and seclusion, the second in visiting her friends and, the envious said, watching for an opportunity of making a second and even more brilliant marriage than her first. On the death of her husband she was left in rather straitened circumstances, and out of her slender income she had to provide for the education of her two little daughters. Lady Tollemache was one of those people who know only the bright side of life. She had loved her husband in a placid, sensible fashion; she mourned for him with the greatest decorum, wearing just the proper amount of crape, and gliding from black into lilacs and grays. Tollemache Park, where she had lived during her married life, had passed with the remainder of the entailed estates to the next of kin, and Lady Tollemache, resolving to have freedom and enjoyment, sent her twin daughters to school while she sought change among her friends.</p>
<p>She was always a welcome guest at Aston Hall. Lady Aston was fond of her, and lookers-on, who generally see most of the game, declared that her ladyship had, from the beginning of Sir Cyril's widowerhood, made up her mind that he should marry her fair friend. Whether Lady Tollemache knew of this or not it was impossible to say; but, when she heard that the handsome and wealthy widower, Sir Cyril Laurayne, was expected at the Hall, she accepted an invitation with alacrity. Evidently she anticipated a pleasant visit, for she ordered new toilets in which there was not a vestige of mourning.</p>
<pb n="10 THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP."/>

<p>Lady Tollemache looked up from her writing when she heard the opening of the door. Standing on the threshold was a child, who was gazing at her with deep, unfathomable eyes--a beautiful child, with a veil of golden hair falling over her black dress. Lady Tollemache smiled when she saw the little black-robed figure. She knew perfectly well who it was.</p>
<p>For some moments the child and Lady Tollemache gazed at each other. The lady looked with calm deliberation into the eyes of the child; the child looked with something like fear and expectation into those of the stranger. Then Lady Tollemache said, sweetly:</p>
<p>"Come in, my dear."</p>
<p>Constance entered and went up to her, and Lady Tollemache held out her hand.</p>
<p>"Who are you, my dear?" she asked. "A stranger? We do not often see little goldenhaired girls wandering about the Hall. What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Constance Laurayne," answered the child.</p>
<p>"Sir Cyril's little daughter!" exclaimed her lady ship, with a soft laugh. "Kiss me, my dear."</p>
<p>But the child's heart did not warm to her, and the light laugh jarred upon her sensitive ears. She had a strange child-like instinct that there was something insincere about the beautiful stranger.</p>
<p>"I have two little girls like you," said Lady Tollemache, smoothing the child's hair caressingly.</p>
<p>"Have you?" cried Constance. "Are they here?" She seemed delighted at the prospect of having playmates.</p>
<p>"No; unfortunately they are not here. I wish they were. The are both at school," her ladyship replied. "I should like them to be with me; I love children."</p>
<p>The blue eyes looking so earnestly into hers darkened. The child could not tell why, but to her the words had not a true ring. Constance had the keen, subtle instinct that all sensitive children have; and, as the dark eyes looked into hers and the white hands caressed her, distrust and something akin to dislike filled her mind. She moved as though she were about to retire.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" asked Lady Tollemache. "Do not leave me. What did you come for?"</p>
<p>"Lady Aston told me I should find some toys here," Constance replied.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes; they are in the cabinet!" Lady Tollemache said. "I will get them for you."</p>
<p>She found them, showed the child how to use them, and was kindness itself to her. She talked to her, and tried by every means in her power to amuse her; but she won neither Constance's liking nor her heart. Yet she was so fair to gaze upon that the big blue eyes never left her face. At length Lady Tollemache, with a dazzling smile, asked:</p>
<p>"Why do you look at me so earnestly, little Constance?"</p>
<p>"Because," answered the child, "you look like a picture." And her ladyship was delighted at the simple words.</p>
<p>"Stay with me awhile, my dear," she said. Then she looked at the child with a curious searching expression. "Why," she said, suddenly, "you must be the little lady of whom I have heard so much, the Heiress of Hilldrop!"</p>
<p>And Constance, with the pretty childlike dignity that became her so well, answered:</p>
<p>"Yes, I am the heiress of Hilldrop."</p>
<p>"A fortunate little heiress too," said Lady Tollemache, smiling.</p>
<p>Oh, no, not fortunate!" was the child's quick reply. "No one can call me fortunate, because my mother is dead."</p>

<p>"Ah, true," said her ladyship. "Still, you are fortunate to hare so kind a papa."</p>
<p>Then she took the child upon her knee, and by a series of well-directed questions drew from her many details of the life at Broome. She talked to her of the dear dead mother, and did her best to win the girl's heart, but without avail. She answered all Lady Tollemache's questions, told her all about her mother's illness, how dearly her father had loved her, and how, since her death, he had grown pale and thin.</p>

<p>"You must be papa's comfort now, Constance," said her ladyship, "and do all you can to make him happy."</p>
<p>During the whole time she spoke Constance noticed that she seemed to be listening intently. It did not occur to the innocent child that Lady Tollemache had prepared a tableau which she intended for Sir Cyril's benefit. Her ladyship was anxious that he should find her with his motherless child in her arms--for she knew the value of first impressions.</p>
<p>Suddenly her ladyship's face flushed and her dark eyes flashed. She heard a rich deep voice in the distance calling:</p>
<p>Constance, Constance! Where are you?"</p>
<p>"That is your papa," whispered Lady Tollemache. "Tell him that you are here."</p>
<p>She tightened her clasp of the child so that she could only raise her head and answer:</p>
<p>"I am here, papa--here in the blue boudoir!"</p>
<p>Sir Cyril opened the door hastily, and his astonishment was evident when his eyes fell upon the beautiful woman, so affectionately caressing his little girl.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "I thought my little daughter was here alone. I am intruding?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," she assured him, with a gracious smile. Then she held out her jewelled white hand to him. "You are Sir Cyril Laurayne?" she said. "Lady Aston told us you were coming. I am Lady Tollemache, and I have been making friends with your little girl."</p>
<p>She still held Constance fast in her arms, and the child looked at her father with wistful eyes, as though she would say, "she is not true; do not believe her--she is not true."</p>
<p>"She has been telling me about Broome," her ladyship went on, smiling sweetly.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril's face had grown pale with emotion; the sight of the child in the fair woman's arms brought back so forcibly the memory of her mother.</p>
<p>"My whole heart went out to your little girl as soon as I saw her sweet sad face," continued Lady Tollemache. "In all the wide world there is nothing that can make up for what Heaven has taken from her. I feel for her the more keenly as I have two little daughters of my own."</p>
<p>"Are they here?" asked Sir Cyril.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, no. I am compelled for the time to keep them at school. I cannot have them with me."</p>
<p>She sighed deeply, and, bending over Constance kissed her cheek. Some impulse made the child spring front her arms and hurry to her father.</p>
<p>"She is rather shy," said Sir Cyril. "You are very kind to my little daughter; I am grateful to you."</p>
<p>But Constance, unable to express what she thought and felt, could not restrain her tears.</p>
<p>"Do not cry, Constance," said Sir Cyril, gently.</p>
<p>Lady Tolleniache bent over the child and kissed her again.</p>
<p>"She is crying because I remind her of her mother," she said, tenderly.</p>
<p>And Sir Cyril did not doubt that that was the cause.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER VI.</hi>

<p>BEFORE Lady Tollemache bad been many hours under the same roof with him, she bad come to the conclusion that she might do worse than win Sir

Cyril Laurayne for her husband. She was really in love with him--after her own fashion. He was handsome, he was the owner of a large estate, and he had no incumbrance, except his pretty little daughter. She would not perhaps have married him if he had had a son, as in that case she would always have held a secondary position; but, as matters stood, nothing could be better. Nor was it altogether self interest that prompted her, She really liked the handsome widower, and would have been willing to marry him had he been less rich and less popular.</p>
<p>It was all right so far. She had herself decided, and others had privately agreed, that such a marriage would be a most excellent thing for her as well as for Sir Cyril. The next question was, how could that impression be conveyed to him? Clever Lady Tollemache knew the way to his heart--she devoted herself to his daughter. She talked, with tears in her dark eyes, of the sacrifice she had to make in keeping her dear children at school--some people shrewdly suspected that the fair widow was pleased to have them out of the way--and she contrived to spend the greater part of her time with Constance; but, although she loaded her with presents and was kindness itself to her, she never won the honest heart of the child. When she was with Sir Cyril, it was never of himself or herself that she spoke, but always of Constance. A mutual interest in the child drew them together. If Sir Cyril thought she was looking pale, was out of spirits, or in any way ailing, it was to Lady Tollemache he went for advice. The beautiful widow never wearied of listening; she soothed his anxieties, calmed his distress, gave him cheering words.</p>
<p>Her ladyship took the child out for long rambles in the morning, or pleasant drives in the afternoon, and Sir Cyril naturally grew interested in the charming woman who was so kind and gracious to him and to his.</p>
<p>One day in the presence of Lady Aston, Sir Cyril said to his daughter:</p>

<p>"Connie, how kind Lady Tollemache is to you! Do you love her?"</p>
<p>"No," answered the child, promptly. "I do not."</p>
<p>Lady Aston smiled.</p>
<p>"How is that?" asked Sir Cyril. "Why do you not love her, my dear?"</p>
<p>"I do not believe in her," was the quick reply.</p>
<p>Lady Aston laughed outright.</p>
<p>"The child is jealous," she said. "I told you, Sir Cyril, that you would spoil her. She wants a good step-mother, since Heaven has taken her own mother."</p>
<p>Sir Cyril made no reply, but kissed the sweet upturned face. Probably at that moment he had not dreamed of putting another woman in her dead mother's place.</p>
<p>Although the danger was vague and intangible, and the child, even to herself could not have put it into words, she was pleased and relieved when she and tier father left Aston. They traveled for some time in the lake district, then went yachting in the Northern seas, and afterward they returned to Broome.</p>
<p>Philippa, Lady Laurayne, had been dead a little over a year when Sir Cyril sent for his daughter one morning, saying that he wished particularly to see her. He was waiting four her in the library when Constance came tripping in. She was nine years old now, and was both tall and well-formed for her age. She stood before him, slight and fair, her golden hair streaming over her shoulders. Sir Cyril clasped her in his arms and covered her face with kisses. He had something to say to her, but he did not quite know how to begin.</p>
<p>"Connie, my dear," he said, at last, "you love me, and you desire my happiness above all things. do you not?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered; "and I will make you happy, papa."</p>
<p>"I have found someone who also desires to make me happy."</p>
<p>"I can make you happy, papa darling," she said, stroking his face. "You need not--indeed you need not--have anyone else but me."</p>
<p>"My dear little daughter," he said gently, "I am going to be married. I am going to marry Lady Tollemache. She will come here to live with us and take care of us both."</p>
<p>"Lady Tollemache!" exclaimed the child, in dismay. "Oh, papa, we do not want her--we do not indeed!"</p>
<p>"I want her, Connie," he said gravely; "and you will want her when you are a few years older."</p>
<p>"No," she cried, "I never shall! I have my own mamma in heaven, papa."</p>
<p>"Ah, my darling, but you will need one on earth!" he answered, patting her cheek. "You will find it out as you grow older. You must be good and docile, and, when Lady Tollemache comes, you must try to love and obey her. She loves you very much, and I want you to love her."</p>
<p>"I never can," was the sobbing reply. "I tried before, but I could not. Oh, papa, do not have anyone here with us; we are so happy alone!"</p>
<p>The day came at last when Sir Cyril brought his new wife home. There were no outward signs of rejoicing--everyone felt that they would be out of place; but the grand old mansion was made to look very bright and cheerful.</p>
<p>All the household, except Sarah King, the nurse, were prepared to welcome the new mistress. To Sarah, the faithful nurse, who had attended the heiress of Hilldrop from the hour of her birth, it seemed little less than sacrilege that another mistress should be brought to Broome--and so soon too. Against the advice of the other servants she dressed the child in black; when the housekeeper remonstrated, she made a compromise and substituted a white dress with black ribbons.</p>
<p>"He shall have something to put him in mind of his first wife," she muttered to herself.</p>
<p>There was no ringing of bells when the new Lady Laurayne came home to Broome; there was no demonstration of welcome. The domestics received their new mistress with quiet respect: but in the heart of the little heiress there was hot anger and bitter indignation.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril gave orders that she should be brought down into the drawing-room after dinner; and thither, in her white dress and black ribbons, Sarah King conducted her.</p>
<p>"Little Comstance!" cried Lady Laurayne, opening her arms.</p>
<p>But Constance stood shyly aloof.</p>
<p>"Why has the child those black ribbons on?" asked Sir Cyril, angrily. "Who dressed her?"</p>
<p>"I did, sir," replied the nurse, who had not left the room.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril's face darkened.</p>
<p>"Take her away," he said, sternly, "and, when you have dressed her properly, bring her back to me."</p>
<p>In silence the nurse led the child from the room.</p>
<p>When Constance went to bid Sir Cyril good night, she kissed him with something like despair in her heart; then she went to the beautiful woman who sat watching her.</p>
<p>"Good-night, Lady Laurayne," she said.</p>
<p>Her ladyship smiled as she answered:</p>
<p>"What a very formal address, little Constance! Will yon not call me 'mamma?'"</p>

<p>"I cannot," the girl answered; "my mamma is in heaven."</p>
<p>"Then will you call me 'mother?'" said Lady Laurayne.</p>
<p>"Papa told me that I could have but one mother," was the quick reply.</p>
<p>Lady Laurayne smiled again.</p>
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 14"/>

<p>"This is most certainly a dilemma," she answered. "Well, call me anything you like, dear--only promise to love me."</p>
<p>The days went by, but Lady Laurayne was never unkind to her step-daughter. She could have inflicted many petty annoyances upon Constance; but she refrained from anything of the kind. She was never jealous of the great affection that existed between father and daughter; she rather encouraged it than otherwise. She never made complaints to Sir Cyril as she might have done, and every one said what a fortunate thing it was for the child that she had such an excellent step-mother.</p>
<p>Of the whole household, the little heiress of Hilldrop and her faithful nurse, Sarah King, were the only ones who distrusted the new mistress of Broome.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER VII.</hi>

<p>YOUNG as Constance was, she never forgot the first visit paid by Lady Laurayne to Hilldrop Priory. Sir Cyril drove them over one morning when the Priory was looking its fairest and best.</p>
<p>Her ladyship was delighted with it. She turned to her husband with a smile and a faint flush on her beautiful face.</p>
<p>"Do you know, Cyril," she said, "I would rather live here than at Broome. I prefer it, because it has a charm of antiquity."</p>
<p>"I am a little disappointed at hearing you say so," laughed Sir Cyril.</p>
<p>"We might live here for a month or two in the autumn," Lady Laurayue went on. "With these magnificent woods, this would be a charming autumn house. I think the trees are seen at their best in the autumn."</p>
<p>"We shall never live here, my dear ,"replied Sir Cyril. "Hilldrop belongs to Constance. Where she grows up, it will be hers, and she must live here."</p>
<p>The child was standing beside them. She heard every word of the conversation; and the time came when she reminded her step-mother of it.</p>
<p>Lady Laurayne looked quickly into her husband's face.</p>
<p>"I have heard that before," she said. "At Aston people were always talking about the little heiress of Hilldrop. But how is it. Why must Hilldrop so surely go to her?"</p>
<p>"It was never mine," answered Sir Cyril. "It was given to my first wife by Miss Trafford; and Philippa had some peculiar ideas. She did not like marriage-settlements. We were both young, and very much in love, and we were married without any."</p>
<p>"Without any marriage-settlements? How strange!" cried Lady Laurayne.</p>
<p>"It seems strange to me now," went on Sir Cyril; "but at the time I thought of nothing but my wife's deep love and trust. She wished me to have share of everything she had; but it was always understood that Constance was to have Hilldrop."</p>
<p>"Such a vague understanding would not content said Lady Laurayne.</p>
<p>"I have made it quite safe," remarked Sir Cyril. "Shortly after my wife died I made my will, and in that Constance is made heiress of Hilldrop beyond dispute."</p>
<p>These woods were remembered afterward both by Lady Laurayne and the girl whom they concerned.</p>
<p>"Constance is a very fortunate child," said her ladyship, bending down to kiss her. "I should like a Hilldrop Priory all my own."</p>
<p>"I wish I could give you one," laughed Sir Cyril; "but in all England there is not another Hilldrop."</p>
<p>All the rest of that day Lady Laurayne was more than usually thoughtful. That she was thinking of Hilldrop was evident from the fact that, when she did make any remark, it was of the Priory that she spoke.</p>
<p>"I wish," she said once, "that our entrance hall had as noble an appearance as that at Hilldrop."</p>
<p>Again she broke rather a long silence during dinner by saying suddenly:</p>
<p>"I like the arrangements of the picture-gallery at Hilldrop, Cyril, and the gallery is a finer one than ours."</p>
<p>Later on in the evening she remarked:</p>
<p>"I think the corridors at Hilldrop are wider than these, Cyril."</p>
<p>"I shall grow jealous of Hilldrop in time," he answered, with a smile.</p>
<p>Lady Laurayne had taken a violent fancy to the place, and for some days talked of but little else.</p>
<p>Day by day Sir Cyril grew fonder of and more devoted to his beautiful wife. Under her energetic rule Broome became one of the most hospitable mansions in the county. There was always something on the <hi rend="italic">tapis</hi>--a ball, a picnic, a garden-party, charades, or private theatricals. Lady Laurayne delighted in entertaining visitors; and she soon became one of the most popular of hostesses.</p>
<p>Sir Cyril never neglected any wish or desire that she expressed, and they were spoken of everywhere as a model pair. There were times when Lady Laurayne wondered if she held the same place in her husband's heart as his first wife had; she wondered if his thoughts went back to that peaceful time when Philippa reigned at Broome.</p>

<p>A great event happened soon after this--the birth of the heir of Broome; and then Sir Cyril's happiness was complete. There were chiming of bells and general rejoicing. Never was a babe more welcome. He was named Austin, after one of the early Lauraynes, who had especially distinguished himself. Sir Cyril's heart was so light, he was so happy, that he determined upon having Lady Laurayne's two little daughters brought home to Broome.</p>
<p>Constance was ten years old when her baby brother was born. She had looked forward with some curiosity to the home-coming of the little girls who were nearly her own age.</p>
<p>They did not much resemble their mother. Blanche was pale of face, tall and slender, with the promise of what would one day be a beautiful figure; but unfortunately, her hair, was unmistakably red. Edith had dark eyes and dark hair, her features were decidedly plain, and she was inclined to be stout.</p>
<p>They were not particularly amiable girls. They quarrelled a great deal between themselves: but in the presence of Sir Cyril they were always sweet-tempered. In the nursery many a battle royal was fought, many a wordy war raged hotly, many a skirmish took place, which was never known to the "authorities." Sir Cyril was always kindness itself to his step-daughters, and he loved his little son; but the great affection of his heart was for Constance--the child known throughout the house and in all the district as the heiress of Hilldrop.</p>
<p>So time passed on, nothing of importance taking place, until Constance had reached her twentieth year.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER VIII.</hi>

<p>TEN years had not wrought much change in the master and mistress of Broome. Sir Cyril was as handsome and as light of heart as he had ever been; and Lady Laurayne looked almost as fair as she had looked on the day of their marriage.</p>
<p>Time had done much for Constance; she had grown into a beautiful girl, and Sir Cyril did not
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 13"/>

disguise the fact that she was the very pride of his heart.</p>
<p>The years had passed so quickly, and despite a few drawbacks so happily, that neither Sir Cyril nor Lady Laurayne realized that their daughters were growing up; that it was time they were "presented," and began to take life seriously.</p>
<p>Constance Laurayne cared little for visiting and gayeties; and Sir Cyril, knowing this, had not sought to influence her. When she was seventeen, something had been said of her presentation at Court; but Constance had begged that it might be deferred, as she preferred the quiet happy home-life to any social triumphs. Sir Cyril yielded to her wish; and, instead of taking his daughter to town, he built for her a studio, where she could pursue her beloved art in peace.</p>
<p>Time had dealt gently with the twin sisters. Blanche, according to the promise of her childhood, had grown into a tall, slender girl with a beautiful figure. Her face was plain, but by no means unpleasant and she sang charmingly. Her great drawback was still her hair. Edith had grown unbecomingly stout, a state to which she greatly objected.</p>
<p>Lady Laurayne looked after the settlement of her daughters very earnestly. With Constance she did not interfere; that was Sir Cyril's affair, and doubtless he would do his best for her. The most eligible men in the county were the young Duke of Hartwell, Sir Harry Coombe, of Coombe; Lord Riversly, of Knowle; and Sir William Purton. Lady Laurayne certainly left no stone unturned to secure husbands for her girls, and she managed to have these gentlemen constantly at Broome; but the mother herself was so much more charming than her daughters that the girls had little chance of shining in her presence.</p>
<p>The four men all greatly admired Constance, but she never gave them any encouragement. Both Blanche and Edith had resolved to be Duchess of Hartwell--and, indeed, the achievement did not seem a very difficult matter to either of them, for the duke was a young, vain, and rather impressionable. A clever girl might have made an easy conquest of him; but neither Blanche nor Edith had talent sufficient for that. Constance was never unkind or contemptuous to the duke; she treated him with gentle consideration; but he would as soon have thought of wooing a princess of the blood royal as of asking the beautiful heiress to be his wife.</p>
<p>Their mother gave her daughters excellent advice.</p>
<p>"I am quite sure, my dear children," she said, "that, if you manage well, one of you may be Duchess of Hartwell. The duke seems equally smitten with Blanche's fine singing and beautiful figure and Edith's merry ways and dark eyes. I must trust a great deal to your common-sense and judgment. Edith, if you see that the duke is inclined to favor Blanche, and that there is a chance of his making her an offer, do not in any way interfere; but help your sister. It will be the most fortunate thing that could happen. Do not let any jealousy or rivalry spoil such a splendid prospect. And you, Blanche, if the duke prefers Edith, help your sister in every way you can."</p>
<p>The sisters did not regard each other too lovingly. The prize was a valuable one, and both were desirous of winning it.</p>
<p>Blanche looked down with some little disdain at her less-favored sister.</p>
<p>"I cannot say that you would make a very elegant duchess," she said, "especially as you grow stouter every day, Edith dear."</p>
<p>"And I'm sure I don't think your red hair would be any recommendation," retorted Edith.</p>
<p>Now, my dear children," interposed Lady Laurayne, in distress, "this just what I want to prevent, what I dread occurring. If this discord goes on, you will ruin each other's chances. Be patient and amiable, and praise, rather than disparage, each other."</p>
<p>But Lady Lauranye's lectures were all in vain. Neither sister could endure the thought that the other should win the duke.</p>
<p>For some weeks his grace seemed to be wavering between the two girls; he seemed equally attracted by both. If one had given way, the other must have been successful; but neither would do so. Blanche drew his attention so continually to the <hi rend="italic">embonpoint</hi> of her sister, to the probability of Edith becoming most alarmingly stout, that the duke took alarm--for he had a great aversion to stout women. Edith, in her turn. made so many quaint comments upon ruddy hair that though he could not he help laughing at them, he took fright again, and determined not to choose either.</p>
<p>That hope dispelled, stars of lesser magnitude appeared in the Broome firmament; but, strangely enough, none of them showed any disposition to take Lady Laurayne's daughters off her hands.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER IX.</hi>

<p>"CONSTANCE," said Sir Cyril, turning to his daughter, "have you read Lady Dresden's letter?"</p>
<p>"No, papa; I did not know she had written."

</p>
<p>"I wish you to read it, as it, concerns yourself. Never mind the flowers just now"--for her hands were filled with lilies and roses. "You want to paint a picture from them; I will paint one for you instead. Come and read this letter, and then picture yourself as the belle of the season."</p>
<p>"That I call never do," she answered, with a smile. "The only season that interests me is the season of flowers."</p>
<p>"Read the letter, and you will see," said Sir Cyril.</p>
<p>Lady Dresden had been all old friend and school-fellow of the late Lady Laurayne's. She had loved her in life, lamented her in death, and she kept up a friendship and correspondence with Sir Cyril and Constance. Her great desire was to present Constance Laurayne at Court. She had been to Broome several times, and had been struck with the uncommon beauty and rare character of the heiress of Hilldrop but she had found fault with her training.</p>
<p>"The girl is a dreamer." she said to Sir Cyril. "She will spend all her time reading poetry and dreaming among flowers, if you allow it. She must come to London and make her debut. I will present her. Nothing will make me happier than to present Philippa's daughter. She has rare beauty and grace, and will make a sensation even among the London belles."</p>
<p>"I will talk to her," said Sir Cyril, resolutely.</p>
<p>"Talking is of no use; you must act," replied Lady Dresden, with a pitying smile.</p>
<p>But Constance was not to be persuaded.</p>
<p>"I am so happy at home, papa," she said, "and I have a curious feeling about going to town.!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell--a foreboding of evil. It seems to me that trouble will come of it."</p>
<p>"Why, Constance, how can trouble reach you? You are the object of our fondest love and care."</p>
<p>"I do not know, but I have that impression. I have always had it;" and tonstance sighed.</p>
<p>"It is all fancy and nonsense!" cried Lady Dresden, when Sir Cyril repeated the conversation to her. "If you are not careful, she will waste her life in dreams."</p>
<p>And now Lady Dresden had made another effort to induce Constance to come to London, urging that the season was at its height, and that a few weeks in town would be very pleasant.</p>
<p>I think you must go, my dear," said Sir Cyril, watching the beautiful face bent over the letter.</p>
<p>"I do not want to go," his daughter answered; and there was a strange reluctance in her voice.</p>
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 14"/>

<p>"I should never be happy away from Broome and Hilldrop."</p>
<p>"I have never spoken very seriously to you about the matter," said Sir Cyril, gently; but, my dearest Constance, as heiress of Hilldrop you have certain duties and responsibilities which you must not evade."</p>
<p>"I never will, papa," she replied, raising her large blue eyes to his."</p>
<p>"I think you had better do it; Lady Dresden wishes. Certainly, your position almost obliges you to make your debut."</p>
<p>"If you think so, papa I will go." she replied, with a faint sigh; "but I cannot resist this feeling of coming trouble."</p>
<p>"Constance," said Sir Cyril, gravely, "do you not really care about seeing the world. Have you no ambition?"</p>
<p>"Not of that kind," she answered.</p>
<p>"Do you not care for any kind of gayety--for balls or parties?"</p>
<p>"Not the least in the world, papa," she responded with a bright smile.</p>
<p>"Then, my dear, in one sense it is almost useless for you to go to London," he said. "Now tell me, Constance, what you do really care for."</p>
<p>"I have a deep threefold love in my heart," she answered--"for my dear dead mother, for you, papa--that is the greatest of all; and lastly for Hilldrop."</p>
<p>"You must enlarge your world, Constance."</p>
<p>"My heart is full now," she answered; and her eyes were so sweet, her words so gentle, that Sir Cyril thought she looked angelic.</p>
<p>So it was settled that, under the auspices of Lady Dresden, she should make her <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;but</hi> in the word of fashion.</p>
<p>Constance never forgot leaving home for what, with one exception, was an ill-omened journey. Sir Cyril would have accompanied his daughter had not some important county business prevented him front going. Sarah King therefore went with her; but she was not to remain in town, as Lady Dresden had engaged a smart Parisian maid for what she called the "London campaign."</p>
<p>"I am sorry I cannot accompany you, my darling," said Sir Cyril. "You must take good care of yourself; and Lord Dresden will meet you at Charing-Cross Station."</p>
<p>"I wish you could have gone, papa," said Constance, wistfully; "I do not like leaving you."</p>
<p>"How I have spoiled you, my child!" laughed Sir Cyril.</p>
<p>She had said " good bye" to Lady Laurayne and the sisters, who were ill-tempered that morning, and was standing with Sir Cyril on the lawn, waiting for the carriage.</p>
<p>"I shall see no place so beautiful as home," she said. "I think my greatest pleasure in London will be in counting the hours until I return, papa." Then she added, suddenly, "You will come to the station with me? I should like you to see me off."</p>
<p>She liked to remember afterwards how they had sat side by side, Sir Cyril holding her hand in his and bending over her with heartfelt affection shining in his eyes. They seemed more together during that brief drive than they had been since her mother's death.</p>
<p>"You will write often to me, Constance," said Sir Cyril, as he stood by the door of the railway carriage.</p>
<p>"I shall tell you everything, papa," she answered.</p>
<p>"You will send long letters in that case, my dear." he returned, laughingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, papa," she cried, with a wistful longing in her voice which pained him, "I would give anything if I were not going, if I might remain with you! I do not like leaving you."</p>
<p>Tears filled her blue eyes, and she liked to recall in the after-years how he had kissed them away with words of tender encouragement.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, my dear!" he said, as the whistle sounded.</p>
<p>Papa," she cried, hurriedly, leaning toward him, "be sure that you send for use if you want ire, If you feel lonely, if you are not well, if you--" But her sentence was not completed, for the train began to move. "Good-by, my best beloved!" she murmured; and she remembered the tender light on his face when he heard the words.</p>
<p>Soon she had passed out of his sight, and he returned to Broome.</p>
<p>Lady Dresden's delight in welcoming the beautiful daughter of her dead friend was extreme. Lord and Lady Dresden were a middle-aged couple without children, but fond of young people, and always intent upon their own happiness and that of others. Their town-mansion was in Mayfair, and Dresden House was one of the most frequented and hospitable places in London.</p>
<p>His lordship's face brightened when he met Constance at the station.</p>
<p>"Laura will be pleased enough now." he said to himself. "She dearly loves a pretty girl to chaperon, and she has one this time."</p>
<p>Never was welcome warmer or truer, yet Constance was some few days before she felt at home. The change was so striking--it was like going into another world. The large, roomy house without any trace of antiquity, the elegant modern furniture, the absence of everything that told of age, were all novel to her, She missed this deep shade of the great trees, the bloom and the scent of the flowers. and the song of the birds. Yet both host and hostess were so kind to her that it was impossible to be anything but happy.</p>
<p>Lady Dresden gave Constance a few days before launching her upon the sea of fashion. The necessary dresses, jewels. plumes, and other adjuncts had to be obtained, and this important work occupied some time.</p>
<p>"'The heiress of Hilldrop,'" remarked Lady Dresden, one morning, raising her eyes from a newspaper. "You see, my dear Constance, your name has preceded you. All the society journals have paragraph about the heiress of Hilldrop."</p>
<p>And time only comfort that Constance found in all the fatiguing duties connected with her presentation was thus--that she was in some measure paying due respect to Hilldrop.</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER X.</hi>

<p>"A PERFECT success!" was Lady Dresden's delighted comment, as she sank back in her favorite easy-chair. "Nothing could have been better. Everyone agrees that it was the best drawing-room of the season, and that you were the belle, Constance."</p>
<p>"Everyone is very kind," said the girl.</p>
<p>"What interested you most?" inquired Lady Dresden, who would have liked a little keener appreciation on the part of her <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</hi> of all they had seen and heard.</p>
<p>"What interested me most?" echoed Constance, dreamily. "I think, nay, I am sure, it was the face of the queen. I shall never forget it."</p>
<p>"But the dresses, the jewels--what did you think of them?" asked Lady Dresden.</p>
<p>"I did not pay much heed to them," Constance answered. "I have always longed to see the queen; and, now that I have seen her, I shall be the most devoted subject she has."</p>
<p>"I thought her majesty seemed pleased with you, Constance. I have introduced some beautiful girls at court; but I think you will vie with the most charming. It will be your own fault now, my dear. if you do not sail smoothly with the fashionable tide. You have an attractive face, and the world has recognized it and raves about it." Then her ladyship asked, somewhat abruptly, "What are you thinking of, Constance?"</p>
<pb n="THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP. 15"/>

<p>"I was thinking of the queen," she replied. What a brilliant yet lonely lot!"</p>
<p>The heiress of Hilldrop was invited everywhere. She was the fashion. Did she care for it? Did the excitement and novelty of the new life fill her heart as the old one had done? Ah, no! She told her father, when she wrote to him, that she preferred her flowers and the home-life.</p>
<p>But a change was coming. She awoke one morning with a prevision of it--a prevision of something unusual. All day long she was in some measure prepared for a surprise; but none came. All day long a feeling of restlessness possessed her, mingled with one of happiness greater than she had ever known before. The routine of the day, however, had in it no variation. There was luncheon, a ride in the Row, and dinner, after which there was a ball at the Duchess of Miniver's.</p>
<p>"Always the best balls in London!" was the comment of Lady Dresden, when she received the invitation card. "You must go there, Constance. The duchess has the finest ball-room in town, and the company is always select."</p>
<p>Constance did not accept all the invitations showered on her. She wondered much in after life if her fate would have been different had she declined this one.</p>
<p>Lady Dresden was very particular as to Constance's toilet on this occasion.</p>
<p>"Being fair," she said, "you must be careful to wear nothing but pale blue with pearls. You will be the belle of the ball, Constance."</p>
<p>"You are too sanguine, Lady Dresden," she returned, with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Not unreasonably so, my dear. You have already some of the best men in London at your feet. If you would come down from your pedestal. If you would be less of a goddess and more of a woman, you could marry whom you would. But you see, my dear, you make all the men afraid of you. You have a fashion of looking over their heads which does not exactly please them. A man likes to think that he is being admired and looked up to."</p>

<p>"I am not conscious of looking over their heads," returned Constance, with a smile.</p>
<p>"I do not think you are, my dear. I was watching you the other evening when the Duke of Oatlands was talking to you; you did not seem to be aware that he was paying you a great compliment."</p>
<p>"I certainly did not know it," said Constance.</p>
<p>"Everyone else did, my dear;" Lady Dresden laughed. "At the present moment the Duke of Oatlands is the best match in England. He seldom pays any attention to young girls, and I am sure has never paid so much to anyone as he did that evening to you."</p>
<p>"I did not notice it."</p>
<p>"No, my dear--that is the one thing I wish to impress upon you. You do not notice such things; you seem to live in the world as though you did not belong to it. The duke was doing his best to be agreeable, yet you looked at him with cool, calms unconcern; and he might have been a thousand miles away, I believe for all that you saw or heard of him. If he should be at the ball to-night, do not be quite so indifferent. There is not a girl in London who would not give much to be Duchess of Oatlands."</p>
<p>"Yes, there is one," said Constance.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" asked Lady Dresden, looking up.</p>
<p>"Myself," answered Constance. "I would not be Duchess of Oatlands."</p>
<p>"Why not?" inquired Lady Dresden, in surprise.</p>
<p>"Because the duke is not at all the kind of a man I could ever love," was the decided reply.</p>
<p>"I should like to have some notion of what your ideal husband is like," said Lady Dresden, with some amusement, yet with a longing to fathom the thoughts of this girl who was so unlike all others.</p>
<p>"I have never formed an idea," she replied "I am not a hero-worshipper, and I have thought very little of marriage or husbands."</p>
<p>"Yet they are the two principal things to be considered in a woman's life," said Lady Dresden, seriously.</p>
<p>"So my step-sisters Blanche and Edith think," remarked Constance.</p>
<p>"So most women think," rejoined Lady Dresden. "Now tell me what you would like your husband to be."</p>
<p>"I should never marry for money or rank. If I marry at all, it will be someone whom I have learned to love with all my heart."</p>
<p>"Now," said Lady Dresden, softly, "tell me what kind of a man it would be whom you could love with all your heart."</p>
<p>"I do not know," responded Constance, with some hesitation.</p>
<p>"Have you seen anyone whom you could like?" asked her ladyship.</p>
<p>Constance looked at her thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"No," she replied, "I begin to think that my life has not been quite like that of other girls I have been too self-contained, I have thought too much of my own pursuits and studies I think I cannot help feeling that if my mother had lived, I should have been different. When very young, I learned the difficult art of keeping my thoughts to myself."</p>
<p>"That is true," said Lady Dresden, softly. "The girl who loses her mother loses almost everything. No one in the world can make up for the loss. All I can say, my dear, is this--that I fervently hope you may meet with a good husband, one who will love you well, one whom you may love."</p>
<p>Constance smiled as she kissed her.</p>
<p>"You are very good to me, dear Lady Dresden," she said.</p>
<p>"I am greatly interested in you," replied her friend; and then, with a frank smile, her ladyship added: "and I am curious, also--very curious--to know what manner of man you will fall in love with and marry."</p>

<hi rend="center">CHAPTER XI.</hi>

<p>CAPTAIN LANCELOT DYSART was one of the most fortunate, yet, in some respects, one of the most unfortunate, officers in that well-known regiment, the white Lancers. He was fortunate because in all England it would have been difficult to find a handsomer man. When he joined the White Lancers, his fellow-officers gave him the name of "Beauty;" but he would not have it, and intimated so clearly to them what would be the fate of any man who dared to address him by that title that it was soon dropped. He was unfortunate, because, being what he was, the favorite of his regiment, holding a high position in society, and living in one of the most expensive "sets," he was entirely dependent on his father for every penny that he received, except his regimental pay.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Dysart was inordinately proud of his son. He made him a liberal allowance; but Captain Lancelot knew that, unless he complied in every respect with his father's wishes, his income might at any moment be stopped. Up to the present time there has been no disagreement between them. Sir Thomas was quite the opposite of his son. The father was as mean, cowardly and ungenerous as the son was ingenious, frank, and liberal. The old baronet had married early in life a beautiful, fair-haired girl, from whom his son inherited his great personal attractions, and he had slowly but surely broken her heart. It took him but four years to do it, and she died most thankful at being rid of the burden of living.</p>
<pb n="16 THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP."/>I

<p>He had tyrannized over her until life had grown hateful to her. A spirited woman would not have borne his cruelty--would doubtless have left him; but Lady Dysart was all tenderness and sweetness ,at first she was too astonished to protest; then at every fresh instance of tyranny she wept bitterly; and finally she subsided into the helpless state of silent despair in which she died. It was not that the baronet disliked his wife; he was really rather fond of her--but it was his way. He was a tyrant by nature, and he never attempted to restrain or control his outbursts of temper. He was generally disliked. His servants, the tenants on his estates, his neighbors, and what he called his friends, all resented and rebelled against his tyrannical spirit. The only person to whom he had never shown it was his son Lancelot. His whole heart was set on the fair-haired, handsome lad who was so different in disposition from himself. He indulged his every whim and caprice; he gave him his choice of a profession; and when the young man, with a flush on his face and a sparkle in his eyes, declared he would rather be a soldier than anything else in the world, he was trained accordingly, and finally he gained a captaincy in the famous White Lancers.</p>
<p>The only thing over which the baronet intended to exercise his control was his son's marriage. He had never yet opposed or thwarted any wish of Lancelot's, but he intended to have a voice in that matter. His son--one day to be Sir Lancelot Dysart, master of Deene--must marry someone who would be a credit and an honor to the family--a peer's daughter, or a great heiress; it would have to be one of the two. Little had been said between them on the subject; but Sir Thomas had given his son plainly to understand that, proud as he was of him, much as he loved him, he should disinherit him if ever he married against his wishes.</p>
<p>The captain, though a prominent figure in London society, was no carpet-knight. He was welcomed everywhere with open arms, for no one could tell a better story, sing a better song, or make himself more generally attractive than Captain Dysart. The fact that he was somewhat proud, and quickly resented any attempt at undue familiarity, did not make people like him the less.</p>
<p>"Are you going to the Duchess of Miniver's ball, Lance?" asked his friend Captain Clinton.</p>
<p>Lancelot looked up from his paper.</p>
<p>"What--to-night? I had forgotten it. I must go; I promised."</p>
<p>There is a new beauty about whom everyone is raving, and she will be there," said Captain Clinton.</p>
<p>"I do not care about new beauties," answered Captain Dysart. "I prefer one on whom society has passed an opinion."</p>
<p>"Society has passed a very decided opinion on the heiress of Hilldrop," rejoined his friend.</p>
<p>"And what may that opinion be?" asked Captain Dysart.</p>
<p>"Why, that she is the most beautiful and the most uncommon girl society has seen lately. Uncommon, mind you, Lance; that means a great deal."</p>
<p>"It certainly does," assented the young man. "But in what way is she uncommon?"</p>
<p>She has original ideas, and is not afraid of expressing them. Then her face is as lovely as a June rose."</p>
<p>All that day Lancelot thought much of his friends words. He had not asked the name of this girl, he knew her only as "heiress of Hilldrop." He had made no inquiries about her family connections; such things did not interst him just then. He thought only how pleasant it would be to meet a fair young girl who had not only beauty, but originality. His heart wars light and his step buoyant when he set out for Miniver House.</p>

<p>Constance went to the Duchess of Miniver's entertainment. She was, as Lady Dresden had predicted she would be, the belle of the ball. Her toilet of blue suited her fair delicate loveliness to perfection. She stood for a few minutes under the central chandelier talking to the young Duke of Oatlands. She was quite unconscious of the many admiring glances cast upon her, and she did not seen to realize how radiantly beautiful she was. Half the girls in the room were eyeing her jealously, but she did not seem to think that her position was one to be coveted, or that the great attention paid to her by the duke was anything uncommon. He had taken her bouquet and was critically examining the white blossoms.</p>
<p>"I know you like flowers," he was saying, "I can tell front your face that you have a passion for them."</p>
<p>She looked at him with laughing eyes.</p>
<p>"I had no idea that my face told so much." she responded.</p>
<p>"It tells me too that you love music and poetry, and everything that is beautiful."</p>
<p>"It tells the truth," she replied, briefly.</p>
<p>It was just as that moment that Captain Dysart, crossing the ball-room, saw her. He stopped abruptly, amazed and slightly confused. He had never seen so lovely a girl, or one so serenely unconscious of her loveliness. He went up to Sir Antony Bedale, who had the reputation of knowing everybody in society.</p>
<p>"Who is that talking to the Duke of Oatlands?" he asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>"That lady?" said Sir Antony. "I have been asked the same question fifty times this evening already. That is the heiress of Hilldrop. She seems better known in society by that name than by any other."</p>
<p>"The heiress of Hilldrop," murmured Captain Dysart; and then his conversation with Captain Clinton recurred to his mind. "What is her name?"
<p>"Constance Laurayne; she is the daughter of Sir Cyril Laurayne of Broome."</p>
<p>The young man inadvertently repeated the words "Constance Laurayne "as he had repeated the others.</p>
<p>So this was the girl whose face had reminded Captain Clinton of a June rose. He was right; she was indeed lovely. As he looked at her, his heart, which had never yet been stirred by a woman, thrilled strangely. Fascinated by that peerless face, he stood for some moments riveted to the spot. Then suddenly he roused himself.</p>
<p>"I will go to the fountain head," he decided; and he went straight to the Duchess of Miniver.</p>
<p>"Will your grace do me a favor hat will shake me the happiest of men?" he said.</p>
<p>He was a great favorite with her grace of Miniver, and she replied, smilingly, that she would be very pleased to make him happy.</p>
<p>"You look very much in earnest about something, Captain Dysart," she added. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Will you introduce me to Miss Laurayne?" he said.</p>
<p>"Certainly," she answered. "It is of no use saying 'Beware!' I presume?"</p>
<p>"Of no use at all," rejoined Captain Lancelot.</p>
<p>" We must wait until the duke has finished paying his <hi rend="italic">devoirs</hi>. It will not do to interrupt his Slow of eloquence. Ah, lie has left her I'' said the duchess, as the Duke of Oatlands moved away. "Now see the little army of adiulrers that take his !place! '

-. I will find a place among thern," said Captain l)ysart.

keeping it," laughed leer grace. " Now don triple armor, Captain Dysart, for y-ou are going to look into the most beautiful face 1 have ever seen. bliss Laurayne, allow me to introduce Captain Dysart to you."

And Constance looked up to see a noble-looking man bending before her. Many proud heads had bent before her that evening, many a handsome face had flushed with delight at a few gracious words from her; but this was quite a different matter.

The duchess passed on with a smile. She knew perfectly well that CaiMain Dysart had forgotten 'verythlng in the world except the beautiful face and figure before him.

Captain Dysart made the most of his few minutes. He asked Miss Laurayne for a waltz, and she promised him one. He looked into her eyes, and said to himself that the heavens were not so blue. He looked at the pearls she wore, and thought they were not so white as the beautiful neck they clasped. Then lie asked her if she would like to go through the conservatory, as the 1oo111 was lvarm,and she answered  Yes." -

As they stood in the conservatory the soft, sweet notes of Strauss' latest waltz carne floating in to their over the flowers.

` Would you-do you care for dancing ? " lie asked, with an admiring glance,  or would you perfer to remain here ?"

1 like this best," slit, answered, with sweet candor; and he obtained a seat for her.

Do you like ch rysanthenmuris ? " he said, feelIng that flowers would be a topic that would interest her. ' I was struck with the rare beauty of some white ones that I saw last autumn. Do you admire them ?


"Yes," she answered, brightly; "they are my favorite flowers."

,,I had always thought of chrysanthemums as belonging to a very respectable but rather dowdy

family," lie continued. ` I always pictured them

to myself as being a shabby purple or a faded yellow. But last year I was visiting where the people were bower-worshippers, and I was slitprised at the beauty of the white chrysant.heniunis. I think chrysanthemums are rather neglected."

" Not by true lovers of flowers." she answered.

We have them of almost every shade at Broome."

" What a pretty name-' Broome!' My father's place is called ' Deere.' I like  Broone' much better."


She gave him a description of her hone, and told him it was called Broone. He listened Mill rapt attention. if only tima would notpasssoquicklyl The golden moments were flying, and he could not sit there with her much longer. The glass doors at the end of the conservatory were wide open, and the moon shone brightly on the lawn. lie looked out at the moonlight and back at the brilliantlylighted ball-room. He took courage.

This is just such a night as one reads of in the Merchant of Venice.' Miss Laurayne, may I 'enture to ask you if you would care for a stroll .cross tile lawn?"

" There is nothing T should like better," she replied. with sudden animation.

They left the conservatory and went out.


Her face, as lie saw it in the moonlight, looker paler, but exquisitely beautiful. She raised it to the dark skies, watching the rising moon. A sigh of deep content came from her lips, and he drew hearer to her.

` If ever I give a fete," he said, " it shall be a moonlit one."

" I should like to be present at It." she returned, with a smile. " Moonlight has a great charm for npe."

" I should not give It unless you promised to be there," he said; and the passion in Ii!s voice start

led her.


They passed many happy hours together later on, but he felt there was never one so wholly sweet as this.

When Lady Dresden's carriage was anrotnnced, It was Captain Dysart who folded the warm wrap round Miss Lair-ayne's white shoulders, to the disggst of a score of ardent admirers, and it was he who received the thanks that shone in the heiress' beautiful blue eyes. To use the expression of his friend Captain Clinton, he went home that night "a lost man.,'





CHAPTER XII.

LADY DRESDEN was wise In her generation. She understood the shrinking delicacy and sensitiveness of a girl like Constance with re gaid to her new admirer. She made no jesting allusions to the handsome young officer, but did that which was kinder and wiser; she invited him to dine at Dresden House two days after the ball.

Constance hardly liked admitting even to herself that since that (night her thoughts had never left hint, and she could not help wondering if lie had been thinking as much of her.

The evening cone when lie was to dine with Lord and Lay Dresden. Her ladyship had noticed that at Miniver House Captain Dysart could hardly tear himself from Constance's side, and she knew that lie had fallen deeply and desperately in love with her joto`gie. She said nothing, but marked with delight the exquisite toilet that made Constance that evening more beautiful than ever-a white silk ornamented with roses. Her face was brightly flushed with hope and expectation. This was a small gathering, and her lady ship knew that after dinner Constance would see more of tike captain than had been possible at the ball. Lady Dresden's heart beat with pleasure when she pictured the scene.

When Captain Dysart, looking very handsome and happy, stood before Constance, her eyes were attracted at once by a gleam of something yellow in his button-hole; and, when she looked more closely at It, lo, it was a piece of broom 1 She blushed crimson when clue saw it.

"Yes, it is real broom," he said, laughingly. "Since your description of your home, I have thought of nothing but the broom and you," he added, tenderly.

" It looks better than stephanotis," she murmured as her slender lingers caressed it lov. inrly.'1

' I think I shall wear broom in future," he went on. "I shall adopt it as my badge, after the fashion of the Plantagenets."

"You will be called `The Knight of the Broom,' "she remarked, with a smile.

"I shall glory in the title. I like to read of those old clays when knights wore ladies' favors in their helmets. I would wear a sprig of broom In my helunet ifI had one. As it is, 1 wear it next to my heart."

At that moment the butler announced dinner. There was no tune to say more.


How she longed for that dinner to end no one knew but herself. It seemed to her that the wearisome procession of dishes would never finish. Whenever she raised her eyes, they fell on the sprig of broom; it seemed to attract general attention.

Lady Dresden noticed It, and understood Its meaning.

" That Is as good as an offer of marriage," she said to herself. "What an open avowal."

The dinner came to an end at last, and the gentlemen did not sit long over their wine. The drawing-roan was a blaze of light, and the air was sweet with the perfume of flowers. The doors leading Into the bright little conservatory were wide open, and the plashing of the tiny fountain could be plainly heard.


is	THE HEIRESS O F HILLDR OP.

Captant Clinton s description had been of her. When Captain Dysart left Dresden House that night, lie vowed to himself that if it were possible Ire would make Constance Laurayne his wife; and she, blushing and smiling, almost frightened by her happy thoughts, acknowledged to herself that this was such a man as site could love.

The fashionable world was not In the least sur,trlsed when an engagement between Constance Laurayne and Captain Dysart was announced. Every one had expected it.

"1 thought," said Constance one morning to Lady Dresden, ' that the course of true love never did run smooth. I have read so, and heard it said many tines."

"It does not often," answered Lady Dresden.

" But ours does." rejoined Constance; and there was a tender light in her blue eyes.

"There are exceptions to every rule," said Lady Dresden. "It is possible that yours may run smoothly to the end."

"Love never dies, does it?" asked the girl, thoughtfully.

	' Not true love. The difficulty Is to distinguish true love front false."

" Aline will never die," Constance said, earnestly, "for 1 know it is true. 1)o you renhembe r that line of Swinburue's-' The meaning of May is clear?' 1 mi~lit adapt it and say, ' The meaning of life is clear. Many things puzzled me before I knew Lancelot; now I scene to understand." She went over to Lady Dresden, and kneeling by her side, looked thoughtfully up into her face. `I have brought you " she said, "two letters to read -one front my Gear father, Sir Cyril; the other front Lancelot s father, Sir Thomas."

The first that her ladyship read was from Sir Cyril, telling Constance how more than delighted lie was at the news of her engagement. Ile said that fie had received from Captain Dysart one of the kindest and most satisfactory of letters, and added that lie had invited the young ollicer to Broonie when Constance returned home. He also said that Lady Laurayne was greatly pleased with the news.

"It was very kind and affectionate-just like Sir Cyril," said Lady Dresden, as she folded up the letter.

Then her ladyship read Sir Thomas' far more grandiloquent epistle, in which lie bade Constance welcome to his family, and hoped the marriage settlements would be satisfactory, and finally, lie congratulated his son on having chosen so wisely and well, and expressed the hope that lie would soon have the pleasure of meeting the heiress of lilldrop.

When that letter was finished, Lady Dresden made uo continent.

	You say nothing about thls,"said Constauce.

It certainly has not the hearty ring that my father's letter has; but still it is kind."

" I do not like Sir 'I'hoinas," said Lady Dresden. "I alit not singular in that respect, for indeed no one likes hint. The keynote of his character is to he found in those few words, he hopes 'soon to have the pleasure of meeting the heiress of Hilldrop! If you were not the heiress of Hilldrop, uo smatter how much his son loved you, lie would not care to see you."

"That is not Lancelot's fhult," said Constance, gi.ickly.

No. No father and son ever differed more In disposition than they do. If any trouble cwues to Till' your happiness, Constance, it will be from Sir Thomas. Yon are quite sure," her ladyship added, with sudden anxiety, "that nothing can in

-

Just such an evening as she had anticipated fell terfere with your prospects with regard to Hilb to her lot. Under cover of'tlie music and singing drop ?"

they talked together, and lie found how correct		"No; Hilldrop Is trine," the girl answered, with quiet conviction.

"Captain Dysart loves you well enough toniarry you without fortune; lie would marry you for your dear and beautiful self alone. But, if by any

mischance you lost Hilldrop, Sir Thomas would

forbid the marriage."

"I cannot lose Iilldrop," said Constance, with one of her quiet smiles. "My mother gave it to time, and no one can take it front nie. But, if I did lose It, what would happen ?"

' Sir Thomas would forbid his son to marry you, and, if lie persisted in doing so, he would disin herit hint," replied Lady Dresden: "and that," she added, solemnly, 11 would be his ruin,"

"Why his ruin Y" asked Constauce.

"I mean the ruin of all his prospects In life. Captain Dysart holds a commission in what I should imagine to be one of the roost expensive reginients, the White Lancers. If his father discontiuued his allowance, lie would be compelled to leave I lie service: lie could not possibly remain in it; and that would mean social ruin to Iiinh."

"Let us he thankful that that can never happen," said Constance, with a slight shudder. "I am thankful that Hilldrop is mime."

For some few minutes after that conversation she felt a faint sensation as of evil at hand ; but it vanished as quickly as it cattle, and site smiled at her groundless fears. Beloved, carefully tended, with the fairest of futures before her, why need she fear ?

There came an evening that she never forgot, when, feeliii ' tired, she declined am engagenteiit which Lady Bresden for some reason was desirous of fulfillin ~',.


"I have hardly had an evening at home since I came to London," said Constance, laughingly. ' Let me have this one. Lady Dresden."

"I know well what that means," site answered; "an evening for rest, and, after I have gone, there will be a knocking at the door, followed by the announcement, 'Captain Dysart,' who will enter, and look much astonished at finding noone here but yyou. All I Constance, I know the ways of lovers I '

" It is all true," the girl replied, with a beautiful blush, "except one part-Lancelot will not feel surprised at finding me alone, for I-I told him. You see, dear Lady Dresden, we always meet in crowds, and, though we see each other often, we seldom have an opportunity of speaking together. We want to settle the titre for his visit to Broome, amid we have a great deal to say."

Lady Dresden laughed aloud.

"My dear simple child," site said. "of course It shall be just as you wish."

It was the first oppol tmnlty Constance had had of all uninterrupted tote-a-tete with her lover, and it scented a foretaste to her of all the delicious hours to conne. She had taken her favorite seat, a chair that stood near the bay-window, and a fairer picture than the beautiful fair-haired girl sitting there could scarcely be imagined.

So her lover thought as lie entered t Ire room and went up to ]let*. He first kissed her white hands t then lie grew bolder, and kissed her fair face.

"Oh, Constance." lie cried, "even now I cannot believe that I have won out It seems too good to be true that I should carry you off front all your admirers, and have you for my own for ever. more. What were you thinking of when I cattle iii, dear?"

' Of the sun setting over Broome," she replied. ''You cannot imagine how beautiful It is. There is no place like Broome."

	 I am half jealous of it," sighed Captain Dysart.

You need not be," she answered, with the sitnple earnestness so characteristic of her. "There is no one and no thing on earth that I love like


THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP.	>l9

you.e I shall even love Broome more when you hav been there."

Captain Dysart drew her head on to his breast, and they talked of the future that was to be brighter and happier to them than it had been to any lovers yet-a perfect life, rich in love for each other, rich, as they meant to make it, in good deeds for others. They talked of Hilldrop: and Constance told him, with tears in her eyes, the tragical story of Philippa Trafford.

	 What a sad life! Philippa he said. , Thank Heaven, no such fate can overtake you, my Constance I "

She looked into his ardent love-lit ayes.

"You will always love me as well as you do low?" she said, questioningly.

"Always: and, if-which Heaven forbid-we were parted, I would never clasp another woman's hand in mine."


He kissed her lips as he spoke. and she was satisfied that his troth was plighted to her for evermore. When that happy meeting came to a close, she realized fully that life without Win would be a blank and a burden site could not bear.

When he held her in his arms and wished her "Good-night," he whispered to her that when they reached beautiful Broonie lie should ask her to fix the wedding-day.

CHAPTER XIII.


E.&iu.y the next morning a loud knock echoed through the hall of Dresden House. A telegram had come for Miss Laurayne; and tier maid hurried off with It to lie".

  A telegram for me ?" Inquired Constance, in surprise. Are you sure there is no mistake ?"

	 None, miss," was the reply; "the address is

 Miss Laurayne, Dresden House;' it must be for you."

No presentiment of evil came to Constance when she took the telegram. There was a bird singing gayly outside: site looked at it with a smile before she opened the envelope.

"Sweet, happy little bird I" she thought.,

The site read with (lazed and bewildered eyes the following words:

"From Lady Laurayne, Broonie, to Miss Laurayne, I)resden House, Mayfair.-If you wish to see your father alive, return at once. He is dangerously ill."

Even as she read the telegram a conviction cane to her that she would never again see her beloved father alive.

` My father is very ill," she said to the maid, ` and I must go to him at once."

Then site stood silent, oppressed by the terrible fear that had come over her, a fear that smote her heart with a deathly chill. Site who was usually so self-reliant, so composed, now seemed to have lost all powers of thought. Site turned to her said.

" What shall I do?" she asked, piteously ; "I gust go, and at once."

"

Shall I ask his lordship to come ?"suggested the maid.

When Lord Dresden saw Constance, lie was alarmed at the pallor of her face and the terror shining in her eyes. She held out the telegram for hint to read.

"TeII me what to do!" she cried. "I feel as though I were dying!"

Lord Dresden took the telegram and read it.

" It may not be so bad as you think" he said, soothingly; "let us hope not. Telegrams must be forcible, or they are useless. Sir Cyril Is strong, and I can scarcely think a few days' Illness will prove dangerous to him. Take heart, my dear; you will soon be able to judge for yourself."

Lord Dresden sent for the time-table, and after looking at it. observed:

"There is a train that leaves Charing Cross at half-past nine; if you can catch that, you will soon reach Ravelaton. The carriage is sure to be waiting for you there."

	 Call I catch that train "' she asked.

"You shall, if it be possible," he replied. "I will order the carriage at once. Leave everything to me, m Drdear."

Lord esden hurried away to give his orders, and the maid assisted Constance to dress. She (lid not wait for any packing; all her things were to be sent on after her. The color did not return to her face, nor did the trembling of tier hands cease; her one feeling was that the whole fabric of her life was shattered. She remembered with a sudden pang, that her lover was conning at noon, that they had arranged to ride together; and now lie would come, and find her gone.

Pressed for time as site was, site yet wrote a note to him, telling him of the telegram, and assuring him that site would write that same day from Broome.

"It is terrible to me," she wrote; "and perhaps the most terrible feeling of all is trite foreboding I have that the happiness of my whole life is hopelessly shattered. But that can never be while you i live and love me."

In the aster-years she often remembered this feeling of coming evil.

She gave the letter to Lord Dresden.

  Captain Dysart will be bereat noon," she said "whemi lie comes, will you give him this ?"-an4 the terror and anguish in tier face as she placed the note in his hands haunted him long afterward.

Lord Dresden offered to accompany her to Broonie; but Constance thought it best to decline the kind offer, remembering the confusion and dismay that must prevail ere. His lordship, however, saw her to the station, and waited until the train left.

The train sped slowly on Its way, Constance could never remember how that terrible journey passed. Site could only pray with her whole heart and soul that her father might be saved.


When the train reached Ravelston, the carriage was waiting at the station for her. With a white, scared face Constance looked at the footman.

" How is my father, John ? " site asked.

The servant looked at her with a face equally pale.

"There has been no change since morning, miss," he answered.

As she drove home, she had no eyes for the smiling landscape, for the beautiful broom on which the sun was shining gloriously.

They drove quickly up to the great entrancedoor, which was hastily opened by one of the menservants.

 ` slow is Sir Cyril ? 'Constance asked, breathlessly. But, hastening past him, she gave him no time to answer.

She thought it strange that none of the family were there to meet her. The darkuessaud silence of the house had not struck lie r, but, wlten site saw her old nurse, Sarah King, crossing the hall, and caught a glimpse of her sorrowful face, she seemed to realize the truth. She stood still, her heart beating wildly, her brain bewildered.

Am I too late? she gasped.

  My poor, pretty darling!" cried the old nurse. "You are indeed too late. SirCyril(lied atsunrise this morning."

With a heart-rending cry Constance fell forward into the arms of the faithful nurse.

" Af y poor, poor dear I " was all the woman could titter.

When Constance opened her eyes she found herself lying in her own room with Sarah King A ously watching by her side.


THE HEIRESS OF HIL LDROP.

" Oh, lily father, my father! " site sobbed. " If I could but have seen him alive! If I could but have kissed him and said ' Good-by!' "

So you would have done, lily dear If I had had my own way. I wanted to send lot* you at first, but Lady Laurayne would not listen to tile. She said Sit, Cyril would soon be well, and that it would be a great pity to spoil your visit."

"What did my visit-what did anything in she world matter, if I could but have seen hint I" the girt cried, despairingly.

" I said as much to Lady Laurayne, but it was of no use. My poor master has been ailing for some days, and lie asked especially that I slight wait upon hint. He talked incessantly about you, called for you, wanted you; last night, when lie was taken so much worse, his constant cry was for you. Her lady ship sat by his side, fair-spoken and kind enough.

'Conuie is coining, Cyril.' said her ladyship, soothingly. I said to ]let, plainly eli,nigh, ' Miss Collide will not come unless she is sent for, and you have not sent yet, my lady.' She rose front tier chair and beckoned me from the room. I went. Site stood looking eagerly into my face, her own quite pale aid anxious. ' I aln afraid,' site said, 'of exciting Sir Cyril.

' But I (to not wish hint to be excited or disturbed,' said Lady Laltrayne. I told her, my darling," continued the old nurse, "that it would agitate him far more not to see you than to see yon; but her ladyship still persisted in saying that lie mast not be disturbed. Miss Laurayne will not disturb hint any Illore than yourself, my lady.' I said at last, almost sharply; and but for that, you would not be here now. Then site told nie to send a telegram ii her Il Ltlie, It was written out last Might, amid sm imttIme first thing this morning. But my poorniaster was lead Wlieil it, was sent.

Has my brother, Austin, conic ? " asked Constance.


' Yes. Her ladyship sent for Lint yesterday. lie was with Sir Cyril for some hours, 'but lie di,l not seem to know the boy. 1-Ie had nulhiug to say to him. My master only cried for 'Connie.

"You shall see him. miss," answered the old nurse; "but go to her ladyship now. I want yogi to be very friendly with her. 1 have more to tell you, but not now.'


Constance followed the maid, who, to her sur. prise. led the way to the eastern wing.

' tier ladyship has changed her rooms," ex. plaiued the maid. "She went into these this nl~~l.uinl*,,,,	.

' She leaves him," thought the broken-hearted girl, "as soon as lie is (lead. He lies fit the western wins;;" and Constance remembered how, when tier own mother died, Sir Cyril had hardly left the room until site was carried frotu it.

Would this beautiful woman mourn for him as tier mother would have donet

A strange feeling came over her-a feeling that in some vague way her father's house was Iioine to her 'to longer. Everything appeared different. ']'here was but one ray of light in all her gloom aid misery, and that was the recollection of her lover. For one look at Lancelot's face, for oie clasp of his hand, site would just then have given anything in the world. How long was it since she had sat ii the great bay-window watching the sunset, with her lover kneeling by her side? How long? And now she was In the midst of bloom and death. Still the thought of hilt was like a ray of light penetrating the darkuess.

Then site reached Lady Laurayne's room and tapped at the door.





CHAPTER XIV.

"COME iu ! " said a faint, lagguid voice, In response to Constauce's tap at the door.

The change was so great from the bright corridor to the darkened room that at first Constance could hardly see tier ladyship. Then in the gloom a white hand was held out to tier.

Come here, niy dear Constance," said Lady Laurayne. "This must be a terrible shock to you; it is to me."

Constance had never loved her step-mother, but in that moment of desolatton and sorrow the girl's heart warmed to tier more than it had ever done. Site, too, was left desolate and lonely-for Sir Cyril had loved her well-and for this reason Constance resolved to try to like her better.

"Let me talk to you about your father, Constance," said Lady laurayue; " it will ease lily heart. I would rather have you with nee than either of my girls, because lie loved ybu so pas


sionately'.-And Constance, kneeling by her side, noticed

how her ladyship trembled, and how terribly agitated she was.

" I wish," said Constance, "that I had seen my father before lie died."


Lady Laurayne sprung from her seat, tier face tlnshod, her eyes shining, tier manner eager and excited.

" You wanted to see hint ?" she cried. "Whywhy? Was it oil business?"

Business 1 " repeated Constance, In astonishment. "llow could I havo business with my owl' fattier?" In that luoluent she load coin pletely forgotten ltilldrop Priory and Ilex fort.uue. 1 should have liked his last words and his last kiss," she continued, her words broken by the choking sobs she could not repress.

Lady Lauraytte's eagerness (lied away, and she lay back again it her chair.

" I smut sorry," site said-" I shall always be sorry that I did not send for you before. I did it, as I thought, for the best. Nurse King said that I was wrong; but 1 was very anxious about your dear father, and was afraid of exciting him. I believed that I was acting for the best,, Constance

11 Yes, I am sure of that," she replied. But in after years she understood better why she had not been sent for.

Then, after promising to return later on, Con. stance went to the room lu which her father lay. She knelt down by the side of his still, cold form,


THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP.	21


and wept as though her heart would break. Was this cold. marble-like form the handsome, affectionate father whom site had loved so well? She felt that she would have given years of her life to have been with him only five minutes before lie (lit d, to have felt his loving clasp, to have soothed his last moments. She had longed to fell him about her lover, and now his ears were closed for evermore. Kneeling with her head resting against his bedside, site gave full vent to her grief.

presently Sarah King came quietly into the chamber of death and led her away.

You will cry yourself blind, my dear," site said. " Will you collie to your own room? I have some yea ready for you there."

Constance went with her; and when she had rested for a short time the nurse said to her:

Was her ladyship ki!.d to you, my dear?"

" Yes-kinder than she has ever been before. Site clung to me, kissed ine, and begged me not to leave her,-1 was the answer.

'' Then," said the nurse, "she means mischief; you may he quite sure of It. I cannot tell why. If she ltad been impatient or angry with you, it would have been better."

Cunstance smiled through her tears.

-That is a strange idea," she remarked.

" It. is the truth, my dear. I have never liked

her la(lysliip; but I have never really mistrusted

her until now "

1, Why cto you mistrust her now?" asked Constance.

May I speak plainly to you?" Inquired the I I ll1'Se.


' If not ),ou, my (tear old friend, wito should speak plainly to inert" was the girl's reply.

''Then, Miss Constance, I have not liked her ladyship's conduct during Sir Cyril's illness. Why should we want to keep my master and the child whole lie loved apart? Why should site endeavor to keep you from hint? There must have been au evil motive."

Do you think there was really a wish on her part that I should not see hits? " asked Constance.

 ' I alit sure of it; and my opinion is that before long+ we shall tind out what that motive was. Ltdy Lauravue was never herself after the doctor saiil there was nollope for the master; she changed boll that hour. tier manlier became shifty, tineasy,aud hurried; she grew restless, and never reuiemined long in the same place. The servants spoke of her being all over the house; no one ever knew where to find her, and when she was found, it was alwa~s in some most-out-of-the-way place. As a rule, Iter ladyship keeps her temper admirably ; but during the last few days she has been irritable and impatient. Tell ine, Miss Constance-could her ladyship do you any harm?

In what way do you mean, nurse?" asked Miss Laurayne.

" Well, my dear, respecting property or any

thing of that kind?" explained the nurse.

"No. Even if she were so in(;lined, she could

tot do ine the least harm in the world." "  l ou are quite sure, miss?"

:'Quite sure. my dear old nurse," was the earnest reply. "Lady Laurayne has nothing whatever to do with' mty aff,iirs ; she has tto control over me in any way whatever. Were all her lotluence brought to bear, she could not make the one farthing richer or one shilling poorer."

" I ant glad to hear It." said nurse King. " You know the old song, ` Love has eyes.' Love-nh, and instinct too! Love and instinct both tell pie there is something wrong regarding you. I can'lot, tell what it is-1 am like one grouping in the dark ; but. I have a sure and certain instinct that dau Hl' ('xi.ts for you."

"Four love for ine makes you over-anxious,"

 rid Constance. "There can be no danger for me through Lady Lauravne.''


But it was Impossible to oonvinee the old nurse


that her fears were unfounded. She had tier own Ideas, and nothing could alter them.

" We shall see, my dear-we shall see," was ai1 she answered when Constance tried to cahu her suspicions.

There was general mourning at Broome, for Sir (yril had been liked by all. His son, a slender, hand ome stripling, now Sir Austin, was inconsolable. Even tliestep-daughters, who quara'elled over everything else, agreed that they both regrettedthe loss of Sir Cyril, who had been so good a friend to them.

The day came when the kindly, genial master of Broome was carried to his last, resting-place. and never was roan more sincerely mourned. Ile had been a good husband and. father, a kind friend, a generous neighbor, a considerate landlord. He was followed to the grave by.crowds of friends, whose grief was as deep as it was general. Such a funeral as his had never heen seen iu the county before. He was mourned by many ; but one heart nearly broke for love of hits and grief at his loss. No ome could ever take his place iu the heart of his loving daughter.





CHAPTER KV.

TtrE library of Broome was a long, lofty room, tastefully furnished, with a few old paintings, some rare bronzes, j(ti'(lin/rsres filled with flowers, ornaments of all kinds, old cltiua, anti, greatest treasures of all, well-tilled bookcases. Three long windows that reached froth ceiling to floor occupied nearly the whole of one side of the room; they opened out on to the closely mown lawn, where tile cedars stood.

Without all was sunshine and brightness. within the scene was one of glooill and sadness. The sdlolight fell on dark mourning dresses and thie.k folds ofcrape, on the pale faces of the ladies and on the sombre garments of the men who had asse.mbled there to hear Sir Cyril's will read.

Lady Laurayne w'as present; but. she looked quite unlike her usual self. The. pride and radiance had left her; she was pale and worn, with an anxious expression of face, ai.d a restless, perturbed mummer. She was seated near one of the open w in(lowvs, her young son, Sir Austin, at tite back of her chair. leis arms resting upon it, Edith sat ou a stool at her feet, and Blanche op polite to them.


Cunstance stood alone at her favorite window, the sunlight glistening lu her golden hair and brightening her heavy nunn'ning-dress. The react' ing of the will had It() interest for her; her eves were almost blinded by fast-falling tears. She would rather have rem,Iined in her own room to wee't out her sorrow alone and unnoticed. Dearly as she had loved Sir Cyril, she had never realized how completely her very life was identitied with his until he died, Light and beauty seemed all to have departed with his death.

The vicar was present-Lady Laurayne had implored him to remain-besides -Mr. Anderson, the awyer. Two or three of Sir Cyril's tuore intimate friends. who had been present at. the funeral, also waited for the reading of the will.

w'hell all were seated, the lawyer stood up.

"Ladies and gentlemen," lie began, "I have strange announeente.nt to snake to you. We are assembled here for the reading of Sir Cyril's will ; but I ant grieved to tell you there is no will. Such, at least is the conclusion I ant compelled to arrive at. Most minute search has been made among Sir Cyril's papers all over the house, in every nook and corner. iii every cupboard, desk, escritoire, bureau, wherever a folded paper could be placed, we have looked. Sir ('vril, as nmst of his household are aware, kept aL his papers and documents, all the deeds re atinir to the estate, all leases, all business memoranda. of whatever kind they might be, to the large Iron safe tvliicll is


12

THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP.

inserted to the wall of his study, and so arranged is to look like part Cyril many times to get papers

from the safe, and naturally enough I thouglttthe will would be there."

-Why was it not given Into your custody?" asked the vicar.

 ' I cannot say. It was Sir Cyril's Idea to keep it with his other papers. I can find no trace of it."

Astonishment and dismay were depicted on every face except Constance's. She looked sur. prised ; but, in her Ignorance and Inexperience, she did not think the absence of a will would make an ) difference to her.

The twin-sisters looked bitterly disappointed, for they had hoped great things from Sir Cyril's will.

" Are you quite sure, Mr. Anderson that my father made a will?" asked the young heir.

 ` I ant quite sure, Sir Austin,' was the answer. "I drew up the will myself from some rough notes supplied to me by Sir Cyril, and, by Sir Cyril's request, I had it engrossed on parchment--a most unusual proceeding. I drew it up, and sent it to hint by my clerk, William Ilewson, who found hint :it home, and his friend Sir John Hartop}i with him. Diy clerk, on his return, gave lime full 'l:trticulnrs of what passed. When Sir Cyril saw him and

learned his errand, lie said, ' You have brought my will; I ani glad.' lie apologized to Sir John, and read It through carefully. He seemed pleased with it, and said it was exactly what lie intended, and then lie handed It to Sir John fiartopp, who also read it through. ' I tltiitk,' said Si Cyril,' that I have been perfectly

perfectly

~ust.' And Sir John answered heartily, So do I' I may as well sign it now,' said Sir Cyril.  Sir John. you will witness my signature, and you, ltewson?' It was done. Sir Cyril signed the will; Sir John IIartopp and my clerk signed as witnesses. I reineniber Hewson telling me that Sir Cyril had given him a live-pound note for his trouble. I ant prepared to declare that a will was duly drawn up, signed, and witnessed; but I have not the faintest idea where that will is."

"It is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard," said the vicar. " Surely Sir Cyril cannot have destroyed it himself?"

" If lie had done so lie would have had another made," replied the lawyer. "Sir Cyril was never careless where the interests of others were concerned."

" What is to be done?" asked the vicar.

" I do not know " answered Mr. Anderson. "I

am more puzzled than I have ever been in my

life."

"Does any solution of the mystery occur to you?" asked Lady Laurayne.

"None whatever," replied the lawyer.. "I may however mention this fact. At the beginning of this year some mining shares which Sir Cyril toad always looked upon as a bad speculation suddenly became very valuable. lie sold them, and the money lie realized greatly enriched him. He wrote to me about it. and lie added these words;

j 'This will snake a considerable difference. I roust stake another will.' I have that letter among toy papers now, and can show it to anyone who may wish to see it. I saw Sir Cyril in February, and I said to him then, ' Ilave you thought any more about cancelling your will ?' He laughed as lie answered, ' No: I have had no time to think of it et. There is no need for hurry.' And the sub. ect was never mentioned between us again." There was a confused murmur when the lawyer flat down; tli',ii some suggest d one thing, some another. Lady Laurayne sad little, but sbe looked very pale and anxious.

"1 am much distressed " she sold, "and do not ,know what Is to be done.;

A clear sweet voice broke In:

"Let no one say that my father was careless.

blame lies anywhere, I am sure It Is not wtth

'

"You think then. Mr. Anderson," said the vicar, " that it Is possible Sir Cyril may have destrctyed the will, intending to make another?"

 ' That is the only thing that occurs to me," replied the lawyer. ' 1 see no other solution of the mystery."

It is a very grievous matter," said the vicar.

And then it struck Constance as somewhat strange that all seemed to be looking at her, some with wonder, solve with pity, all with interest yet the loss of the will mattered less to her that to anyone, she thought.

"I see but one remedy for the misfortune," said vicar, slowly. " Have you the rough notes yoc spoke of witli ),oil, Mr. Anderson ? "

Yes," rep lied the lawyer. producing some papers; "I leave all the instructiois that were given to me for making the will."

"Then I would suggest that you read them out, and that Sir Austin, as his father's heir, should act upon them."

"A very fair and just suggestion," acknowledged young Sir Austin.

" My notes are to this effect. To Sir Austin the estate descends by entail; to Lady Laurayne is given an annuity of fifteen hundred pounds, to each of her daughters a legacy of ten thousand pounds, and to his beloved child Constance, the daughter of his first wife, Plmilip}is I)arrell, Hilldrop Priory, with all its lands anti revenues."

There was dead silence, and again therecarne to Constance the conviction that everyone was looking at her.

"I may as well," continued the lawyer, "repeat the conversation that passed between Sir Cyril and myself when lie gave me instructions to make his first will. ' I should like the will drawn up at once,' lie said. ' It is not Broome I ain anxious about; that is entailed, and will go to the next male heir. But Hilldrop I hold, as it were, upon honor. It belonged to my wife, Philippa Darrell, and ought to have been settled oil her marriage; but she was romantic-she would not have any marriage-settlements. It was her wish that the Prior - should go to Constance. In fact, the child has peen brought up to consider herself heiress of Hilldrop. She is heiress of Hilldrop, and I wish to make her right secure.' This conversation, I should say " added the lawyer, " took place shortly after tile death of Sir Oyra's first wife."

Again a clear, sweet voice broke in

"There is no one living who can say that Hilldrop is not mine 1 " And, as Constance spoke, she stepped forward Into the middle of the rooni. ' Hilldrop is mine," she declared. "It was my mother's, and it is mine!"

" I have a very painful duty to perform," said Lady Laurayne, when silence was once restored. "I have listened to all that has been said, and I have arrived at a very different conclusion froin anyone else here. I believe that Sir Cyril destroyed the will because, oil reflection, lie considered that it was not a just one."

' rot)ust!"exclaimed Mr. Anderson.

No,' sire replied, boldly; "I say It was not just. Iilldrop belonged to Sir Cyril. His first wife virtually gave it to hint, and it belongs to his estate' it is part of his pro ierty, and goes with it. Being his, as it most uur'oui)tedly was, lie could do i as lie liked with it; and, from many things that he said to me, I have an unalterable conviction that of late lie changed his mind completely concerning Hilldrop "

" He never said anything of the kind to me," r plied Mr. Anderson. " Of that I am very cer




~i"IIThat may be," said Lady Laurayne. "Sir !gill does not appeal- to have consult@& you at all nrt , the last few rnontlts."


THE HEIRESS OF HILLDROP.


'43

" He has nut done so; but I believe the reason to be that lie had nothing to consult me upon. 1 Must say that I aui quite sure that, if Sir Cyril had ill his mind anything so important as the changing ofhis plans concerning Hilldrop, he would have consulted nee. I believe that your ladyship s mistaken."

" And T I feel sure that I am not," replied Lady Laurayne, warmly. "What makes inc more sure is that there is no trace of the will. I myself have always considered that Ililldrop belonged to sir Cyril. It was I'liili1ppa 1)arrell s, and, when lie married her, there being no settlement, all Shat she had in the world, as a matter of course, jecatue his. Is not that right to law ? "

"Right in law, but it Is not In justice," replied Mr. Anderson; and profound silence succeeded his remark.





CHAPTER XVI.

No scene could have been more dramatic than that enacted in the library at Broome. Mr. Awderson was lost ill a maze of per lexity and dismay; I lie vicar looked distressed and anxious, the sisters pale and seared; the handsome young heir, Sit* Austin, seemed to waver between his stately mother and the fair young step-sister whom lie loved so well. He looked sorrowfully from one to the other.

But the interest of the scene was centred in the two who now stood face to face III the twiddle of the room. It was war to the knife between them, war in which no one else cared to engage. Face to face, each drawn up to her full height, they stood-Constance, tall, ender, looking like a, pale lily ill her dark dress, the usual dreamy gentle expression of her face changed to one of quiet, deep resolution; Lady Laurayue, tall and stately, her face slightly flushed, her eyes shining, determination ill every feature. They had drawn near each ether, and Constance was the first to speak.

" Lady Laurayne," she said,  every word that you have uttered is false. My father, who never coimuitted an injustice in his life, always intended Hilldrop to be mine, because it was my mother's. He always was roost careful of iiiy interests, and, to render then secure, lie made a will leaving Hilldrop to ne. In your presence lie has spoken repeatedly of the Priory as mine. You know well that I nave been brought up as heiress of Hilldrop, that I have always been taught to regard it as my inheritance."

"I admit all that most frankly," returned Lady Laurayue; "but I must repeat that during the last few months Sir Cyril has spoken quite differently of Hilldrop and of his intentions concerning It. He has said more than once that Hilldrop Priory would form all excellent dower-house for the Ladies Laurayne."

At this the vicar looked steadfastly at her ladyship.

"Are you quite sure," he asked, "that there Is to mistake ? Is that perfectly true ?" She looked at hint proudly, almost Indignantly. " Do you think, sir, that I would be guilty of false

flood ? she asked.

 I hope not, niadatnti" he replied. " That which you say throws quite a new replied. on the matter. You now affirm that Sir Cyril had changed his mind, and did not intend Hilldrop to go to Miss Laurayue."

" I air sure of It," she answered.

"And you further believe that Sir Cyril destroyed the will he made preparatory to snaking another ? "

	That is a momentous question," said Lady Laurayne.

"The more need that It should be thoroughly answered," returned the vicar.

Site was silent for a few moments; then, glancIng at him with proud, fearless eyes, she replledt

" I do believe that my dear husband destroyed that will because he hhd changed kill plates, and that lie intended making another."

"Then," put in Mr. Anderson, " If Sir Cyril destroyed that will, intending to make another, how do you account for his not doing so ?"

"I do not seek to account for it, 'site replied; "I merely state what I know. I should say III)-self that it was not a pleasant task, and that lie postponed it. Another thing that contlrnis niy belief Is that, during the last few hours of his life, lie cried incessantly for Constance; he had soniething to say to her, and wanted to see her. In my opinion lie wished to tell her of this."

Lady Laurayue spoke with such an air of conviction that every one present was more or less impressed by what sue said.

"I may add something else," continued her ladyship-111 do not think that I shall betray Sir Cyril's confidence in repeating what he said to me. One day, when we were discussing the matter, he said: `It would be a great disappointment to Contance; but it is just possible she might be happier without Hilldrop. Her tastes are very simple, and a large estate is a great burden.'"

" 1' hen we inay take it for granted that you and Sir Cyril tallied the matter over very often ? "

"During the last three months, ' she replied, "not before."

	Why did not Sir Cyril send for me when he found himself in danger ? " asked Air. Anderson.

"lie was too ill to think of anything of the kind," answered Lady Laurayne, Sadly.

The vicar and the lawyer looked at each other.

"I really do not see," said Mr. Anderson, "what is to be done. It is a difliulty to which I can set no satisfactory termination."

" Hilldrop is mine, and I will never relinquish It!" Constance declared; and site and Lady Laurayue drew nearer to each other and stood face to face.

" My dear child," began her ladyship, " I would not for worlds injure you or de p rive you of your rights; but Hilldrop is not and never has beeii yours. It belonged to your fattier. A married woman has no property of her own unless it is trade hers Uy marriage-settlement. Having nQ marriage-settlement, everything your mother 'possessed became Sir Cyril's. Is not that the law, ir. Anderson ?"

" Yes, out ladyship, but, as I remarked before, it Is not jjustice," was the reply.

" What call be done ? " asked the vicar, despairtngl

 here Is only one thing that can be done." answered Mr. Anderson. "As the natter stands, Ililldrop does not belong to Miss Laurayue by law, but it can be made hers by deed of gift."

"That is a way out of the diiculy," said the vicar, with an air of relief. ' I am sure we all wish for justice, and nothing more. We can see that legally Hilldrop does not belong to Miss Laurayne, yet we know equally well that she has always been looked upon as its heiress. That will simplify matters and sets everything straight."

"It is the only just course to pursue," observed Mr. Anderson.

11 It is a course that shall never, with my consent, be pursued ! " cried Lady Laurayne, vehe. niently. "While I live I shall never consent to see niy dear husbatid's wishes so completely set aside.' Then she turned abrubtly to her son. ' Austin," she said, you bear this. You are young, but you are capable of judging for yourself in this matter. Remember that your father Intended Hilldrop to become part of the estate, to be your own, and that, if you are guilty of any such folly as giving it away, you will be acting agaiust his dearest wishes, and will incur my most severe displeasure."

11 But Constance, mother-what of Constance ?"

cried the boy. " Ale cannot take all she has and Leave her nothing. 1 (to not want 1-lilldrop."

  it 14 not a question of whether you want It or not. If your father Intended it to become part of the family property, You are morally bound to carry out his intentions."

But no such intention has been expressed," said the boy.

It is clearly expressed through me," she fusisted. "Still, is you say, Constance must be provided for. I think it will meet the justice of the case and her requirements if you give her a ortuue of twenty thousand pounds."

-That is hardly a fair equivalent," said Arr. .'1 nderson. "The revenue of Ililldrop is four thousand per anuutn,"

'` My son can please himself," returned Lady Laurayne proudly . "I think the sum quite suilicient, and indeed a very handsome fortune for

aThat question need not be discussed," said Consta.ucecalmly, "l ant heiress of Ililldrop. It is mine; every one here present knows it is mine. No one of the name of Tollemaclie has or ever can have the least claim upon it."

` No; but when your father married your mother, the Priory estate became his," explained Mr. Anderson.

" tie intended it to be mine." urged Constance.

lie leas expressed that wish and iii teal ion orally a hundred tires over, if not in writing."

"That is just where the law steps iii," said Mr. Anderson. "The spoken wishes of a man during; life are of no value after his death. They must be written to be of legal force."

Did my father Know that?" asked Constance.

" Must assuredly," replied Mr. Anderson.

Then," site said, "I ant quite satisfied that my father has not died without leaving a will. I ant is sure of It as though I held the will in uty hands. These sunrises of Lady Laurayne's have ho foundation in fact. She supposes my father destroyed his will ; site has no proof of it. She supposes lie Intended to retain 11illdrop as part of the fancily estate; she call give no proof of it. But I, who knew Sir Cyril's love for my mother and for tttyself-I am sure he would study my interests fiat. My own unalterable Conviction is that a will exists, and that it is here at Broome."

"I should he glad if you could find it. Miss Laurayne," said the lawyer, with a shake of the head ; " but I sun doubtful of its existence."

11 1 till not," site answered, confidently. "I feel sure that the day will collie when it will be found."

There was an awkward silence for souls ininutes. Then Nlr. 1fr. Anderson said:

yo" I rieve over the position in whichh you are placed, :Miss Laurayne; but unless tine will is found, you can never take possession of Hilldrop. If it should never be found Ililldrop can never be urs."

" It will he much better, Constance. for you to act reasonably, as the law is against you, and to ;eke the fortune offered to you. It will be more ;brut sufficient for your wants, and you will have

" I think," said Constance, ` it will not be out of placo if I ask for another rigorous search for the will. 1 have thought over the matter. I do not believe it is destroyed, and I should therefore like a rigorous search to be made for it."

	It shall be made," promised her ladyship.

"I wish to add this,' continued Constance. " i shall remain here for two or three weeks, while the search is made; if it prove unsuccessful, I shall leave Broome never to return. I will make to compromise. 1 will have my own, lily iuheritance, or nothing."

There was a general murmurot dlsmayaud pity as these words fell front the young girl's lips.


" You are agitated now, Constauce ; you will awake to better sense and reason," remarked Lady Laurayne; and then the painful seems elided.

The lawyer was the first to take his lea ve.

"This has been the most painful hour of tit)' life,' lie said. '`Miss Lanrayue, having always beet your father's friend, you will always find no, yours. Send for me at any titae, and I will give you whatever aid I can."

"You NN-111 be all the more my friend for your kindness to my sister," said the young baronet, with delightful frankness.

The vicar shook hands with her warmly.

" 1 am always your friend, my dear," lie assured her gently,

The sisters went to Constance and kissed her. They were truly sorry for her, as was Sir Austin ; but they honestly believed their mother to be right in all site had said.





CHAPTER XVII.

Trig news soon spread that Sir Cyril Laurayne had died without making a will, and that therefore his daughter would not inherit IIilldrop Priory. Sensational paragraphs made their appearance tit the fashionable journals. and it was a nice-days' wonder to society to find that, after all, site who had trade such a stir as a beauty, and who had been known principally as the heiress of Hilldrop, was no heiress.

Constance waited. for some weeks at Broome, while search was made for the will. She did not like to disturb the quiet and sorrowful repose that had fallen over the old mansion now that its master was gone, and therefore site abstained front mentioning Hilldrop in Lady Laurayne's pres. ence; but her ladyship discussed it continually with lien yomig son, until site had thoroughly finpressed hint with the justice of her own cause.

Let us tit the circumstances to other characters," she said to hint once. "Imagine that Sir John Hartopp marries twice-that ills first wife brings hint a large fortune in land and shares. It becomes his. Site dies, leaving one daughter; ire marries again, and has a son. Do you think the law would give the first wife's fortune to her daughter, If it was not settled upon her ? Cer. tainly not."

"But Constance has always looked upon Hilldrep~as hers by right." urged Sir Austin.

"Yes. that makes it harder for her," agreed her ladyship. "I say it with all candor-It would certainly have been hers if her mother or father had looked more keenly after her interests. If her mother had been more practical concerning her marriage-settlements, and her dear father regard ing his will. Hilldrop would have been hers; now the law stands between her and what was doubt less intended to be her inheritance. In affairs such as these you have to eonsider the future at

well as the present, Austin. You cannot help being In the position in which you are; atti, though you and Constance might arrange the matter, as you thought, peaceably, your successors :tit([ hers might dispute the Justice and log:tlity of any such settlement."


Mother," said the young heir, sorrowfully, ' 1 shall never be quite happy, and my mind will never be at rest, when I remember that I have taken IIilldrop from Constance."

" It is not you will) take it, my (tear boy. You must always remember it is your father's wish :hat influences me, and also that it Is his wish shat incites you owner of Ililldrop. Your father ,bought of it, wished it, planned it, desired ityour father, not I."

-Yes, that is the only consolation." said Sir Austin. wearily; ' but for that I should take the earilest opportunity to make it over to Constance. I cannot endure the thought of keeping it: nor can I bear to think that I am in any way dlsregardiug iuy father's wishes. It has made life quite unhappy, mother."

Those words seemed to distress Lady Laurayne greatly. She looked imploringly at her son.

' Do not say that, Austin,'' she cried ; remember that you hold my happiness as well as all your own ill yotn' hands."

iyo"I must make the best of It,"said the handsome ung heir, half moodily. "I love Constance, and cannot endure the thought that she should suffer any injustice. I will tell you one thing, mother I will never touch the revenues of Hilldrop. Until now I have loved the place; henceforth I shall hate It."

And Sir Austin kept ]its word. Not one penny of the lfilldrop money did lie ever take. nor did lie ever derive the smallest advantage from the possession of the estate.

lie was perfectly sincere in his belief In his mother ; he never for one moment doubted the truth of her statements. And so for some weeks matters rested, and during that time there was nothing that gave ('instance more pleasure than the honest affection that Sir Austin slwweVor her.

The search for the will proved fruitless. If one had ever existed, it certainly existed no longer. All the nooks and comet-stliat Irad not before, been examined were now laid bare, but no will was discovered, and everyone agreed that it was useless to waste more time over it.

Then followed, as far as it was possible, a settlement of affairs. The late baronet's wishes, as expressed in the notes given by him to his lawyer, were all carried out, with the exception of that concerning Ililldrop. A11 the legacies he had intended to bequeath were paid; thesistersreceive d the very handsome sums Sir Cyril had decided to leave them, and there remained only the dilliculty with Constance to adjust.

She, however, was brut in her determination. Site considered tixtt a gross injustice had been lone to her, au injustice that site could not fortive. She spoke very plainly to Lady Laurayne abort it when the question wasdiscussed between theta, and again tier ladyship implored of her to accept the twenty thousand pounds offered to her: but Constance was resolute in tier refusal.

"1 have no claim to money derived frotn Broome," she said. ' and I shall never touch it. As this mistake, if mistake it be, has been made, tit, right thing is for Sir Austin to make 1Iilldrop mute by (teed of gift. You Iinow that it is mine by right: you know that neither you nor your Children have the slighest claim to it. Keeping it front me is a cruel, at wicked injustice!"

" 1 am sorry you look upon It tit that light." said her ladyship. "You see tile law must be respected, and the law forbids you to take Ililldrop."

Constance looked steadfastly at Lady Laurayne.

"We shall meci In another world," she sai 1.

" There you will have to give all account of yooo,, actions, and what will you say? Shall you be able to meet uiy father amt mother face to face and tell them how you have robbed their child Y'"

" Do not use the word 'rob,' my hear; it has an ugly sound, and I ant not a thief. 1 have merely carried out your father's intentions."

I wish,'' cried Constance, with sudden passion, "that lie knew! I wish he could come back to defend life! I ant alone in the wide world. No one would believe that I was once the beloved and cherished daughter of the house."

' I do not wish to be unkind to you, Constance,' said her ladyship, gently.

It is not a question of kindness, but of justice,' sharply returned Constance. " Be jus to tile, Lady Laurayne. Give ire my own; give me that to which I have a right-miry inheritance! "

 ' if you would but cease to be at tragedy-queen, and listen to reason." interrupted Lady Laurayne, impatiently. " 1 offer you a fortune, a liaudsome fortune, and the kindest treatment you call desire is yours. You call either live with lite at Hilldro p or stay with your brother at Broome. You will have love, care, and affection-"

"And forfeit my inheritance!" Interrupted Constance. "No: when I leave Broome, I pass out of your lives forever."

"You will only make a scandal and aseisation, when you might, by acting differently live hap. pily, and at the same time receive a splendid fortime. I never dreamed that you would act in this fashion, Comtattce."

"You could never have Imagined that I should behave ill any other," site replied. "But reproaches are useless. I do not think. however, even though you may live at Ililldrop and hold it as your own, that you will be a very happy w o. luau."

I shall not allow any sentimental regret, to in. terfere with my happiness," r ;turned Lady Lau rayne, lightly. "You are wilful and obstinate, Constance, and I fear there- is malice ill this determination of yburs. You think, naturally enough, that you will meet with universal pity and sympathy-that people will say we have driven you front home, and that you arecontpelled to work. But I have taken care that the world shall know about the twenty thousand pounds. You will not meet with much pity, for everyone will tltillkhow foolish you are."

"I shall not seek pity," said Constance. She knew that, when she left Broome, every hope of her life would be extinguished, and that it would matter little whether site was pitied or not.

No lover could have been more devoted to her than wits Captain Dysart during this trying time. lie wrote the fondest of letters, ill which lie implored tier to allow hint to visit Broome ; but she would not accede to his wish. tier answer was that she would wait for a time before inviting hint.

Her father's death had been a terrible blow tc her, and the loss of Ililldrop had been ahut.st overwhelming; but in the near future she foresaw a trouble more serious still.

It came only too quickly. One morning in the early autuuni she received a letter front Sir Thomas I>ysart. She went out to read it alone, and it contained just what she had expected, just what she had dreaded and foreseen.

Sir Thomas had been in the south of France, and had only just heard of the misfortune that had befallen tier. He was grieved to increase tier t roubles, but the engagement between his son and herself must now be considered at ant end. He knew Lance would rebel against his decision. but he intended to remain first, and. if, in spite of his wishes, the marriage was carried out, lie should at once diiiiuherit his son and divide all his money among various charities Ili London.

I kuuw," lie contituted, "that all good women

are unselfish. It Is for you to prove, Miss Laurayne, whether your love for my son Is selfish or not. It your love be of the ordinary t pe, now that you have lost your fortune, you will be more anxious than ever to marry one who you way think has good prospects. If your love lie of the ordinary kind, you will think more of your own happiness than of his; you will marry him, with not 11iig but poverty, nay, ruin ii prospect. You will in this fashion secure your own misery. I know my son, and of all men in this world lie is the least likel to be happy on a small income-in fact, lie could not be happy on limited means, and lie would learn in time to hate the wife who had so dragged him down. If, on the contrary, your love is above the ordinary type, and you care more for him than for yourself, then you will write to hint to say that you release him front his engagement, that you will never be the means of dragging hint down into the depths of poverty You will do even more than that; you will withdraw yourself entirely front him, go for a time to some place to which he will not be able to follow you, and keel) from him all knowledge of your whereabouts until lie has forgotten you or despairs of finding you. I know limy sots. Having pled fed his faith to you, he will wish to keep his pledge, even at the risk of his own ruin; so that his future, his happiness or misery, his prosperity or ruin, rests avitle you. Remember, 1 :tit not writing idle words; I never do. Do not delude yourself with the belief that it will be all right in the end-that, if you are married 1 shall ' come round' and forgive you. I shall never do anything of the kind. If you wish for my son's welfare, and desire to prove it, you Nvill give him tip, and let him see plainly that there is no hope of you ever becoming his wife. By doing this you will deserve my lasting gratitude. I am. I repeat, sorry to add to your trouble -I would fain help you; but, having read the newspaper account carefully, I alit reluctantly forced to the conclusion that you have no hope of chance of establishing your claim to Hilldrop. If I were in a position to advise you, I should say, ' Take whatever compensation or equivalent may be offered to you.' I am sorry to have to write this letter; but niv son is niy first consideration in life, and I must study his welfare at any cost. If I can assist you in any way, command rue, and believe me to remain always,

"Your sincere friend,

"TIIOMAS DYSAKT."

Though cruel and cutting, though dictated by a sordid mercenary mind, the letter was full of common sense. Constance knew that her inarriage now with her lover would ruin hits.

She clasped the letter for some minutes, bewildered; then )let- ncind recovered its balance.

"I feel that I ant being crushed inch by inch. I lost my mother first: much of lily happiness went when my father married again; then my father ,tied; then Hilldrop was lost to tie; and now icy lover is denied time. I wonder if my clip is full? I have nothing more to lose except my life."

The next morning's post brought her a letter front Captain Dysart, which leas the very opposite in tone to that she had received from leis father. He told her that lie did not care in the least for her money-he had loved her for her own beautiful self-that lie should love her just the same were. ,lie penniless. and that nothing but death should part them. His father had written, declaring that, the engagement must be at once broken off, mid that, If it were not, lie should not only disinht'rit him. but should discontinue his allowance.

Ile may do so, my darling," wrote her lover,

but it will be in vain. I ant young and strong.

a man according to his industry and integrity. and not weighed In accordance with his money or birth. I shall throw off the old life willingly, cheerfull , and love the new one that gives me you; for will suffer poverty, loss, any and everything to gain you. Let nothing that my father says, dear love, distress you. Let Deene, Hilldrop, and all the money go; give me only your beautiful self, and happiness will be ours. Ishall come and see you next Tuesday, and, if I call, I shall persuade you to let me marry you at once. 1 long to have the power and the right to comfort and protect you."

As she read those words tears fell from her eyes, and site kissed the paper that brought her such comfort. But she had already resolved, and nothing would shake her determination to release her lover. She would never now show hint Hilldrop, never ride with hint through the golden broom: never more would she see the gallant, handsome young soldier who loved her so dearly and so well.

CHAPTER XVIII.

THE sun had risen and set twice since Constance Laurayne had received the letters of Sir Thomas Dysart and his son, and she had come to a decis. ion-come to it with tears that almost blinded her, with pain that was almost past endurance. Site believed that she was acting rightly in refusing any compromise that would sanction what site knew to be all tin just and wicked action with regard to Hilldrop, even as she believed site was doing right in leaving her lover and refusing to blight all his prospects in life.

lie was coming ors Tuesday; but she dared not see him, she dared not trust herself to his influence. She could not look into his dear eyes and know that site would see them no more. She could not bear the clan of his hands, and know that she was never to touch them again. Site could not resist a prayer from his dear lips; flight therefore, was the only means by which she could save her lover and herself.

It was the close of the day when she came to this resolution. The air was hot and oppressive, the rooms seemed stifling, and the whole family were out on the lawn, Lady Laurayne having suggested that they should take their dessert there.

Standing among the syringas Constance made up her mind as to her future. She would leave Broome in the morning, but she would not inform her relatives whither she. was truing. Site would write to her lover and tell hint that they had parted forever; and then, safely lodged In London, she would endeavor to earn her own living. Her father had often told her that she could make a small fortune as an artist, and now site would try. There was only one gleans of pleasure left in her life-she loved her art; but for that, earth would now be a blank to her.

The light of the setting sun fell upon Lady Laurayne and her children as Constance took a last farewell of them. She went back slowly to the house. In tier mind she had already separated herself from them forever. She resolved not to take more clothes with her than she would absolutely require. All her beautiful dresses and ornaments she would leave behind; but tier jewelry she would retain, lest povet_h' should overtake tier. She found that she had nearly a hundred pounds in money. so that there was no fear of immediate want. Then, (caving packed her boxes, she sent for Sarah King, and told what she in. tended to do.

` You can go with me If you like, Sarah," she said. "You can be my faithful friend, eompan

than live in luxury with your enemies. But, oh, that It should have come to this-toy mister's daughter, the heiress of Hilldrop, to go out In the world to get her living! Mark my words, miss -Heaven is just, and, though it may be years first, It ty own opinion is that the will wi l be found yet, and found at Broonte. With all her fair face and winning ways. lily Lady Laurayile knows all about it, ant she will be found out!"

Consta nce made her iinal arrangements that night. She would have her breakfast brought early to her own room ; then, while the family were )rcakfasting, the carriage should be ordered, and ;he, with her few belongings and Sarah King, Mould drive to the station.

She spent tile greater part of the night in writfitg letters of farewell. To Lady Laurayne she wrote all she felt, and she told her that, unless the will was found, she should never return to Broonte. Her letter to Sir Austin was kind and affectionate; site expressed tier belief iu the existence of the will, that it wits either hidden or lost at Broome ; and nothing, she added, would ever clutnge that conviction. She bade hint farewell, and told (tint, as site had told Lad ,, laurayne, that, unless the will was found, site should never see Brootue again. To each sister site also wrote a farewell letter. Then she replied to Sir Thomas Dysart. Her answer to him was brief and indignant; and, callous and worldly as he was, Sir Thomas winced when lie read it. He felt humbled for many t long day afterward and lie kept the contents of that letter carefully to himself. The test of the night she spent iu writing to her lover. It was a sine le, noble renunciation of hint for his own sake. rt was her final farewell to him who was dearest to her. She told him that site was going out into the world to lose herself in the crowd of nice and women who tilled it; that it was for his sake, and because of her g11at love for him, because of her great fear of marring his life, that she had cut herself off front all; that she was going where no one could find her, and where she had no desire to be found. Site wrote all that was ill her heart to hint: and he held that letter sacred until death, held it as his dearest earthly possession.

There was no concealment about the manner in which she left Broonte. The carriage was driven round, the boxes were carried down, and Constance, with Sarah King, entered the carriage and was driven off to ifavelston Station. When the coachman was about to return, Constance gave hint the four letters she had written, and asked him to deliver them.

She was well oil her way to London when the letters were read. Lady Laurayne was tile first to peruse hers. She looked round with something like dismay when she lead finished.

" Constauce has gone 111 she said.

Sir Austin uttered an exclamation of dismay; while Edith and Blanche looked at each other is ilent inquiry and consternation.





CHAPTER XIX.

EIGHT years had passed since Constance Lau. raymie bade adieu to Broomne. There had been no search made fur tier by the Brootue people : but it 'Mss understood that Mr. Anderson had her address, although lie was bound in honor not to divulge it. W1' lien Constan ce wrote to him to tell hint what she had done, and what her plans were, she added these words: "I shall live believing in the mercy of Heaven and in Heaven's justice, and holding a firm conviction that some day a niessage will be brought to me that the will is found;" and Mr. Anderson never forgot the words.

Captain Dysart spent weeks in London searching for tier. Then, when he found that it was all in vain, and that there was but little chance of his ever seeing tier or hearing of tier again, he

went down to peene, and between father and sot there was a painful scene.

T1te cap tatn was indignant and angry t lie re fused to listen to anything that Sir Thomas urged in extenuation of his conduct.

"  You have taken from rue the light of my life!" he cried, furiously. -You have blighted my youth by taking my love froth me! 1 do not ears what becomes of mite now. You would have taketi my allowance from tie if I had married Constance I will never touch it again. You would have ld me gu to rack amid ruin, for all ou cared, If I baO married Constance. Well, it shall be as thought 1 had married tier. 1 will give up my commission sacrifice ny prospects and everything I hold deaf' in life, because that which I hold most dear it gone. Give your money to the charities you elect, father. I would give, were it mine, twice al much as you are worth even to know where Cotstance is. The Twenty-ninth sails next week foi the Cape. I shall exchange at,d go with them f and I hope some Kaflir will deal me a death-blow, It will be more merciful titan the one you have dealt me."


So lie raged In his anger and despair. He would not remain under his father's roof for a single night, and lie carried out his threats. He exchanged into the Twenty-ninth Regiment, and, before leaving for the Cape, told his father that nothing would induce hunt to return to Ellgland unless lie could find and marry Constance Laurayne. He had done all that lie could to discover her whereabouts, and, as a final effort, had gone to Scotland Yard, and told the whole story to one of the inspectors, promising a handsome reward to anyone who should be able to send hint any Information concerning Constauce.

~Vheil what lie had done was beyond recall, Sit Thomas was truly sorry, and would fain have undone it. He had notanticipaced that his son would take the course ire had. The career of the young man had been hopelessly spoiled by the very means his father had adopted to bring about the opposite result, and the London charities would be so much the richer.

Sir Thomas, dearly as he loved money, and deeply angry as he felt with his son, had many a heartache. lie wrote letter after letter, imploring hint to come home. But Captain Dysart had no interest In life since he had lost Constance. Then war broke out at the Cape, and he was durIng that period one of the most gallant and ever getic officers engaged. No one but lihmiself knew how he sought death.

So eight years had passed away. Constants had taken up her abode to an old-fashioned house in South Kensington, where she occupied a suit of roosts. Sarah King, faithful as ever, was her attendant. Constance not only supported herself, but made a very fair income by her paintings, and her lovely flower-groups were eagerly sought for and commanded good prices. Time had not touched her delicate, dreamy beauty, but had, on the contrary rather added to it.

Nothing oft importance had happened to her in those years. She had painted pictures and had sold them; she had risen and slept; each day had been p:uinfully like the day before. Mr. Anderson and the vicar wrote occasionally, and informed tier of what was passing at Broome and Hilldrop: but no news came of the will. The lawyer had long given up expecting any, and the vicar had no gleam of hope. But a change was coming.

One morning-Constauce never forgot the shock of surprise and pleasure that she experienced on the occasion-a telegram came to her from Mr. Anderson. A wild idea possessed her that the will was found. for surely lie would not telegraph regarding anything less important than that Her has trembled so violently that she could hssdly open the envolope.

From that ntotnent a new world scented to o fen to ]let'. Of late site had hardly thought of ~ter aunt Elena, her mother's beloved sister. For the Last few years there had been no correspondence between then), for Madame Suarez was never so happy as whuu Irave ing, and. Since her widowhood, she hall seldool stayed lung in the sauce place; but now, for her d:uigltter's sake, she hail collie home to Eurlaud. to settle there peruianentiv, an l her first thought was of tier sister's child, Constance.

Being in iuoras ire of what hail happened. they had gone aft once to ti llldrop. The!: surprise and dismay were great when they leaaord the state of affairs. After sonic reflection, finding that no one at Itillslrop had the least idea of whereConstanee was, they applied to Mr. Audersou, file lawyer, and lie was able to afford them the information they desired.

On returning to London they went at once to the address given to tltetn, and there, to their great joy, they found Cotsstautce.

Mercedes, who was some seven or eight years youuetr than her cousin, was a girl of uncommon loveliness. She iii tilted the dark beauty of her father, was bright., vivacious. animated, full of spirit and iutelligencr, auel she fell ill love at once with her beautiful, fair-haired cumin.

" You have beret sutlrrih g all this misery." she said,  while we have been wandering over tile face of the earth. I shall never leave you again, Constance. I wish I had known you before."

Constalice told tier beautiful young cousin the whole story of her life.

)lour after hour passed, and they did not rise Constance telling calmly the story of tier loss ol~ fortune, Mercedes iuterruitting at times with eager questions, then listening again withearuest attention.

"It is a strange story," said Mercedes, when Constance had hiiished her Inu'rative. "The fact that puzzles me most is Itow, believing what you (to, you can rest here in peace.

"Does any suspicion attach to Lady Laurayne'.?"

'Chcre is good reason for stisjecting tier."

"Do \ou believe that she either destroyed or concealed the will ? " asked Mercedes.

Constance was silent for a few moments, her fair, proud face full of thought; then she answered

" I (10, honestly, Mercedes. I believe that she found it, and that she either destroyed it of concealed it.. I have an Inward conviction of it ; I can hardly tell you why. I feel that the will still exists, and that is hidden sollnewhere at Broome. Of course it is natural that I should cling to that belief-I cannot help it; yet more-I feel that my belief is well founded."

" \Vhy not go back to Broome, then, and look for it yourself? " asked Mercedes.

Constance shook her head.

"It would be quite useless, even if I could do it. Before I left the house I searched everywhere. Were I to return, I should not know where' to look that I have not looked already."

	' Then let someone else search for you," suggested Mercedes.

"To what end? I have nothing but suspicion and personal conviction to go upon. I have no )roof -not the fit iittest-noevidelice. no witnesses.

"Then, though knowing full well that you are the rightful owner of Hiltdrop, you mean to live oil in this fashion until you die! "

"I see no help for it." replied Constance, sadly.

11 And the devoted lover whose heart you must have almost broken-what of him'?"

"lie will forget the perhaps as the years go by," returned Constance. " 1 often think of him, and at times wonder what I should feel if, on opening the newspm.per, I found an announcement of his marriage. 1 weave all kinds of fancies.

She was very kind to me, even to the extent of pressing me to spend some months at Hilldrop. Her daughters, she said, were not at home then. but, they would return in a few weeks, and would be delighted to know me. But my mother was not, to be won over. She declined to rentain, and sM returned to London the next day.

" Will you ?" exclaimed Constance, In surprise.

"Yes. I have tut idea: but I will not tell you now what it is. What a long talk we have had, Constance I I am hungry and thirsty, yet I could talk to you for hours longer. I shall explain my idea to nianuaa, and if she approves of it, I will tell you what it is. Do you feel inclined to return to your painting to-day, or will you go home with

" Neither, my dearest Mercedes. I have opened the very depths of my heart to you; I have laid bare wounds that will never heal. I shall try to forget ..y own story in the interest I may find in those of others."

Then slowly the two girls walked back to the house.

"It Is a lonely life for you, Constance" Mercedes said. I do not like to go away and leave you alone. I wish yot, would come and live with us; we could make you SO happy. We cannot offer you a home like Broonte or Hilldrop; but mamma says she would give anything if you

CHAPTER XX.

AFTER hearing tier cousin's stcry, Mercedes went home with her heart full of it. She found her mother awaiting her somewhat anxiously.

"How is Constance to-day?" asked Madame Suarez.

"She is well. mamma. Whet. 11 reached Queen's Gardens she was very busy finishing a drawing. :?he is a true artist ; her ttowers are so natural, t lie delicate coloring is so perfectly imitated. that almost iiivolnntary I put out my hand to take a. lily from the bunch before me. The sun was shining and the day beautifully clear and bright, so 1 managed to persuade her to come out into the park with nte. and tell me her story in her own way; and I have spent the brightest hours of this bright clay listening to it."


"And what conclusion have you arrived at, Mercedes?" asked mad:une.

"Wlty, that it is the most cruel Injustice I ever beard of in my life!" she replied, emphatically.


That, is m opinion, too.' said Madame Suarez. I am glad that we agree."

Later that same evening Madame Suarez and her daughter sat alone in their drawing-room. The

tong windows were wide open, the lace curtains drawn aside, and the fresh air came in freely, bringing with it the odors of the old-fashioned flowers hl the garden and the roses that clung around the windows. They could hear the distant roll of carriages, and madame sighed more than once as she thought of the thousand delights of the wonderful city; but Mercedes had asked her

 ,o spend a quiet evening at home, as she wanted Zo talk to her; and reluctantly, though with her usual sweetness of manner, madame had consented. Now, however, Mercedes seemed more 'ucliued to sit in silent meditation than to talk.

  I thought you wanted to speak to lie, bier2des ? "

MSoI do, mamma," Mercedes said at last. "But L;as doing what is unusual with me-I was think

first.,,

Then we may hope for something good," laughingly remarked madame. " What is it that engrosses you ?"

g Constance," replied Mercedes. "I cannot foret her. It is of her that I wish to speak to you. [ow cruelly she has been treated 1 In a country like this, it seems to me that it should be impossible fm so great an injustice to be done. I cannot imagine why people who know of it do not rise up against it."

 ' People seldom rebel against anything if It does not affect their own interests," said madame. ' It is both sad and pitiful that such an injustice should be permitted; yet we can do nothing to help Constance."

" I am not sure of that," responded Mercedes. " Constance seems convinced that Sir Cyril's w?11 is still in existence at Broonme, and though she cannot account for the conviction, she is nevertheless quite sure of it. It is part of her nature, part of her life, part of herself, this belief."

It stay be true," said madame.

Site dreams of the will," continued Mercedes -"dreams always the same thing, that a stranger comes to tell her the will is found. That is singular, is it not, mamma? "

"No, I do not think so. The fact of the will being lost has naturally impressed her so deeply that even ill sleep she cannot forget it."

"That is a plausible explanation," said Mercedes. ' Yet 1 am inclined to believe with her that the will is in existence. She is so earnest in her belief that site made a convert of me."

Madame Suarez looked up in wonder.

"Do you, too, Mercedes, believe," she asked,

	'that poor Sir Cyril really left a will, and that it ie at Broome?"

"Yes; with my whole heart, mother," she replied, earnestly.

"Then how do you account for its non-production, Mercedes? 'they appear to have searched everywhere for it. Lady Laurayne gave fullest assistance: the vicar, the lawyer, Constance herself, everyone interested, had liberty to search where they would; there was no restraint on all ymue. If the will had been put away carelessly by ;ir Cyril. they must have found it; it could not lave been overlooked. I am rather of the opinion that Sir Cyril destroyed it himself."

" You do not think it possible that anyone else destroyed it, (to you, mamnnta?" asked nlercedes.

I should think not, my dear. Such all idea never occurred to me. Who would do such a wicked deed?"

11 That is the question-who would? I merely suggest it. It may have been destroyed or hiddell. Constance thinks it was secreted to some place impossible to discover."

But by whom, my dear? Who would run such a risk? It Is a serious offence, you know."

' Some' people do not calculate the risk they run where the probable gain is large. But, mamma. do you not think it feasible that Sir Cyril's will may be still in existence at Broome?

"It may be, of course; but t (1o not think It probable. England is not a land of romance, Mercedes. You do not find crime of that desper. ate kind among the upper classes. There are only two persons benefited by the loss of the will -Sir Austin and Lady Laurayne. It is foolish to think that either of them would have done such a wicked deed, would have ventured upon anything so full of risk and danger. Lady Laurayne derives the greatest benefit front the document not being forthcoming; but I am sure she would not be a party to destroying it. It is such a serious offence."

  We will leave the doer of the deed out of the question for the present, and try only to find out if the deed be done. I told Constance, mauuua, that I had in idea; but 1 did not tell her what it was. I want to confide it to you, and to persuade you to let me act upon it for ('onstance's sake."

"I will if it is feasible, Mercedes," replied madame. "Tell me what it is."


" It is this. When next Lady Laurayne invites me to Hilldrop, let the go. She asked me to go down this summer; if she repeats the invitation, will you let me accept it? You did not seem willing before."

" No, I did not care for you to go ; but If you have any particular reason, any especial object, 1 will consent."

'' I know you will laugh, mamma, when I tell you what it is. You will think I am superstitious, foolish, imaginative-and I plead guilty to being all three-but, just as Constance believes that the will is at Hilldrop, so I believe that I shall find it. I cannot help my conviction any more than she call hers. Now do not laugh, maninia. When I read that beautiful life of Joan of arc to you, you cried over the verses, and you said to me, ' Every life has its Heavenly voices, but most people are deaf to them.' "

" It is true," said madame, gently; " few hear and obey."

`Every since Constance told me her story, a voice has ti lied my ears-a voice that bids me go to Hilldrop, a voice that says. `Go; you will find the will I' The words seemed to ring in my ears all the way home."

' My dear Mercedes," smiled madame, "you are full of fancies."

l"It is not a fancy, mamma. People said so of Joan of Arc ; they said It was neither Heavenly nor Angelic voices that she heard, but only those of her own the%fining. Do believe that this is no imagination of mine. Surely, if I can (1o anything to help Constance, I ought. She is not poor, nor does she suffer privations: but she bears )atiently a great Injustice which has cost her liar over and the whole happiness of her life. Surely, if I could recover for her what is really hers, I should be doing her the greatest of services? "

" I do not deny it; but I cannot see what you will gain by going to Hilldrop."

"Let me try, mamma. You know I have often heard you say that I have inherited from lny father a certain keenness-not talent, but keenness-of observation. What would escape the notice of another would not escape me: what another would hardly see would be full of meaning to me. I have frequently heard you mention this characteristic, so that there is no vanity in my speaking of it. Now, if I have this faculty of keen observation, of rapid, sure, safe judgment, of seeing farther and more clearly tlian some others, let me use it for Constance's benefit."

" In what way. Mercedes? " asked madame.


"Let me go to I illdrop and see if I can discover anything of the fate of the will."

My dear child, that would be In plain English to act the part of 'a spy toward Lady Laurayne and her household."

	' No; you are mistaken, niamnta," cried Atero1+w "A cruel wrong has been done, two lives

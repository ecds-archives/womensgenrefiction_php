<pb n="5"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.CHAPTER I*Love steals into every heart*Some time in life; it is the will of Heaven.SHELLEY.<p>IT was seven o'clock on a warm June evening. The shadows of early twilight were just beginning to gather over the hills and vales of southern Maryland as the shriek of the evening express train which had been due at the station of Dunwoldsome twenty minutes previous sounded shrilly in the distance.</p><p>A young and lovely girl paced impatiently to and fro on the platform, keeping well in the shadow of the building, casting anxious glances in the direction of the on-coming train, then back fearfully at a large stone building standing like a grim sentinel on the brow of an adjacent hill.</p><p>Another moment and the panting train had dashed up to the station.</p>                                   <p>With a little glad cry and another fearful glance at the stone With a little glad cry and another fearful glance at the stone house on the hill, the young girl sprung swiftly up the steps and stood timidly in the door of the car.</p> <p>Several young gentlemen, who had settled resolutely back in their seats and turned their heads and stared out of the window when a fleshy old lady entered the railway car a station below, took but a single glance at the slender girl in the doorway, dressed in a natty suit of navy-blue trimmed with white braid, and at the pretty, dimpled face half shaded by the sailor hat that was crushed down over her brown curls, and immediately each young fellow spring to his feet with a flush, a smile, and a bow to proffer the pretty young stranger his seat.<p>No-less than five of them! No wonder the young girl was slightly embarrassed and bewildered.</p><p>The train gave a sudden lurch forward, and she took the seat nearest her, with a very demure " Thank you, sir," and a drooping of the white lids over her brown eyes.</p> <pb n="6 ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE."/><p> Placing her luggage in the rack overhead, he took the unoccupied seat beside her, mentally wondering who she was, where she was going, and why such a pretty young girl was permitted to travel alone, and at night.</p><p>Meanwhile the train rushed on through the fast-gathering darkness, and as the lights from the large stone house on the hill vanished from the her sight, the young girl hid her pretty face in her handkerchief,and the slender form shook with enmotion like a quivering leaf in a gale.</p>A thrill of intense pitty stirred the heart of the young man seated beside her.</p><p> His fair, handsome face flushed, Ah, if he could but do something--say something to comfort her!</p> <p>In his graet sympathy, his eager curiosity to know the cause of her grief, and his implusiveness, he threw prudence to the winds.</p><p>"You are in trouble," he said, kindly. "can I, a stranger, help you in any way?"</p><p>He was amazed at the faceshe raised from the folds of the snowy handerkerchief; it was fairly convulsed with laughter, and the merry brown eyes were sparkling with suppressed mirth.</p>She saw the look of wonder and astonished in the handsome  face turned turned toward her, and again the brown curly head and sailor hat were half hidden in the the folds of the snowy handkerchief with a burst of laughter.</p><p>"You must excuse me, sir," she faltered, at length, blushing as red as a rose, "I am sorry that I disturbed you, but it was vey funny I--I could not keep from  laughing; indeed, I could not keep from laughing; indeed, I could not though I tried my best."</p><p>He looked down into her face, and saw that she coud  not be over sixteen or seventeen years of age at most. And he judged, too, that she was a school-girl, from the two books, English Grammer and and history, she held tightly ,clasped in her little, slim white hands.</p><p>Of ourse he was more than anxious to know What it was that amused her so. Her answer had piqued his curiosity; but he was too thorough a gentleman to venture to inquire.</p><p>Perhaps she raed the question in his eyes, for she went on, with all the thoughtlessness of a school-girl:</p><p>"As the train moved out from the station at Dunwold, I saw lights flashing hurriedly from room to room in the large stone house on the brow of the hill; then i knew that my flight had been discovered. It's a boarding-school. They would not let me come home to spend the vacation, but I would not <pb n="7 ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE."/> stay at the school"--this with a defiant toss of the brown curls and the roguish dimples deepening in the rose-pink cheeks--" so I ran away. I'm going home to take them by surprise. I can imagine the terrible anger and consternation on theprincipal's face as those lights flashed from window to window. I knew she was searching for me, and I safely whirling away beyond her reach, so I couldn't help laughing, it was so very funny," she added, apologetically. And, as though theexplanation quite excused her mirth, without waiting for his reply she turned resolutely toward the window and stared for an hour or more in utter silence.</p><p>This, evidently, did not quite suit the young gentleman beside her.</p><p>"What a pity it is that I'm going only as far as Allendale," he said to himself, regretfully. "If she were not going much further, I might see her safely to the end of her journey--she would never know." And again the thought occurred to him that she was decidedly too young and pretty, and by far too innocent, to be traveling at night alone.</p><p>"Are you going much further?" he asked, at length.</p><p>The young girl started and turned around.</p><p>"I'm going to Allendale," she said.</p><p>He could scarcely repress a start of pleased surprise.</p><p>"Allendale!" he repeated; "why, that is just where I am going. I have not been there for a year or more." He longed , to make certain inquiries, but prudence restrained him. "She would not know them," he argued with himself. Yet he asked, abruptly, "In what part of the village do you reside, may I ask--in the valley, or on the hill? I used to live there, but I do not remember having met you there.</p><p>Her answer literally took his breath away.</p><p>"My home is at Strathmore Hall, on the hill," she answered, " and the reason that you have not seen me is, 1 suppose, because 1 have not lived there for many months." He was listening with an intensely interested face, and she went on, heedlessly: "Major Strathmore, the master of Strathmore Hall, has been my guardian ever since I can remember. He sent me to school at Dunwold, and I have passed all my vacations with my aunt, who lives near Dunwold. Last year she died, so I had nowhere else to go when vacation came, unless I went to Strathmore Hall. My guardian wrote me I was to remain at the school this vacation, but I would not do it. I wanted to come home and see the fire-works on the Fourth. The housekeeper says they are glorious," she continued, enthusiastically. "They are on a grand scale for two reasons--<pb n="8 ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE."/>one is to celebrate the fourth, of course, and the other is because it is the birthday of the majo'r son, poor Harry Strathmore."</p><p>"Why do you say 'poor Harry Strathmore'?" asked the young man, flushing hotly, then turning a shade plaer.</p></p>"If you live in Allendale you ought to know why," returned the girl. Then with a glance of curiosity she asked: "Do you know Mr. Harry Strathmore, sir?"</p><p>"Better, perhaps, than any one else," he answered, with a touch of bitterness in his voice. " Yet why do you speak of him as poor Harry Strathmore'?" he demanded , somewhat haughtily, his fine, keen blue eyes flashing.</p><p>"Because I feel very sorry for him," returned the girl, slowly. "I cried when they told me the story how his father sent for him the evening after he returned home from college, how the major stormed and raged at something he had done, and, vowing he should never forgive him, turned him out of the house."</P><p>"Do you know --did you learn what the quarrel was about? Did Major Strathore ever say anything to you about it?" asked the young man, with intense interest.</p><p>She shook her head. "He will not speak about his son," she said. "His cousin, Miss Voilet Kensington, has been at the Hall a long time, trying to win the major's fprgiveness for his son, but his heart is like marble; he harshly forbade her to mention the name 'Harry Strathmore' in his house under pain of banishment."</p><p>The young man sighed heavily, then his fine blue eyes lighted up again with a sudden thought.</p><p>"Major Strathmore's heart can not be altogether hardened against his son. You say he still continues ti celebrate his birthday?"</p><p>The young girl laughed. "As Mr. Harry is on the fourth of July, the old gentleman declares that is the national celebration he is honoring, and that not a rocket should go up or a salute  be fired in honor of the son who dared defy him, There is a terrible secret and a dark mystery connected with poor Mr. Harry."</p><p>Again the young man's face plaed, and the hope died out of his blue eyes; for a moment he was silent, then heturned his fair, handsome face toward her.</p><p>"I hope you will not think me impertinent if I inquire your name," hbe said, with a winning smile; "and, as this pooor Mr. Harry's friend, to thank you for speaking so kindly of such a scapegrace and thinking and thinking so well."</p><pb n="9 ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE."/>" If you are his friend why do you call him a scapegrace  -Xbehind his back?" demanded the girl. Her brown eyes flashedresentfully, and she looked him straight in the face."Oh, did I?" he answered with a confused laugh. "Ireally was not aware of it; pray forgive the expression."She was slightly mollified." You have not told me your name," he said, hurriedly, aathe train slackened and stopped suddenly at the Allendalodepot, and he gathered up her books for her."My name is Theora Chester, but every one calls me Theo-only that, because I like it best."                       -"Thank you," he said; but Theo noticed, with a thrill ofdisappointment, that this young man, quite the handsomestshe had ever seen in the short sixteen years of her girlhood,seemed to have no inclination to give his own in return.Theo's pride was piqued. So, when he held out his white hand to assist her to alight -from the car, she busied her two little hands in the draperies of her dress, affecting not to see his offer of assistance, and, sprung down the steps lightly without his aid.The young man smiled at this dash of spirit; he knew quite  - well what prompted it.         *He was five-and-twenty, and at that age nowadays youngmen are worldly wise, or, at least, we gather the impression  :that they are.                     :" Shall I see you as far as the park gate?" he asked.  -  ::" No, sir," replied Theo, with dignity; " I am much obligedto you, but 1 can do very nicely without you."   :       V:He raised his hat with a bow, which Theo admitted to hergirlish heart- was perfectly princely. Yet, without deigning  Ihim another glance, Theo wheeled around and walked proudly-along the path that led down the valley and over the hills toStrathmore Hall.: There was no moon, not even the friendly light of the stars -  --i---to guide her, and Theo's heart quaked with a strange, unde-  ,finable fear for a moment, and she really did wish that shehad said " yes " to the handsome young stranger who had  :asked so courteously " to see her safe to the park gate," : although the stern warning of the principal so oft repeated  -still rang in her ears, " Never let me hear of any of the young: : :ladies of this school making or cultivating chance acquaint-ances; remember, new acquaintances should be made only   ":-through the formula of an introduction of some commonu friend.'     -                                             i<pb n="10"/>_ ai.4  ei wrouldhv  e knowndi   that 0e1ttt      i tg ^ eo str-tger'at frst ittidwig of loin a irl' heart, thei   foe i ei-ther ar blesing ore a Ursnd  yotng stranger watched the slim giria O Mil  s wl tj  lloW af a safe distance and  e tt befall her,"pheeljtod rhimself, pntting the thoughtq ciitk  i"- Major  rathmore's ward"P' he maud.ef le?

He had been MajorStrathmore's secretary up to a month or so previous. He hadbeen discharged, and had left vowing bitter vengeance uponall connected with the house of Strathmore. He recognizedTheo quite as readily as she had him, and sprung quickly for- ward. " Why, 1 declare, it's Theo!" he cried, grasping one of herwhite hands. " This is a most fortunate adventure for me,by Jove! Little Thee, and grown a thousand times prettierthan ever!" "Let go my hand!" cried Thee, angrily. " How dare youeven presume to speak to me, Frank Hawthorne?"" By the right of old acquaintance," he replied, with a reck-less laugh; "besides, you're just the one I wanted to see,Theo. ""Let go my hand, or 1 shall call for help!" cried Theo. " Rest assured, Major Strathmore shall hear of this and pun-ish you for it as you deserve!"  'He laughed derisively."You wouldn't put on so many high and mighty airs if youknew what I know, my proud young lady. You had bettermake friends with me, for I always had quite a fancy for yourpretty face, little Thee."The strong hand clasped hers more firmly. The black subtle eyes were gleaming down into her own terrified ones, and thedark face was bending down nearer her own.It was then that Thee uttered the quick sharp cry thestranger had heard as he stood under the trees, as she attempt-ed to wrench her hand free from the detaining clasp of the ex- secretary."You contemptible coward!" she heard a voice cry; andthe next instant, her enemy was stretched upon the bridge."You scoundrel, to terrify and insult a young lady! Upon myword, I have half a mind to throw you over into the rapids. "And looking up, Theo saw the indignant face of the hand-some young man whom she had first met on the train...Again he raised his hat and bowed to her, and Theo never<pb n="12"/>On~~~~~~~ae laa& -1g *MW~ thallmeetArf i-cht.wMIAh--- arm adbled s hot from theom i *tht  uadin msythlr~k JSca ou ar rado me?"t she sked.o~k&ttugr~iyote sto~ne minionm wrIth whi-n.fl y itc ~',*she akred, wraey. tthe axnbarrasrsTdsie wpt; overhis haudnrda.lut-TtE4lot~~mSOto 4&o,3he answkered, "sui ee~ ltptt.&i ith piqueand ' reueatm *O ~~ """:th~len,"she said horing out ~b  touly overit for a iohtent,  t  turned<TiireofJ~dfbe Mr~d~ge; wrhile~-ne·; ··.migte tap rh h  Ia del  he ede~f teoeveing sa die kew thi~aat4issmbled ~in, the dnawiug-rmemn. and su ea e buri~s-ia anrionthem likes veirdhbi ww holInto his head twnedi flda· hewn~~:Zaimgrtoii~hiS a~, ~tqtbipm. rrrnug~ hera mo.U .<pb n="13"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.            13the hair that waved low upon her white forehead, were blackas a raven's plume.Her mother, Mrs. Kensington, sat near her, idly turningover the leaves of a late number of the " New York FashionBazar," scanning the handsome pages, intent upon finding astylish pattern to make up Violet's new wine-colored silk walk-ing suit.Theo burst in among the trio like a veritable whirlwind,and in an instant the major found two soft white arms cling-ing to his neck, and a gay, laughing young voice was cryingout:" There wasn't the least bit of use in your writing that hor-rible letter that I wasn't to come home this vacation, guardy; mI wouldn't stay at school-1 ran away, and here I am; aren'tyou glad to see me, really now?"But before the flustered, surprised major could find hisvoice to reply, Theo had darted off to greet Violet, and toplant the shadowy excuse of a kiss upon Mrs. Kensington   'angry, ruffled brow, much to that lady's annoyance."Theo," began Mrs. Kensington, sharply, "how daredyou disobey the major's express orders that you were to passthe summer vacation at your boarding-school? I am amazed-shocked! Of course the major will send you back at once!"That was a very unwise speech-she saw it the moment after :it was uttered. If there was one predominating peculiarity in Major Strathmore's character, it was his anger at being dictat-ed to. No one had a right to presume thus far; it was quite his own business as to what he intended to do.It had been the major's intention to pack Theo straightback to school again, bag and'baggage, bright and early the  :tnext morning, but he changed his mind instantly. "Pray be kind enough to leave the management of my     iaffairs to me, Mrs. Kensington," he said, haughtily.  " Theo :shall remain at Strathmore Hall and share the pleasures ofthe coming season with your daughter Violet."Theo looked delighted. Violet looked blankly and helpless-, ly at her mother. Mrs. Kensington's brow grew black and.stormy, but she had the grace to wreathe her mouth in smiles."My dear brother-in-law," she said, sweetly, "your de-cision is always the wisest and best; but it rather changes our: plans, you know. We had arranged to take Violet to LongBranch."                                              '   ;" What has that got to do with Theo?" demanded the major.

"1 fear I havestartled you; if so I beg ten thousand pardons.""You have not startled me," said Theo, blushing rosierthan ever. " I-I-was just thinking about you, wonderingif you would come to the Hall so that I could present you toMajor Strathmore, that he might thank you for rendering mesuch timely assistance the other evening on the bridge."" One needs no thanks whatever for doing one's duty," heanswered, carelessly. " Please do not consider yourself underthe slightest obligation to me, Miss Theo."A swift look of annoyance crossed the brightness of Theo'sface for an instant." He wants to be coaxed to come to the Hall, but I shall notdo it," she thought, with resentful defiance; " he ought to beglad that he has such an excellent reason for presenting him-self at Strathmore Hall."They spent an hour loitering beside the brook. To Theo itwas the brightest and sweetest of her young life.If Theo had but noticed it she would have seen that hercompanion was interested only when she spoke of StrathmoreHall or its master.He listened with wistful eagerness to every detail of themajor's illness, and the departure of Violet Kensington andher mother for the sea-shore. But here Theo made a strangemistake, inadvertently mentioning Coney Island as the placeto which they had gone instead of Long Branch.After that eventful morning it was no unusual thing forTheo to meet the handsome, fair-haired hero of the bridge ad-venture as she rambled through the woods that skirted thequaint, pretty village. It was always by accident, never byappointment.Let it be thoroughly understood, dear reader, that our herowas far too honorable to think for a single moment of winning'the admiration or liking of the innocent, dreaming child whoseacquaintance fate had decreed that he should make in soromantic a manner.When they met but a few words of greeting were exchanged;he would make earnest, wistful inquiries after the health ofMajor Strathmore, then walk away, leaving Theo to her ownreflections, which were always romantic day-dreams in whicha fair, handsome face and a pair of blue eyes held a prominent part.Once he chanced to mention that he intended to stay ia,,                      *.     .~~~~:-<pb n="16"/>4ak day wha3#Te~o  &dwn'j bight, cblear, and goldastsinA alwere ciosed, all Mvtud to t   pne Thie illage idkee n manse on the green lawn--'*tl W~ it gayflaunndirbbU*iilaready when the durtat-g   teed t  Wthfre- works which the naturoeth.  t     f~~~·WOPB~bd  h nmmiw d!awafunised,, and which were to be e.~~tbh iaz o h TownP~  Hall6dy teaWas. young girl gazing out upsapi  - eaLr-swoflen eyes and a very rebel-~~~t~e:   rr~erbae alresdy imainbr it~ff  ogn t h thSJw: Early in the atermoamher rettest hit e musin dnreu, sad with.tro in the :bodice of 1her drem a$ bwh pushed sk from her dark oulL she W" fl.d Is~rebroad  corridor,   the"   ofMaora o~  udel opened and ab.. was mfiremiu geT   he demanded, in a ler, tm,gaatdy," he answrd, awed I~".oftt Of thk~i   houl" Itbnautsd thetim dawknjt, to __m 9!t " Every mimn amid# '. a. w i;" -he  veag   on  f'alnm4Ofwbiftardaxmio~a  F~uhijk w~s  h s hesrteba 'lad edf )r me. for twebor--.me tbemu WC bm NORyourlhe r,"budosr ndeaORya qnrokbe~h'  "-  9two ""Wood    rr <pb n="17"/>3    ~      ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             17word and retraced her steps, while the major re-entered hisroom, closing the door after him with a decided bang.For hours Theo sat at her window peering out from behindthe closed blinds."Because he could not enjoy himself why should he pre-vent me from enjoying myself as 1 like?" she thought, ruefully.As the darkness drew on apace, a mischievous idea enteredthe little dark curly head lying so disconsolately on the win-dow-sill.Why oouldn't she slip out for a few minutes and view thefire-works?-the major would never know of it until she wentto him on the morrow, and, with her white arms round hisneck, confessed her willful disobedience, begging him to par-don her under promise that she would never again so offendhim.Could he find it in his heart to be very angry and refuseher? Theo thought not.Besides, there was another very important reason urging herdecision, and that was perhaps she would see the fair-haired stranger there. He had said he intended to stay to witness the celebration of the Fourth from the Town Hall; he wasgoing away the next morning, and she might never see himagain.The last reason decided beautiful, capricious Theo; and,feeling sure of being able to win the major's forgiveness, shecaught up her hat again, and, smoothing her disordered curls, tying them back with a bit of crimson ribbon, Theo stole noiselessly from the house.A tall figure, walking nervously up and down among the dense shadow of the beech-trees, gave a start of surprise as thewhite figure flashed past him in the moonlight.           ;It was Major Strathmore, and he recognized Theo at once.His dark, anger-distorted face was a study.             -"So she has a will of her own and defies me, too, it seems," he muttered. Then a strange gleam came into his eyes. Pulling his hat down low over his face, he turned andwalked in the direction Theo had taken.Theo, in her fancied security, had made straight for the Town Hall, and, quite unluckily, the young man who had charge of the fire-works espied her, and, recognizing her asMajor Strathmore's ward, insisted upon her accepting a seat upon one of the flag-draped balconies, where she could have an unobstructed view.On the opposite veranda sat ten pretty, white-robed young :7gils, who were to begin the celebration of the evening, jus -                 - ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .L,-<pb n="18"/>glay tk t1he proffered met of rmid w.:: the an in all directions,       rowing aglare -upon the throngs gathered with uptrndth      l~l., in eager, excited expeotancy,sailight-irickering shadwe the bcgrod      bel   .dtthertain light, amid the vast throng, Theo mu}s -waslooking for.

With a mighty cryof horror he raised his eyes to the girlish figure standing outin bold relief against the background of fire flame.Her lovely white arms were stretched out in an agony ofsupplication to the throng of upturned faces. Terror anddespair were written upon every feature of the beautiful child-ish face turned toward them. They saw her lips move, andthey knew it was a prayer for help, although the fierce crack-ling of the flames drowned her piteous voice.Major Strathmore would have sprung forward to save her,but strong arms held him back. To venture there was mad-ness.All this had occupied scarcely a moment, and, as is so oftenthe case in great emergencies, the crowd stood by petrified withterror, unable to move or act.Major Strathmore's voice rang out like a bugle-blast over thegreat hush, broken only by the hoarse, fierce crackling of thefire-fiend:"Five thousand dollars to the man who saves that girl! 1am a rich man; I will double it-ay, quadruple it! He shallhave half my fortune and my blessing!'Before the major's clarion voice had uttered the first word,the stranger leaning against the tree had taken in the terriblesituation, and, tearing off his coat, sprung to the rescue of thebeautiful girl.In a flash he had scaled the net-work of clinging trellis-work, that swayed to and fro beneath his weight. Higher andhigher he climbed while the throng watched him from below,with hushed breath and white, upturned faces. Steadily heclimbed the dizzy height; his fair, handsome head was on a level with the balcony now."Oh, God! would he gain it or miss it?" was the wild in-quiry that rose from every heart.Mothers knelt down and prayed for the daring stranger;strong men wept as they had never wept in their lives before.One white hand had grasped the balcony now; and as poor,hapless Theo realized that succor was at hand, she took one step forward, falling fainting at the feet of the man who hadperiled his life to save her.In a moment'he had sprung over the rails of the charred,burning balcony, and clasped the form of the fainting girl inhis arms. But the crowd below dared not a cheer, or scarcelyy                                    ,~~~~~~~y p~sL<pb n="20"/><pb n="21"/>ALL FOR LOVE Of A FAIR PACE.           [21in his own suite of apartments at Strathmore Hall, bless hisdear heart!" added the housekeeper.To Theo the story seemed more wonderful and more beauti-ful than the pages of a romance."You see, dear," continued the housekeeper, wiping thedimness from her glasses, "the old adage that 'truth isstranger than fiction ' is perfectly true.""You must thank Mr. Harry for me for saving my life,"faltered Theo, burying her face in the pillow." He knows you're very grateful; he don't like much fussover anything. Besides, I don't like to disturb him now; heis asleep; he has been sitting up all night with his father. Theexcitement of the fire was too much for Major Strathmore; hetook straight to his bed when he came home, and the doctorlooked pretty serious when I asked him how his patient was."Theo sprung from her couch with a little distressed cry, andwould have flown to the major's room at once, but the house-keeper put a detaining hand on her arm." You must not go until you are sent for, Theo," she said;"the major would not like it; and besides, in his wakinghours he wants to talk alone and uninterrupted to Mr. Harry '-it's only natural, you know."For a week Theo and Harry Strathmore met constantly.Theo lived in the sunlight of his kind, handsome face. Andwhen she saw a small, irregular scar upon his hand, and thehousekeeper told her it was a scar he had received at the fire, in very pity Theo could have knelt and kissed that hand, andthe fair curling hair, too, which was slightly burned over thetemples on his broad forehead.iWhen a young man reaches the standard of a hero in a romantic, impulsive young girl's thoughts, it is very easy tojudge what the sequel will be.It was so with Theo. In a beautiful, childish, thoughtlessfashion her young heart had gone out to her hero, handsome ' Harry Strathmore.That week was brought to a close by a startling event whichchanged the currents of three lives. It had been a stormy day, and a dark, stormy night settledupon the heels of it.Such a terrible night had not been known among the hillsand vales of Southern Maryland for years.Giant trees swayed to and fro on the hill-side like reeds inthe gale, and the howling winds died away in a low moan in the valley below.The solemn hooting of the owls in the turrets of Strathmon--e~~~~~~~:!i<pb n="22"/><pb n="23"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             23quickly. Remember," she added, warningly, " a betrothalis a solemn thing, child-almost as solemn as a marriage vow.Decide wisely."The young girl had risen to her feet, her beautiful browneyes dilating with a strange expression, her face paling andflushing, her bosom heaving with great mental excitement, herlittle white hands clasped convulsively over her throbbingheart. It had all been so sudden, so unexpected, Theo wasdazed, bewildered, utterly speechless for a moment." Promise to marry him-Harry Strathmore has asked meto promise him that!" she faltered.  " Did he tell you to tellme so?" she asked, trembling so that she could hardly stand." His father spoke for him. Poor Mr. Harry was so flus-tered he could do nothing but keep his pale face hidden inthe bed-clothes," she explained. " You must make up yourmind quickly, Theo," she said, laying her hand on the bowedcurly head. "' The major won't last long, and he wishes towitness the betrothal."" Oh, Mrs. Mills," cried Theo, clinging to her, and sobbinghysterically, " what would you do if you were in my place? Iam so young I have never eveni thought of such a thing asmarrying any one!"" I should look into my heart and follow its dictates," re-sponded the motherly old lady, smoothing back the girl's dis-ordered, tangled curls. " I would never betroth myself to aman I did not love, for a betrothal is quite as solemn in thesight of Heaven as the marriage tie which follows. My advicewould be, never betroth yourself to handsome Harry Strath.,more unless you love him, for marriage without love is thegreatest curse the human heart can know! You are young, Theo, and I am old," she went on. " Life is an open bookto me-to you it is a sealed one, for old age only is ripe withthe pitfalls of experience; and I tell you solemnly the wordsthat will come back to you many a time in the years of yourafter-life. Never marry a man to whom you have not givenall the love of your heart, and unless, my dear child, you arequite sure that he loves you. ""But do you think that Harry Strathmore really loves me?"queried Theo, between her sobs. And in a quick, gaspingvoice she falteringly gave the old housekeeper every detail ofher meeting with handsome Harry, the major's discarded son,together with each and every subsequent event which hadtranspired up to the time he had so bravely periled his life tosave hers.Old Mrs. Mills was silent and thoughtful for a moment.  j<pb n="24"/><pb n="25"/>ALL TOR LOVE OF A PAIR PACE. MAnd in the strange silence that ensued, Major Strathmore'sand his son's eyes met for an instant; then Harry Strathmoreturned abruptly away, and Theo, who was watching her hand-some lover's face, and wondering why he had no word for her,saw his face grow white, hard, and stern." Leave me alone!" cried the major. But to Thee he whis-pered, in a low, gasping voice: "Come back to me within the hour, child. I have a startling confession to make. I couldnot die unless 1 had told you; I could not rest in my grave,my poor Thee, who has been so bitterly wronged, unless youwere righted. You shall be righted!"Alas for the strange complications of cruel fate! The low,faintly articulated words had been unintelligible to Theo'sdazed ears. She quite believed he was murmuring a blessingover the little white hand he held clasped so tightly. She kissed him, and, with tears in her eyes, slowly quitted theroom.At that instant the furious peal of the door-bell resoundedthrough the house, and over the fierce blasts of the storm a  iwoman's voice, young, shrill, and piteous, could be heard in-.  i:quiring for Harry Strathmore." My God!" cried the young heir, turning pale as he heardthat voice, "it is she!"                                   -':CHAPTER V.THEO fled to her own room with swift-winged feet. Sheheard Violet Kensington's voice in the corridor below, andshe knew that Violet and her mother had returned, in re-sponse to the telegram which had been sent them apprising  ;them of the major's dangerous illness.She would not go to Violet now and tell her of the strangeevent which had just transpired; her heart was too full.Once in her own apartment, where she was safe from observa-tion, Thee drew off the betrothal-ring Harry Strathmore hadplaced on her slim, white hand and covered it with passionatekisses, her pretty, dimpled face flushing rosy red.She laughed as she remembered the quaint superstition that "it was an unlucky omen to remove a betrothal-ring until themarriage-day dawned.""Nothing could ever change my heart toward him, unlessit was to love him more and sore-my handsome hero, mynoble lover! And to think that he loves me as well and astruly as I love him is the sweetest assurance my heart canknow," she mused,~~~rrvvr ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    ~         ~   ~   ~  I'<pb n="26"/><pb n="27"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             27She never remembered what excuse she made to leave themajor's bedside, or how she gained her daughter's room.Violet sprung to her mother's side as she saw her standing,white and trembling, on the threshold. She knew at oncesomething had happened." What is the matter, mamma?" she cried. " s the majordead?"There was no love or anxiety in her careless tone-simplycuriosity. Mrs. Kensington shook her head; she was afraid totell her. The girl stood still a moment, her gray eyes dilating,her face blanching." lie hasn't made a will leaving anything to that hatedTheo, that should belong to Harry and me, has he?" sheasked, breathlessly."No-it is worse than that," answered her mother."Is it about Harry?" she asked, searching her mother'% 'face with those strange, burning gray eyes."Yes; I have heard something about him which I dread totell you, Violet. You love him so well the shock might kill you."" Tell me what it is; I can bear anything but suspense. Ishe ill? If so, I will go to him; no one has more right than Ihave.""It is not that," replied her mother; "it is somethingquite different. He is well; but-oh, how shall I tell you thatwhich must wreck your whole life-lay your hopes and yourlove in ruins?"" You frighten me, mamma! It were better to tell me atonce than keep me in suspense," returned Violet, in a low,unsteady voice."Listen, then, my poor child," returned her mother,pityingly. " During the few weeks we have been away, thisgirl, Theora Chester, whom we left at Strathmore Hall a poor,miserable, dependent creature, has stolen your lover, HarryStrathmore, from you, and less than an hour ago they werebetrothed to each other at the major's bedside. It wouldhave been a marriage had the girl, been a year older."A low, bitter, lingering cry fell from Violet's lips-a cryterrible to hear. Then she turned, aRd, with a quick motion,attempted to fly from the room, eluding the hand that wasoutstretched to detain her."Violet!" cried her mother, warningly, " what would youdo? Remember you must do nothing rash; for you and 1,much as it hurts my pride and yours to remind you of it, ariT<pb n="28"/><pb n="29"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             2back among the pillows were closed. He could not bear thegaze of the girl's startled eyes upon his face as he told herwhat he had to say.                                '" Turn down the light, Theo-lower still-and turn yourface away while I whisper to you the terrible secret that hasweighed down my soul so long-the dark confession whichmust be whispered to no ears but yours, as you are most vitallyinterested. Even my son does not know. Are you listeningclosely, Theo? and are you sure we are all alone?" " Yes," whispered the guilty girl; " go on." It was strange that he did not notice it was not Theo's  'voice. But he did not; his faculties were dimmed by theshadow of death.Never dreaming of the terrible deception being practiced upon him, he spoke quickly, laboriously, and Theo s secret,which he would have guarded with his life, stood revealed toher cruelest foe-the one of all others who would show her nomercy. Violet listened as if petrified, and as the last word wasspoken she uttered a piercing, shuddering cry.- --                                   - qsCHAPTER VI.                                   _ EVEN" the cry that fell from Violet Kensington's lips failed  :to betray her identity, yet she could not have repressed it if :her life had paid the forfeit." Forgive me, little Theo," murmured the major.Those were the last words those white lips ever uttered. Hefell back upon the pillow-dead.Quick as thought Violet snatched the key, which was at-tached to a slender cord which he had said she would findaround his neck, and, hiding it in the pocket of her dress, fledprecipitately from the chamber of death. She could not go to the old chest now; she must wait for daylight to search among the debris of the tower.She turned, walking hastily in the direction of the library,without stopping to arouse the house with the startling news.The major had breathed his last-let them discover it whenthey would.The sweetest thought in her revengeful heart was theknowledge that Harry Strathmore did not love Theo, andthat the betrothal was at the major's instigation.She had shrewdly gleaned that much from his words.Theo would have been too artless to have read his wordsaright. Not soViolet,<pb n="30"/><pb n="31"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             31lover. Why, then, had he asked her to marry him insteadof Violet?Her beautiful, love-dream had received a terrible blow. Heridol was shattered. Now she knew why Harry Strathmore hadspoken no word of love to her. He loved Violet-not her;while she, Heaven help her, had given all the worshipful loveof her heart to Violet's lover. Like one in a terrible dream, sheheard every word they uttered, but all power to move or cryout seemed suddenly to have left her."Violet," he was saying, "do not unman me with yourtears. 1 have no right to kiss them away now, for I-  Oh,Violet, my love! do you realize what has happened? A terri- ble gulf lies between us now. I, who up to one short hourago never gave one thought to any one but you, am now thebetrothed husband of another."" Why did you do it, Harry?" sobbed the girl.  " Surelyno one could have forced you to utter words you were so farfrom feeling."" I can not tell you why I did it," he answered. "Youwould not understand, even if I were not bound by a solemnpledge never to reveal why. I feel sorry for myself-moresorry for poor Theo," he went on, slowly, "for there willsnever be any pretense of affection between us. 1 can neverlove her."Violet Kensington knelt sobbingly on the low hassock at hisfeet."Oh, Harry!" she cried, tremulously, raising her strange,mesmeric eyes to the young man's pale face, "should weallow this girl to come between us for a mere whim on yourfather's part-you and I, who love each other so well? Itwere better far such a betrothal should be broken. " .  .Harry Strathmore shook his head despondently." Violet," he said, slowly and hopelessly, " we are pledgedto each other as solemnly as vows can bind us; death alonecould break them. Not that I wish poor little Theo's death,"he added, hastily, " even though she has ruined your life andmine. I tell you the simple truth-while Theo lives you arelost to me, my darling. Do not look at me with that awful despair in your eyes, my Violet. There may come a daywhen I can exlpain this to you. Oh, if you but knew why 1bartered away my love, freedom and happiness-why it waswrung from my lips-you would pity, but never censure me.The sentence died on his lips. A low, quivering cry ofraortal pain rang through the room.

He placed a chair for Theo, but she waved it away witha gesture of superb pride, as a young queen might have done,and stood before him like a statue carved in marble, her facewofully white and the despair of death in her deep dark eyes." Oh, Mr. Strathmore," she broke out with a piteous sob;' you must believe that 1 never thought of-of-marryingyou up to an hour ago, or I should go mad with very shame.Poor guardy never mentioned such a subject to me in all hislife. I thought when you sent Mrs. Mills, the housekeeper,to tell me you wished me to marry you, I thought-oh,Heaven pity me, I thought you-you loved me just as dearlyas I loved you! Yes, I believed that with all my heart."The words she had uttered had fallen upon Harry Strath-more like a thunder-bolt; he was literally speechless; the wordsthat fell so thoughtlessly from her lips in her intense excite-ment were a startling revelation to him:"I thought, oh, Heaven pity me, I thought you loved mejust as dearly as 1 loved you!"He looked up into the beautiful childish face.  Theoloved him; he was fairly dumfounded with surprise; Theo,whom he had considered but a beautiful, willful, capriciouschild, had given her heart to him-she loved him, and he hadnever dreamed of such a possibility, even while he wonderedthat she had consented to such a strange betrothal; but hadconcluded that she had been lured by the wealth he was toinherit.He had never thought of associating love with Theo. Nowonder he was startled at the revelation that in the excite-ment of the moment sprung from her overcharged heart toher quivering lips." Oh, if you had but left me to die among the flames! forit was then that my heart went out to you, and 1 quite believedthat, because you periled your own life to save mine, you mustlove me," she went on, pantingly, still holding up her littlehand to enjoin silence,' her beautiful face pale as the whitebuds that still clung among her dark curls. " If 1 had butknown you were Violet's lover, and that for some unknown,,         X                                           .      ~<pb n="34"/><pb n="35"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             35IHe hates me because 1 came between them and parted them,and I couldn't bear that. I must die and set him free!"And with a quivering, piteous cry that pierced HarryStrathmore's heart like an arrow as it floated back to him,poor little Theo flung herself from the rock on which shestood down, down into the seething abyss below.The next instant Harry Strathmore had reached the spot.To follow would have been madness.   A fall upon thesharp, jagged rocks over which the maddening waters rushedand foamed meant instant death.For a moment he stood there as if turned to stone, and looked down into the mad waters, sparkling and curlingunder the pale light of the moon-the waters that had but amoment before closed over that beautiful, dark head andwhite, childish, despairing face.Horror had almost robbed him of his voice, deprived him of his strength. With an awful cry he staggered back from therock and rushed toward the Hall, crying loudly for help andlights.Poor little Theo, the lovely little creature to whom he hadplighted his troth scarcely an hour before, lying dead--drowned in the dark waters, and for his sake!She had believed that he hated her, and she found deatheasier to bear than that. Oh, the shame and horror of it!Poor, pretty Theo had not laid a trap to entangle him intoan engagement, as he had so stormily accused her in his ownheart of doing as he parted from her an hour since in the sick-room. He knew it now, for no scheming girl who coveted hisgold would have taken her own young life rather than endurehis scorn and pitiless contempt, and that, too, when successhad been hers.Poor little Theo! He had driven her to a suicide's doom, andthe child loved him with all her heart."Help! Lights!" he cried, hoarsely, wildly rushing upthe broad marble porch two steps at a time.To the servants, who rushed out in answer to their youngmaster's wild cries, he told in a few gasping words what had.happened.There would be no question of saving her now, they toldhim. Her death must have been instantaneous. They couldonly get the drags out and search for the body. This wasquickly done.It was a perilous task guiding a life-boat over those madpddying waters, but steady hands bent to the oars.1igid and still and ghastly white, Harry Strathmore sat in _<pb n="36"/><pb n="37"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.              37self, 'The obstacle in Harry's path is removed! How glad hewill be!'"Harry Strathmore started to his feet, white with horror.Could it be that he had heard aright?  Great Heaven! could the lips he had kissed with love's alluring rapture utter such words as these? Was her heart marble, that she could speakof poor little Theo's untimely death like this?Violet," he cried, sternly, " do you realize that you arespeaking of little Theo's death as though you were glad?" " And so I am glad," asserted Violet; " are not you?" "Heaven forbid!" cried Harry Strathmore, shuddering. " Oh, would that I could put life into that still heart again, Iand brightness into those dim dark eyes! I would suffer a life-time of pain to do it."                                 ^Violet Kensington wreathed her white arms round his neck,tossing back the damp, fair clustering hair from his burning brow with her cool white hands." You have forgotten that, if she had lived, she would havecome between you and me and happiness," she murmured, inher low, sweet, cooing voice that had always sounded like the sweetest music to Harry Strathmore's ears. Now it sounded strangely discordant, and the vague wonder flitted across his  'mind. whether indeed it would be happiness with Violet, after all. The chances were that, if Violet had remained silent      'then, the whole course of her after-life would have been differ- ; ent.  A slight incident-a word, a look, or even a gesture have been known to change the mightiest love into abhorrence.  -Love comes to the heart swiftly, and it may take wing just asswiftly, and is often but a fickle, transient guest. But, feel-ing so sure of Harry Strathmore's love and blind adoration, Violet went on, hurriedly:" Yes, I am glad she has made away with herself. How wewould have hated her, if she had lived to spoil our lives! She  ;was a designing, artful little minx. No wonder she drowned   -herself when she found out that we knew-" "Violet, remember you are speaking of the dead!" ex-claimed Harry Strathmore, sternly. "Do not say anotherdisparaging word of poor Theo, if you would retain the respect  iin which 1 have always held you."                             : Violet took a step backward, and looked at his pale, angryface." One would almost imagine that you were as much in love with the pretty little beggar as she was with you and yourglittering gold, and that you had just discovered that the   -,~~                                ~   ~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ '-'-d _.<pb n="38"/><pb n="39"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FPA       FACE.        39clouds of night as a little boat shot rapidly through the darkwaters, making for a group of heavy willows that skirted adense tract of uninhabitable land known as the Marshes. Itsoccupant, Frank Hawthorne, the ex-secretary, hastily securedthe skiff, and, raising a small, unconscious figure that lay inthe bottom of the boat, strode rapidly through the reeds andbrambles toward a small frame house that was almost hiddenfrom view by the luxurious wild creepers that covered it.There was no sign of life about the dilapidated structure, butnotwithstanding this, Frank Hawthorne gave a low, peculiarwhistle and an impatient, imperative knock at the door. A moment later, and there was a sound of shuffling feetfrom within, the door was opened ever so slightly, and a tall,angular woman peered out." Oh, it's you, is it, Frank Hawthorne?" she exclaimed, insurprise, and with a touch of anger in her voice. " What inthe world brings you to the Marshes, and at this time o' themorning? It's three years since you set foot here before. Youdidn't know or care whether your old aunt was alive or dead."She stopped short. He had pushed past her with an angryexclamation of annoyance and a muttered imprecation, andshe saw, with amazement, he held in his arms the inanimateform of a beautiful young girl. No bonnet covered the littlehead, but in the meshes of her hair white buds were clinging;and the strangest and most mysterious part of the whole affairwas, her dress and long curling hair were dripping with riverwater, that trickled from her garments to the floor in tinypools. " Never mind talking now," said Frank Hawthorne, strid-ing into an inner room with his unconscious burden. " Letus see if this girl is alive or dead; I rescued her from drown-ing.  You women understand such things, Aunt Dorcas.Why don't you set about trying to revive her?" he asked, im-  -patiently." 'll set about it as soon as I can get you out of the room,"grumbled Dorcas Lane.   " I don't suppose she would appre- ciate the situation if she opened her eyes and found you star-ing at her."He turned on his heel and quitted the room. For an houror more he paced the outer room excitedly."I can bear the suspense no longer," he told himself. " IfTheora Chester lives, my fortune is made; if she dies-"The sudden opening of the door of the inner room inter-rupted his meditations.

While 1 was standing there gazing about me in      =utter bewilderment, my eyes fell upon the major's safe; he   . -always kept it securely fastened, and the key attached to someother one hung by a silken cord about his neck.

'N It can not be done; there's not one of them 1 would dare bindto secrecy as to who the patient was whom he should findhere."" Without a doctor she will die," predicted Dorcas Lane."As to revealing her identity, pshaw! can't you say she's yoursister or something of that sort?  You're not obliged to go toAllendale where the girl is known; there's a little village upthe river; go there for a physician. "Frank Hawthorne grasped eagerly at the suggestion, andthe frown cleared from his face.After all, there couldn't be much danger in such a courseas that; Dorcas would remain constantly at the bedside, givingTheo no chance of exchanging a word with the doctor.He waited for the shades of night to gather, then put hisplan into execution at once.The little village of Rosecliff boasted of but two physicians.One was away; Frank Hawthorne was obliged to make use ofthe other. He would have been better pleased if he had notbeen young and handsome.Frank Hawthorne regretted too that he had not said it washis wife who needed his assistance, instead of his sister.Silently the young. doctor followed his companion into theskiff which lay in waiting, and they pushed out into deepwater and down the stream, Frank Hawthorne steadily plyingthe oar for half a dozen miles or so. Dr. Melville watched the dark, shadowy banks on either sideas they swept quickly past them, with a strange sensation inhis heart. Where was this dark-browed stranger taking him?Why was he so silent?He was no coward, this fair-haired, handsome young doctor,but as the boat swept along he could not help but rememberthat there were perhaps more thrilling events in the lives ofdoctors than any other class of men in the world-eventsthat might have been romantic if they had not ended in crueltragedies.He remembered the story of the " Mad Philosopher," thatold tale handed down to us from the German-the philoso-pher who for years made way with doctors in so mysterious<pb n="44"/><pb n="45"/>ALt Pot LOtV   Os A PAtIt fAOP.          48Frank Hawthorne was a blind fool to bring a handsome youngman like this to doctor the girl; " ten to one he will fall in lovewith her pretty face, and then we shall have a deal of troublewith the pair of 'em."Her words, however, had aroused the young doctor's'thoughts from the chaos into which they had been wandering .:lin delicious reverie, recalling him to a sense of duty. An hour later, under his skillful treatment, Theo opened  .her eyes for the first time to consciousness and, as it hap- pened, Dorcas had left her position at the bedside for one lbrief moment in quest of a spoon. The bright brown eyes flashed wide open, gazing with as-tonishment into the blue eyes of the young doctor who bent  'anxiously over her." Who in the world are you? and what are you doing here?"gasped Theo, starting up in affright, then falling back upon her pillow through sheer weakness, but still gazing at himwith those great, velvety, wide-open eyes."I am your doctor," he answered, with a quiet smile."You have been very ill. I shall try to get you well verysoon providing you keep perfectly quiet." " Ill!" repeated Theo, in wonder. " How did it happen?"then like a flash memory returned to her. She reached outher hand and clung to him with a piercing, piteous cry ofanguish. "Oh, I remember!" she cried, wildly, incoherent- .  ;ly. " I struck the dark water and it closed over my head.  ,Did you save me?"" No, but some one else did," he replied, thinking it best · .to humor this strange vagary. " Why did they do it?" sobbed Theo. " Oh, I wanted todie. The world is so hard and bitter. Nobody loves me;      ievery one wishes that 1 would die, then I would be out oftheir way."" Not every one," said the young doctor.How he longed to take one of those little white hands in hisfirm, strong ones, and tell her if she died the bright worldwould never be the same to him again;' but he only said, veryquietly: "It is very wrong for you to wish for death; it comes tothe most of us altogether too soon. ""It couldn't come too soon for me," robbed Theo. "Nogirl in the world was ever so wretchedly unhappy as I am!""Why are you unhappy?" he asked, wistfully, more witha yearning to do something or say something to comfort herthan from idle curiosity  '"<pb n="46"/>tr<pb n="47"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A PAIR PACE.            47permit me to say I will come without extra charge untilshe has fully recovered." "It appears to me you take a great interest in the girl,"'said Dorcas Lane, her eyes flashing fire that alone should havewarned him."I do," admitted young Dr. Melville, blushing like a school-boy."Then you sha'n't come again!" cried Dorcas Lane, ana fthe door was closed in his face with a loud bang.I will come again! I will go through fire and water tolook upon that lovely, girlish face again!" the young doctorthought to himself. "She shall not prevent me from seeing her-I am determined!"CHAPTER X.AT Strathmore Hall strange events were transpiring. Asudden coolness had sprung up in Harry Strathmore's hearttoward Violet Kensington. It had come about in this way:Since the night of the major's death, when she so boldly de- -clared her hatred for poor, hapless Theo, he had seen Violet's disposition in a new light; and the event which happened aweek subsequent turned the remnant of respect he had forher into the deepest loathing and disgust.He had been walking in the garden late one moonlightnight, when the sound of low, familiar voices fell upon his ear,and, glancing around, he saw, to his astonishment, VioletKensington and Frank Hawthorne, his father's ex-secretary,walking up the gravel walk together.  In his right hand Frank carried a small ebony box. Harry Strathmore was too much amazed to utter a word toacquaint them of his near presence, even if the words that fell from Violet's lips had not held him spell-bound." You ask me if I am glad Theora Chester is dead," she was saying, "and I answer yes. If she had lived to comebetween me and my dearest plans, I would have been temptedto kill her with my own hands! There is nothing underheaven that makes a woman so desperate as to be thwarted inlove. Do you think I could have borne to see Theora Chesterthe mistress of Strathmore Hall, the most magnificent placein the county, courted, admired, sought after, while I wasturned adrift on the world with the paltry ten thousand dol-lars the major-the mean old thing!-left me in his will? No,no; the girl should never have lived to triumph over me likethat-neverl"<pb n="48"/><pb n="49"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.              49      I" Down beside the flowing river,  ?Where the dark-green willows weep, Where the tender branches quiver,There a gentle maiden sleeps.In the morn a lonely strangerComes and lingers many hours,Reader, he's no heartless ranger,For he strews her grave with flowers."To Violet Kensington this strange revulsion of feeling on the part of her lover was maddening. In vain she tried to fwoo him back to his allegiance, but the spell was broken. Heshrunk from her, and avoided her whenever it was possible.Yet, Violet Kensington would not be discouraged." The course of true love never does run smooth, mamma,"she would say, in answer to her mother's earnest inquiries as to the existing state of affairs.                'Even to herself she would not admit the alarming truth   ;that Harry Strathmore's heart had grown cold toward her.One golden afternoon matters came to a crisis.  HarryStrathmore had suddenly given out his attention of leaving  ':,Strathmore Hall for the present and traveling abroad.-Violet Kensington heard the report with pale cheek and; bated breath. She would go to Harry and ask him at once ifthe report were true. She wrote him a little pink-tinted perfumed note, request-ing him to see her in the drawing-room    an hour after luncheon. "I have heard that you are going away, Harry," she wrote,"but I will not believe it. My doubting, aching heart mustbe set at rest by a denial from your lips."  She signed the note, "Your loving Violet."Harry Strathmore put the letter into his pocket with a sigh. : There was a time when these pink-tinted notes in the samedelicate chirography had set his heart beating strangely, butnow only annoyance gleamed in his blue eyes. He had half an hour yet to the time appointed by Violet in her note, and he spent it out-of-doors with his lawyer, who had run down to Strathmore Hall to find out the young heir'swishes concerning the estate while he remained abroad.He was an old friend of the major, and stood on terms ofthe greatest intimacy with the son."I have pleasing news concerning you, Mr. Strathmore,"   :he said, as they walked down the broad path toward the arched gate together. " I wonder if I may congratulate you?""What is it?  I do not know of anything oQncerning mT 01t that calls for congratulations."<pb n="50"/><pb n="51"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.              S1had existed between them, were it ever so slight, he wouldhave fulfilled his part of the contract to the very letter; butas nothing of the kind existed, she was free as air, so was he.The words died away on his lips as he saw the marble pallorof Violet Kensington's face; her eyes glowed like purple fires,"I am a victim to the fickleness of a man's love," she   ,fs cried. "You did love me once, and you would have been    -'-  mine but for the girl who came between us, Harry Strath- ^ ?"more," she went on, " and I hate her for it-hate her even in her grave; for I believe in one mad moment, as she stood be- fore you pleading her cause that night, your love turned fromime to her. Is it not so?" she panted.He was too honorable to deny the truth, and he bowed hishead in assent."1 knew it," she cried, with a hard, bitter sob. " But itis not too late, now that she is dead, to-to-care for meagain. "He could not help feeling touched with pity and distress forthe humiliation it must have cost this proud girl to speak suchwords as these." If you ever marry, I could curse the woman who wins yourlove!" she cried out.  " She shall suffer for it, for my venge- ance shall fall upon her head, just as surely as yonder sun shines.""Calm yourself, Violet," he answered, gently, taking herburning hands in his. "I shall never marry-never.  I wasplighted to Theo living, and, now that we have been parted bymy own cruel coldness down here, I shall fulfill that pledgeup there."" You will wreck your life and mine for a foolish vagary!"she cried. "Theo is dead. Why can you not forget her?Harry," she cried, with a spasm of pain in her voice, " pauseand think before you give up such a deathless love as mine."  :He shook his head with a sad gesture." 1 am grieved, pained to tell you, Violet," he said, "butthe memory of Theo comes between us."The next day a thrilling event happened.CHAPTER XI.WHEN Dr. Melville had left the house on the marsh, DorcasLane, contrary to his directions, had given Theo a strongsleeping potion; therefore, the noonday sun was shining intothe room before the girl opened her dark, wondering eyes.[o<pb n="52"/><pb n="53"/>AltL FOR LOfVE O  A PAIRt  ACB. face as he raised it to his lips, pressing a kiss upon it, mur- muring how delighted he was to see her looking so well afterher terrible accident and ordeal of brain fever through which she had passed."I must thank you for saving a human life, Mr. Haw-thorne," said Theo; "but all the same I wish you had leftme to my fate."" Why?" he demanded, drawing his chair a trifle nearerher.  "You are young, and-beautiful: life should holdgolden pleasures in store for you-unlimited joy." She shook her brown curly head sadly.Joy! what joy could there be for her, now that the dazzlinggleam of love that had shone upon her heart like a radiantmeteor had set in eternal darkness?Life-all the future years-would be but a sorry pilgrimage to her without Harry Strathmore's love!"There may come a day when you may have wealth andlove, Miss Theo," he went on, eagerly; " then you will rejoicethat I did not leave you to your fate." "I may never have wealth," said Theo; " if I ever should,1 shall reward you for what you have done for me."          IShe stopped abruptly, for the change that came over his facestartled her; the light that flashed into his eyes electrified her,"You have it in your power to reward me now, beautifulTheo!" he cried. Then for a moment a dead silence fell be-tween them. " You have the power to reward me now, beau-tiful Theo," he repeated. " Give me this little hand for my  ::;own-the little hand that I rescued from the cold clasp of  :-death. I love you, little Theo!" he cried. "Pardon me if 1 am brusque and abrupt; have pity on me if my words' andactions do not please you. Love will be my redemption, lovewill make me all that I should be. Oh, Heaven help any ::;man who loves a woman as I love you!"He had caught hold of her little white hand again, and she was too dazed and bewildered to withdraw it from his firmclasp.She was quite stunned by his wild, reckless impetuosity, toomuch surprised to utter one word of interruption or draw her:hand away. Passionate words like these terrified her.All that she knew in her bewilderment was that she wassitting in the willow rocker by the open window, propped upwith pillows, and that Frank Hawthorne, the man whom shehad always disliked so cordially, and yet to whom she owedsuch a debt of gratitude, was kneeling at her feet, clasping herhands, and telling her he loved her. She tried to check hinj<pb n="54"/><pb n="55"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             55harshness and contempt, and 1 swear that I will use mypower over you without mercy. 1 will humble your pride tothe very dust; my love an insult indeed! You shall rue thehour in which those words fell from your lips.""What power do you pretend to have over me?" flashedout Theo, spiritedly. "I am only a young girl, and veryignorant of the ways of the world, I admit, but 1 know thismuch: in the United States of free America, no man can forcea girl to marry him against her will!"" We shall see what we shall see within a week, my scorn-I ful beauty," he answered, picking up his hat and cane."You shall be Mrs. Hawthorne within twenty-four hours,depend upon that. I shall go for some one at once to performthe ceremony." "You are trying to frighten me," she said; " I defy you toput your threat into execution!""1 may as well tell you that it is far from my intention tobring a minister when there are such commodities as justicesof the peace to be had.""But no justice would marry a young girl against her    'will!" cried Theo, proudly, her red lips curling scornfully."A. hungry country justice of the peace is not such a foolas to throw away a tempting bait of one hundred dollars for agirl's foolish whims," he replied; " unlike ministers they are not likely to be troubled with qualms of conscience, and thebeauty of the matter is, they can tie the marriage knot just assecurely, my beautiful Thee. I know of a certain justice whomI helped to count into office when I was one of the canvassers,;and he wouldn't dare to go back on one of his friends; menstand by each other in many an affair unknown to the generalpublic. Au revoir, my charming Theo," he said, standing onthe threshold and raising his straw hat jauntily from his darkcurls with a low bow. " When I return 1 shall hope to hearthat you think more kindly of your husband that soon to be,and have succumbed to the inevitable with smiles insteadof tears.""Never!" cried Theo, fairly trembling with rage; "I tellyou solemnly I shall never marry you. Remember my words,;1 will die first!"CHAPTER XII.THE door closed after Frank lHawthorne with a bang, andTheo sunk back in her willow rocker again, with a whiteoterrified face._.-... <pb n="56"/><pb n="57"/>ALL PFO  LOVE OP A PAIR PACE.             ?     ' :"There will be the very mischief to pay when Frank comes back and finds this state of things," she muttered; "and therecan be no wedding if she's like this."She thought of the startling revelation Frank Hawthornehad made concerning the girl, which he had whispered intoher startled ear after having sworn her to eternal silence; sheremembered his closing words:"Take great care of the girl, Dorcas, watch her as Aladdinwatched his lamp; for she is to you and me what that lampwas to Aladdin. And the day that sees me her wedded hus- band will make you rich for life. If she dies there is an end  $, to our golden dreams, remember that."A strange fate had been playing directly into the schemer'shands.On the night which followed his thrilling revelation toDorcas he had haunted the grounds of Strathmore Park asusual, waiting patiently an opportunity to make his way into the Hall and up into the tower unobserved.As he watched, a woman's figure passed quickly before thewindow in the tower; her face was turned directly toward himin the moonlight and he knew that it was Violet Kensington.  -"What was she doing there?" he asked himself; "could she suspect-" the cold prespiration stood out in beads uponFrank Hawthorne's forehead. If any one should by chance  "-examine and take possession of those papers concerning Theo,=  .which he knew that the iron-bound oak chest contained, thegreat scheme which he had concocted would be laid in ruins.  iHe almost held his breath when a moment later Violet Ken- .sington crossed the moonlit porch, gliding into the grounds ¥: :with the identical black ebony box in her jeweled hands.She went straight to the Heron's Pool, a dark sheet of water  :that skirted the park, and was about to consign the casket into its depths when it was snatched from her hand; and wheeling swiftly around with a low cry, she found herself face ' to face with Frank Hawthorne, the ex-secretary. "What do you mean by such an outrage?" exclaimed          AViolet Kensington, white to the lips, yet with a ring of terror 'in her haughty voice."Because I know its contents," he replied, coolly. " Whyshould you wish to destroy it, Miss Kensington. Let me an-swer for you. You have discovered the import of the papers!"  -he exclaimed; " and you would consign the proofs of TheoraChester's strange secret to these silent waters.""Well!" exclaimed Violet, effecting a cool bravery she was t.-·       6<pb n="58"/><pb n="59"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.            5through their fingers at almost the very hour of success?Dorcas asked herself, her nervousness increasing.  No, itshould not be; she must live. She would increase the strongpotion that had been left by the doctor for such an emergencyas this-yes, she would double it-quadruple it!And, without waiting to secure a glass, she poured half thecontents of the vial the doctor had left, between the girl'swhite lips. The result of the overdose was alarming! There was a violentcontraction of the girl's muscles, the face grew livid, then iturned to the hue of death. There was a short, sharp strug-gle for breath, a violent spasm, then the muscles suddenly re-laxed, and Theora Chester's heart ceased to beat."Oh! good Lord, good Lord! what have I done?" criedthe woman, in mortal terror. "Oh, I have given her toomuch: and instead of bringing her out of her swoon, it haskilled her!"In vain she redoubled her exertions to chafe the cold handsand blue-veined temples. They grew cold, with the clammychill of death beneath her trembling touch.And thus, an hour later, Frank Hawthorne found her, whenhe returned to inform her that he had found a justice whowould be willing to perform the ceremony the following'day,and that in the meantime she must keep a strict watch onTheo's movements.His intense rage knew no limits."Dead!" he exclaimed, bending over the beautiful, inani-mate form, and placing his hand over the pulseless heart." How did it come about, woman? No prevarications, I say-tell me at once, how you have managed to wrest the goldenprize from my grasp by letting it slip through your fingers. Icould curse you for it!" he cried, fiercely, and with a terriblegroan.And in a trembling voice, Dorcas Lane told him truthfullyjust how it had happened-to bring the girl out of her lengthyswoon, he had given her an overdose-it had brought herdeath instead."Fool! most accursed fool!" cried Hawthorne, smiting hisbreast with his clinched hand, in his mad rage-" her deathruins me!"He picked up his straw hat, and strode toward the door;but Dorcas Lane intercepted him."Out of my way, woman,'? he cried; " never let me lookupon your face again!"What shall I do with the girl in yonder, Frank?" she<pb n="60"/><pb n="61"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.              61than mine.

He was herjunior by several years, but love forgets that. He was but apoor, strolling player. She had wealth a duchess might envy.All went smoothly enough with this love match until a fort-night preceding the wedding.As she was awaiting her turn to go on the stage, standingin the heavy shadow of curtains, she heard her lover's voice.He was standing behind one of the shifting scenes talkingwith one of the chorus girls, a bewitchingly pretty maiden,  -$whose great attractions of face and eyes the great actress had often secretly admired.They were standing so near she could have put out herjeweled hand and touched them. "You must not persist in making love to me, monsieur,"the girl was saying.  " You love our star. You are engagedto marry her. Why then do you talk to me as you do?          ;:Madame would not only be very jealous but very angry if she were to hear of it, and I should lose my place."            -: :"Love her!" he groaned.    "Ah, ma chare," he cried,"how can you for a moment believe such a thing possible?Who could love her when they looked into her face-it is sofrightfully plain, quite ugly in fact. If she had your beautynow, with her golden shekels, I might be able to love her;but," with a sigh, " we must take the goods the gods offer,  -even if they are not given on golden plates."The great actress waited to hear no more, but went upon the stage with a firm step. Never in her life did she gothrough her tragic part so sublimely. Women wept aloud,and tears came to the eyes of strong men.Showers of bouquets fell about her sweet as the breath ofAraby. Yet, in the very zenith of her fame, her wondrous: ·P t_<pb n="62"/><pb n="63"/>Att tOR LOtiN   OF A PAIR    ACE.      -   6tViolet overruled his objections, and he could not refusewithout positive rudeness.He offered her his arm and silently they walked out intothe moonlit grounds together.   Ah, surely it was the verynight, the very scene and hour for the witching poetry oflove!Ah, the beautiful world into which they went. The illu-Tnined park, odorous with flowers, and tinkling with themusical murmur of the fountain, lying about them    underthe moon's bright pale rays.                                 iThey stood before the marble Flora in the fountain watch-ing the white arm and delicate hand which scattered the cool-ing spray.The marble Flora was beautiful with its statuesque grace,but the girl standing there with her passionate living beauty,the moonlight falling on her fair face and on the rich folds ofher silver silk robe was more beautiful still.Harry Strathmore could feel thwe white hand trembling onhis arm as Violet bent her dimpled face over the water, sighingfaintly, her white lids drooping over those wondrous eyes.The spell of that witching hour was over her. Softly underher breath she repeated the lines of a poem she had read thatday. Now, it seemed to have a double, thrilling meaning,invested with all the yearning sweetness of her tremulousolice:" ' What have I done, that one face holds me so,And follows me in fancy through the day?Why do I seek your love? I only knowThat fate is resolute, and points the wayTo where you stand, bathed in an amber light;Since first you looked on me I've seen no night.What have I done?' What can be done?

He knew that Violet loved       "him, and that knowledge troubled him.   He knew what was expected of him; he realized why she had brought him out here in the mystical, poetical, odorous moonlight.He knew she was waiting for him to take her in his arms,<pb n="64"/><pb n="65"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.              65   ;       Byoung doctor had remarked, as he settled himself more com-fortably back in the spacious arm-chair, and puffed awayvigorously at a fragrant Havana.  "You would not wonderat it if you knew of the thrilling events which have takenplace within the last fortnight: but as I have promised youthe narrative, here it is, my dear Strathmore; it has all the  -flavor of romance, but 1 assure you upon my honor I canvouch for the truth of every word of it." The experience of almost any physician is ripe with thrill-ing events that would startle the world if they were to findtheir way into public print. But to the story-pardon thedigression, Strathmore:" I was sitting in my office one stormy night, some weekssince, when the door opened, and I was confronted by a tall,dark-faced, nervous young man, who asked if I was DoctorMelville."I bowed in the affirmative, indicating a seat, which he  i-declined." It struck me that I had seen that face somewhere before,but where, I could not tell. You know I have been abroad,for years, and the faces of my countrymen at home are there-fore new and strange to me now." '1 am Doctor Melville, at your service, sir,' I said; ' whatcan I do for you?'"'I wish you to attend a lady at once, sir,' he replied- :'my sister. Kindly prepare to accompany me without delay. '" ' Have you any idea of the nature of her illness?' was mynext query."'A fever of some sort, I should imagine,' he replied,brusquely.  'We make the journey by boat; the place liesdown the river a few miles.'" I followed him into the boat; he picked up the oars, andwith a few strokes of his muscular arms the skiff was quicklyout in midstream, whirling down with the swift current." I must confess, Strathmore, for the first time in my lifeI felt strangely nervous-queer forebodings, and all that sortof thing, such as many a man has felt when he took passageon an ill-fated vessel that was destined never to land." But 1 was plucky, and I determined to see the adventurethrough, despite the nervous sensations that were thrilling myheart." I was sure that the crisis of my life had come, and, as thesequel will show, I was not very far wrong."My strange' forebodings increased when my strangely.;lIt4 AWW9   A--... 4L-bA a1-  -i- A oe r U ha-na nA thn<pb n="66"/>"              7nth Iat skirat;ed the t~l ,innOtinm~ ing we were tosighr"Ater a sharp, -imperative rap by my companion, the door /hort whispered conversation she turned to me, bidding mefollow her into an inner room.A lamp from a bracket on the wall lighted the illy fur-nished room, and by its rays 1 saw my patient. " Great Heaven, Strathmorel how shall I find words to de- 1scribe to you what she was like? I have traveled the world over-1 have seen. the beauties -:of every country-but never in my life had my eyes ever be-held' such a glorious vision of girlish loveliness as my eyes ;rested on in that isolated house on the Maryland marsh.Could you paint still whiter the petals of the lily, gild refined gold-it were easier to do this than describe my beautifulpatient and do that wondrous face full justice." 1 am only a plain doctor, it would take a poet or an artist -to describe her.

" You hold my interest as deeply inthralled as one of the pages of Emile Gaboriau's ' Monsieur Lecoq.' " "Well," continued Walter Melville, " I went home withmy thoughts full of that girl's lovely face.             ;:"I was like a man haunted; I knew very well what was the matter with me-I was violently, hopelessly in love! "And what gave a spice of romance to the affair was thatopen warfare had been declared against me, and the gauntfemale who presided over the isolated house in the marsh hadstoutly declared that I should never see the girl's face again. "This made me all the more determined that I would see her, if I went through fire and water to do so. Opposition, asis usually the case, made me all the more determined, and asI was putting my wits together, to use a common phrase, tofind some means of accomplishing this, the most tragic eventof my life happened."Again the young doctor stopped short in sudden emotion,passing his white hand over his forehead, upon which the veins  :stood out like knotted cords." When I had concluded to pay another visit to the house,the beginning of the end came in the shape of a letter in astrange, cramped, peculiar hand. It was from  the femalevirago of the marsh." For hours after I read the contents of that letter I pacedmy office like a man driven mad-yes, mad! I can not re-member now what the exact words were, but its import wasthis-  I wonder the words did not turn my brain:"On the night previous the beautiful girl had died.

Noruthless hand should ever use the knife on that beloved form.Not a hair of her dear head should be severed. She should beinterred at the family vault at Rosecliff.i" I made a full confidante of my mother, and to this ar-rangement she made no objection for my sake.It was late at night when the body of the beautifulstranger, who had won my heart, even though her name wasto me unknown, was brought into our drawing-room at home,where my good mother out of pity for me was waiting to re-·   ceive it, and lovingly clasp the beautiful white hands over thepulseless breast."A '  " Do not plead to see her now, Walter, my poor boy,' said  Imother; with tears in her'sympathetic eyes, 'wait till I havesmoothed back her hair and.arranged her first.'~'~      " In tearless sorrow I went back to the library, and pacedup and down, awaiting the summons."It came sooner than 1 expected in a quick, sharp cry frommy mother's lips, and through the corridor her startled voicerang out, shrilly, 'Walter!

There were tears of sympa-thy in his blue eyes; the young doctor's narrative had thrilledhis heart strangely."I hope for your sake, my dear friend, this romance willend in a wedding."He never would have uttered those words if he had but dreamed who the beautiful young girl was.The time was not at hand, however, for the startling revela-tion to be made known to him." It will if I can have my way about it," admitted the hand-some young doctor, modestly. " She is at my home now, con-valescing rapidly, and has won her way to my mother's heart  sas well as mine." It was morning. The household at Strathmore Hall wasastir, and Dr. Melville remembered he had kept the young heir from a few hours of needed rest before his departure.With profuse apologies he arose."Well, Melville, my dear boy, I wish you joy with yourwooing," cried Harry Strathmore, genially; and a few mo-ments later wishing his friend a safe and pleasant journey thetwo young men parted.Neither of them guessed how or where they were destined tomeet again.On his way back to Rosecliff it occurred to the young doctorthat he had quite forgotten to mention to his friend what abeautiful, poetic name his mother's protegee had - TheoChester.He repeated the musical name over and over again, smil- 'ingly, thinking it would not be Theo Chester long if he couldpersuade her to change it to Theo Melville.The sun was shining brightly on the roses that rioted in  iglorious profusion around the doctor's home, as with swiftsteps he ran lightly up the stone steps and entered the house,glancing up blushingly at Theo's window as he advanced fromthe gate, to see if she were watching him.                    HAt that moment Mrs. Melville and Theo were seated in thepretty pink and white morning-room in earnest conversation.Iheo's dark eyes were red and swollen with weeping; the elderlady was very pale.                 .-              -<pb n="70"/>- hero-n mind sheute bei             tat the n ame Theo  hesterwas -an assumed one."Oh, Mrs. Melville,'-sobbed: Theo, wringing her white|hands, "believe me, I have not one friend'in the whole widehwo:d.

Great 'Heaven, what a cruel stroke of fate that his heart has gone out to this girl, whose past is shrouded in such mysteriousdarkness.

She was his mother. She must save him from the fruits of his own folly even though she resorted to strategy to do it.First of all she would confess to the girl her son's mad in- fatuation, and plead with her to'go away and save him fromhimself.

I pity you, my poor girl," she continued; -" but I would rather see my beloved son dead than your hus-"band."Again Theo attempted to speak, but the lady interruptedher with a commanding wave of her jeweled hand, and Theo,her face turning from a deep flush to a dead white, sat look-ing at her like an image carved in marble." You may be a very innocent young girl," continued Mrs.Melville; " but matters look decidedly against you, and I ap- peal to your honor not to encourage my son's love. If you are in want of money and that would be any consideration toyou, I will give it to you gladly to go away quietly, withoutletting my son know your address, or giving him any clew bywhich he could find you. My son's future happiness is more : to me than gold."Theo had risen to her feet, her face white with horror and :mingled scorn."Have no fear of my encouraging your son's love, ma-    'dame," she answered, proudly; "for I could not marry himeven though we two loved each other to distraction. I repeatI could not. And as to accepting your gold for such a pur- pose, you insult me. May Heaven forgive you for the words you have uttered, and for the cruel suspicions that have found  !lodgment in your heart against me. I shall leave your housethis very day, within the hour, before your son's return; I amstrong enough to go now." '"You will at least allow me to provide you with ample - means for the present," she said, secretly delighted at the turnaffairs had taken. " One can not exist long without money."" I would rather starve than touch one penny of yourmoney," said Theo, proudly."The girl has spirit, at least,".thought Mrs. Melville."But what do you intend to do? where do you intend togo?" asked the lady, as Theo turned toward the door."I intend to go out into the great cold cruel world' just asmany a homeless, friendless young girl has had to do beforenme. God takes care of the homeless birds, surely He willwatch over one of His creatures who is cast adrift on the roughwaters of life. I think I will accept money enough from you,Mrs. Melville, to get to New York or Baltimore. I think Icould do better in a large city-it would be easier finding some-thing to do."<pb n="72"/>B ^rs.'Melville, who weas natnrally kind of heart, opened hflarse nd handed Thee a, hundred-dollar greenback.It was not much-it would not last long when one'had te Ifa"ce the world with only that amount between one and starva-tion.; .Theo would never have taken so large an amount if she had. - noticed its denomination, but through her tears it looked like ' a ten-dollar bill.- "Do you know anything of city life?" inquired Mrs. Mel?ville, a little uneasily.Theo shook her dark curls, repressing a sob." I will repay you as-as soon as I have earned the money,"faltered Theo. And, with a little choking," I bid you good-bye, madame," she turned and fled precipitately from theroom.In the corridor she encountered young Dr. Melville himself.For an instant Mrs. Melville's guilty heart stood still as she saw her son clasp Theo's white hand with an eager flush onhis handsome face, and draw her, quite against her will, intothe conservatory among the fragrant blooms.Would the girl tell him all that had just transpired? Shemust know-she would know. And the proud, haughtymother, who would have scorned a mean, underhand action,sunk breathlessly on a willow seat in the shadow of the palms,where she could hear all that was said while she remained un-observed among the luxuriant foliage.Theo knew that Walter Melville had been away the previousevening to a grand ball, but she never dreamed that it was atStrathmore Hall." You do not say 'good-morning,' Miss Chester," he ex-claimed, gayly. "Why, you look pale."  And, with a startof surprise, "Pardon me, but these brown eyes are heavy withtears. Has anything gone wrong with you during my ab-sence?" he questioned, anxiously."Nothing, Mr. Melville. I felt a little lonely, that is all."Poor, foolish fellow! those words caused him to take heartof grace. . She had missed him during his absence, she had- been lonely. He would never leave her again, never!i    Theo," he cried, breaking off a white rose and holding ittoward her, "I have a certain question to ask you to-day.tLook up into my eyes, sweet, and you can read it there! 1  ':;,Ami really a bashful fellow--bachelors usuallyare.

I hang my hopes upon that white rose you holdin your hand, Theo. Miss Chester," he whispered, " be kindto me," and before Theo could find voice to answer him, hehad imprinted a kiss upon the hand that was as white as thepetals of the rose she held, and the next instant she stoodalone, as she thought, in the blooming, fragrant conservatory.CHAPTER XVI.                     -IN an instant Mrs. Melville had confronted Theo, snatchedthe white rose from the girl's fingers, murmuring, hoarsely: " I will give my son his answer, Miss Chester.",Theo bowed and turned away, and without another wordwalked slowly from the grand mansion of the Melvilles, to doas many a girl had done before her-face the great, cold,cruel world.An exultant throb of intense satisfaction lighted up the coldgray eyes of Walter Melville's lady-mother at the knowledgethat she had parted her son from this girl so effectually.  ' She would not tell him that she had gone until the last mo-ment, when search would be quite useless.She saw the look of disappointment that crossed his facewhen he came into luncheon and found Theo's place vacant.  aHe laid the fragrant bunch of wood-violets he held in hishand on the marble mantel, and sighed." Not here," he murmured, to himself, and a sudden anx-iety filled his heart.Was she still debating in her own mind as to whether she    :should give him hope, or doom him to despair?He longed to ask for her, but there was a look on his moth-er's face that seemed to repulse such a question.  -He ardently hoped she would join them at six-o'clock tea,but to his dismay no Theo appeared." Mother," he asked, at length, unable to bear the suspensea moment longer, " why does not Miss Chester join us? Sure-ly she is not ill? 1 should have been informed of it at oncehad such been the case."Mrs. Melville looked up at her tall, handsome son with well-feigned surprise in her cold, gray eyes.'Miss Chester has gone," ske said, calmly.

Her feet wereWeary and sore; but her heart was still more weary.Utterly exhausted, she sunk down upon a fallen log by the <pb n="76"/>d  -   AtUL POR to-E OF A PAtIR FACE.way-side to rest, and her thoughts reverted to StrathmoreHall and its occupants.She had read, the previous day, in a morning paper at Mel-ville Villa, the following paragph  among  e personals:Mr. H.

She would never cross his path again-hisand Violet's. And she bowed her beautiful head over thecrimson creepers that grew in rich luxuriance over the mossylog upon which she sat, watering them with bitter tears.'' 1      A sharp crackling of the dry twigs a few rods ahead of herstartled Theo, and, with a little suppressed cry, she draw backi:-    into the dense shadow of the alder bushes hard by, but not amoment too soon; for, advancing scarcely twenty feet fromher she beheld, by the faint light of the young moon, the fig-ures of two men, one of whom she recognized instantly as thatof Frank Hawthorne.For an instant Theo's heart seemed to stand still, and shefancied that her cruel enemy, with whom she had been broughtso suddenly and unexpectedly almost face to face, must hearthe loud, terrified beating of her heart."We will sit down here upon this fallen log and talk thematter over," said Hawthorne, indicating the seat upon whichTheo had sat but a moment previous, and so near her that shecould have put out her white hand from where she stood, cow-ering and shrinking back among the alder bushes, and touchedhim."The-New York train will never reach the station two milesyonder," cried Hawthorne, exultantly, in answer to some ques-tiop of his companion.  "I have taken good care of that. 1made sure, first, that it was the mail train, and that thosedocuments were mailed to-day, and would be on this particu-lar car.

In the confusion we can enter the car and secure all thenail for Allendale. There was no other way," cried the hand-some villain, recklessly. " There is another reason that in-fluences me," Hawthorne went on, with a diabolical laugh." I should not mind seeing that train a total wreck; for theman I hate above all others is on board-Harry Strathmore,of Allendale!"  And he ground out the name from betweenhis white teeth, with a fierce imprecation. " We may as welltake a stroll down the road. The mail train won't reach the fbridge for an hour yet."So saying, they walked leisurely away, leaving their listener,who crouched shrinkingly back among the alder bushes, fairly,paralyzed with horror.Theo had caught their terrible meaning in a flash. GreatHeaven! what should she do? They intended to wreck thetrain at the bridge-the train in which Harry Strathmore, theman she worshiped so blindly, was a passenger!How long she stood there, in her dazed horror, the girl neverknew; time seemed to slip by with the rapidity of lightning.The far-off shriek of the on-coming train aroused her as itsped on to its doom, nearing the fatal bridge!CHAPTER XVI1.I FOR a moment Theo Chester stood as if rooted to the spot,dazed with horror, and the face that was uplifted to the dim,flickering stars was pale as death itself.The far-off shriek of the on-coming train aroused her asnothing else in the world could have done. Each instant itwas tearing madly toward the bridge and to certain destruc-tion, while the man she loved was wholly unconscious of histerrible danger.In an instant Theo, brave, dauntless little Theo, had decid-ed upon her course of action.Quick as thought the girl dashed back to the bridge, whichshe had crossed scarcely an hour before. It was for life ordeath, and fear seemed to lend wings to her feet.It was true, yes, horribly true; the iron rails had been tornfrom their fastenings, and the dark stream yawned below as ifeager and expectant to swallow the prey that was to be giveninto its keeping if Heaven did not interfere.With a terrible cry Theo sprung forward, throwing herselfinto the middle of the track and gesticulating wildly, as shewaved her white handkerchief to and fro to warn the enginees-<pb n="78"/>78           tt ALt ORt  LOVEt OP A PAIT PiAC.of his great peril. The sound of her wild, agonized voice was lost, drowned, in the roar and thunder of the on-coming train.It was the most intensely thrilling moment of the girl's life.Would the engineer see her, or hear her cries, or would theiron monster in its mad flight crush her, and carry its load ofhuman souls on to the bridge and to death?<! -      Theo stood upon the track with a death-white face andlips firmly set, trusting her young life blindly to Heaven.The train had gained the curve scarcely ten rods ahead ofher, and the head-light of the engine threw its bright glareinto the white agonized face, and the slender, lissom figurestanding directly in the track."Harry," murmured the girl, raising one white arm aloftas if supplicating aid from above, "  will save you, oh, loveof my heart, who are so cruelly lost to me, I will save your lifeto-night or die in the attempt."The blind agonized prayer died on her heroic young lips;already the white steam enveloped her like a misty shroud,the intense heat stifled her, the terrible glare of the head-lightdazed each faculty, the rails on either side of the brave noblegirl shook and trembled like an electric battery; but the girlnever wavered, never flinched.And in that awful moment of intense peril, the engineerbeheld her gesticulating so wildly, with hands aloft, wavingher handkerchief as a signal of danger.He saw and comprehended, but not an instant too soon. In!   vain he shouted hoarsely to the girl to save herself; she seemedrooted to the spot. Great God! she would be crushed, man-gled, beneath the ponderous wheels.Great drops of perspiration stood out in beads upon theman's swart face, and in that moment of fearful ordeal hispresence of mind aided him.He had done all that human power could do to stop thetrain, but it must pass a rod or more over the spot where thegirl stood ere its speed would slacken. With iron will andnerves of steel he sprung forward out upon the iron fender.A moment of breathless suspense followed, another momentand he had clutched the girl 's upraised arm, drawing her bymain force upon the railing beside him, and  the great ironmonster thundered pantingly over the spot where Theo hadstood but an instant before, panted, trembled, and then stood:  still, scarcely three feet from the fatal bridge.,With a great hysterical cry Theo had pointed to the bridge: The rails are torn up, she gasped.       eant to your train--or--or die!"                   meant to save<pb n="79"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             79 The brown eyes closed and the girl fell back in the engineer'sstrong, stalwart arms in a dead faint; but the man realized atonce the terrible import of her words, the fearful catastropheshe had averted at the peril of her own young life.          iBy the strange complications of fate, Harry Strathmore had  -;missed that train and had been obliged to continue his journeyby a different route.The passengers-fifty odd in number-and to whom her :;bravery had been explained, overwhelmed Theo, when she :: : ^.:opened her eyes to consciousness, with thanks. She was the  -  :iheroine of the hour.A purse would have been raised for her at once by the pas-sengers, but this Theo firmly declined. Neither would she give her name, and as to her address, she said, with tears in  -her brown eyes:" I have no home. I was on my way to New York to search- :X .for a situation to earn my own living."'A tall, portly, elegant-looking gentleman, the foremostamong the crowd of passengers who had gathered aroundTheo, stepped quickly forward, proffering his card. Uponat :she read the name, "Harold Winfield, U. S. Senator, No.-, --- Avenue, Washington, D. C.""You have placed me as well as my dear wife, who is in: "the rear coach, under the greatest obligations, my dear younglady," he said.  "If you will not accept money, and insist. upon securing a situation, allow me to beg of you to accept aposition in our home as companion to my wife-valued friend,if you will."Theo was overwhelmed at Heaven's goodness to her.     : '; Mrs. Winfield repeated her husband's request, and the grateful passengers urged her' to accept as she could do nobetter, although each one of them stood ready to render any  'assistance that lay in their power to the noble young girl whohad saved their lives.And thus it was that within one short hour the whole courseof Theo's eventful life was turned into a different channel.The brakemen upon the train had set to work with a will, - and the rails which would have been the cause of such a terri-ble wreck were quickly laid in place and firmly spiked down,and with but half an hour's delay the train thundered on in safety, speeding with the rapidity of lightning past the twodumfounded men hurrying along through the copsewoodtoward the bridge.Imprecations loud and deep broke from Frank Hawthorne's loodles lips. A thunder-bolt from'a clear sky could not,                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ ~ ~   ~<pb n="80"/>80          ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.!.have astonished the villain more than to see the train which hehad planned to destroy dashing past him like a meteor.How could it have happened?  The planks and rails uponthe bridge had been torn up; yet here was the train and ap-parently in excellent condition.To the last day of his life he could never solve that mystery./%          "Foiled!" he exclaimed as the train thundered past him;then turning to his companion he cried, under his breath:^  t1 £" I must fly from here this very night, for that train, which'/''^^    carries the mail to New York, carries among the registeredletters one to the district attorney calling for my apprehensionfor forging the name of the late Major Strathmore to a certaindocument. Harry Strathmore, the son-curse him-is pushingjr.~     this affair through. After to-night this vicinity will be toohot for me. By the eternal, I think I'll go to Washington."r E        Surely it was the crhelest fate in the whole wide world that]   caused him to make that decision. What came of it we shallsoon see.*,'l  ~In the meantime, Theo was ensconced in Mrs. Winfield'sI:~i     section of the Pullman palace car. That lady sat opposite herin a crimson revolving chair, declaring herself by far too badlyshaken up in the nerves at the very thought of the thrillingaccident they had so narrowly escaped to think of sleeping.When Theo had given the lady her name, she was quitesurprised to see her lean forward in her chair with an eagerexpression on her face."Lester! did you say your name was Miss Lester?" shecried, breathlessly. "Ah! I shall love you because your nameis Lester. My dearest friend bore that name."Again the lnes of adverse fate crossed Theo's life. It wouldBy   have been very easy to correct that mistake, which was to havesuch a tragic ending, then and there, by saying, " My nameis not Lester, madame; it is Chester.""What did it matter whether it was Chester or Lester theychose to call her?" Theo reasoned with herself. if the ladyloved the name of Lester so dearly, she might as well permitherself to be called by that name as well as any othe.; it mat-|J '      »senator's wife looking wistfully out of the window.

I do not care much for society, although my husband is quite a favorite in it," continued thelady, flushing hotly as she again turned toward the window,her jeweled hands locking and unlocking themselves nervously together in her silken lap."I am not used to society myself," answered Theo, feelingthat she was called upon to say something.Of course it was only fancy, but it certainly appeared toTheo that the lady looked relieved.During the remainder of the trip there was one thing that struck Theo quite forcibly: they saw very little of Mr. Win-field. They dined upon the train; he seldom joined them.In her husband's presence Mrs. Winfield .was strangely reti-,  icent. Husband and wife seldom addressed a remark to eachother; yet the senator was the very perfection of politeness in -his elegant, polished manner and smooth diction; and thewife's wistful eyes rarely left his face when he was in her pres- once.Theo was too young and inexperienced in the ways of theworld to read aright these indications. Even palaces have their skeleton closets. Theo was soon to know, to her bitter cost, the skeleton that existed in the elegant mansion of theWinfields.CHAPTER XVIII.THE home of the Winfields, in which Theo was soon domi- ciled, was indeed beautiful; the spacious grounds, the graystone building with its turrets and ivy-covered tower reminded Theo painfully of Strathmore Hall.The mansion was elegant in its appointments, vet fewvisitors were entertained there.  This was rather remarkable,  -owing to their high social position.Theo saw still less of the master of the house than she sawof him on the train; she often wondered why. He neverbreakfasted with them; was rarely home to luncheon, and theioccasions were still rarer when he graced the table with hispresence in the evening; and often, for days at a time, he would absent himself from home altogether.                 -     1When he was at home, IMrs. Winfield was fastidiously par-   *ticular over her toilets.  She generally chose a pale-blue hilk  ;garnished with pink rosebuds.                            :<pb n="82"/>-  82       ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.This costume above all others was most trying to her com-  iplexion, but one had not the heart to tell her of it when sheraised her troubled eyes and said, slowly: " My husband likes me best in pale blue; it is his favoritecolor, this particular shade.""Poor lady!" exclaimed Jenny, her maid, to Theo, whenthey were quite alone.  " Her husband will never knowwhether she has a blue gown or a pink one on; he never seesher when there's anything else in the room for his eyes torest on."Theo looked up from the lace-work she held in her handswith grave surprise in her brown eyes."La!" cried Jenny, "you've been Mrs. Winfield's com-panion nearly a month now, and you haven't guessed yet whatmakes her so unhappy! You're not very sharp, I should say,Miss Lester; I found it out the first day I came here.""I do not know what you mean, Jenny," returned Theo,quietly.     "1 should never think of prying into people'stroubles."" Prying into!" repeated Jenny, with a sneer and a toss ofher auburn locks; " why, it's no more of a secret in thishouse than if it were pasted up on the bill-boards that SenatorWinfield and his wife don't get along well together.  There'sno fussing and quarreling, to be sure; but then, goodnessgracious knows if I had a husband I'd rather he would befussing all the time than to give me such a freezing lettingalone as he does her. Poor lady! I feel sorry for her, she triesso hard to keep him attracted!"This little conversation opened Theo's unsuspecting, inno-cent eyes to the true state of affairs.That evening Theo found Mrs. Winfield sitting alone in themoonlit window of her room, wistfully watching the mainroad. The beautiful white flowers she had put in her hairthat morning were- withered and dead, and her face showedtraces of tears."I am glad you are come to keep me company, Miss Les-ter," she said.  "I was feeling very lonely, sitting herewatching for my husband."A deep sigh accompanied the words."i Lonely!" exclaimed Theo, gayly. "Why, that oughtnot to be, my dear Mrs. Winfield. You ought to rouse Toui-self up, and if happiness will not find you out, you ought togo in search of it."fabled fountain of youth--I should never ind it," murmurN<pb n="83"/>AUt   01R LOVE OF A fAtTI BAOE.            8 $S     jhe lady. " My only happiness is in being where my husbandis.'"' Well," returned Theo, sweetly and consolingly, " you cannot expect a gentleman in your husband's position to have verymuch time to devote to home life, no matter how much hemay love that home.""Do you really think that, Miss Lester?" exclaimed thepoor lady, her pale face] lighting up with an eager radiancethat was seldom seen there; "do you really believe it is asense of duty instead of inclination that keeps many a man       - -away from his home?"" In a great many cases, certainly," responded Theo, gently."You are very young but you are very sensible, Miss Les-ter," said the lady, clasping Theo's hands in her own cold,jeweled ones; " it is a great pleasure to talk to you, to hearyour views; I draw great consolation from your words."" 1 am very glad," said Theo, earnestly."Do you think, Miss Lester," said the senator's wifetremulously and hesitatingly, "that a husband can ever gain           Ba higher sphere than that occupied by his wife? Do you think,putting it quite plainly, that a man lifted from obscurity andpoverty can rise so far above the wife that he married while  :oppressed by that poverty that she is unfitted for the positionof- his wife, sharer in his thoughts and joys when fame andprosperity have lifted him far above his fellow-men?"The poor lady listened breathlessly for the answer to thatquestion, as many a wife had done before her.The answer fell clear and distinct, like balm from Theo'ssweet lips." No husband can ever rise above the wife he has married,taken to his bosom to love, cherish, and protect through life,Mrs. Winfield; as he rises in the social scale, she rises withhim step by step."" Thank you, Miss Lester; your words encourage me, theygive me heart. I should like to confide a-a-secret to you;would-would you care to listen?"And as she spoke a burning tear-drop fell from her longlashes, splashing upon Theo's cool, white hand." I shall be very pleased to listen, Mrs. Winfield; anythingthat interests you to relate must interest me in listening to it.""1 can talk to you--you seem to understand me better thanany one else has ever done," responded the lady, gratefully.It is my own story I am about to relate to you, Miss Lester,and a more tragic story never was written by the pen of anovelist; they make their romances end in these words: ' TheJ<pb n="84"/>24          ALtL FO  LOVE OF A. fPAIR PACE. married, and lived happily ever afterward,' but with marriagethe tragedy of my life began."The white hands that Theo held trembled, but with a firmvoice, which quivered brokenly now and then, she went on,slowly:" When I was your age, Miss Lester, 1 lived upon the bankof a stream in Southern Maryland. 1 was a miller's daughter,as happy as the day was long. Did you ever read GeorgeEliot's 'Mill on the Floss'? if you did you will have quite a!fl      faithful description of what my old home was like, the descrip-tion suits it so well."1 was as happy as a skylark, Miss Lester; my song wasAV s   as blithe as the gay dashing ripple of the brooklet that glee-fully escaped from the wheel of the mill! What does a girl ofseventeen know of the world and its cares?"=- " I suppose they don't know very much," admitted Theo."They know nothing," responded Mrs. Winfield, "life'sa?\--     cruel lessons lie all before them-even at twenty."I was just seventeen-your age now-when my fate over-t1!      took me. It was on the sunniest of sunshiny mornings, I satamong the blue harebells idly plucking them from the stem'-l:    and tossing them into the stream, when suddenly glancing upI saw the handsomest young man I had ever seen in all mylife standing just across the brook looking at me with eyes:         full of admiration."I could feel my cheeks blushing burning hot, and myheart beat as it had never beaten before.i   "'.,   'Is your father in?' asked the stranger, lifting his hat.' You are the miller's daughter, I presume?'" 1 could not tell you, Miss Lester, what I said. I neverknew. I must have answered in the affirmative, for steppinglightly and gracefully over the round, white stones lying inthe bed of the brooklet, just above the water, he crossed overand stood by my side; but instead of going on to the mill tosee my father he lingered there talking to me." All young girls are easily impressed with a gay, handsomeyoung fellow.  His witching black eyes taught my girlishheart the sweet possibilities of love before we had been talkingtogether an hour, and I was vaguely wondering if he wouldever come again."He did come, upon one excuse or another, every day, andthose halcyon days are like a dream to me now."Again a burning tear fell upon Theo's cool, white hand; but.the narrator continued, falteringly:<pb n="85"/>AIL PoR tOVE O     A PAIR PACt.           38"" It might have been better perhaps had I never met thehandsome stranger."Our wooing was sweet and romantic enough to please theheart of any young girl; but when he asked my father for myhand there was sudden and terrible opposition." 'No, sir!' exclaimed my father, looking at Harold's whitehands, 'you are not the husband I would choose for my girl.I can see now what you would learn in the after years. Youare not suited to each other.'"' In what way, sir?' demanded Harold." Well, to be quite frank with you, you are too fastidiousa young man to mate with my Linda,' father replied, glancingat the fashionable cut of his clothes.  ' It seems to me a wifewith more book-learning would suit you best. My girl knowsmore about the songs the birds sing in the trees yonder, thewhispered words of the breeze among the flowers, than shedoes about grammar. Her lessons have all been learned fromthe book of nature. No, no, young man, she is suited for amiller's wife, or the wife of a farmer, but not for you.'"Love laughs at obstacles, and 1 am grieved to tell you thatwe eloped, and the true saying that ' runaway marriages neverturn out well,' was fully exemplified."When my father discovered what I had done he simplysaid:"' I hope you may never rue it; but, ah, I fear for you.'"Those words struck more terror to my heart than thedeepest curses would have done."Yet in the first happy year of my marriage with Harold Iquite forgot them, or remembered them only to laugh at myforebodings." Harold owned a dry-goods store in a country village then,and we lived over the store. And in those humble rooms,Miss Lester, I was a thousand times happier than I am now inthis marble mansion." 1 fear my recital does not interest you, Miss Lester," shesaid, anxiously. " Pray go on," cried Theo. "I am more than interested."Theo little knew what vital interest the continuation of thistory was to have for her.CHAPTER XIX."FOR the first year everything went on smoothly enoughwith us," said Mrs. Winfield, continuing her strange reoitar__: '~wm<pb n="86"/>- 6      ltt tOR LOVE OP A PAi    lACE. " then for the first time I noticed that my Harold was grow.i ng discontented with the life we led.i';         " He was ambitious to a fault. The one dream of his lifewas a longing for fame and glory. I could not understandthese longings, and he often told me impatiently that ' we hadI not one thought in common,' and that if he had married anyother wife-one who understood him better-he might haveI been a brilliant man." Then the crisis came.  A distant relative died, andHarold, as next of kin, inherited his vast wealth. Fromthat moment I never knew a happy hour.qli.9  " We moved to Washington, and, with his great wealth,honors, fame, and all that his heart sighed for were soon his;l    but alas! Miss Lester, each day but drifted his heart furtherfrom me. I"I was brought to a realization of it in a strange manner.I had sent for my sister Dora to make me a visit, and see myelegant home and Harold's.  When Dora came I wantedHarold to take her out to drive and show her the city, but tomy great dismay he absolutely refused." 'Indeed I shall not be seen in public with an awkwardcountry girl like that!' he exclaimed, angrily, when we werealone together. ' It is bad enough to tolerate her about thehouse. Do you think a man of my standing can endure to belaughed at by having it leak out that she is my wife's sister?I wish to Heaven you would keep your country relations wherethey belong, and not bring them here to disgrace me. Iabhor them!"" o  Harold,' I exclaimed, sharply, 'you seem to forget thatDora is my sister!'"'She doesn't gain anything in my opinion by that!' heexclaimed, in a voice of concentrated bitterness.  'You twoare as much alike, to use a common phrase, " as two peas ina pod."'" Those words were a revelation as to the opinion he had ofme. And 1, ah, God pity me, how I loved him! He was myworld-the most perfect o men in my worshipful eyes.One's relatives are always quick to note the domesticinfelicity between husband and wife whenever it exists.e  ister Dora's sharp eyes soon detected the growing cold-ness between Harold and me."' Pardon me, Linda,' she said, 'of course I. may be mis-taken, but he doesn't seem to caremuch about you.

These things hadnot occurred to me before; my eyes were slowly opening." 'That sister of yours has been putting all these notions inyour head,' he retorted, angrily.  'How dare she criticise mymovements?'"' But why do you not take me out with you when you callupon your friends, or dine with them?' I persisted.'I had rather not explain why, Linda,' he said, evasively;but I insisted upon an answer." ' Well, then, if you must know, I might as well admit thetruth to you, Linda. You are neither fitted by education norculture to mingle in the society which my position calls uponme to enter. You would be out of place. You would beignored instead of being appreciated.  You could neitherunderstand the conversation of those around you nor enterinto it. Your position would be most trying for yourself andfor me. You are not a society lady, Linda; you can never beone.' "' You knew all this when you married me, Harold; youwere pleased enough with me then,' I cried."' What would please Harold Winfield, a country mer-chant, would be far from pleasing the fastidious taste ofSenator Winfield, a man of the world,' he replied. 'Yourfather was right, Linda; you and I were never suited to each  :other. '"From that night I was never the same, Miss Lester. Icried myself to sleep. Had Harold's love for me grown cold?would it die altogether out of his heart? 1 asked myself. Ah,how I prayed Heaven to spare me his love-prayed as a starv-ing, dying child prays for a crust ef bread! Love is rapture,Miss Lester, and yet it is the keenest torture a woman's heartcan know."When Dora went home I applied myself to study; but itwas a hopeless task; try as I would, I could not retain in mymemory what I did learn. 1 tried music, but 1 could notmanipulate the ivory keys of the piano; the notes seemed tomy nervous, excited fancy like little black sheep jumping overthe bars." It never occurred to me before that I was no conversation-alist. I realized it now with a pain at my heart that was terri-ble to endure. I could not converse with any one whenHarold was by; my thoughts grew muddled and confused,and my lips grew mute, for I knew that he was noting all n$<pb n="88"/>1  88      ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.'imperfections. I lived in constant dread, that was agony itself,lest I should do or say something wrong."Each day the breach between Harold and myself widens,and the full force of the words I should have heeded ere it wastoo late often recurs to me-' We are not suited to eachtother.' 1 try to look my best before Harold, but it is quiteuseless," continued the poor lady. " He is dissatisfied withme. Hope has died out of my heart. Your words that' husbands can never rise above their wives in the social scale 'has given me great hope, Miss Lester. I thank you for them.I shall dream over them to-night. This exchange of confi-dence with you has comforted me strangely."Theo was kneeling beside her, her lovely, sympathizingyoung face upturned to the one bending over her in infinitepity." Do not allow yourself to grieve over such a gloomy pict-ure," she cried. "You and I must change all that. Bythree months you shall have your Harold again at your feetsuing for your love as in those bright halcyon days."The radiance that lighted up the haggard face for an instantwas pitiful to see; but it died out in a single instant, leavingi it more haggard than before. She shook her head sadly:"'Love that has once died out of the heart can never berekindled,' Ik Marvel tells us; and I believe that that is quitetrue, Miss Lester.""Love for you has not died out of Mr. Winfield's heart,"declared Theo. " The old affection is only sleeping; we mustarouse it."The lady looked incredulous, scarcely daring to hope." You can not be much older than I am," continued Theo.'" You are still young and beautiful. You are despondent,that is all.""I am twenty-seven," said Mrs. Winfield, ruefully; "andmy age shows to great disadvantage when compared to thefresh young face of a girl of seventeen.""iNay," cried Theo, gayly, "many a lady never falls inlove and marries until she is that age; twenty-seven is youngindeed; you will admit that when you are forty.""What a wise head you have on such young shoulders, mydear," laughed Mrs. Winfield. "I believe 1 am regaininglost youth again under the witching spell of your presence.ave something to say to you about yourself" she went onpatting the girl's soft brown crls  "My husband has anephew who is coming here to spend a few days with us ere hegoes abroad--his father died recently.

I shall like so much to keep you in the family always."Theo had risen to her feet, her beautiful face death-white inthe solemn moonlight."I am not for love or for marriage, Mrs. Winfield," shesaid, brokenly. " I pray you never to speak to me of it again -I could not see your nephew-I would rather not-please donot ask me."That night, when Theo went to her room, long and earnestlyMrs. Winfield mused over her strange words-" Not for love,or for marriage "-what could the girl possibly mean?"She would make such a good wife for my husband'snephew, handsome Harry Strathmore," she mused; "but ofcourse, if she refuses to see him when he comes, I can notinsist upon her doing so; and he comes to-morrow, his tele-gram says. I am sure he would fall in love with her prettyface if he were to see her."CHAPTER XX.EARLY the next morning the following hastily written notewas received at the Winfield mansion:" MY DEAR AUNT LINDA,-I shall be with you at six o'clockthis evening at latest. I bring with me a friend of mine,Doctor Walter Melville, of Rosecliff, who has concluded atalmost the last moment to join me in my trip abroad. Weshall be able to pass but a few hours under your hospitableroof, as we take the midnight train to New York, where wewill be just in time to catch the outward-bound ' Servia ' onthe following morning."Yours in great haste," HARRY STRATHMORE."" My nephew will be here this evening," said Mrs. Winfield,folding the letter and putting it into her pocket. "What a pity it is that Harold is not at home to receive them. Youmust come to my rescue, Miss Lester, and assist me in enter-taining them."  But Theo pleaded so hard to be excused, on -the plea of a sick-headache, Mrs. Winfield was at lengthobliged to relinquish her pet scheme of bringing her handsomeyoung nephew and pretty Miss Lester together.Again strange fate played at cross-purposes with pool Theo<pb n="90"/>00          AtL POR LOVt 0O   A   AIRB PAY. -it did not occur to Mrs. Winfield to mention the name ofher nephew or that of his friend.After tea Theo went directly to her room, while Mrs.Winfield repaired to the drawing-room to receive her guests.A few moments later a coach dashed up the avenue andthrough the arched gates up to the porch, and Theo knew thatthey had arrived.Theo sat by her window an hour or more, watching the duskcreep on and the stars come out in the blue arched sky, spark-ling radiantly in the wake of the Lady Moon.The hum of masculine voices floated drowsily up to Theowhere she sat, and once a ringing laugh made her heart almostcease to beat for an instant-it was so like the voice of HarryStrathmore-and a thousand memories smote the girl's soreheart.Why could a voice that had just such a ring as HarryStrathmore's cause her such bitter pain? She had told herselfthat she would tear all thoughts of his fair, handsome facefrom her heart; but that was far easier said than done, eventhough she knew he was Violet's lover. Love goes whereGod listeth. It was beyond the girl's power to cease lovinghim. There was scarcely a moment, waking or sleeping, thatthe fair, frank, Saxon, debonair face, in its haughty pride,was not before her." Ah! why could she not hate him instead of yearning forhim?"   That was the passionate cry of her soul.f        ^In sheer despair, and for something to take up her thoughts,Theo arose mechanically and went down to the library in questof a book.i ^    She was glad that the crimson velvet hangings that sepa-rated the library from the drawing-room were closely drawn-she could search for the book she wanted without fear of beinginterrupted.Five-ten minutes passed in inspecting the volumes thatstared down at her from their gay bindings. At last shesecured one of Victor     ugo's works, and, book in hand wasabout to retrace her steps, when a voice from the adjoiningroom fell upon her ear, holding her spell-bound by its strangelyfamiliar tone.' !:~ iy;^'s"A ,song? Certainly, Aunt Linda," she heard the voice'say;  what. shall it be?".?    '    '7rAnything you like; favor me with your own selection, mydear nephew," replied Mrs. WinfOeld.X I  a, Amoment later the grand piano was touched by a mastert    .                                                     mt<pb n="91"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR PACE.              91hand, and a soft melody floated through the room, a barytonevoice, clear, powerful, and flexible, accompanying it.Theo stood still on the other side of the velvet hangings,her very soul wrapt in a trance of delight. Every word of-thesong fell with a strange thrill upon her heart. It seemed in-stinct with passionate sorrow and love:                    ;I picked up a moss-grown stoneFrom the green bank where I lay,And wrote:'Here lies the body of Ellen AdairAnd the heart of Edward Gray.'Then I tossed it into the stream--"The grand voice that filled the spacious room thrilled andtrembled, then grew suddenly still for a moment, adding,hesitatingly:"Pardon me; I can not sing the rest, Aunt Linda; thewords have escaped my memory.""What a pity!" cried Mrs. Winfield; "you sing it sofinely. I have never heard it rendered better; you put soulinto it.  One could almost fancy you were Edward Graysitting on the banks of the stream where perished poor EllenAdair. "The strangely familiar voice answered, but Theo could notcatch the words.A great longing came over the girl to see the face of thisstranger, whose voice reminded her with such keen pain of the lover whom she had loved so well-and lost. If she butdrew the velvet hangings ever so slightly apart her greatlonging would be gratified.Young girls usually act upon the impulse of the moment. It was so with Theo. Yet, during the instant she was hesitating,Harry Strathmore had risen from the piano and walked to the other end of the room-to the bay-window, where his aunt wasseated, and quite out of Theo's range of vision-and Dr. Mel-ville, who had been standing beside the instrument, bent closerover it, to read the title of the song his friend had just sungso touchingly.At that moment Theo parted the crimson hangings ever so'slightly, and peered out with a strangely beating heart. Oneglance, and she reeled back faint and giddy."Dotcor Melville, of Rosecliff!" she gasped. "MercifulHeaven! now I know why the voice of Mrs. Winfield's nephewstruck me as being so strangely familiar."She shrunk still further back into the shadow of the library,<pb n="92"/>93        ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE. feeling intensely glad that Dr. Melville-whom she had quitehe conteplated a trip abroad, and would not be in Washing-ton for some time to come. If Mrs. Winfield mentioned herat all, it would be as Miss Lester-not as Theo Chester-shewas thankful for that.Theo walked slowly out of the library, little dreaming thaton the other side of the velvet curtains stood the lover her soulcraved who would have clasped her joyfully to his heart hadhe but known of her near presence-the lover who, like EdwardGray, was pining his life away for the girl whom he believedburied beneath the rippling waves.But life is full of just such pitiful mistakes that part lovers,and change the current of lives.Theo walked slowly back to her room; but Victor Hugohad lost all charm for her; she could only think of the mourn-ful words of the song she had just heard, which were so sweet,so simple and sad.Her life was so different from poor Ellen Adair's. Ellen'slover mourned for her untimely death; his heart was in herBut her love, handsome Harry Strathmore, to whom she hadbeen so solemnly betrothed, was glad when the dark watersclosed over her head. He believed her dead, and he was glad,for it broke the bonds of that hated betrothal, and set himfree." Ab, how different life might have been for me," shecried, with sudden passion, " if Harry Strathmore had lovedme as Edward Grav loved Ellen Adair!"r*        *      *e     *             *      *In the drawing-room, at that particular moment, while Dr.Melville was busily examining a book of engravings, Mrs.Winfield was in earnest conversation with Harry Strathmore,extolling the praises of her beautiful young companion, whomi    she could not induce to come down to meet her guests."I should have been so pleased had you seen Miss Lester,I{        Harry," lhe went on; " she is so sweet and winsome she wouldhave been sure to have captivated your bachelor heart.

"I may asell be frank with you: if she were a Hebe I could take noore than a common interest in her. Let us discuss some-ing else;" and he shrugged his broad shoulders impatiently. Mrs. Winfield's eyes sparkled. What if these two obstinateoung people, who persisted in not knowing or caring for eachther, should meet some day and fall in love after all!-itould be really quite romantic." Very well, Harry, we will talk no more about it," shegreed.An hour later as Theo sat by her window, the carriage con-aining Mrs. Winfield's guests drove hurriedly away.Of course it was only fancy, but the waving pines tossingheir leaves fitfully against the casement seemed to murmur:" Lost, lost, lost to you forever!"Ah, if she had but known who it was that drove off in thatclose carriage with young Dr. Melville!Long after the gilded clock on the mantel had played thechimes of the midnight hour, Theo still sat by the moon-lit window, her dimpled chin resting on her white hands, herlovely brown eyes drowned in tears."Why should I waste one thought on Harry Strathmore?"she murmured, in a voice of bitter pain. " By this time he is  iViolet's husband, and far away over the sea."The handsome Saxon face rose up before her-the smiling,haughty, debonair face of the man to whom she had given thelove of her heart unsought.She looked wistfully out into the tender starlight that laywith a white, soft light over the waving trees and sleepingflowers." How long am I to live this desolate, weary life?" shecried out. "I am so young, yet I am so forlorn and lonely!Why has fate been so cruel to me?"'ate was, however, marking a new chapter in the girl'sdestiny. On the morrow a startling and unlooked-for eventWas to happen.CHAPTER     XXI.ATE morrow brought Iarold Winfield, and a startlingchange. He had been appointed to a foreign mission, andmaust sail for Europe on the following week. <pb n="94"/>94         ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.This was the intelligence that greeted Theo the next morm ing at the breakfast-table. "Harold and I have been talking as to what disposition weshould make of you, my dear," Mrs. Winfield went on hur-riedly. " I can not take you with me, and as the house is to beclosed, we concluded that it would be an excellent idea to sendyou to Vassar College, that you may complete your educationI have often heard you say you would like that."Tears rose to Theo's eyes. She crossed over to Mrs. Win-field's side, clasping her jeweled hands impulsively." You are more than kind and considerate," she faltered."I have no claim upon you; I could not accept so much fromyou when I have done nothing to merit it.""Nothing!" exclaimed Mrs. Winfield, with great emotion;"why, my dear child, you saved our lives not long since;there is nothing we can do that would balance that.""I must earn my own living," returned Theo, simply.No words can express my gratitude for your kind intentions,even though I do not accept your offer. "In vain Mrs. Winfield expostulated; Thee was firm; shemust make her own way in the world."But what can a young girl like you do?" asked the ladywith deep anxiety."I can be somebody's companion, or a governess to littlechildren," returned Thee, "if you will help me to obtain sucha situation. You were telling me of a lady who was going toFlorida with her daughter, and who asked you if you knewwhere she could get a suitable companion; if you will butname me I shall be so glad."s?^t    ~Mrs. Winfield looked troubled.!f/L         o"If you knew Mrs. Culver and her daughters as well as Ido you would not be so anxious to get into their family; themother is a kindly woman despite her pride; but the daugh-ters are-well, they are viragoes.

To be a composer of  :,music was the one grand dream of her young life.The money she received from Mrs. Culver should go to per-fecting herself in music, she promised herself.Thus it happened that one sunshiny morning a week later,a hack stopped at the Culver mansion in the suburbs ofIIagarstown, and a solitary figure alighted. The name uponthe dainty card the liveried servant took up to the ladies in themorning-room read:THEO LESTER.It was too late to correct the mistake that she had allowedto pass by.  " After all, it d6es not matter," she often toldherself. "Lester or Chester, what difference could it makewhich name I am known by?"Mrs. Culver sat in the morning-room   holding a spiriteddebate with her two daughters, Iris and Isabel, when Theo'scard was handed her.What is known as a little family quarrel was at its height atthat particular moment-the young ladies were having such aspirited debate that their mother was compelled to interfere." I have nothing fit to wear to the ball, mamma, and youknow it!" cried Isabel Culver. " I would rather stay athome than wear a green silk dress. What suits Iris's com-plexion doesn't suit mine, and you know 1 want to look par-ticularly well at this ball, for if Colonel West allows me toleave the ball without proposing to me, when he knows westart for Florida this week, I may as well give up all hopes ofhim and his millions-that's all there is about it!"Iris Culver laughed aloud a provoking, sneering laughthat provoked her sister as nothing else in the world could havedone." The colonel propose to you, indeed!" she cried. " Thereare too many younger and prettier girls that he knows whoare willing to be Mrs. Millionaire West for him to propose toa maiden of five-and-twenty--be sure of that."Do you hear her, mother?" screamed Isabel. "She'salways taunting me with my age; but there's one great corn-fort in knowing if I am twenty-five, I don't begin to lookt, and I have inherited all the beauty that was allotted to thisfamily. No wonder Iris is jealous!"And she shook her dark head so vehemently that her curl-papers loosened, and the would-be curls danced over her angry forehead in a rakish-looking, tumbled mass.Iris Culver, twenty, and a decided blonde, did not utter the<pb n="96"/>96          ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FAiE.scathing retort that sprung to her lips, for, glancing suddenlytoward the door-way,e beheld a slight girlish figure in abrown traveling-dress standing timidly beside the servant, who'had shown her into their presence in accordance with Mrs.Culver's desire.Isabel Culver gave a start of surprise as her angry eyes fellupon The's beautiful young face. Iris's pale brows loweredominously, and, as if to atone for her daughters' incivility andwa°t of good breeding, Mrs. Culver stepped graciously for-ward, holding out her hand."Miss Lester," she said, kindly, "I am very glad you areco.me," and she looked uneasily from Theo's pretty youngface to the scowling countenances of her two daughters, whowere evidently not favorably impressed with the " companion Mrs. Winfield had sent." You must be tired," she said; " it is quite a trip fromWashington to Hagarstown. You must rest until luncheon.Iris," she said, turning to her youngest daughter, "touch thebell, dear, and order your maid to show Miss Lester to theroom that has been prepared for her."Iris Culver raised her pale blue eyes with a lurid light shin-ing in them."Miss Lester can touch the bell herself," she answered, in-dicating the bell-rope with a wave of her white hand, andmuttering to herself: " The idea of asking me to wait uponher when she is brought here for the sole purpose of waitingupon us. Touch the bell indeed!"Mrs. Culver attended to it herself, and Sara, the maid, soonappeared and conducted Theo to her room."So you're the new companion," she said, throwingopenthe closed windows and letting in the warm, bright sunshine."It's a wonder to me that they took you!""Why?" asked Theo, scarcely knowing whether she oughtto feel angry or curious at the girl's remark."Because you are so good-looking," replied the girl, with alaugh. "1 haven't been here six months, yet during thattime madame has had no less than twenty companions.' Thegood-looking ones never stayed the first week out, the youngladies made it so uncomfortable for them. The young ladiesof this house are Tartars-that's what they are!"Of course it was not right to stand there and encourage theservant to gossip. Theo knew this, and turned away withouta reply; but Sara was not to be put off so."1 thought I'd give you a piece of advice, miss," she wenton, confidentially, "whether you thank me for it or not-forr;gje-=d               .~~~~~~~'<pb n="97"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A }AI L VACE.            97it will put you on your guard-and that is, look out forColonel West. He's a young man that often visits here;and if he should chance to meet you in the grounds and makethe remark, 'Who is that pretty young girl?' -you'd get yourwalking-papers at once. Now mind, I'm telling you to putyou on your guard. ""Thank you," replied Theo. "I shall remember whatyou have said, and take good care to keep out of ColonelWest's way."After luncheon Theo was called to Mrs. Culver's boudoir."Did you ever design a ball costume, Miss Lester?" sheasked. " My daughters are in quite a dilemma over theirs.Each has been presented with a new pale-green silk of exactlythe same shade. As you see, one is a brunette, the other ablonde. Can you assist me in deciding how we can arrangethem both to look becoming?"" It is a beautiful shade of green," replied Theo. " MissIsabel's dark beauty would be greatly enhanced by an over-dress of rose-pink lace, caught up here and there with shininggems. Your other daughter, according to my taste, wouldlook best with simple garnitures of white lace and pearls,"Both girls looked up in pleased surprise, their angry browsclearing. If their mother's companion could design costumeslike these for them, she was' worth keeping, even if she waspretty. They could keep her well out of sight; no one wouldsee her, and all would be well." I should not like Colonel West to see her," said Isabel."Nor should I like handsome Harry Strathmore to seeher," returned Iris, flushing."What is Harry Strathmore to you?" sneered Isabel."Doesn't everybody who knows him know that he was headand ears in love with that Violet Kensington, and that theywere as good as engaged long before his father died?""Then why don't he marry her, if he thinks so much of heras you would have me believe?" cried Iris. " He is his ownmaster; he has only himself to please. I tell you, Isabel,"she went on, excitedly, " if there ever was an engagement be-tween them, it was broken off when he started for Europe,otherwise he would have taken her with him as his bride."" What makes you think so?" asked Isabel.The answer to Isabel's question never left iris's lips; for,glancing up, she saw Theo, the new companion, standing,pale and white and trembling, on the threshold, looking at herwith frightened eyes.4                        ' <pb n="98"/>I9          ALt SOR LOVE OP A FAIR FACd.CHAPTER XXII.THEO had caught just two words of that conversation" Harry Strathmore."  The name fell upon Theo's ears likan electric shock. Was she awake or was she dreaming?INo, no; it must have been a mistake," she thought^      "My ears deceived me. The murmuring branches of thchestnut-trees, the song of the birds, and the musical ripple othe brooklet seem to murmur forever the name of my loslove. "Iris Culver gave a guilty start."How long have you been standing there, Miss Lester?'*           ,~she asked. "You should have knocked-given us an intimation of your presence," and her paleface glowed with haughtdispleasure."' The door was open; I did not see that the room was occupied until I had crossed the threshold," replied Theo../ " I am glad to know that you were not eavesdropping, MiLester," and she turned away without a glance at the whitf face of the girl she had wounded so cruelly and unnecessarily." Shall you take Miss Lester to the ball to-night?" askeIris, when Theo had quitted the pink-and-gold boudoir wherthe sisters sat. " Of course it would be an awful risk, but wishall need her so badly to rearrange the drapings of ou'    dresses after we get there; and it is quite the fashion now-borrowed from the English custom, 1 suppose-to take one'scompanion with one to places of this kind, to look after one'toilet.""I suppose I shall have to take her," returned Isabel;" and I am angry enough at being compelled to do so. ItColonel West, who is a beauty-worshiper, were to see her,-there's no knowing what might happen."i  Theo's heart gave a great throb of delight when she was in-formed that she was to accompany the Misses Culver to thegrand ball. Thee had never been to a ball in all her life; sheiihad seen no gayety whatever, except that few months of hersojourn at Strathmore Hall, and that had been of the quietestkind, owing to the major's long illness. Therefore, a ball, thefirst she had ever seen, was an event in the girl's life. True,:I  she was not permitted to enter the ball-room, but she was toview the guests from the grand stairway as they passed into-f the supper-room.A room had been set apart for the use of the maids who,     ..]i~<pb n="99"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.                99 ad come to assist their mistresses with their toilets.  Theseoung persons preferred gossiping with each other to observinghe guests, so Theo stood alone in that vast assemblage, look-ng wistfully down upon the gay throng from her nook amidhe roses on the staircase. For the first time in her life something like rebellion against  .er fate rose in her heart. Hitherto she had never dreamed    :hat such passionate longings slept in her soul. The girl felt,s though she stood outside the gates of paradise.  She heard  'he delicious dance-music as the band played the witching trains of " Dream Faces," dainty feet keeping time to it. Theo longed and listened until it was time for the banquet,nd then she took up her station behind the great statue ofVenus with the group of crimson flowers.Ah, what a picture it made!-beautiful faces, flashingewels, the gleam of satins and silks, tall men and laughing,air-faced women. How the light fell on them! how thewarm, perfumed air stirred gently as they passed! To be onef those, to share in the light, the fragrance, the jewels, theilvery laughter, to see the handsome faces of the men brightenat her smile, to know their hands trembled at her touch-ah, Ihat was life!There was never a girl more disconsolate than herself. ThePeri who stood outside of the locked gates of paradise wastsurely not more desolate. In all that crowd of girlish faces there was none so fair asher own. Theo had seen Isabel Culver, gorgeous in her rose-lace, green silk and flaming jewels pass by, leaning upon the;arm of a tall, handsome, military-looking young man, andshe knew that he must be Colonel West.Theo was quite unsophisticated, yet even she could see thatit was Isabel who was in love with Colonel West, instead of'the gallant colonel being in love with her.So they passed on-the beautiful women and brave men, thelight of the jewels, the sheen of the satin dresses, and thefragrant odor of the roses they wore-passed on to the supper- room, leaving Theo alone-alone with her passionate heart onfire. Was it right, was it just that she should be so near yetso far?  Her warm, sensitive, pleasure-seeking nature wasaroused; her heart was still beating to the echo of that dreamymusic. Why, oh, why was she shut out from all this?She stood on the large landing that was covered with crim-: Eon velvet; below her was a sea of warm, bright light; aboveher the walls covered with pictures, and the cold, unsympa-thetic statuary in the alcoves about her.I                                                        .         '<pb n="100"/>K &i 100          ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.A large mirror was in one of the panels of the wall. Theostole softly, wistfully up to it, gazed in its depths, then a lit-tle sobbing laugh fell from her crimson lips." My face is as fair as any of them," she sighed.  "Yet Imight have been very plain or very ugly for all the good itdoes me. No one cares for me, I am alone in this great coldworld."She turned away from the gilded mirror with a sigh, turnedfrom the reflection of the lovely fresh young face, the scarletlips, cheeks with soft pearly bloom, dark, wondrous eyes andregal little head crowned with masses of nut-brown wavinghair.Who cared whether a poor little paid companion was prettyor not.Then from the window near where she stood she saw themoonlight lying clear and white on the grounds outside, cast-ing quaint shadows on the grass and on a silvery miniaturelake.The branches of the trees seemed like giant hands wavingto her to come out among them, the graceful, mystical weirdshadows had a strange attraction for her. Her heart wasbeating; the thrill of music had passed like the fire of feverthrough her v'ins."I will go out," she said, "that will cool my head andbring me to my senses.''There was no one to see her or notice what she did; and,unobserved, she passed out of the side door that led into thegardens, and sat down on a rustic bench by the miniature sil-ver lake bordered by waving ferns.Again she heard the sweet dance-music floating through thenight air. Theo felt alone-so terribly alone; it seemed won-derful to her that, within so short a distance, girls of her ownage were enjoying themselves, were laughing happily, followedby admiring glances and whispered, tender words.Suddenly voices sounded on her ears, and turning hastilyaround Theo saw two figures approaching the spot where shesat, and at a glance she saw that they were Isabel Culver andColonel West.They stopped beneath the drooping branches of a lemon-tree-so near the spot where Theo sat she could not help buthear the words that fell from their lips.It was impossible to leave, for they stood directly in thepath, cutting off her retreat; so Theo shrunk back still fur-ther into the shadow of the palms, waiting until they should go.For a moment Isabel C0ujver and her companion stood by.|,-<pb n="101"/>^." - -     AALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.          0'the little lake, lying so still and silvery white in the moonlight,-without uttering a word."It is a lovely night," murmured Isabel.

Her  Xheart beat with a throbbing sense of triumph. She knew      ;what was coming; the next words that would leave the lips ofthe handsome millionaire colonel would be, "Will you be my wife, Isabel?"                                  .She was dying to end the suspense; but she must not say  ;:' Yes " too quickly, lest he might think her too easily won.  :-She had always heard that men are more anxious to win those '?--i*whom they are not sure they can get.                   :What a triumph was in store for her!

A fair face that had flashed acrosshis path like a meteor had changed the current of two lives!CHAPTER XXIII.THE strange brooding silence deepened; the leaves of thelemon-tree stirred in the night wind; the subtle odor of thelaburnum blossoms seemed to rise up and infold the two whostood silently by the fountain, but the sentence, half spokenand so suddenly broken off, was never finished.The strange silence grew irksome to Isabel Culver.  Why.  did he not finish the sweet sentence that he had brought her!   out there among the odorous flowers and the moonlight tolisten to? Why did he look away over the distant hills withsuch a strange expression on his face?How was she to know that in a single instant his heart," the inconstant heart of man," had swerved from its course,and for a fair face that had crossed his path at the very mo-t  ment the words were on his lips?Isabel Culver was not a girl to lose an offer of marriagethus easily. Had he changed his mind, and that, too, whenthe all-important words were half uttered?  It must be so.It was a situation that called for immediate action.  Isabelwas equal to the emergency. There must be no coy hesitancynow, or the handsome millionaire would slip through herfingers._ "It is chilly out here," stammered the colonel.  "Shallwe go back again into the ball-room?"" No, it is too pleasant here," murmured Isabel.  "Thememory of this beautiful night will linger in my mind for-ever."He laughed uneasily-a way he had when he did not knowexactly what answer to make." But I interrupted you," she breathed, softly, and with anattempt at coyness.

He had     .changed his mind about asking her to marry him. Yet he -:.!must get out of it some way.                           . ^" Ah, pardon me, Miss Isabel," he said. "When the words: were half uttered, a sudden conviction came to me that what. ,?JI intended to ask for might not please you. It might look like monopolizing your agreesble society if I asked you if youwould share the pleasure of the next waltz with me."   . Something very like a hysterical scream broke from Isabel  :Culver's distorted lips. She knew quite as well as he did that ' -ihe had turned off the proposal with skillful adroitness. Yet':-it had come upon her so suddenly in the very moment of her  : --triumph that it dazed her. She could not comprehend that-.she had lost him. The thought was maddening. " Are you quite sure that was the question you intended-. -:asking me?" she said, breathlessly, with white, parched lips.-; ^-" What has our conversation, the loneliness of a bachelor's life -.'!:and this longing for home ties, to do with the next dance?" " Dances and bachelors' lives are identical," he said, blush-::ing uneasily under her steady, breathless gaze. " There r is:nothing in the world more pleasing to me than a waltz with i?/-you, Miss Culver-pardon me for saying so. Yet the truth-.ishould never be looked upon as flattery. Your waltzing is the:-poetry of motion," and he bowed low over the hand that lay .-trembling on his arm in order to hide his confusion. ; , .--In that moment Isabel knew well that she had lost him, but '-9='she knew not what had come between her and a fortune.Without waiting for a reply to his words the colonel drew: r:?~Isabel's white trembling hand through his arm and moved: ;i-:hastily forward toward the grand hall again."I will take her back to the ball-room, then come back and :-.:find out for myself who that divine face belongs to," he told : !?himself.And, bitterly chagrined, Isabel Culver was obliged to per-.mit him to lead her back to the glittering ball-room with the.-:words unuttered that would have made her the handsonme-.,e:millionaire's betrothed.The colonel was secretly delighted when a partner Came-;lurequesting the pleasure of dancing the lancers with Isabel. -' I shall take the opportunity of enjoying a cigar, 'hefcolonel Whispered.

Surely the beautiful vision had not vanishedso soon.With hurried steps he walked down the laburnum-borderedpath to the fountain again and there he saw the object of hissearch-a young girl with a face like a Clytie and a slender,lissom form seated on a rustic bench among the lemon spraysand crimson roses.Her face was turned toward him and he saw at a glance thatit was more gloriously beautiful than he had at first supposedit to be; oval in contour with a low brow and dark eyes, red, tcoral lips, eyes full of veiled fire, dark, stormy, and passion-ate; not the face of a commonplace girl; not a face with acommon story in it. Looking at it, one felt sure to such a onethere would fall no ordinary fate.Her scarf was entangled in the branches. She was tryingto extricate it.Theo uttered a little cry as the tall figure stepped out of themoonlight and stopped before her, bowing profoundly."Will you permit me to assist you, miss?" he said. "1am taller than you. Rather than destroy this bit of lace wemust break the branch that has entangled it," and withoutwaiting for a reply he took the filmy scarf from Theo's handand commenced to unwind it from among the branches wherethe sportive breeze had tossed and held one end of it captive."Man makes his own opportunities or mars them," thehandsome, dashing colonel said to himself.  "This is mine,and I will make it. "There was no blush, no flutter of gratified vanity, no at-tempt at the least flirtation as Thee handed him the other endof the scarf.It was only natural that he should pretend to find that taskof extricating the filmsy bit of lace from its entanglement moredifficult than it really was." I thank you, sir," she said as he handed it to her at lastwith another low bow and turned to go." Do not go just yet," exclaimed the colonel. "You wereout here enjoying the calm beauty of the night. Do not letme frighten you away. I would rather leave you at once thanprevent you from enjoying  it.n I am not frightened'" said the girl, sloly; "  but I mustgo into the house." "You have not been dancing this evening; I have not seenyou in the ball-room." Then he looked at her dress, so plainl efihe  o  wy  ol rte eteyua  neta<pb n="105"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.        ,   10d simple-dotted Swiss muslin-and it occurred to him that -I-e was not in ball-room attire; she could hardly be a visitor.  2Pardon my curiosity, but are you visiting here?" he asked. : -:¥How is it you are not in the ball-room enjoying yourself like o  :e rest of the young ladies in yonder?"Theo laughed, and he, the experienced man of the world,  ' istinguished something very like a sob in it.   .         :-"1 am not a visitor, I am not an invited guest at the ball; am Mrs. Culver's companion; I am here to help her daugh- rs with their dresses. I am Theo Lester."The colonel was too well-bred to utter the exclamation ofrprise that rose to his lips. Only a companion, this beauti-, graceful girl! Was there ever a queen more graceful or ore dainty?  He knew in an instant why Mrs. Culver's ---aughters had not allowed her to enter the ball-room: she wasy far too lovely; they could tell that their mother's compan- would outshine them."You would like to dance?" he asked, twirling his .;-ustache thoughtfully with his white fingers."Ah, yes, so much!" sighed Theo. It was hard to be     :ut out from the brightness and music when one's whole soul  ~?;nged for it.The handsome colonel laughed. Balls, dancing attendancepon pretty girls, and all amusements in general were begin- iing to pall upon him; he was surfeited. The enthusiasm in  ->-er voice amused him greatly."What if I were able to gratify that intense longing, Miss.ester?" he said, laughingly.  "I think I can manage it if   !ou do not prove yourself too timid to consent to my plan."Theo looked up into the smiling face in wonder. What '.iould he mean?" The hostess is my aunt," he explained; "therefore I am  -hat may be termed a privileged person here. So, if you wisho dance, you shall. They are playing a waltz now. You     :?:all be my partner. Come, Miss Lester. " Theo drew back."  thank you for your kindness, but I-I would not dareo go into the ball-room with you.

" If they say nything about it, just refer them to me.'

"I am ofily a paid dependent.  I wereto offend the young ladies, it would cost me my position."" There are always much better ones to be found," he re,turned, quickly, looking with intense admiration down at thebeautiful face on which the moonlight fell." No," said Thee, " 1 must refuse your kind offer; I muststay here."" Then, in the language of Ruth, 'here will I stay also,'"returned the colonel. "I would rather stay out here amongthe roses than go back to the ball-room. Can you guesswhy?"I can guess why!" cried a voice fairly convulsed with ragebehind them. The next moment Isabel Culver confrontedthem.CHAPTER XXIV.I the scene had not been so terrible in its tragic intensity,it would certainly have been ludicrous: the white, startledface of Theo, as she stood there trembling beneath the fierce,scornful gaze of Isabel Culver; the colonel, in his faultlessevening dress, looking from the one to the other in somethinglike amusement."I can guess why you find it so pleasant to remain out inthe gardens," repeated Isabel, her voice fairly quivering withwrath. " Colonel West is not the man to lose the opportunityof a flirtation, even though it be with a paid companion. ""Miss Culver," cried the colonel, flushing hotly, "youforget yourself! You have no right to pry upon my actions,much less question me in regard to them. Please allow me toescort you back to the ball-room," he said, with icy politeness.Isabel Culver knew better than to discharge poor Theo onthe spot, much as she would have liked doing so. She waswise enough to see how such a scene would end."I shall expect you to go home at once," she said in anunder-tone barely audible to Theo's ears; then turning andgathering her silken skirts over her white arm, she walkedback to the house with Colonel West.s  "I-I could kill him if he gave me up-for her," was thethought that rankled bitterly in her heart, and her rageagainst Thso knew no bounds.When Thee found herself alone she sat down on the gardenbench again, giving vent to her distress in a flood of tears.Ah! what had she done that Heaven should show her so littlemercy? She knew quite well what to expect: on the morrow<pb n="107"/>At rOR LOVE of A o       AT  ti   . -           - AMrs. Culver would tell her that her services were no long ier' required; then she would be obliged in truth to face the cold,'""cruel world.During the drive homeward after the ball there was an-s^'ominous silence between Mrs. Culver and Theo. Isabel had'c -1flown to her mother at once with her story of the startling -'iscene she had just witnessed-Colonel West flirting in the-garden with their companion, Miss Lester.Mrs. Culver looked up anxiously into her daughter's flushed,excited face." I certainly agree with you, my dear, that Miss Lester- ' -'must be got rid of at once, but I seriously question the advisa-' bility of discharging her to-night," exclaimed the old lady,: folding her jeweled hands in her lap."But you must do it, mamma!" stormed the enraged         '-beauty, stamping her white-slippered foot vehemently.  "I tell you that girl has come between me and a fortune. If you  -'don't send her away at once, this very night, I shall not be W'accountable for my actions!". -"' Don't let your jealousy run away with your reason," re- 'torted her mother.  " Have you not sense enough to see that'--:she would go to Colonel West for sympathy? and that when a ::- :iman sees a pretty girl in tears and distress, and knows that he, - is the cause of it, his heart is touched as nothing else in the:-world could touch it? and, nine times out of ten, he will pro-;?pose marriage on the-instant.  No, no; it would never do at  Or~all to discharge Miss Lester now. Besides, I have a much -:better plan than that. Hush! hear me through," she said, as 'Isabel was about to interrupt her.  " We will take her rto-Florida with us, as we proposed to do; and, once there, we'-<=will rid ourselves of her. We could take no better way of- -'putting distance between this girl and the colonel." Angry as Isabel Culver was, she realized that her mother's plan was best-decidedly best. Thus it happened that Theo ^;.did not receive the notice of dismissal which she had so dreaded. and feared. The next day the entire party were en route to Florida. -'Two days later they had reached their destination at CedarKeys, and here, to Theo's dismay, she was told that her -services were no longer needed. Alone, and in a land of strangers, what fate could have been-/more pitiful?

This suspicion grew into acertainty, however, when Mrs. Culver coldly refused her arecommendation."You do not. vou can not think, madame, that 1 knowaught of Miss Isabel's lost diamond!" she exclaimed, with a-  piteous quiver in her sweet voice. " Surely you can not wrongme by a thought as cruel as that.""No matter what 1 think," responded Mrs. Culver,haughtily. " You have no right to question me upon thatpoint. I simply refuse to recommend you, no matter why;;and 1 do not thank Mrs. Winfield for sending you to me. Lshall tell her so upon the first opportunity," and she turned'to her novel again, indicating that the painful interview wasover; and, blinded by tears and sick at heart, Theo quittedthe villa among the orange-trees, and once more faced theworld in search of employment.She sat down upon the bank of a purling stream to think.She was dazed, bewildered, utterly miserable. Which wayshould she turn? where should she go?Women who have never had such an experience, neverknown such a dark moment, should be thankful to God forit.   Those whe know the dark horror compressed in thewords, " Thrown out of a situation," can sympathize withpoor, heart-broken, beautiful Theo as she sat there trying tothink over the matter coolly, calmly, under the white blos-soms.How long she sat there she never knew. A swift stepstartled her. A white, jeweled hand thrust aside the over-hanging branches, and a young girl stepped into the leafyglen where Theo sat-a young girl with a death-white face,,deep violet,, wistful eyes, and pale-gold hair.Theo recognized her at once as a young invalid lady whomshe had seen stopping at the hotel as their party hd passedLthrough Cedar Keys. She had heard them call her FlorenceVale.She remembered Theo, and held out her little white handwith a faint smile.You have invaded my retreat," she said. " Yet I do notonder at it-a more charming spot could not be found.

A dShe had spoken more to herself than to Theo; it did not  ioccur to her that the girl had heard her. " Tell me who you are," she said, turning abruptly to Theo. " They call you Miss Lester, do they not?"" Yes," responded Theo.Suddenly her companion gave a little terrified cry, grasping  :Theo's arm.t Do you hear that noise?" she gasped; "listen, Miss Les- ter, and see if you can hear it, too, it is like-like-the wail-  i ing cry of a little child; don't you hear it, Miss Lester?" "N'o," replied Theo, "it is only the wind stirring the branches of the trees. We are going to have a storm, I    Ithink." She struck her hands together with a passionate cry.   '^" You surely must hear those cries? The feeble cries of a  ' 'very little child?" she gasped. "Some one must have left a .little child here among the trees," she wailed. " Don't you - -:hear its plaintive sobbing voice?""No,   replied Theo, "it is your fancy. I can not hear a  ";:,sound; even the wind is still-it is the hush that always pre- :-cedes the storm."Still Florence Vale clung to Theo's hand with wild distended '  E.7eyes, and hands cold and clammy. "Walk back with me to the hotel, Miss Lester," she said.  - ':"I-I-am :afraid to go through the lonely orange grove .l  Ialone.

Those wailing cries would drive me mad.Theeo clasped the cold hands of Florence Vale in her own,and together they walked through the myrtle and orange-    egroves back to the hotel.                                 -" Thank you," replied Florence Vale, " you have been kind to come with me. !f vou were not Mrs. Culver's companionI should pray you to be  line.

" Remember, I haveno reference to offer you.""I am not here with my father," sighed Florence Vale."I am here with-my-my-husband and my old nurse. Myhusband never interferes in what I do," she added, bitterly,"it would be nothing to him-less than nothing."" Then I will come this very hour to you-now," repliedTheo.Thus it was that her life became linked with the tragic lifeof beautiful unhappy Florence Vale.CHAPTER XXV.FLORENCE VALE had been missed at the hotel, and it waswith the greatest relief her nurse saw the flutter of her whitedress among the green trees, as she slowly approached thehouse leaning on Theo's arm.A shade of annoyance passed over the woman's face whenFlorence explained to her that she had secured Theo as acompanion. She cast one glance at Theo's face, then turneduneasily toward the window gazingfthoughtfully out."It will end in the old way," muttered Janet Graham."Florence ought to have known better. I have no patiencewith her."When Theo went to her own room, Janet Graham followedher there."You must not think strange of anything you may see orhear, Miss Lester," she said. " Remember there are myster-ies, secrets in every family; this is no exception. Be as gentlewith poor Florence as you can. She is an invalid, you know.She has strange fancies. It would be well to pay no attentionor attach any importance to them."" 1 shall remember what you have told me, Mrs. Graham,"said Theo, quietly."..  That afternoon Theo gained a faint idea of what the oldnurse meant. She was sitting in the bay-window reading abook of poems to Florence Vale, as she insisted upon beingcalled, when the sound of footsteps in the corridor withoutfell upon their ears.<pb n="111"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A     iuFA PAc  .      1* lorece Vale started.

Arthurshould have known better; he was twenty-five, she was onlysixteen." One might as well have thought of caging a humming.--    bird, or fettering with silken cords a bright-winged butterfly;she was too young for a wife. Matters went on smoothlyenough for a year or more until baby Coral was born, theneverything went all wrong. Poor Florence was too young tounderstand the care and responsibility of the little one." The heart of handsome Arthur Vale was wrapped up inthat little child. In vain he remonstrated with Florence aboutleaving it with nurses. ' You can not give up parties and ballsfor your child's sake, Florence. I believe you would be gladif the child would die, it seems a burden to you,' he would cryout bitterly, but Florence always danced from the room payinglittle heed to the words." Indeed, she always handled the little one in an awkward,   sort of manner; much as a girl handles her first doll. PoorFlorence could not give up her love for balls, and the tragedyof her life came about through the agency of a ball." It was to be a grand affair, the elite of the country wereto be present, and poor Florence had set her heart upon going,but at the last moment, just as the coach drove up to the door,baby was taken sick. She thought it was but a trifling cold,and the nurse knew a thousand times better what to do for itthan she did, so she left it in her care, promising to returnearly." But the hours flew by amid the lights and the music, andpoor Florence danced on into the ' wee sma' hours,' quite for-getting the dull cares of life and home.  Remember howyoung and thoughtless she was before you condemn her, MissLester." It was morning when Florence returned from  the ball,her bonny blue eyes sparkling brighter than the diamondsshe wore upon her white throat."' What was it that cast such a gloom over the house,' she, wondered, vaguely, as she tripped tip the stairs. At the door<--  of little Coral's room she stopped involuntarily; was it a sobshe heard, or was it only her fancy?  Then she rememberedhat the baby was ill and she had promised to come homeearly from the ball." Her heart smote her with a strange chill, she could notI f [L ...-  ' ,<pb n="113"/>ALL FOR LOVE.

The sight;that met her gaze rooted her to the spot."Arthur Vale knelt by the couch clasping one of little' Coral's waxen hands in his, weeping as men weep but once in- ,J--a life-time. In an instant it flashed through poor hapless.:Florence's dazed brain what had happened: pretty little Coral '.  ~ was dead!" Through his sobs Arthur Vale heard her footsteps, andturned upon her as she entered the door in all her ball-room   .finery-turned upon her, fierce anger flaming in his eyes, and  -he shook off the white hand that she had laid upon his arm in  ;piteous entreaty as though it had been a viper." ' So you are come from the ball at last!' he cried, in avoice so stern and altered she shrunk from him in terror. 'So  :you have danced away the hours, frittered them away in idlecompliments and flattery, while our child lay dying!'       ;i" 'Dying-dead!' gasped poor Florence, making an effort   q? to reach the lace-embowered crib where the tiny waxen form  :reposed; but Arthur Vale thrust her back with a fierce im-precation." ' You shall not look upon the child you have murdered!'  -he cried: ' for it is no less than that in the sight of Heaven; ;it is the right name for it.'                              --f; "'Arthur!' cried the miserable young wife, utterly pros- --trated by her great grief; 'you frighten me, you terrify me!  -- Little Coral is not dead; she is sleeping. If she had been so "_ ill, you would have had a doctor.' " The harshest laugh ever a man uttered fell from his lips." 'A doctor!' he cried.

Again that horrible laugh fell from his lips."' Never in his life would he take her in his arms again,'he answered; 'all was over between them. He should nevert     kiss her face again. A grave lay between them. Even thebitterness of death could not bridge over the yawning gulf thatseparated them. Although they lived under the same roof,she should never be wife to him more. She was never tospeak to him. They were to be further apart than strangers.Either that or part forever.'" She looked up at him with hopeless despair shining in herviolet eyes."' Arthur,' she sobbed in broken gasps, ' the sentence you-    have passed upon me is worse than death to me, but I acceptit rather than to part from you; that would kill me. Let mekiss my little child just once, Arthur; my heart is breaking.'"'Heart!' he echoed; 'you have no heart. A woman, Ai   who can go to a ball, and leave a little sick child at home, is;  utterly heartless. Would to Heaven you had a heart, for thenyou might feel sorry for what you have done. Little Coral'sfate lies at your door. Her death might have been avertedhad you stayed away from the ball.'"From that day to this Arthur Vale has steadily kept histerrible vow.

" She has robbed me of allthat life holds dear; she has won the love that would havemade this dreary world a paradise for me. Heaven keep mefrom hating her."There was to be a grand lawn fete, ending in a grand ball,to be held at the Vale mansion on the Heights, and Theo wasto be the principal attraction, as Florence Vale laughinglydeclared. The elite of the two great cities were to be present,yet this did not influence Theo to take more than the usualpains with her toilet."Quite a number of notables are to be present, among themsome one whom you know," Mrs. Vale continued; "but I; shall withhold the name from you until the last minute, tomake the surprise more complete."Theo smiled, but did not question her as to the name."You will be happy to-night, Florence," she said. " Yourhusband can not hold out against your sweet entreaties andearnest prayers much longer."Florence Vale sighed. It was a great point gained, winninghis consent to give the ball; but his opening the ball bydancing the first set with her was a matter of etiquette, notinclination, she well knew." Yes, it will be a happy evening for me," said Florence.She knew that for a few short moments she would rest inArthur Vale's arms the face that for four long, weary yearshad been turned so haughtily from her, with bitter, angryscorn stamped upon it, would bend above her own to-nightwith a smile upon it, that their guests might not know uponi'  what footing they stood.

No wonder her face was flushed with keen antici-. nation, and her violet eyes shone with a bright, unnatural  *tight. Those few moments would be heaven to poor Florence .Vale.                                                    -<" Ah, how can he help loving her?" Theo thought as she =Ialooked at her an hour later, radiant in shimmering pink silk  ' .i/and diamonds. She looked like a fairy, while Theo herself -: looked like a tall, stately lily in her dress of soft, white,,creamy lace, caught here and there with simple clusters of wood violets, and the same flowers in the meshes of her goldenlhair. If the girl had but dreamed that this was to be theturning-point of her future, that after to-night the calm ofher life would be broken, she would not have entered the ball-room so thoughtlessly.Suitors gathered around her, eager for one word, a glance,or a smile. Young girls envied her, and the young gentlemen  :-Iadored her. They raved over her glorious beauty, and Theoe enjoyed their worship. " Now, my dear," cried Florence, coming up to her, 'hereare some old friends who can hardly wait for the opportunity- '::of finding you disengaged for a moment," and, turning hastily y  '-slaround, Theo was almost overjoyed to find herself face to face  - iwith Senator Winfield and his wife. In another part of the ball-room  two gentlemen stood 'owatching the lovely flushed face as Theo turned to greet the :-jWinfields with trembling, outstretched hands. The gentle- :-:men were Colonel West and Harry Strathmore. "You ask who that tall, lovely young girl is," cried the .i,colonel, " and I do not know in what words I should answer - .you. Her name is Miss Lester; she is the rage of the metrop-  ::-,;olis-the most beautiful girl the sun ever shone upon!

' - The colonel sighed."Yes, I looked, into them once," he replied, " and I feltdazed, dazzled, bewildered-much like the eagle that lookedtoo long at the sun. I looked into them, and I. was lost.That was over three years ago. From that time to this I havesearched for her, never finding her until to-night." It was certainly a case of love at first sight, said Harrytrathmore, laughing at his friend's enthusiasm. -If th<pb n="118"/>118     AtL FOR LOVE OF A itI tACe. tender passion would make me look as hopelessly wretched ayou look, I hope it will never come to me, my dear colonel.""'He jests at scars who never felt a wound," quoted Colonel West.And it occurred with amusement to Harry Strathmore that,although his friend had spoken so rapturously of the lovely\ ^      young girl standing beneath the palms yonder, he did notoffer to present him to her.Her profile was turned but partially toward him; he couldonly guess what her face was like-pretty and coquettish, nodoubt, like the faces of thousands of pretty girls.Harry Strathmore was too cynical, too much a man of theworld, to give her another thought.Yet, in circling the grand ball-room a few moments later inthe waltz with Florence Vale, he suddenly found himself faceto face with her.At first he was incredulous, thinking some beautiful picturehad stepped from its frame. Then he looked again-and henever forgot that picture while he lived.There was a beautiful overhanging plant, green, with richred flowers drooping from it, that formed a natural arch, andshe was standing underneath it. He did not see the man towhom she was speaking; he did not think of him.   Everysense, every thought, was engrossed in her."Of whose face did she remind him so strangely?" heasked himself. There was something almost familiar in theslender figure, every line and curve of which was full ofgrace.Yet he owned to himself he had never beheld such a lovelygirl. He began to understand what the colonel had meantwhen he said, " When men look at her their hearts go fromthem-they are lost."  Harry Strathmore quite forgot he wasstaring at her, he was so completely charmed and bewilderedby the lovely vision.Mrs. Winfield's voice aroused him. She had taken his arm." Oome with me, Harry, my dear nephew," she said; "Iwant to present you to Miss Lester.'"CHAPTER XXVII." COME, Harry, my dear nephew," repeated Mrs. Winfield,tapping the young man on the arm with her fan, " come, andallow me to present you to my friend, Miss Lester.

Where had he seen just such ;: a proud, crimson, sensitive mouth, and such brown, velvety .eyes?At that instant Theo turned her glance in their direction, :(--?and saw him approaching her hurriedly, Mrs. Winfield leaning -supon his arm.For a single instant the room seemed whirling around Theo: ; Iithe music, the lights, and the flowers seemed to clash together: and rock around her as she stood there face to face with Harry -Strathmore.                                           - Like a dream she heard Mrs. Winfield go through the -:-formula of the introduction. She heard Harry Strathmorare say, "I am happy to meet you, Miss Lester."  Then Mrs.-;:Winfield left them alone.Theo never remembered whether she made a reply or not. He had looked into her eyes, heard her voice, and had not, :recognized her; and she told herself, with a bitter smile, that _she would never betray her identity to him--never! He-,'should never know that she was the same Theo to whom he'* :had once-been bound by a death-bed betrothal-never! He:--:had been so glad to have the fetters that bound him broken.: Of course he was Violet's husband long since; he was, there-, lfore, nothing to her now-less than nothing-and, quite uneon-: I-sciously, her lovely face grew cold and haughty in its superb pride." Are you engaged for tho next waltz, Miss Lester?" he  iasked, taking the pearl-and-gold tablet from her hand.    iTheo drew back, her face paling; even her lips lost their :-color. Waltz with-him! ah, no! she could not. How could she feel his breath upon her cheek, the clasp ofhis strong arms around her, the beating of his heart, when Asheloved him so and knew that he was another's, and that he waijlost to her for evermore?"I should prefer dancing any other 4had a waltzs with Foyn  :Sr. Strathmore," she said.,            :I,;  :  X           ,  *                       ;;<pb n="120"/>120            ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.Harry Strathmore felt piqued. Any other young lady in'I - \  that grand, glittering ball-room would have been delighted to. have waltzed with Hlm, he well knew.May I put my name down for the next quadrille, then?"he asked, with charming grace; and as Thee could find noreasonable excuse for refusing him, she bowed a cold assent.To her horror she found it was, after all, a waltz-quadrille.She could not escape from him when they were out on the floortogether; she was obliged to go through the dance with him;yet Harry Strathmore could not help but notice how shelIl jd ] shrunk from the touch of his hand and the clasp of his arm.iP      " Why had this beautiful girl taken such an aversion to himat first sight?" he asked himself, in the deepest wonder; hecould not understand.That one waltz-quadrille undid the work of years. Theethought she had schooled her heart against him, but love wastot to be disciplined thus easily. Poor Theo realized that theTheo of twenty loved Harry Strathmore a thousand timesmore deeply than the Thee of seventeen had done. That wasa childish, beautiful love, this was the full, passionate strengthof a woman's love, the love that blesses or curses humanhearts.From that hour Harry Strathmore followed Theo about likea shadow. He took great care to place himself in every setwith her. If she strolled out on the balcony, on looking upshe was sure to find him near her; if she seated herself at thepiano in the grand drawing-room, she would find him at herside, ready to turn the music for her." Why is Violet, the wife for whom he deserted me, notwith him?" Theo asked herself; then she remembered that itwas not unusual for husbands to be seen at grand gatheringsunaccompanied by their wives. No doubt Violet had notchosen to come. " Why will he torture me with his soft, win-ning, melodious voice and his presence?" thought Theo, bit-terly.Theo had gone to the music-room to rest for a moment, ex-aesrng to lnd it quite deserted. A merry group of youngladies followed her there, laughingly declaring that Theewith a song.e the music-room without first favoring themwith a song.like something setimentala       ice song" said oneyoung girl, glancing up coyly into her lovely face."What shall it be" 'YY? it her lovely face.'What shall it be?" asked Theo, seating herself at thegrand piano and running her white sliem ingers over the ivorykeys.

In an instant the  |music ceased. Theo raised her eyes, meeting Harry Strath- -more's gaze bent full upon her face. Her voice failed her,  ,-the great chandelier above her head seemed to. suddenlydarken, shutting out from her gaze the faces around her, thewords of the song died on her lips, and she fell backward into : Harry Strathmore's arms in a dead faint.It was but the work of an instant to gather the slender fig- ure in his strong arms and bear her from the heated music  'room out into the fragrant coolness of the night-wind in thegarden.The young girls scattered in all directions in search of theirhostess, Florence Vale, while the young men hastily went insearch of a doctor.Thus it happened that for one brief moment Harry Strath-, .more found himself alone in the starlit fragrant garden clasp.ing the unconscious form in his strong arms.     .The beautiful golden head rested heavily against his shoul-der, the lovely white face-whiter than the petals of a l ily,5gs,  7 =,,             3;  ' 0  ,  '  ,  ".'  ='   t  a  t  = . - w t<pb n="122"/>l E   1    AILL FOR tOVE OF A FAIR    ACE.with the long curling lashes over the rounded cheeks, lay1against his throbbing breast.Harry Strathmore was not a marble statue, he was onlyhuman with a warm, passionate, impulsive heart beating inhis breast.Can you wonder that he clasped the slender form close tohis throbbing heart, murmuring:" My beautiful darling! how sweet and lovely you are!"'The next instant he had bent his handsome head and kissedthe lovely mouth.At that instant Theo opened her eyes.iCHAPTER    XXVIII.THEO struggled from the clasp of Harry Strathmore's armswith a cry of dismay, looking around her in bewilderment." You fainted in the music-room, Miss Lester," explainedHarry Strathmore, " and I brought you out into the cool airwhile the rest went in search of the hostess and a doctor. Youare better now I hope?""Thank you-yes, I am better; the room was too warmfor me, I remember," returned Theo, quickly.|-I       At that instant Florence Vale came flying breathlessly downthe rose-bordered path." Why, my dear," she cried, clasping Thee in her arms-"what a scare you have given me! What caused you tofaint?". Again Thee murmured something about "the heat of theroom;" but Florence Vale, looking keenly into her face, knewthat it was not the heat.Ere the doctor who had been summoned made his appear-ance, Theo had returned to her anxious friends in the ball-room, and the festivities of the evening went on as before." 1 must control myself better than this," Thee thought."The sound of his voice-the touch of his hand-one glancefrom his eyes must not agitate me so." It seemed to the girlthat the whole world must read her secret.Mrs. Winfield was too wise to mention her nephew's nameto Thee, lest she should remember how earnestly she hadstriven to make a match between them three years before, and- Theo was too proud to ask Mrs. Winfield about Violet. Theehad been too confused to notice that Mrs. Winfield had intro-duced Harry Strathmore as her nephew. She believed him afriend-nothing more.Theo was still under the delusion that young Dr. Melville:I    _ .' s; -'T_  r<pb n="123"/>Hi*  ^     ALL FOR LOVE OF A PAIR FLf Rosecliff was the one referred to when Mrs. Winfield me -ioned  her nephew."           .    . A week later the Vales took up their summer quartersa'he Oriental Hotel, Manhattan Beach.

Why should she fearhim?That afternoon when Harry Strathmore joined a group ofyoung girls on the sea-shore, among whom  was Theo, henoticed with a thrill of pleasure that she did not turn andwalk abruptly away as usual, and he flattered himself that shewas beginning to look more kindly upon his patient devotion.The group of chattering young girls made way for him.He flung himself down on the white beach at Theo's feet, butthe graceful, golden head after a slight inclination was turnedproudly away from the face gazing up into her own." I want you to settle a dispute for us, if you will, Mr.Strathmore," said a bewitching little blonde, laying a littlemite of a white hand in a half-careless half-caressing way onhis arm. " I am trying to induce these timid girls to take adip in the sea with me. I have Miss Lester half persuadedalready.  If she goes the rest will follow; now add yourentreaties to mine and tell them the sea will be delightful thisterribly warm afternoon."Harry Strathmore looked up in swift alarm." I think Miss Lester is quite right in hesitating to trust the,water to-day. There is danger in its wooing. Do you see how,high the breakers dash on the shore? I have been told it be-tokens a swift, treacherous under-current.""Oh, how cruel of you, Mr. Strathmore, to say that," pout-ed the little blonde belle, who was quite an expert swimmeramong the breakers and longed to show her dexterity in bat-tling with the huge waves; " of course your opinion will decideMiss Lester, and my eloquent arguing of an hour's durationhas all been in vain."" I think not," returned Theo, very quietly; " 1 have madeup my mind to go into the surf with you."The little blonde belle looked delighted; Harry Strathmorelooked annoyed."Why do you wish to court danger, Miss Lester?" heasked, in a low voice. "You can see for yourself how heavythe sea is. I beg of you do not be tempted into the surf."Theo crested her beautiful golden head, looking down athim with cold, proud eyes; she would have gone now even ifdeath itself stared her in the face." You will promise that you will not go, Miss Lester?" hepleaded, eagerly."Why do you take so much interest in this matter?" askedTheo, sharply.The words: " Because I love you so madly," sprung to hit_ifM. *- '.?» ^S.      .    -    .     t    o     -   -         3<pb n="125"/>.ALL FOR LOVE OP A PAI      A FPAt,     7I--is, but he forced them back-this was neither the time norl; -tIace to utter them.He smiled, and a tender look came into his fine blue eyes. rs-"."Would I not stretch out hands to sare a rash child from ushing headlong into danger? or turn aside from its course a& --ird that was seemingly benit upon fluttering straight into a  'a   Blap?

Harry Strathmore could not tell ',hether she meant to heed his warning or not. A half hour later as he paced the veranda of the Oriental,  ioking out seaward he saw a group of bathers battling with  ihe breakers.His heart almost stood still; he recognized the foremost onepon whose golden head the sunlight fell: it was Miss Lester.How madly the white-capped waves dashed over the four oung girls who clung to the ropes with'their slender whiteands." They have found the water much too rough for them,ust as I told them," he muttered, strolling mechanicallyown the beach.Theo saw him coming toward them, and a reckless defiant ight flamed into her brown, flashing eyes." I will show him how little I think of his warning," she  ' ought, striking boldly out fully a rod ahead of--her com-, nions.It was a fatal move; all in an instant she realized it; the ' reat waves carried her far out of the reach of the protecting  '- 'opes, and in a single instant more the treacherous under-cur-  'nt dragged her down.Hoarse cries'echoed from hundreds of throats as the horri-  'ed spectators realized what had happened; before a life-boat  'uld be put out the girl would be swept out to' sea! But in that moment of horror a young man had torn off hisoat and sprung into the waves to her rescue.

Prayezwent up from women's hearts; men muttered, " God strength-    en his arm;" and through the moments that followed theywatched with bated breath, the intense silence broken only bythe loud, hoarse murmur of the breakers.Harry Strathmore was young and strong, and an expertswimmer, but the odds were fearfully against him. He struckout bravely for the shining mark that was drifting out soswiftly to sea."Courage! courage!" he shouted to her. "I will saveyou, or die with you!"J    Theo heard him, and the words infused her with new life.A moment later he turned and struck boldly for the shore,holding the form of the insensible girl.Five minutes later, midst lusty cheers and glad cries ofwomen, Harry Strathmore laid Thee down upon the whitesand of the beach among them.From that hour handsome Harry Strathmore, of Maryland,was the hero and idol of all the belles at Manhattan Beach,and the grand parlors of the Oriental were crowded with ladiesto catch one glimpse of the noble young man who had donesuch a heroic deed.i f::     It was a week before Theo was sufficiently recovered toventure down to the parlor to thank him for saving her life.It was evening; the chandeliers were lighted, throwing asoft, mellow light over the marble halls and vast parlors, andout upon the stretch of beach beyond, lying so white in theclear, bright starlight.Thee saw him out on the veranda, pacing to and fro, smok-ing a cigar.Silently she crossed the veranda and stood before him like8a vision, in her clinging dress of soft, fleecy white." I am come to thank you for what you have done for me,Mr. Strathmore," she said, with an unconscious flutter in hervoice, and extending both her hands. " I thank you so much,words will not express my great indebtedness! Why did youdo it? It might have cost you your own life-oh, why did youdo so much for me, Mr. Strathmore?"He took both her trembling hands.y We will walk down on the beach together, and I will tellyou why," he answered.How smooth the treacherous, smiling sea looked under thebrilliant starlight! How clear the silver moon looked, coylyhiding her sweet face behind the soft, white clouds, like ablushing bride behind her white veil!

'Her beautiful face was turned toward the water; her eyeswere filled with a soft, dreamy light.

The beautiful head drooped until it restedon his shoulder, as they stood on the white beach together,listening to the low, musical murmur of the waves, and he wasunutterably content.For one brief moment-five-ten-as they stood there, theyforgot the past, the future, remembering only the present-this sweet dream of love-such a beautiful, beautiful dream!He clasped her in his arms, murmuring how well he loved'    her-that sweet love-story of which young hearts never tire,and which grows sweeter each time it is repeated.flB  a   What would he say if he knew that she was Theo? she won-r   dered. It was strange that in that moment of supreme hap-piness she should forget that such a person as Violet hadever come between them-forget her very existence.In that moment of happiness Harry's mind had flown backto the dark rapids that murmured over the gray rocks thatskirted the terrace of Strathmore Hall, and to the white faceof that other one who had loved him-loved him so well thatshe had gone down to her death to sever the fetters of thatbetrothal that bound her to him.It was strange that in the presence of this beautiful girlwhom he had learned to love so passionately his mind alwayswent back regretfully to poor little Theo-sweet, pretty Theo.Not that there was anything in common between them. Theowas only a simple, loving school-girl with a dark, gypsy facecrowned in masses of brown locks. This beautiful, peerlesswoman was taller by half a head; she had much the samebrown eyes, but her hair, unlike Theo's, was golden-glorious-ly golden as the sunlight.HIt occurred to him that he ought to tell her the story ofsweet, simple Theo, to whose memory he had been so true.Surely she would not be jealous of that other love; she was toonoble for that."My darling," he murmured, you have admitted thatyou love me; would it grieve you to know that I am not en-tirely heart whole?"With a wailing, piteous cry, she tore herself from his arms.CHAPTER XXX. LIE a flash the memory of Violet rushed back on Theo.Heaven help her!

Go back to Violetand tell her how true you have been to her. I hate you!"How mad he had been. Why, of course the girl hated him;he had reod it in her eyes the first time they had ever met.l  He remembered that it had seemed a hardship for her tospeak to him, look at him, or even touch his hand.Yet, despite her open aversion to him, he had allowed thegreat passionate love of his heart to go out to her.He had fancied Violet in a boyish sort of a way, he had feltthe tenderest, most intense pity and regret for beautiful Theo,A  but this royal, peerless girl he loved with all the strength ofhis heart, a love such as comes to a man but once in a life-time.Surely she had heard but Violet's side of the story; was ittoo late to tell her his? would she censure him when he toldher why he had ceased to care for Violet?He walked back to the Oriental with a white set face. Heknew she would be strolling on the beach early the next morn-ing; it was her usual custom. He would join her, and pleadwith her to listen to the story he had to tell her; and if, afterhaving listened, she could find no leniency, no pardon forhim, then he would go away, go out of her life, though itj crushed his heart and ruined his hopes.He sat by the window in his room far into the midnighthour, smoking a companionable cigar, and through the bluerings of curling smoke seeing pictures, in his mind's eye, of afair girlish face crowned in waving masses of beautiful goldenhair, a scarlet, quivering mouth, and a pair of darkly flashingeyes.Leaning his handsome fair head back against the casement,and glancing carelessly out of the window, he saw a coachdraw up in front of the veranda.  The slight figure of awoman dressed in a dark traveling cloak and wearing a veil,hastily entered the vehicle; the door was closed with a bang,the driver cracked his whip over the heads of the horses, andin a moment more the coach and occupants were lost amongthe shadows of the night and the leaden stretch of beach andsea.He did not give the matter a thought, further than towonder why the lady had preferred traveling alone and atnight, exposed to all its dangers, rather than wait for the earlymorning boat.The impatient young lover could scarcely wait until thedawning of another day; yet he knew he ought to snatch BJ; ~~~<pb n="131"/>f:'"        ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.             13. i'ew hours of balmy sleep, if he would not look haggard before  ier on the morrow.The next morning, flushed and eager, Harry Strathmore      - -    ^   Rse with the sun, and, after making a careful toilet in his andsome navy-blue suit, white neck-tie, a red rose inhe lapel of his coat, his white straw hat, with the blue band round it, pushed back from  his fair, clustering hair, heauntered out on the beach to await the appearance of Missester.An hour or more passed as he paced impatiently to and froithout seeing the well-known, graceful form." She is an hour later than usual," he told himself, consult-ug his watch for the twentieth time.       .At last it became apparent to him that Miss Lester would ot walk on the beach that morning. There was still a hopeeft him of seeing her within the hour, however.She usually breakfasted with the Vales at eight o'clock; heust manage to enter the dining-room at the same time. Itould be an easy matter to beg for an interview of at least aw moments that morning.To his surprise th6 Vales entered the breakfast-room alone.here was Miss Lester?  Why was she not with them? He could stand the suspense no longer; he would boldly beg Mrs.  -Vale to induce Miss Lester to see him in the parlor.He stopped at that lady's table, and, after exchanging afew pleasant courtesies, asked why Miss Lester had not joined them-he wished so particularly to see her.Florence Vale raised her blue eyes to his white face.1 am sorry to tell you that my friend was hastily called to~the city late last night," she said.CHAPTER XXX1.S   GONE!" he echoed; "do you tell me that Miss Lester'has gone away?"" Sit down and take breakfast with us, Mr. Strathmore,"said Florence, gently, "and I will tell you why she left sosuddenly."I He sunk into the proffered seat; but breakfast was a farceto him; he pushed away the broiled quail and toast untasted." You say she left quite suddenly last night?" he asked;and his mind reverted to the dark, muffled figure which hadentered the coach at midnightW    r Freqce nodded.j                         - ,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~fJ('!<pb n="132"/>H::  182 - - ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACME." Yes, very suddenly.

'I must go to.night. 1 can not tell you why.'"'Going?-and in the very height of the season! Why,you are surely jesting,' 1 cried. ' Why, your beau would notfind life endurable at Manhattan Beach if you were to goaway.," She turned a white, pained face to me, and there weretears in her lovely brown eyes.F " 'Never speak to me of beaus,' she said; 'love or loversare not for me, Florence.'V "And do you know, Mr. Strathmore, I had an idea thatperhaps you two had quarreled?-for 'the course of true lovenever did run smooth,' they say," continued Florence, archly." Did she say that it was on my account that she intendedto leave the beach?" he asked, quickly." Oh, no; I merely surmised that. As 1 said before, sherefused utterly to tell me why she was leaving us so suddenly."-A sudden thought came to him." She told you where she was going, did she not, Mrs. Vale?She must have left her address with you. Perhaps she has-  gone to your house in Brooklyn," he went on eagerly.iAgain Florence shook her head:" She went in the direction of Baltimore, I believe; but thatwas not her destination, 1 am quite positive."Harry Strathmore's brain was in a whirl; he caught theone word, Baltimore, but the rest of the sentence fell upondeaf ears.There was great commotion among the belles at the beachthat afternoon when it was rumored that handsome Mr.Strathmore intended to take his departure that day.Marriageable daughters and their mammas were in a flutterof keen disappointment. More than one pretty, pink-tinted,dainty note found its way to his room as he was packing histrunk, expressing the hope that he would not forget to bidthem good-bye.To all of these missives Harry Strathmore returned the samecourteous, brief reply-he was sorry that his time was solimited he would be obliged to forego that pleasure, yet thank-ing them for their kind interest in him.ore than one chagrined beauty tore the formal reply intoshreds, satisfied that she had made no impression upon theheart of handsome Harry Strathmore, and felt that her seasopat Manhattan Beach had been wasted.=:_3B 'e<pb n="133"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE. :            3SMBut we must now return to Theo. It was she whom Harry i  lStrathmore had seen entering the coach at midnight. Twohours later she was pacing the deck of a steamer bound for Baltimore.Theo retired to her state room and cried herself to sleep that .night. Late the following day she reached Baltimore. Shedrove to a quiet hotel in the suburbs and secured a room. She :had no definite plans; she only wanted to be alone, to have  .time for rest and peace, to be away from those who wouldmention the name of Harry Strathmore to her.For one week Theo enjoyed sweet seclusion; but she found, go where she would, she could not run away from     her   'thoughts. Waking or sleeping, a fair, handsome face hauntedher, and the yearning cry in her heart for him was never b lstilled.Scarcely a furlong from the hotel was a large white build-ing, set far back from the main road, in a bower of trees. Itwas a charity hospital, presided over by " The Little'Sisters ofthe Poor," and Theo found great consolation in making daily visits there, and many a dollar from her purse found its way  --there in suitable dainties for its helpless inmates. The gentle sisters welcomed the beautiful, golden-haired    Iyoung stranger warmly.  " Your presence seems to brightenus," they said; "it seems as though you brought the sunshinewith you.To the poor sufferers tossing on their beds of pain Theeseemed like an angel of mercy. Her touch cooled the feveron their burning brows, her gentle voice soothed them.Many a kindly act she did for them-many a letter shepenned for trembling hands too weak to perform that officefor themselves, to relatives and friends. They named her"the angel of tle helpless and unfortunate," and the namesuited her well.-No one would have believed that the cruelest and darkestI temptation of her young life was to come to her within thosewalls.Theo had gone as usual to the hospital one morning on hersweet errand of mercy, carrying with her a basket of ripe,luscious fruit for a poor young working-girl who had slippedand been caught in the meshes of a cruel loom, while weavingsilk that was to adorn the person of one of earth's more fortunate ones, yet perchance less noble.In her satchel she carried a book of Will Carleton's beautiful poems, for a homeless young clerk who had been etriF9 l9w by fever's scorching hand.!          , ._, -                     |;'.  f i''' ' .' i.f~'~/!.<pb n="134"/>184         ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.LTheo walked quickly up the broad pebbled walk, pausingnow and then to pluck a fragrant lilac spray that kissed hercheek as she walked along.How eagerly they welcomed the angel of the helpless! Shevisited each of the wards in turn, carrying brightness, joy, andsunshine with her. Tears dimmed many an eye as they sawher depart." Would you mind visiting a new patient with me to-day,Miss Lester?" asked one of the gentle sisters. " It is a young1 and beautiful girl. There is a tragic story in her face; sheturns her face to the wall, refusing to take food or drink fromour hands. Will you come and see her, Miss Lester?"Theo consented at once.She threw open a -door at the furthest end, and Theo fol-lowed her into the cool, white, plainly furnished apartment.A young girl lay upon' the couch, her long blue-black curlstossed in picturesque confusion over the ruffled pillow, and asthe sister had said, her face turned toward the wall, buriedin her white hands." Speak to her, Miss Lester; my prayers and entreatieshave failed to move her," urged the sister.Theo placed her white hand on the beautiful dark head,bending gently over her that she might obtain a better viewof the face the young girl sought to hide from view so persist-ently." We are your friends," said Theo, in a sweet, clear voice."You will surely not refuse food and drink-"The rest of the sentence was never uttered-the tone ofTheo's voice acted like magic upon the stranger; with thewildest cry that ever fell from human lips, the girl turned withlightning-like rapidity on her pillow, raised herself on heri -   elbows, fairly glaring up into the death-white face bendingover her.The recognition had been instantaneous. No change of ap-pearance-nothing in this world could have veiled Theo'sidentity from the girl who had hated her with such a bitterhatred three long years before."You," she cried-" you are not dead then; you have risenfrom the grave to come between me-"The sentence ended in a gasp, which was followed by aIdeath-like swoon. The instant Theo's eyes had rested on theltranger's face, with a thrill of horror she recognized Violt,<pb n="135"/>ALL FOR LtVE OF A FAIR FACt           ^     CHAPTER XXXII.Po F   one thrilling instant the gray eyes and brown eyes metihn Theo recoiled with a bitter cry. It was Harry Strath.re's bride-the girl who had come between her and happi.-ess and love!" Do you know her?" asked the wondering sister."Yes," said Theo, "we have met before-she is Mrs.trathmore, of Strathmore Hall, Allendale, Maryland."    'That afternoon a telegram was sent to Harry Strathmore at e Oriental Hotel, Manhattan Beach, which ran as follows: " Your wife lies seriously ill at St. Mary's Hospital-thesult of a railway collision. Will you come on?"Yet up to midnight no reply had been received. Then thenswer flashed over the wires was that " Harry Strathmoread left the Oriental that afternoon, and that his whereaboutsere unknown."A second telegram was sent to Allendale-Strathmore Hall:" Violet lies here sick unto death. What shall be done wither?"lo this also the following answer was received:" Strathmore Hall has been closed for two years or more.ccupants gone abroad."Theo was in despair. How could she communicate withViolet's friends? their address was unknown to her. Andupon her devolved the duty of watching over her until herfriends could be heard from. Miss Lester seemed to possess a strange influence over theeautiful stranger. From  no other hands would she acceptfood. No other presence seemed to soothe and calm her.The dark-gray eyes fringed by their long lashes would scan:Theo's face intently for long hours at a time, and the words:"You came between us; I hate youl" would tremble on thever-parched lips.Before nightfall Violet's condition became so alarming thatit was considered best to call in another physician for the pur-se of consultation. Accordingly, another physician was sentr, and within the* hour he arrived-a tall, bearded manonzed by sun and travel. Theo did not catch the name adwas announced, but it mattered little.<pb n="136"/>Is:::Ly:~ : :t5'   f ', 'LO R  Low, o  A ~x1n~xc~-  ;  111o  AtL  0th LOtfl 0P A *Att PACMThe tall, bearded stranger bent over Violet's couch, thenistarted back with an exclamation of surprise.- "' 1 know this young lady's friends," he said. "Word mustbe sent to them immediately of her precarious condition.He was informed that this had already been done.The next day the doctor was presented to Miss Lester as sheentered the sick-room. Again Theo did not catch the name,so intent was she upon watching Violet's white face. Yet,upon the young doctor the effect of her presence was marvel-ous. He grew white to the bearded chin, and the compoundhe held in his hand fell to the floor unheeded.r  As the reader probably has already surmised, the doctorwho had been called in for consultation was none other thanWalter Melville, of Rosecliff. Three years of foreign travel hadaltered him greatly. No wonder Theo did not recognize thelover of other days in the tall, bearded, bronzed stranger whostood before her.The first instant Dr. Melville's eyes had rested upon Theo'sface he knew her." Miss Lester they had called her; evidently they had madea slight mistake," he ruminated, " as the names Lester andChester were quite similar."- He was obliged, however, to put all thoughts of Theo from: his mind, for the time being, as this case of Violet's illness,' upon which he had been called upon to consult, had assumeddangerous proportions, and all the skill of the physicians com-bined was called into requisition.At this state of affairs, one of the experienced nurses of theinstitution, who had watched untiringly by Violet's couch, suc-cumbed to overexertion and fatigue, and, in answer to thepleadings of one of the gentle sisters, Theo could not refuseto take her place at her rival's bedside for that night, until anurse could be substituted on the following morning." Is there such great danger, doctor?" Theo had asked, inapprehension, as the consulting physicians rose to take theirleave.It was Dr. Melville who answered.I;     " So great," he replied, gravely, " that if these drops weleave with you should fail to be given her exactly on thestroke of the midnight hour, her life would pay the forfeit erethe day dawned."Silently and gravely the physicians filed from  the room,leaving these two alone together.For hours, as the moments dragged slowly by, Theo wntched/-<pb n="137"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR PAO              137ebeautiful white face lying so still against the pillow--tched it with a strange, fierce, yearning pain at her heart. "Bat for you he might have loved me," murmured Theo,tching the contour of Violet's lovely face.

But have you prospered with the lover you wrested)m me, Violet?  Ah, no, no! He who is false to one candom be true to another.

There could be no thought of winning, or havingn him, while Violet lived."While Violet lived!"  How the strange words seemed tount her! The pity of it was that she dared to listen to thenge, sibilant voice that was whispering to her heart.Long hours Thee sat there with only her thoughts for come -ions-and there was danger in that."If Violet were dead," that same terrible voice whisperedher beating heart, "Harry Strathmore-the love of here, the one above all others for whom her soul yearned withpassionate yearning-would be free!"i ow strangely her heart beat at the thought!

Will you have the love your heartcraves, or doom yourself to eternal misery?"The clock on the mantel was on the stroke of twelve now.With slow, measured chimes it tolled the midnight hour.She grasped the vial with her white, death-cold hands andslowly poured out the glittering life-giving drops, as the doctorhad minutely directed-the drops which were to give Violetlife and love, and doom her whose white hand gave it to thedepths of despair, such as always follows a life bereft of love-e loveless life.Five-ten drops she poured out with a shaking hand, and,with a face pallid as marble, she approached Violet's couch."Can you give up love, life, hope, happiness-doom your-self to everlasting wretchedness and a desolate, loveless lifelike this?" cried the same still, small, mocking voice.The girl had listened too long. The terrible force of themightiest temptation that ever sued for the mastery of ahuman heart overcame her.Theo had listened too long to the tempting voice of con-science. With a cry of remorse pitiful in its struggling de-spair, Theo dashed the silver spoon with its glittering con-tents from her. Violet should not be saved to enjoy HarryStrathmore's love!The hour and the moment had come and gone. She threwup her hands, with a wild, hushed cry, and fell by the couchof the girl whose doom she had decided, in a dead faint.CHAPTER     XXXIILTHE faint into which Theo had fallen lasted for long hoursThe gray dawn was struggling through the clouds in the east-ern sky, and the clock on the mantel had slowly chimed thehour of 6ve as she opened her dark, terrified eyes.Theo sprung to her feet with a low cry. Was it some terri-ble dream she lhad hadi that clutched so heavily at her heart?Her eyes encountered the spoon lying upon the carpet, thenthe white face of Violet agamls tahe pillow; and trhe4, Heaven<pb n="139"/>AtL tPo   LOVf 0O  A PAIR pAO-           13elp her, she remembered all, and the cry of agony she ut-tered was pitiful to hear.How white Violet's face looked in the gray, uncertain light?She recoiled with a gasp as she gazed."God be merciful to me!" moaned the girl. "Oh, Violet, Violetl I am terrified at what 1 have done! If I could givemy life to save yours I would do it! Oh, Violet, Violet!"  -When the doctors entered and gathered around Violet's bedside, what would that ghastly grayish face tell them?Would they discover the cause of death? What could she sayin defense? That sleep had overcome her, and the hours hadgone by?Sleep! How could she say that she had dared to sleep whena human life was intrusted to her care?Oh, could the love of man ever atone for what she wassuffering then? Kneeling there beside Violet's couch, shesuffered a life-time of misery.Blow the terrible moments passed she never knew. Sheheard the tread of feet in the corridor without, and she knewthat it was the consulting physicians-they were coming atlast.The gentle sisters were with them; she could hear their low,hushed voices-she could hear their expressions of hope thatthey would find the beautiful stranger's condition greatly im-proved-the powerful medicine would bring her back fromthe gates of death, if anything could.How Theo cowered as she heard the words-how she wishedthat God in His mercy would strike her dead for yielding tothe horrible temptation to withhold the life-giving cordialfrom her rival's lips!They had called her the " Angel of the Helpless."  Oh, ifthey but knew-oh, if they but knew what she had done!Softly they pushed open the door and entered, advancing atonce to Violet's couch. One of them crossed over to the win-dow, drew aside the heavy curtains, and let in a food of bright,invigorating sunshine.i  How is our patient this morning?" asked one of the doc-tors, taking one of the white hands in his and bending his eardown to listen to the faint throbbings of the sufferer's heart.The words were addressed to Theo; but she dared not look up or raise her head from the coverlet, lest they should readhorrible guilty fear and despair in her death-white face andterror-stricken eyes. She neither moved nor spoke. Shecould not have replied if her life had depended upon the utter-Saoue f a single word.I '                                     .           .<pb n="140"/>- 4.  0    AMLL POr  o LOVE Or A PAIRt  ACt For a moment that seemed the length of eternity to theguilty girl, a death-like silence reigned in the room.i "Were the doctors looking at each other with horror intheir faces?" Theo wondered, vaguely. "Would the horrible]  stillness be broken by the stern, awful words: 'What doesthis mean? the cordial has not been given the patientl' for ofcourse the wise doctors would know-oh, yes, they wouldknow."How oppressive the silence grew! Were they pointing toher with significant glances? How she wished she dare raise herface and see what this silence meant-see what was passingI around her.l It was one of the sisters who spoke-the sister who saidTheo was rightly named when they called her the " Angel ofthe Helpless."J She had bent over the lovely white face lying against thepillow with bated breath, then a sharp cry broke from her lips.:  " Doctor," she cried, her low, sweet voice quivering withalarm and pain, " this is not life! See the gray pallor aroundthe lovely mouth, the glaze of death is creeping over theseeyes, death-damp stands out on the blue-veined forehead.y The sight of death is not new to me; the girl is dying!"Ah, me, how the wind among the trees, whose leafy branchesfluttered against the casement, seemed to take up the wordwith a low, moaning shriek and whisper it to the whole world-  outside. And it whispered something else, too-somethingthat only Theo, kneeling in such abject terror at Violet's bed-side, knew and understood.Theo wondered vaguely why the doctors did not answer thestartling, vehement words that fell from the gentle sister's lips."- The lovely young stranger is dying, doctor," repeated the.sister, sobbingly."It looks strangely, startlingly like it," responded one ofthe physicians, gravely. "If you ladies will kindly leave theroom, we will hold a consultation. This case seems to havetaken an altogether unusual turn. I am mystified. As yousay, good sister, the young girl before us has every appearanceof death.         -Only Heaven alone knew of the superhuman effort Theoput forth to prevent giving utterance to the shrieks of terror.^ that seemed to rise up in her throat and stifle her.Like one stricken blind, she struggled up from her kneesand groped her way with unsteady steps from the room.No one seemed to notice her-every thought seemed bent- pon Violet. She made her way down the cool, wide corridor,:if          :^                           t^^k<pb n="141"/>ALL VOll LOVE OP A PAnt Ircm'.           141pt the wards of the many who had blessed her and kissed the olds of her robes with reverent lips, calling her the "Angel)f the Helpless. "e How stealthily she crept past them, her beautif l golden ead bent heavily and dejectedly on her breast-crept downnto the silence of the garden, throwing herself upon her knees mong the long grasses, and lifting her white, agonized faceo the morning sunlight.  She dared not pray, though thehite lips moved dumbly. There was no pardon for what shead done.Glancing up to Violet's window she saw the doctors movehurriedly to and fro with white faces. She knew well whathat meant. Oh, yes, she knew! It told her throbbing heartthat Violet was dead.But such was not really the case, however.: We must goback a little to the midnight hour while Theo sat at Violet'sbedside. At the moment Theo had raised the vial in her death-cold hands and turned toward Violet's couch, a firm,white hand had turned the knob softly, pushed open the doorand stood on the- threshold.It was Dr. Melville. He had been detained by other patientsin the building, and was just preparing to depart when hefound that he had left his medicine-case in the ward whereViolet Kensington lay.He had returned for it, entering the room noiselessly, think-ing he would be in time to administer the cordial to Violethimself.He entered the apartment, as we have said, just as Theowas turning toward the bedside.The expression of her face startled him, holding him spell-bound, and the low muttered words that fell from her color-less, compressed lips held him fairly rooted to the spot.Was it fancy, or did he hear her murmur faintly as she bentover Violet:" God forgive me, the terrible temptation has conquered'me! I shall not save her to enjoy the love that but for herwould now he mine! She has cheated me out of my love,ruined my life! Why should 1 raise my hand to save her? I will not!"Then, to his deep horror and dismay, he saw her dash thespoon with its contents upon the floor, throw up her whitehands, and fall headlong beside Violet's couch in a dead faint.Dr. Melville crossed swiftly to the table, picked up another .spoon, poured out from the vial the required amount, aid-   ,L-<pb n="142"/>; 14S    AtL POR tovt OF A iA1ER     AOcl. forced it down the sufferer's lips just as the clock on the man/'tel in slow measured strokes tolled the midnight hour.Violet was now in God's hands; if she died mortal agencywas not now responsible for it.-" It would be more merciful for me not to attempt to re-store her," he thought with compassionate pity, looking downi. upon Theo's white face, " it is best that she should come toby herself."I As silently as Dr. Melville had entered the room he quittedit, the heart in his bosom as heavy as lead.ri He had made a startling discovery. He had received a ter-rible shock. His faith in womankind was crushed.Yet, what his eyes had seen, his ears heard, he was boundto believe.How long Theo knelt in the garish sunlight among the tallgrasses she never knew. A step aroused her; she looked up inaffright and saw one of the doctors approaching." He is coming to tell me Violet's fate," she thought, " heknows all. He has come to accuse me. Heaven pity me!What shall I do?"CHAPTER XXXIV.THE doctor rapidly came nearer. A vague presentimentcrossed Theo's mind that he was searching for her, and a wild,mad impulse to fly-to hide herself anywhere-anywhere, oc-curred to her.She saw now how imminent was her peril. She had stoodquietly by while the life of Harry Strathmore's bride hadslowly drifted out, without lifting her hand to save her; yet-    she might have saved her if she would.Ah, yes! she could have saved her, but she did not. Nowthey were coming to accuse her of it.With a white, ghastly face, and eyes dilating with fear, shestruggled to her feet, and fled swiftly through the green, sun-lit grounds that surrounded the hospital-ran fleetly, swiftly,to hide in the thick green coverts of the park; but the swiftfootsteps seemed to gain upon her. It was no delusion, then;they had discovered what she had done, and they were pursu-ing her. At that moment she was mad with fear.And of all the pain she had suffered since her path and Vio-let's had first crossed-pain of blighted love, the keen, tortur-ing pangs of bitterest jealousy, temptation, and remorse-nonewas so great as this she felt hiding among the green trees on<pb n="143"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A PAIR PAC               143which the golden sunlight fell-hiding in sorrow, in shame,and in feel.No one could deny the swift and sure punishment of sinwho could have seen that white, terror-distorted face, and thewild, frightened eyes peering out from the midst of the thickgreen leaves.She had hoped that the doctor had not seen her-that hewould pass her by; but when he had reached the lilac bushesbehind which she crouched in the long green grass, he paused.With folded arms, young Dr. Melville gazed pityingly down upon the white-faced girl cowering at the foot of the gnarledbeech-trees.With gentle hands he raised her, placing her upon one ofthe garden chairs. He was touched by the sight of her utterterror and abject fear. Alas! how fatally lovely she was inher helplessness. Even had he come there to condemn her,he would have found that the words would have died unut-tered on his lips.The dark eyes looking down into her own with such astrange light in them terrified her more than words could havedone." It is right that you should feel remorse for what you havedone-or, rather, for what you failed to do. Still, you need not stand in such terror of me, although I know all. I, andI alone, am possessed of last night's mystery," he said, slowlyWith a superhuman effort Theo raised her dark, dazed eyesto his face."Oh, sir, as you are strong, be merciful!" she answered."I was so sorely tempted.  I did not mean to do wrong; Icould have died sooner than harm one hair of Violet's head.I-oh, be merciful and spare me!""I do not want to be anything but merciful," he said; " atthe same time I should be just."   The cry of mortal terrorthat fell from her lips was pitiful to hear; then she looked upinto his face with the calmness of utter despair. " I shall notbe harsh and cruel to you," he went on, steadily; "I wouldrather shield you than betray you. 1 will tell you why wouldkeep the knowledge of what you have done from the world,he went on with sorrowful gentleness. "It is because I onceloved you, Theo Chester-and I love you still.- A thunder-bolt falling from  the sunlit sky at the girl'feet could not have startled her more. This dark, bronzed,bearded doctor, whom she never remembered having seen be-fore, loved her! Why, surely the man was mad! ' You have looked into my face and have not recognized m .<pb n="144"/>l i--144-  ALt FOE LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.Suns of foreign countries have tanned me, and, together with /: his heavy beard, I am, no doubt, greatly changed. Yet in /me you behold one who will befriend and protect you if you so.* will it-Doctor Walter Melville, of Rosecliff."-\  A cry of dismay broke from Theo's lips. How strange thatshe had not recognized him! Yet she did not wonder at it as'she looked up into his face; it was, as he said, greatly altered.A sudden inspiration came to her: could she prevail uponhim to go away-leave her, and keep her secret?  He lovedher once well enough to shield her from the world's scorn.Surely she might influence him now. She would try.She rose from the garden seat and flung herself on the greenS grass at his feet, clinging to him with hot, burning hands, soimploringly, so beseechingly, that he was compelled to listen.You will not betray me, Doctor Melville," she sobbed."By the old love which once filled your heart for me, I pray--you to shield me-to never let the world know-and I willatone for it all the years of my after-life. I was mad to listento the voice of temptation-madder still to yield to it!"l Walter Melville took her burning hands in his, and raisedher to her feet, his passionate eyes devouring her fair loveli-ness. She was more beautiful to him, with all her faults,than a saint would have been."I will shield you, Theo," he said, drawing her so firmlywithin the shelter of his arms that she could not break awayfrom his clasp. "There is but one way, and one way only,and that is that you must be-my wife! I will show you allconsideration. 1 will swear never to breathe one word of theterrible secret that shocked me so-never mention it even toyou after to-day. I will not ask you what prompted you to-do it-you and I will forget it.""What would the alternative be?" she whispered, in a voiceso hoarse he would scarcely have recognized it as hers.; l e stooped down and whispered a few words in her ear.She fell back in his arms as white as death.' Give me time," she cried, wildly-" I must have time tothink it over!"" I will give you time, Theo," he said.  " It is morningnow; I will come for my answer here, to this very spot be-neath the beech-trees when twilight falls. I shall expect tofindyou here."He placed her gently on the garden chair from which shehad risen, turned, and walked rapidly away.The sound of his footsteps died away oln the pebbled walk;then, with a cry so bitter it startled even the singing-birds in<pb n="145"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.- -          145the trees, she fell forward, burying her face in the long grass.The sun shone on her as she lay there; the summer wind'swept over her, odorous with the breath of roses. She laythere long hours, heedless of what was transpiring around her,wildly praying for death.Was it a dream-a hideous nightmare-the events of thelasttwenty-four hours? she asked herself.Was she, whom they called the " Angel of the Helpless," shewho had always shuddered at the bare mention of sin, she who ihad grieved with all the pitying tenderness of her heart over a butterfly's broken wing or a robin's death--could it be truethat the blackest and most pitiful of all charges that could bewritten against a human being's name was entered againsthers?  Would the word guilty be written against it?Had ever a young girl been tempted so cruelly to sin in sopitiful, strange a way for mighty love's sake?Had Thee not believed Violet to be Harry Strathmore'sbride, she would not have withheld the potion from thosewhite lips, crying out in the bitterness of her despair::" Why should 1 give her back to Harry Strathmore's arms--to him whom I love better than life itself?  I can not, oh,I can not!"Slowly Theo raised her head from the grass. 'She saw thatthe sun was slowly sinking in the west, and she knew that shemust have been lying there long hours. She dared not raiseher eyes to Violet's window as she crept slowly out of the parkgates to the main road. How Harry Strathmore would scorn her if he knew what she had done, and he might do worse than that-he might    icry out for vengeance against her for robbing him of his love.fie might call it by a worse and more horrible name.The world is severe in its censure and condemnation. "An -eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a life " areits sentiments.Would they deal hardly with her if she refused to marry Dr.i Melville, and he told the world what he knew? She grew wild with terror as she thought of it.Then a reckless despair seized her. She would not marry Dr. Melville, come what would. Let him denounce her if he   rwould. Better her doom should fall upon her at once than to fdrag the long years through, never knowing what moment thesword, which was suspended by a single thread, should fall upon her defenseless head and slay her. She walked along the crowded streets back to the quiethotel she had quitted the morning before, and wondered if shei , =<pb n="146"/>B':     U 146      ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.could be the same creature. She turned her face shrinkinglyfrom the gaze of those whom she met, and hid her white hands,   under the folds of her wrap. It almost seemed to her thatthose hands, white as lily leaves, had cruel stains upon theml1A   --stains which could never be washed away. She dare nothold them up to the sunlight.Oh, if she could go mad and end this horrible torture of re-^ morse! A strange thought occurred to her. She would writethat very hour to Harry Strathmore, confessing all, then shewould die and end it.CHAPTER XXXV.WWITH slow, tired feet, Theo crept back to her lonely roomat the quiet suburban hotel.Ah, unlucky fate that had tempted her to cross the portalof the hospital and meet Violet. How bitterly she rued it.She called for ink and paper, and the maid who suppliedher wants was startled by the white, despairing face the beau-tiful young stranger turned toward her." Is there anything else I can do for you?" she asked.Theo raised her golden head from her white tremblinghands, studying the girl's face intently for a moment." You could do me a favor if you would; 1 am in greatpain, a few drops of laudanum would relieve me; do you thinkyou could procure it for me?"Once before in her life the maid had been asked the samequestion by a beautiful woman who had come to the hotel,whence none knew, no one discovered, and it had ended in atragedy.The maid's face paled slightly, but she answered readilyenough:" Certainly I can get it for you, miss. It may be pain thatyou want it for," she thought, " but it is a pain of the heartrather than the body," and she questioned herself whether sheought to get it or not. Shortly after she entered the room,placing a small bottle containing a dark brownish liquid inTheo's hands.Theo sat at a desk at one end of the boudoir, her head bentover a letter she was busily engaged in writing, and the maidnoticed that the eyes she raised to her face were heavy withunshed tears.Her 'face flushed hotly for a moment as she received themixture from the girl's hand, then it died away, leaving herpaler than before.a    - -  -                                 ,IH, A,<pb n="147"/>ALt SPOf totE 6P A PA I tAtSC           147"I shall have two letters written within the hour," she saidwith a forced calmness; "and after I finish them I will liedown and rest and will leave them on the desk here. Will youcome in and get them-you have pass-keys? Do not disturbme," she continued, with strange gentleness. " I shall besleeping. If I do not come down to six-o'clock tea do not callme. Take the letters I have written down to the clerk in theoffice, telling him that it was my request that they should besent out on the morrow's early mail. You have been verykind to me, my good girl, kinder than you know; accept thisas a token of my gratitude. "And as she spoke she unclasped a thin gold chain from herneck, and despite the maid's protests clasped it about her.Then the maid turned and left the room; at the door she gaveone quick backward glance. The beautiful golden head wasbent upon the white hands, and in one of them  was tightlyclutched the small vial.When Theo found herself alone she slowly crossed the room,drew back the heavy lace curtains and gazed upon the scenebelow.Ah, how bright the world looked in its robe of green andgold, powdered with myriads of flowers. Yet to this girl-scarcely twenty, it had lost all charm.She was looking out upon the beautiful world for the lasttime, she told herself. To-morrow when the sun rose on thisfair green earth she would be at rest.The " Angel of the Helpless " they had named her.. Ah,me! was ever a young girl more helpless or more in need ofhelp or guidance than she herself at that moment?She saw the lovely picture the opposite mirror reflected, andshe turned away with a shudder.What did her beauty avail her? Did it bring her happinessor the love she craved? No.She turned again to the half-written letter upon the escri-toire. There were but a few lines; they were addressed to Dr.Walter Melville, and ran as follows:"I can not be your wife. I have thought the matter overcalmly. When you receive this 1 shall be past all earthlypower to harm me. Tell the world my story if you will, but remember to add that I have atoned for what I have done withmy life.  ' An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a lifefor a life,' the world cries, and I shall have paid the penalty.Ah, would that the story of my strange temptation should bea warning to all young girl.'"<pb n="148"/>I r148       AtLt tOR ttots Of A SAlB PACf.There was no name signed to it; in her tremulous haste teseal and direct it Theo quite forgot it.The next letter was addressed to Harry Strathmore, Strath-4  more Hall, Allendale.No one would ever tell him how she wept over it, caressingthe white pages which the man she loved so well was to holdin his hands. No one would tell him how she laid her beauti-ful white cheek against it, sobbing out as she kissed the deli-cate lines. He would never know of the passionate kisseswith which that solemn farewell to him was freighted. Hewould never know how the white, death-cold hands trembled..over the wavering words his bonny blue eyes were to rest upon.Would his heart throb faster if he knew?With a little choking sob Theo commenced her letter. Wewill look over her shoulder, and read it as she writes:!  "MR. HARRY STRATHMORE:" DEAR SIR,-When your eyes rest upon this page, I shallbe beyond all earthly suffering, beyond your anger, your just- vengeance. The sentence passed upon me will have been:  ttered by a higher tribunal than the lips of man."Before confessing my pitiful sin to you, I must go back alittle in my narrative, setting straight an error which I should- have righted long ago."I am not what you believed me-Miss Lester. I amTheora Chester, the girl to whom, three years ago, you wereso solemnly betrothed at Major Strathmore's death-bed." You will rememebr that it was on this self-same night Idiscovered that the betrothal which we had gone through was,on your part, a farce, the cruelest mockery; that even whileii  you clasped my hand, took upon yourself those solemn vowsof constancy, your heart was given to another."Oh, Harry Strathmore, if you suffered day and night yourwhole life through, you could not suffer more than I did atthat moment."I can put upon the white, soulless paper what I wouldnever have dared tell you in words. I can breathe out thegreat passionate love of my starving heart to you, and you cannot reprove with haughty, scathing words.Yes, I loved you, Harry Strathmore, with a love that wasmy doom. I vas alone in the world. Only those bereft ofmother, sisters, home ties such as other young girls have canunderstand and sympathize with me and realize how myheart craved for some one to love me-ah, yes, some one tolove me! It was then that I first met you. Can you wonderAw, 1 k<pb n="149"/>ALL Pt LO VE   OF A FAIR FAC            14ht your fair, handsome face won its way to my heart, andhat I worshiped you in my girlish day-dreams?    -1 was blind to your indifference, and when they told mehat you loved me, wished to make me your bride, and thate betrothal must take place at once at the major's bedside,-oh, Heaven-I believed them!"Then came the bitter awakening-when I heard you, as ou clasped Violet passionately to your heart, bemoaning theruel fate that had torn you two asunder, and crying out gainst the betrothal that was literally forced upon you by the ying major; but for that you might have been happy with he love of your own choosing; I had wrecked your life, spoiledoar future and Violet's."I listened in the alcove, rooted to the spot, listened untilour words drove me mad-yes, mad-over a love-dreamruelly shattered." Only one thought occurred to me. If I died the bondsf that betrothal which were so galling to you would benapped asunder-my death would set you free."You know how 1 fled from you, dashing out of the alcoveirying out that I had heard all."1 fled to the dark rapids that skirted the park and plungedn. The last words on my lips were these:" ' Oh, love, whom I love so well, 1 am setting you free.'"But ere the dark waters closed over me a strong handhurled me back upon the rocks, back from death and destruc-°tion." I was saved-saved for a more cruel fate, it seems." When I regained consciousness after weeks of lingeringillness, 1 found a young doctor who had been attending mebending over me." I was subsequently removed to this young doctor's home.iHe was Doctor Melville of Rosecliff." During my convalescence an idea occurred to me, andthat was to hide for evermore from those whose lives I hadursed. I was dead to the world-they believed me lying cold ^and white among the gray rocks in the bed of the rapids-let them believe so still." I knew that you and Violet would not grieve for me,Harry Strathmore. You would feel sorry for my supposedfate, but in the same breath you would add:I   " ' Yet it was much better so, for now 1 am free to woo andwin my peerless Violet.'                          e[   I went out into the world as many young girls,-ieavenjhelp them-are forced to do, to earn my own iving.

I told her May name.Then a strange mistake occurred she had misunderstood me.' Lester,' she cried. 'You say your name is Miss Lester. 1shall love you all the better for that.'" A name mattered little to me. I allowed the mistake topass uncorrected."CHAPTER XXXVI.FoR a moment Theo paused with the pen suspended be--    tween her fingers. But time was flying; she must finish thelettbr within the hour.And again she bent to her task, one hand clutching at herheaving breast, the other traversing quickly the tear-blottedpage.I made a grave mistake," she wrote, hurriedly, " when Idid not correct the false impression that my name was Lester.But as I said before, I was quite indifferent in the matter.Theo Chester, whom nobody loves, is dead to the world,' Isaid to myself; 'let " Miss Lester " take her place. No onecares-no, not one.' From that time I was known as MissLester. Three times has the sweet spring-time brightened theworld since then; and in those three long years, ah me! how Istruggled to forget you, to crush all love for you out of myheart! Waking or sleeping, your face was ever before me,although I tried to put you out of my thoughts; for I knewyou must have wedded Violet, the love of your choice, longsince. I thought I had succeeded, but, alas! 1 knew how vainthat thought was when 1 met you face to face at FlorenceVale's. For a moment my heart stood still as 1 raised myeyes to your face. You smiled upon me, you clasped my hand,but I thanked Heaven you did not know me." A year before, a fever had changed my brown locks to ahue that is now golden, and I was taller than the Theo ofother days.

The secret my heart'IT&<pb n="151"/>-  f  MP  :,ALL FOR LOVE 01 A FAIR FACE.            151whispered to me terrified me. Violet's face seemed to rise outof the silver-lighted waves and confront me.  Heaven helpme! I had forgotten Violet's very existence.  Her voiceseemed to cry out hoarsely: 'Leave him, if you value yourown safety, for he. is mine!' Ah me! to err is human; yet youknow how I turned from you and fled precipitately-fled,leaving the question you had asked me unanswered. I fledfrom one folly only to ingulf myself in a deeper one, for which1 am about to pay the penalty, and the penalty is just."I fled from your presence, coming here, and here 1 havemet my doom. I tried to fly from my own thoughts as 1 had fled from you. A way suggested'itself, and blindly I followedthe guidance of the hand that led me on. Long hours I wouldsit by the fountain in a green park that skirted a suburbanhospital, trying to think out what 1 should do with my lonely,blighted, loveless life.'I thought of all thou wert to me;I dream of what thou can'st not be;My life is cursed with thoughts of thee,Forever and forever.'"' Oh, little birds,' I cried, aloud, holding my hands out tothe green boughs on which the robins twittered,' tell me what1 shall do with my life-how to live through the dreary daysand to escape from my own thoughts!'" A white hand was laid gently on my shoulder, and springing tomy feet in astonishment, I found myself standing faceto face with one of the gentle sisters whom I had often seenpassing into the hospital grounds.'        S^Asking the birds what to do with a human life whichGod put upon this earth for his own wise purposes?

They told me she turned her lovely face to thewall, refusing both food and drink, and asked me to visit her."1 went to her and bending over her drew her white handsfrom her face. Ah, Heaven! It was Violet, your wife!" The one above all others whose very name caused me tocry out in the bitterest anguish. I could not even endure thetender flowerets that bore the name of violet.I did not cry out, faint, or utter any moan; but if myface had been-a stone mask it could not have grown harderand colder in a single instant, as 1 gazed upon the fatal beauty: that had won from me the love I would have died for. Wasthis the cruel irony of fate?"I looked and the bitterest hatred that ever warred in ahuman heart wrung mine."That night, by the strange complications of fate, I wasrequested to sit up with Violet. Her illness had taken a fatal: turn. The climax would be reached at midnight. And thatl night the most pitiful temptation that ever wrecked a soul,lost for it Heaven's mercy, attacked mine.!

Violet, your wife, the beauty who had robbed meof your love, happiness, and all that the world holds dear, layat my mercy. I had only to sit with my hands folded in mylap and the end would be that when morning dawned my rivalwould be swept from my path." I had but to sit still and fate would set you free, my love.Oh, bitter hour, when first we listen to temptation's voice. 1listened-hesitated, and in hesitating, was lost."1 could have saved Violet-your wife-Harry Strathmore,but because she was your wife I did not lift my hands to saveher, so in the eyes of Heaven I am  guilty of that which thewhole world calls by a harsh name."I did not plunge a dagger into her white breast, but mysin is equally deep; I stood quietly by without stretching my|-^^-                 &? ^<pb n="153"/>-,   ~    ALL POR LOVE OF A PAIR PACE.            1583hands to save her when I might have done so.

MELVILLE had walked hurriedly away from the parkwhere he had left Theo, busy with his thoughts.Of the girl's past he knew nothing. Since the moment hehad been called upon to attend her in that strange house inthe marsh to the time she had been removed to his own home,leaving it so suddenly, he had loved her; she was the one loveof his life.In the moment of her greatest peril-when the world wouldhave, turned from her with bitter condemnation-he hadoffered her the noble love from which she had once fled-offered her his name and his protection.What the secret was that made Violet and her such bitterfoes he would never seek to probe; he would wait patientlyand she would tell him perhaps all in good time.So buried was Dr. Melville in his reverie that he did not seea young man dressed in a traveling-duster, who had stoppedsuddenly scarcely ten feet in advance of him, a pleased smilelighting up his fair, handsome face, as his eyes rested upon theadvancing figure of the young doctor." Walter, my dear boy, I hope you are not going to passyour old friends by in this way!" he exclaimed, as they stoodabreast of each other.Walter Melville started and wheeled abruptly around." Why, Strathmore, is this really you?" he exclaimed,grasping heartily the extended hand. "I thought you were at Manhattan Beach, listening to what the wild waves weresaying. I had made up my mind to join you, and would havedone so had not an unexpected event happened last night, or@ this morning rather, which may change my plans materially."Harry Strathmore noticed that his old friend turned awayI confusedly, blushing hotly under his gaze.     ,E i      e<pb n="154"/>1S4        AtL 0RO LOVE 0' A tAIR FAC.         ,"Perhaps it is a matrimonial event upon which I shall hatethe pleasure of congratulating you, my dear fellow," suggestedHarry Strathmore, earnestly yet quizzically." It may lead to that, I hope," smiled the young doctor.The hearty grasp of the young men's hands as they met wasmore expressive than any words could have been." By the way," exclaimed Dr. Melville, suddenly recollect-ing himself, " you received the telegram that was sent you inreference to your cousin's illness-Miss Kensington's, 1 mean?1 suppose that is what brought you to Baltimore, is it not?You have heard she is at the hospital here?"Harry Strathmore looked bewildered."A telegram in reference to my cousin Violet!" he re-peated. "No; I have received no such message. I am inBaltimore on quite a different errand. But what is it you tellme?-Violet is ill and at the hospital! Her mother will begreatly shocked. 1 must see Violet at once, then communicatewith her mother. I suppose she has not been informed, as noone knew her present address, probably.""You must have rest and luncheon first," said Dr. Mel-ville, looking anxiously into his friend's handsome, strangelyhaggard face. "You are not looking like yourself at all. Imust see to it that I do not have you for a patient on my-     hands."Harry Strathmore admitted that he was greatly in need ofrest, and consented to adjourn to an adjacent hotel.By the strange complication of the tangled web of destiny,they repaired to the same hotel in which Theo had takenrefuge, and, while she was writing her letter, he whom shehad loved with a love more cruel than death would have beento her, was sitting in the room directly above the one sheoccupied.Oh, if she could have known before-alas! it was too late-how he was wearing his life out searching for her! What alterrible mistake she was laboring under from first to last,.which had made her young life go all awry!As Theo was penning the closing lines of that pitiful page;.in the room above her Dr. Melville was saying, with a rare:smile on his grave face:"I can give you but a few moments, Strathmore, as I havean appointment at sundown, and "-consulting his watch,and glancing toward the sun dipping behind the western hills-" it is nearly that time now."" But you have not told me yet who the young lady is<pb n="155"/>ALL FOR LOVE OF A PAIR FACE.            15whose smiles have won you from your bachelor life, my dearMelville. Come, be more kind: confide in me."" Do you remember, Strathmore, the story I once told youof a beautiful young girl whom I had met and loved, and whosought the protection of strangers rather than share my beau-tiful home, and become my wife? You remember that it washer flight that caused me to change my mind and to go abroadwith you, without scarcely an hour's notice. The subject ofthe sudden breaking-up of my love-dream was never men- tioned between us-never. I thanked you more than wordscould have expressed for respecting my secret sorrow, and notpressing me upon the subject. I will tell you now, however,that the broken dream has had a strangefinale. I have metmy love again-1 have asked her to be my wife, and I am tohave my answer at sun down, and, please God, I trust that the i-.answer will be 'Yes.' ""I hope so, for your sake, my dear Melville," returnedHarry Strathmore, heartily, little dreaming how strangely his own destiny was crossed by the answer his friend was to re-ceive. "Go, and may God speed you, my dear fellow,"added Harry, warmly.Theo had sealed and addressed the two letters, placing themconspicuously upon the table where the maid could not fail tofind them when she returned.This done she crossed over again to the window, taking asilent farewell of the bright beautiful world that, after the sunwent down, she was to see no more.Tears filled her eyes, and her lips moved." Harry," she murmured, clasping her ice-cold hands overher beating heart, " I have sinned in loving you so madly, buteven now my lonely heart cries out for you. Ah, me, a lovesuch as mine ends but with death. "She lay down upon the couch by the window; loosening thebeautiful hair till it fell about her like a veil of gold.The sighing wind that stirred the climbing roses and dashedthem fitfully against the casement seemed pleading with herto pause ere it was too late.But if she heard she did not heed it, and with unsteady handshe raisedhe e tiny sparkling glass, drained its contents and itfell with a crash from her nerveless fingers beside the couch.When the sunlight waned and the soft dusk crept over theearth. Walter Melville was standing in the park where he had pIM1ted that morning from Theo. The stars came out in the sky; the moon shone down uponthe green arth? the birds were in their nests; and the UqwQrf <pb n="156"/>:-     : I'_156 0  ALL FOR LOVE OF A FATR FACE.i:  were asleep. There was no sound of footsteps, no shadow of:   a figure." She is not here, she does not intend to come," he said to:himself. " 1 must go in search of her."He bent his steps in the direction of the hospital; she waseither there or he could find out her address.He called for Sister Genevieve and made known his errand.At that identical moment there was a stir in the suburbanhotel across the way.The maid had followed Theo's directions. She had enteredl m- noiselessly with her pass-key, finding the two letters upon thetable.The figure upon the couch did not stir. How white theface, framed in its sheen of golden hair, looked in the pallidmoonlight which drifted upon it through the parted lacedraperies of the windows. But the maid did not disturb her,but gathering up the letters quitted the room as silently as shehad entered it.She took them to the clerk in the office, repeating the in-structions that they were to be sent out by the first mail onthe following morning.The clerk received them carelessly enough, glancing ad-miringly at the delicate chirography. Then the name on eachof the square white envelopes caught his eye and held hisattention."'Mr. Harry Strathmore, Allendale, Maryland,' and-   'Doctor Walter Melville, City,'" he repeated, slowly and, wonderingly.The next moment he turned to the register, scanning thearrivals for that day."Ah! I thought I couldn't be mistaken," he muttered;"these names are among to-day's arrivals.  Lucky 1 have sogood a memory for names, or these letters might have beenposted. Rooms No. 16 and 17," he said, consulting theledger. "I suppose they might as well be sent up at once tothese parties;" and he leisurely tapped the gong for the bell-boy and gave him the letters, with the necessary instructions.Five minutes later the bell-boy returned to the office-desk." TWell, what now?" said the clerk." Both of the gentlemen were out. Mr. Strathmore's doorwas unlocked, so I laid the letter down upon the table; theother gentleman's door was locked, so I brought his letterback to you. Did I do right, sir?"·" Yes, I suppose so," he returned, tossing Dr. MQlville'litter back into the box. :        Ll<pb n="157"/>ALL FO   LOVE OP A PAIR PACEI.; -::    15:::7CHAPTER XXXVIII.IT was ten o'clock when Harry Strathmore returned to hishotel. He lighted the gas-jet, and the first object that hiseyes rested upon was the white envelope addressed to himself.He tore it open wonderingly, noticing that it had no post-mark, and concluding it must have been sent by a specialmessenger by some one in the city. His wonder increased as he saw that the page bore theprinted letter-head of the hotel; the missive was evidentlyfrom some one in the house.He smoothed out the page indifferently enough, but the firstsentence that caught his eye held him spell-bound. A redmist swept before him; the veins on his forehead stood outlike knotted cords, and the strong hands that held the lettertrembled like leaves in a wind, while his handsome face grewpale as death.He drew a long, quivering breath; his lips trembled. Theo,whom he had mourned as dead three long, weary years, alive-and in the person of Miss Lester! Great Heaven! it couldnot be; it was some jest. He was astounded, amazed, dis-mayed. Miss Lester, the beautiful girl he had learned to lovewith all the passionate depths of his heart, was Theo-poor,little, despised Theo? He could scarcely realize it; yet, as heread on with breathless interest, there was no room left fordoubt in his mind. The shock was terrible to him. Theounder the same roof with him! He read slowly, carefully,each line on the written pages-the confession of her greatlove for him, and the pitiful temptation that had followed onthe heels of it.Harry Strathmore's head fell forward on his breast, and asbitter a sob as ever left man's lips died on his. Great dropsof anguish stood out on his brow. What could the closinglines of that piteous letter mean? Like a flash the terribleimport of the words came to him. Great God! was he too lateto save his beautiful, innocent darling? Like one mad he sprung from his chair, giving the bell-      Brope a violent pull. Only Heaven knew what he suffered.When they answered the hasty summons they found HarryStrathmore standing in the middle of the room, with a face haggard as death, while the letter he held clutched in his handwas wet with tears. He was laboring under some great excite-plent.<pb n="158"/>15' 1§8     ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FAMC"Miss Lester! go to her room at once!" he gasped in.coherently, and the letter fell unheeded from his nervelessfingers.At that moment Dr. Melville entered his friend's room.He saw at once by the group of excited attendants aboutHarry Strathmore that something unusual had transpired.He picked up the crumpled sheet, smoothed it out, and ranhis quick eye over the page. His face grew white as marble.R In a single instant he had mastered its contents and he under-stood all. He and his friend were rivals for the love of abeautiful girl; their friendship was over for evermore. Butr it was a useless rivalry on his part, for, by her own confession,her heart was given long since to his rival, Harry Strathmore.lHe read, too, with a thrill of horror the closing lines of thatletter as his friend had done, but he was quick to act, and inless than a moment, guided by the frightened housekepeer andattendants, he had made his way to Theo's boudoir.But here a, new difficulty presented itself: the door wassecurely fastened upon the inside. Yet not a moment was to1 be lost. A deathly silence that made the doctor's heart fairlyquake with fear, reigned in the interior of the room.The key was upon the inside of the lock: but one coursepresented itself-they must force the door.Strong shoulders were brought to bear on the heavy oakenpanels; it quivered an instant on its hinges, then fell in with acrash.In an instant Dr. Melville had bounded over the thresholdand was kneeling beside the silent figure on the couch.A strong pungent odor filled the room. The vial which the- doctor had hastily picked up and examined solved the mystery.It was valerian, a sleeping potion, not necessarily dangerous,he explained to them.And the maid whispered to the doctor and the housekeeperhow she had substituted valerian, fearing something of thatsort when the beautiful young stranger had pleaded with herto bring her a vial of laudanum." Your wisdom has saved her life," said the young doctor,gravely.He chafed the little, white, ice-cold hands. How he yearned to take her in his arms just once and kiss her for the first andlast time.The sweet face, the tender lips, were not for him, yet heloved her with the whole passion and force of his soul, and atthat moment he almost hated the fair, handsome rival, whohad won Theora Chester's heart,Z:                                           A,<pb n="159"/>ALtL OR LOVE OF A PAIR FACE.           15OYet, Walter Melville being the very soul of honor, he put thethought from him; the idol he had enshrined in his heart wasshattered. He must leave her at once and never iook uponher face more, until he could think of her calmly.Theo had fallen into a deep sleep from which all attemptsto awaken her had proven futile. It was induced not so muchby the draught she had taken as great mental excitement fol-lowed by exhaustion.An hour later Walter Melville sought Harry Strathmore'sroom. He found him pacing up and down in the most intenseexcitement."She has taken nothing injurious.   Your fears weregroundless," he said, in answer to the anxious questions withwhich he was plied ere he had crossed the threshold; " but Iwould not advise you to attempt to see the young lady for aweek at least. Her nerves would not admit of a sudden shocksuch as your presence would be to her."Something in the young doctor's voice caused Harry Strath-more to pause and glance up at him wonderingly." I thank you for doing what you have for her," he said,holding out his hand.  "-You read the letter, my dear Mel-ville. You know all." Walter Melville drew back coldly from the proffered hand." 1 can never clasp your hand in friendship again," he said,chokingly, " for-Heaven help me!-we both love the samegirl, and her heart has been given to you, it seems, long ago.1 can understand now why 1 could not win her."Harry Strathmore was too shocked for words.Dr. Melville loved Theo too! When and where had theymet and how? Then he remembered the words of Theo'sletter, that she had been taken to Dr. Melville's home fortreatment when she had been so miraculously rescued from a"Must the friendship of long years be thus rudely severed?"asked Harry Strathmore, sadly.  haWalter Melville turned his pale, handsome face haughtily"There can be no friendship between two men who are un-fortunate enough to love the same woman.

" That will be best, Mr.Harry," she declared.L "Well, when will that be?" he asked with great impatience.i" To-day, we hope," was the encouraging reply.lThe golden sunshine was flooding the pretty lace-draped:   boudoir with a flood of softened, mellow light, and the air,sweet as the perfumes of Araby, was heavy with the fragrantodor of roses as Theo opened her wondering eyes with the light- of consciousness in them, gazing in bewilderment at the groupof faces about her couch.- Her eyes fell first upon Mrs. Mills, and she held out herarms to her like a tired child.It was a pathetic sight to see the old housekeeper clasp herin her arms laughing and crying over her in a breath.Suddenly Theo's arms fell from about her and she buriedher face in the pillow with a bitter cry:"      Oh, you must not touch me, indeed you must notl" ahe-ai_<pb n="161"/>Att POI totn OP A      'PAIt k .- ?

"I believe you would havebeen sorry, Theo, if I had shuffled off this mortal coil, butwhat made you imagine I had died?"The pallor of Theo's face as she fell back shudderingly onthe pillow was neart-rending. Mrs. Mills answered the ques-tion for Theo."tioWhy, you know you were quite ill at the hospital, Violet,when Theo saw you last. Poor Theo was exhausted watchingbeside'you, so much so that she fell asleep while watching, soDoctor Melville says. He had gone into the room to get hismedicine Mase, at midnight, at the time of the crisis, and wasjust in time to give you your potion himself. As he looked atTheo' white face, exhausted with long watching, he told him-Theo's white face, exllusma whf~-h   gnuld have two patientaself unless she rested at once that he would have two patientson his hands instead of one."It was to Violet Mrs. Mills addressed the words, but sheknew poor hapless Theo would understand her meaning, andTheo did understand, and the most thankful cry that ever went out from human lips broke from hers.At that moment she could have knelt at Dr. MeilTe' feetand ,kissed the hands that had saved her own from stains thatdould never be washed aWway.             a The eyes of Thleo and the old' husekeepar  emO 4 Tbsp-:wt    t fra.

" I have something to say to her."The housekeeper turned and slowly quitted the room.Then Violet flung herself down on her knees by Theo'scouch."Mrs. Mills tells me that you are under the impressionthat I am Harry Strathmore's wife," she said, in a low, unsteady voice. "I must correct the error at once: I am nothis wife, Theo."She did not heed the cry of astonishment that broke fromi  her listener's lips, that had grown white as death, but went onhurriedly:" He never really loved me, Theo, it was only a boyishfancy; from the night you fled from Strathmore Hall andthrew yourself into the rapids he was never the same. Thechange in the man I worshiped so fondly maddened me. Iaccused him of caring for you, and the answer he made mewent like a dagger through my heart-it made me a fiend in-carnate." 'You are right, Violet,- le answered, 'I do love Theo;no other woman shall ever take her vacant place in my heart.1 admit to you, frankly, that while we were plighting our troth- at the major's bedside such an idea as loving her never en-tered my head. No man cares for a prospective bride whohas been forced upon him as Theo was. But the moment myheart did awaken to the truth, and to the power of a mightypassionate love, was in the moment poor Theo confronted usas you and I, Violet, stood clasped in each other's arms be-moaning the fatal betrothal that had put us asunder. Thepitiful cry the poor child uttered, and her words: "Heavenhelp me, Harry Strathmore! I thought you loved me as dearlyas I love you!" went to my heart.: " ' As dearly as I love you,' those words thrilled me like anelectric shook and then and there my heart went out to Theo.While 1 live I shall kiss no other woman's lips. Ah, Violet,that solemn betrothal was broken because your fair face camebetween me and my pledge.'.." That was the answer he made me, Theo," Violet went on,sobbingly, " and Harry and I parted then and there. Thatwas three long years ago, and 1 have never seen him sinceuntil last week; he came to see me at the hospital when I wasill. He came again yesterday begging me to come and seeyou, Theo, and tell you how matters were and to tell you hehad read the letter you wrote him, and that he was coming tosee you as soon as the doctor would permit him to do so."<pb n="163"/>ALL FOR LOVE OP A FAIR PACE.            163To describe the emotions that filled Theo's heart as shelistened to Violet's recital; the hope, the joy, the yearning cryof her very soul for the lover who had been so true to hermemory, even though he believed his love for her had comeinto his heart too late, would take a cleverer pen than mine." There is something else I have to tell you, Thee," wenton Violet in a low, husky voice-" a secret that has beenweighing my heart down, wearing my life out. The secret ofwhy Major Strathmore wishes to see you the betrothed brideof Harry Strathmore, his heir, ere he passed away."With penitent tears Violet confessed to the dastardly deedshe had done in personating Theo during the major's last mo-ments, while he, believing her to be Theo, had whispered astartling revelation into her ears, bidding her take the silverkey from the chain about his neck, and after he was deadsearch in the old iron-bound chest in the tower for the proof ofwhat he had said. The papers were there." At the first opportunity I secured them," continued Vio-let, " and 1 found out then why he was so anxious that a be-trothal should take place between you and his son. Are youtoo weak to listen, Theo?" asked Violet. "It is a startlingstory. ""No, no! go on, I pray you!" gasped Theo, clutching ather heart with one hand and the other seeking Violet's as ifin token of forgiveness for what she had done." I will tell it briefly," said Violet.  "You have heard thestory of how the major's wife, Harry's mother, died in hisearly infancy?" she asked, " and you have heard too that themajor's heart was buried in his wife's grave. That was thereason the world gave out why he never married again.""Yes," responded Theo."It was quite false. The world was cheated of a greatsensation then, for Major Strathmore did marry again, thoughthe secret was well hidden from the knowledge of all men." Harry was three years of age when his mother died.Seven years later the major met and loved a fair-haired littlewidow whose worldly possessions were a beautiful face, anempty purse, and a little daughter of two summers.The major's wooing culminated in a speedy marriage,ind for a few short months life, youth, love, and happinessbloomed anew for the major. There cane a terrible ending:in a steamboat accident, the major's wife lost her young lifeand he was left to mourn, and with the little child his wifead left he started back to Strathmore  all. Bu en route h, changed his mind, Why tell the world he had uaried  .         _<pb n="164"/>18 14 I ,    AALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACr.;  'and the tragic fate of his lovely young wife? He could notb' bear,t  t thought that the deepest and sorest wound of his life;: 0oMd be laid bare before the world; better eternal silencethan that."He took his young wife's child to a relative who lived inDover. Ah! you start, Theo, the truth bursts upon you:yes, yqu were that child, Theo; Major Strathmore was yourstep-father, but he loved you with a passion that was almostpain, because you were his lost Evelyn's only child." ' He made over half of his fortune to you, Theo, and the^I dearest wish of his heart was that in after years his son Harry'' should wed with his Evelyn's child.:" He had a monomania upon the subject, brooding over it'by night and by day. As the years went by I believe that hegregretted not having made known that second marriage, andf::  t that you, Theora Chester, was his step-daughter, heiress to halfof his estate.c "'Harry would set all this straight in good time,' he toldhimself.'a ''  " -When he told his son that he had a bride already selectedi'  forshim, the young man flatly refused to fall in with his-  father's plans, declaring that he was capable of choosing his:own wife when he was ready to marry.1  "A stormy scene, ensued, and to make matters worse, hot-:  headed Harry declared that he would not marry his father's: ward, whoever she was, if every hair of her head was hungwith gold, and that he was fully prepared to hate her on sight.It was then that the major disinherited his son, turning himaway from Strathmore Hall. The papers which deed half of-  the Strathmore estate to you, I found just as the major had; said, in the old iron-bound chest.1' "I thought no one else knew of their existence; but it' seemed that Frank Hawthorne, an ex-secretary of the major,P  knew of them, and one night when I had gone down to the'  Heuron's Pool to cast the papers into its depths, this man sur->:f  priaed me there, taking the papers from me.I' "'If Theora Chester is an heiress I will marry her if I can,'l:;  he cried, with an exultant laugh."Ai:  With the news of your death the man disappeared, though[S i-: a year later all the papers, intact, were sent to the lawyer who:;  has, charge of the late major's estates. None knew fromw,1  * hence they came, and at last they were given in charge of: ]rry Strathmore.i  : "Say that you forgive me, Theo," she added in conclusLoX."4 'i-,*w-:   that I . tried to lure Harry from you, and the prop*  I<pb n="165"/>ALL   olt LOVE OF A FAIR FAC.           65at ill always follows those who interfere in a betrohal hasoome home to me."I have not been happy, 1 am wretched now; I will notdo not love Harry Strathmore still, for 1 do, but his heart isyours, Thee." But for me you would have been his bride three long yearsago, and that death-bed betrothal solemnly fulfilled."Let those take warning who would interfere and puttasunder those who are bound to each other by solemn betrothalWith these words Violet kissed her and hurriedly quittedthe room.CHAPTER XL.VIOLET KENSINGTON'S thrilling narrative produced a won-derful effect upon Theo. When Mrs. Mills returned she foundher weeping for very joy; the housekeeper could well under-stand why, but all she.said was:"You see, my dear, Harry has loved you from the first,better than you knew."The clinging pressure of Theo's hands answered her.From that moment her improvement was rapid; perhaps itwas heightened by the knowledge that Harry Strathmore wasunder the same roof with her, How her heart beat at thethought!Two days later she was so far recovered as to sit at the win-dow in a great willow rocker. Mrs. Mills had taken much pains with Theo's toilet thatday, declaring it made her think of old times to see prettyMiss Theo robed in a dress of spotless white. She had crim-son roses on her breast and in the meshes of her bonny goldencurls, while her beautiful dark eyes shone with unwonted brill-iancy, and a flush, delicate as the pink tint of a sea-shell,deepened in her round, dimpled cheeks.Mrs. Winfield and Florence Vale had been sent for by Harryto help plead his cause with Theo before he should see her;and both came at once, and both did their best for Uarry's&interest; but if they had not spoken one word in his favor theresult would have been the same, for the most powerful agenti of all was pleading for him-Theo's own glad, throbbing heart.That afternoon Mrs. Winfield and Florence Valenm4ade in-.: auerabhle :excuses to leave Theo alone- even Mrs.  ill-ipioked up her sewing, declaring that .he  ist esmoj <pb n="166"/>-  OI       ALL FOR LOVE OF A PAIR POAE.shine in the garden below, and that Theo should call her iishe needed her-she would be within calling distance, in caseshe was wanted.So Theo-our pretty, blushing Theo-sat by the rose-embowered window alone-alone, did I say? Well, I don'tmean quite that: she had the happiest companions about herthat ever cheered a young girl's heart-her own sweetthoughts, for they were sweet. She was thinking of hand-some Harry Strathmore, and wondering if God really meantto give her so much happiness as his love. She was wonder-ing how she would greet him-what words she should use.Her heart beat and her hands trembled at the thought.The door had opened softly; a tall figure stood upon thethreshold, his heart in his eyes, as he watched the slender fig-ure in the window.He crossed the room softly and stood beside her.Theo was looking dreamily from the window, wonderingwhy the sunlight at that moment seemed to take on a moregolden hue, why the birds singing in the branches withoutseemed so joyous as they looked at her with their bright,black, knowing eyes, and why her heart had commenced tobeat with a rapture so sweet and keen it was almost pain?She turned around uneasily and then she saw him.Harry Strathmore was standing beside her with extendedarms, and a light on his handsome, fair face that she hadnever seen there before."Theo, my darling," he whispered, softly.With a little quivering cry she rose to her feet, and the nextlm  moment Harry Strathmore's strong arms infolded her, thebeautiful golden head was pillowed upon his throbbing heart,r and love's passionate kisses were pressed upon the lovely quiv-ering mouth and the fair sweet face.It was quite an hour before Mrs. Winfield and Florence Valereturned, and when they saw Harry Strathmore and pretty,shy, blushing Theo sitting on the divan by the window to-gether, his arm about her slender waist, it was easy for themto surmise Theo had not missed them.What they said in that sweet hour of reconciliation we canonly guess; all lovers use the same beautiful language.Harry Strathmore led Theo up to where his aunt stood smil-ing upon them.Theo has promised to become my wife," he said, simply.The next moment Theo was sobbing happy tears upon Mrs.Winfield's breast, while her hands were clasDed in FlorenoeT''le's.<pb n="167"/>Ai   FOR iMVF OP A fAtR PACE.          16Theo made no proud stately bride to reign at StrathmoreHall. She was simply sweet and good, and her adoring younghusband loved her all the better for it.They took no tour abroad. Harry took his bride back toStrathmore Hall, and it would have brought tears to eyes leastused to them to see how they welcomed her at the grand oldHall-beautiful Thee who had been returned to them sostrangely. Mrs. Mills accompanied them back to the Hall.Two persons read the notice of their marriage with whitefaces and bitter pain in their hearts: one, a young doctor wornand haggard, sitting in his office far into the midnight hour.He took a faded blossom from his pocket, tore it sorrowfullyinto shreds and flung it to the breeze." Thus do I tear your image from my heart, sweet The ,"he said, sadly. "I pray Godthat the choice you have madewill prove a happy one.'"Never from that day was Walter Melville known to lookkindly upon a woman's face.The other one who read the notice of their marriage wasViolet Kensington. She remembered how she had tried topart them and failed so ignominiously, and a sigh broke fromher lips for the lover whom she had lost.Harry Strathmore and his bride are happy now, and thebetrothal, which was broken for the sake of afair. false faoehas been cemented by the marriage-bond.,                                                      -/:-'                    ' :                              Ll IB                              SD>^.f fe^ In >4<pb n="1"/><pb n="2"/><pb n="1"/>LAURA JEAN LIBBEY'SCharming       StoriesPUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM.10 Cents Each; Any Three for 25 Cents;        ' The Nine for 50 Cents.These books are 12mos, printed on good paper, in large, bolderpe, and bound in neat paper covers.ALL FOR LOVE OF A FAIR FACE.LITTLE ROSEBUD'S LOVERS.DAISY BROOKS.BEAUTIFUL IONE'S LOVER.LEONIE LOCKE.A STRUGGLE FOR A HEART.MADOLIN RIVERS.JUNIE'S LOVE-TEST.THE HEIRESS OF CAMERON HALLAny of the above books sent by mail, postpaid, on receipt of 10cents per copy, three copies for 25 cents, and all nine books for 50cents.

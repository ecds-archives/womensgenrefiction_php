SISTER SUSY.
CHAPTER I.
KEEPING SECRETS.

<p>We might begin this story of Susy Parlin on a New Year's day, only it is so hard to skip over Christmas. There is such a charm about Christmas! It makes you think at once of a fir tree shining with little candles and sparkling with toys, or of a droll Santa Claus with a pack full of presents, or of a waxen angel called the Christ-child.</p>
<p>And it is just as well to date from the twenty-fifth of December, because, as "Christ was born on Christmas day," that is really the "Happy New Year."</p>

<pb n="6 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>For a long while the three little Parlin girls had been thinking and dreaming of presents. Susy's wise head was like a bee-hive, full of little plans and little fancies, which were flying about like bees, and buzzing in everybody's ears.</p>
<p>But it may be as well to give you a short description of the Parlin family.</p>
<p>Susy's eyes were of an "evening blue," the very color of the sky in a summer night; good eyes, for they were as clear as a well which has the "truth" lying at the bottom of it. She was almost as nimble as a squirrel, and could face a northern snow storm like an engineer. Her hair was dark brown, and as smooth and straight as pine-needles; while Prudy's fair hair rippled like a brook running over pebbles. Prudy's face was sunny, and her mouth not much larger than a button-hole.</p>

<pb n="7 KEEPING SECRETS "/>

<p>The youngest sister was named Alice, but the family usually called her Dotty, or Dotty Dimple, for she was about as round as a period, and had a cunning little dimple in each cheek. She had bright eyes, long curls, and a very short tongue; that is, she did not talk much. She was two years and a half old before she could be prevailed upon to say anything at all. Her father declared that Dotty thought there were people enough in the world to do the talking, and she would keep still; or perhaps she was tired of hearing Prudy say so much.</p>
<p>However, she had a way of nodding her curly head, and shaking her plump little forefinger; so everybody knew very well what she meant. She had learned the use of signs from a little deaf and dumb boy of whom we shall hear more by and by; but all at once, when she was ready she began 

<pb n="8 SISTER SUSY "/>

to talk with all her might, and soon made up for lost time.</p>
<p>The other members of the family were only grown people: Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, the children's excellent parents; Mrs. Read, their kind Quaker grandmother; and the Irish servant girl, Norah.</p>
<p>Just now Miss Margaret Parlin, their "aunt Madge," was visiting them, and the little girls felt quite easy about Christmas, for they gave it all up to her; and when they wanted to know how to spend their small stock of money, or how much this or that pretty toy would cost, Prudy always settled it by saying, "Let's go ask auntie: <hi rend="italic'>she'll</hi> know, for she's been through the Rithmetic."</p>
<p>Prudy spoke these words with awe. She thought "going through the Rithmetic" was next thing to going round the world.</p>

<pb n="9 KEEPING SECRETS"/>

<p>"0 Auntie, I'm so glad you came," said Susy," for I didn't see how I was ever going to finish my Christmas presents: I go to school, you know, and it takes me all the rest of the time to slide!"</p>
<p>The children were busy making wonderful things "all secret;" or they would have been secret if Prudy hadn't told.</p>
<p>For one thing, she wondered very much what Susy could be doing with four pins stuck in a spool. She watched the nimble fingers as they passed the worsted thread over the pin-heads, making stitches as fast as Susy could wink.</p>
<p>"It looks like a teenty snake all sticked through the hole in the spool," said Prudy, eager with curiosity. "If you ain't a-goin' to speak, I don't know what I <hi rend="italic'>shall</hi> do, Susy Parlin!"</p>
<p>When poor Susy could not pretend any

<pb n="10 SISTER SUSY"/>

longer not to hear, she answered Prudy, half vexed, half laughing, "0, dear, I s'pose you'll tease and tease till you find out. Won't you never say a word to anybody, <hi rend="italic'>never</hi>?"</p>
<p>"Never in my world," replied the little one, with a solemn shake of her head.</p>
<p>"Well, it's a lamp-mat for auntie. It's going to be blue, and red, and all colors; and when it's done, mother'll sew it into a round, and put fringe on: won't it be splendid? But remember, you promised not to tell!"</p>
<p>Now, the very next time Prudy sat in her auntie's lap she whispered in her ear,--</p>
<p>"You don' know what <hi rend="italic'>we're</hi> making for you, <hi rend="italic'>all secret</hi>, out of worsted, and I shan't tell!"</p>
<p>"Mittens?" said aunt Madge, kissing Prudy's lips, which were pressed together over her sweet little secret like a pair of sugar-tongs clinching a lump of sugar.</p>

<pb n="11 KEEPING SECRETS "/>

<p>"Mittens? No, indeed! Better'n that! There'll be fringe all over it; it's in a round; it's to put something on,--to put the <hi rend="italic'>lamp</hi> on!"</p>
<p>"Not a lamp-mat, of course?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes it is! 0, there, now you've been and guessed all in a minute! Susy's gone an' told! I didn't s'pose she'd tell. <hi rend="italic'>I</hi> wouldn't for nothin' in my world! "</p>
<p>Was it strange that Susy felt vexed when she found that her nice little surprise was all spoiled?</p>
<p>"Try to be patient," said Mrs. Parlin, gently. "Remember how young and thoughtless your sister is. She never means any harm."</p>
<p>"0, but, mamma," replied Susy, "she <hi rend="italic'>keeps</hi> me being patient all the whole time, and it's hard work."</p>
<p>So Susy, in her vexation, said to Prudy,

<pb n="12 SISTER SUSY"/>

rather sternly, "You little naughty thing, to go and tell when you promised not to! You're almost as bad as Dotty. What makes you act so?"</p>
<p>"Why, Susy," said the child, looking up through her tears, "have I <hi rend="italic'>acted</hi>? I didn't know I'd acted! If you loved me, you wouldn't look that way to me. You wrinkle up your face just like Nanny when she says she'll shake the naughty out of me, Miss Prudy."</p>
<p>Then what could Susy do but forgive the sweet sister, who kissed her so coaxingly, and looked as innocent as a poor little kitty that has been stealing cream without knowing it is a sin?</p>
<p>It was plain that it would not do to trust Prudy with secrets. Her brain could not hold them, any more than a sieve can hold water. So Mrs. Parlin took pity upon Susy,

<pb n="13 KEEPING SECRETS"/>

and allowed her and her cousin Florence Eastman to lock themselves into her chamber at certain hours, and work at their presents without interruption.</p>
<p>While the little girls sat together, busily employed with book-marks and pin-cushions, the time flew very swiftly, and they were as happy as bees in a honeysuckle.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parlin said she believed nothing less than Christmas presents would ever make Susy willing to use a needle and thread; for she disliked sewing, and declared she wished the man who made the needles had to swallow them all.</p>
<p>The family were to celebrate Christmas evening; for Mr. Parlin was away, and might not reach home in season for Christmas eve.</p>
<p>For a wonder they were not to have a Tree, but a Santa Claus, "just for a change."</p>

<pb n="14 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>"Not a truly Santa Claus, that comes puffin' down the chimney," explained Prudy, who knew very well it would be only cousin Percy under a mask and white wig.</p>

<pb n="15"/>

CHAPTER II
BEFORE DAYLIGHT

<p>On Christmas morning, at three o'clock, there was a great bustle and pattering of little feet, and buzzing of little voices trying to speak in whispers. Susy and Prudy were awake and astir.</p>
<p>"Where <hi rend="italic'>do</hi> you s'pose the stockings are?" buzzed Prudy, in a very loud whisper.</p>
<p>"Right by the bed-post, Prudy Parlin; and
if you don't take care we'll wake everybody up,--'Sh! 'Sh!"</p>
<p>"Mine's pinned on," said Prudy; "and I've pricked my fingers. 0, deary me!"</p>
<p>"Well, of course you've waked 'em all

<pb n="16 SISTER SUSY"/>

now," exclaimed Susy, indignantly: "I might have pricked my fingers to pieces, but I wouldn't have said a word."</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, who were in the next room, were wide awake by this time; but they said nothing, only listened to the whispers of the children, which grew fainter, being smothered and kept down by mouthfuls of candy, lozenges, and peanuts.</p>
<p>The little girls longed for daybreak. The sun, however, seemed to be in no haste, and it was a long while before there was a peep of light. Susy and Prudy waited, wondering whether the sun would really forget to show his face; but all the while they waited they were eating candy; so it was neither dull nor lonely. As for closing their eyes again, they would have scorned the idea. It would be a pity indeed to fall asleep, and lose the pleasure of saying " Merry Christ-

<pb n="17 BEFORE DAYLIGHT"/>

mas" to everybody. Norah, the Irish servant, had said she should be up very early to attend High Mass: they must certainly waylay her on the stairs. How astonished she would be, when she supposed they were both soundly asleep!</p>
<p>"Let me do it myself," said Susy: "you stay here, Prudy, for you'll be sure to make a noise."</p>
<p>"I'll go on my tippy toes," pleaded Prudy, her mouth half filled with chocolate drops.</p>
<p>So through their mother's room they stole softly, only throwing over one chair, and hitting Dotty's crib a little in their haste. Dotty made a sleepy sound of alarm, and Prudy could not help laughing, but only "in her sleeve," that is, in her "nightie"' sleeve, which she put up to her mouth to smother the noise.</p>
<p>When they had reached the back-stairs

<pb n="18 SISTER SUSY"/>

Susy whispered, "O, Norah is up and gone down. I hear her in the kitchen. 'Sh! 'Sh!"</p>
<p>Susy thought there was no time to be lost, and she would have rushed down stairs, two steps at a time, but her little sister was exactly in the way.</p>
<p>"Somebody has been and tugged my little chair up here," said Prudy, " and I must tug it back again."</p>
<p>So in the dim light the two children groped their way down stairs, Prudy going first with the chair.</p>
<p>"0, what a little snail! Hurry--can't you?" said Susy, impatiently; "Norah'll be gone! What's the use of our waking up in the night if we can't say Merry Christmas to anybody?"</p>
<p>"Well, <hi rend="italic'>ain't</hi> I a-hurryin' now?" exclaimed
Prudy, plunging forward and falling, chair and all, the whole length of the stairs.</p>

<pb n="19 BEFORE DAYLIGHT"/>

<p>All the house was awake now, for Prudy screamed lustily. Grandma Read called out from the passage-way,--</p>
<p>"0, little Prudence, has thee broken thy neck?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Parlin rushed out, too frightened to speak, and Mr. Parlin ran down stairs, and took Prudy up in his arms.</p>
<p>"It was-you--did it--Susy Parlin," sobbed the child. "I shouldn't-have--fell, if you--hadn't-have--screamed."</p>
<p>The poor little girl spoke slowly and with difficulty, as if she dropped a bucket into her full heart, and drew up the words one at a time.</p>
<p>"0, mother, I know it was me," said Susy meekly; "and I was careless, and it was all in the dark. I'm sure I hope Prudy'll forgive me."</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't you, neither," said Prudy,

<pb n="20 SISTER SUSY"/>

whose good humor was restored the moment Susy had made what she considered due confession. "You never touched me, Susy! It was the <hi rend="italic'>chair</hi>; and I love you just as dearly as ever I did."</p>
<p>Prudy lay on the sofa for some time, looking quite pale by the gas-light, while her mother rubbed her side, and the rest of the family stood looking at her with anxious faces.</p>
<p>It was quite an important occasion for Prudy, who always liked to be the centre of attraction.</p>
<p>"0, mamma," said she, closing her eyes languidly, "when the room makes believe whirl round, does it <hi rend="italic'>truly</hi> whirl round?"</p>
<p>The truth was, she felt faint and dizzy, though only for a short time.</p>
<p>"I wish," said she, "it had been somebody else that fell down stairs, and not me, for I

<pb n="21 BEFORE DAYLIGHT"/>

didn't go down easy! The <hi rend="italic'>prongs</hi> of the chair pushed right into my side."</p>
<p>But it did not appear that Prudy was much injured, after all. In a few minutes she was skipping about the room almost as nimbly as ever, only stopping to groan every now and then, when she happened to think of it.</p>
<p>"It is a wonder," said Mr. Parlin, "that more children are not lamed for life by such accidents."</p>
<p>"I have often thought of it," said aunt Madge. "Some little ones seem to be making hair-breadth escapes almost every day of their lives. I believe Prudy would have been in her grave long ago, if it had not been for her guardian angel."</p>
<p>The long-expected Christmas had come at last, and Prudy had stumbled into it, as she stumbled into everything else. But it is an ill wind which blows no good to anybody;

<pb n="22 SISTER SUSY"/>

and it so happened that in all this confusion Susy was able to "wish a Merry Christmas" to Norah, and to the whole family besides.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Parlin found that the children were too thoroughly awake to go to sleep again that morning, she told them they might dress themselves in the parlor if they would keep as quiet as possible, and let the rest of the household take another nap.</p>
<p>It all seemed very strange and delightful to the little girls. It was like another sort of life, this new arrangement of stealing about the house in the silent hours before daybreak. Susy thought she should like to sit up all night, and sleep all day, if the mayor would only hush the streets; it would be so odd!</p>
<p>"0, how dark the clouds are!" said Prudy, peeping out of the window; "it <hi rend="italic'>fogs</hi> so I can't see a single thing. Susy, I'm

<pb n="23 BEFORE DAYLIGHT"/>

going to keep <hi rend="italic'>at watch</hi> of the sky. Don't you s'pose, though, 'twill be Christmas all the same, if there's a snow storm? "</p>
<p>"There's been snow," said Susy, " all in the night. Look down at the pavement. Don't you wish that was frosted cake?"</p>
<p>"0, the snow came in the night, so not to wake us up," cried Prudy, clapping her hands; "but it wouldn't have waked us, you know, even in the night, for it came so still."</p>
<p>"But why don't the clouds go off?" she added, sadly.</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied Susy; "perhaps they are waiting till the sun comes and smiles them away."</p>
<p>Such happy children as these were, as they sat peeping out of the window at the dull gray sky!</p>
<p>They did not know that a great mischief

<pb n="24 SISTER SUSY"/>

was begun that morning--a mischief which was no larger yet than a "a midge's wing." They were watching the clouds for a snow storm; but they never dreamed of such things as clouds of <hi rend="italic'>trouble</hi>, which grow darker and darker, and which even the beautiful Christmas sun cannot "smile away."</p>

<pb n="25 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

CHAPTER III
SUSY'S CHRISTMAS

<p>It was bright and beautiful all day, and then, when no one could possibly wait any longer, it was Christmas evening. The coal glowed in the grate with a splendid blaze: all the gas-burners were lighted, and so were everybody's eyes. If one had listened, one might have heard, from out of doors, a joyful tinkling of sleigh-bells; yet I fancy nobody could have told whether the streets were still or noisy, or whether the sky had a moon in it or not; for nobody was quiet
long enough to notice.</p>

<pb n="26 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>But by and by, when the right time had come, the folding-doors were opened, just like the two covers to a Christmas fairy book. Then, in a second, it was so still you might have heard a pin drop.</p>
<p>Such a funny little old gentleman had arrived: his face alive with dimples, and smiles, and wrinkles. His cheeks were as red and round as winter apples, and where there wasn't a wrinkle there was a dimple; and no doubt there was a dimple in his chin, and his chin maybe was double, only you couldn't tell, for it was hidden ever so deep under a beard as white as a snow-drift.</p>
<p>He walked along, tottering under the weight of a huge pack full of presents. He extended his small arms towards the audience most affectionately, and you could see that his antiquated coat-sleeves were bristling with toys and glistening with ornaments.

<pb n="27 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

His eyes twinkled with fun, and his mouth, which seemed nearly worn out with laughing, grew bigger every minute.</p>
<p>It took the dear old gentleman some time to clear his throat; but when he had found his voice, which at first was as fine as a knitting-needle, and all of a tremble, he made</p>

<p>THE SPEECH OF SANTA CLAUS.</p>

<p>"How do, my darlings? How do, all round? Bless your little hearts, how do you all do? Did they tell ye Santa wasn't a-comin', my dears? Did your grandpas and grandmas say, 'Humph! there isn't any such a person.' My love to the good old people. I know they mean all right; but tell them they'll have to give it up now!"</p>
<p>(Here Santa Claus made a low bow. Everybody laughed and clapped; but Prudy whispered, "0, don't he look old all over?

<pb n="28 SISTER SUSY"/>

What has he done with his <hi rend="italic'> teeth </hi>? 0, dear, has anybody pulled 'em out?")</p>
<p>"Yes, my dears," continued the old gentleman, encouraged by the applause,--" yes, my dears, here I am, as jolly as ever! But bless your sweet little hearts, I've had a terrible time getting here! The wind has been blowin' me up as fierce as you please, and I've been shook round as if I wasn't of more account than a kernel of corn in a popper!</p>
<p>"0, 0, I've been ducked up to the chin in some awful deep snow-drifts, up there by the North Pole! This is the very first time the storms have come so heavy as to cover over the end of the North Pole! But this year they had to dig three days before they could find it. 0, ho!</p>
<p>"I was a-wanderin' round all last night; a real shivery night, too! Got so <hi rend="italic'>broke up</hi>, there's nothing left of me but small pieces. 0, hum!</p>

<pb n="29 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

<p>"Such a time as I had in some of those chimneys, you haven't any idee! Why, if you'll believe me, over there in Iceland somebody forgot to clear out the chimney, and there I stuck fast, like a fish-bone in your throat; couldn't be picked out, couldn't be swallowed!</p>
<p>"The funniest time that was! How I laughed! And then the children's mother woke up, and, 'O, dear,' said she; 'hear the wind sigh down the chimney!' 'Only me,' says I; 'and I've caught you napping this time!' She helped me out, and when I had caught my breath, I climbed out the window; but, deary me, I shouldn't wonder if that very woman went to sleep again, and thought it was all a dream! Heigh-ho! that's the way they always treat poor Santa Claus nowadays."</p>
<p>(Here the children laughed, and Susy

<pb n="30 SISTER SUSY"/>

said, "I guess he must have bumped his nose against that chimney: see what a hump !")</p>
<p>"0, 0, don't you make sport of me, children! My nose is big, to be sure, but I'm  going to keep it and make the best of it! If you loved Santa as he loves you, you wouldn't mind the looks. I <hi rend="italic'>was</hi> going to change my coat and dickey; but, then, thinks I, I'll come just as I am! I patted myself on the shoulder, and says I, 'Santa Claus, don't you fret if you <hi rend="italic'>are</hi>, growin' old! You may look a little dried up, but your heart isn't wrinkled; 0 no!' You see father Adam and me was very near of an age, but somehow I never growed up! I always thought big folks did very well in their place; but for my part, give me the children. Hurrah for the children!"</p>
<p>(Great clapping and laughing.)</p>

<pb n="31 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

<p>"I tell you, darlings, I haven't forgot a single one of you. My pockets are running over. I've been preparing presents for you ever since last fall, when the birds broke up housekeeping.</p>
<p>"Here's a tippet for the Prudy girl, and she may have it for nothing; and they are cheaper 'n that, if you take 'em by the quantity.</p>
<p>"I'm a walkin' book-case. Why, I've brought stories and histories enough to set up a store! I've got more nuts than you can shake a hammer at; but I think there's more bark to 'em than there is bite. 0, 0, I find I can't crack 'em with my teeth, as I used to a hundred years ago!</p>
<p>"But my dear, sweet, cunning little hearers, I must be a-goin'. Queen Victoria, said she to me, said she, 'Now,

<pb n="32 SISTER SUSY"/>

Santa, my love, do you hurry back to fill my children's stockings before the clock strikes twelve.' Queen Vic is an excellent woman, and is left a poor widow; so I can't disappoint her, poor soul!</p>
<p>"I must be a-goin'! Would like to hug and kiss you all round, but can't stop. (Kisses his hand and bows.) A Merry Christmas to you all, and a Happy New Year."</p>
<p>So saying, Santa Claus suddenly disappeared at the hall door, dropping his heavy pack upon the table. In another minute the lively old gentleman was in the front parlor without any mask, and of course it was nobody but cousin Percy, "with his face off."</p>
<p>Then they all fell to work sorting out presents. Prudy seized her fur tippet, and put it on at once.</p>

<pb n="33 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

<p>"0, how pretty I look," said she; "just like a little cat! <hi rend="italic'>Ain't</hi> I cunning?"</p>
<p>But nobody could pause to attend to Prudy, though she chatted very fast, without commas or periods, and held up to view a large wax doll which "would be alive if it could talk." They all had gifts as well as Prudy, and wished to talk rather than to listen. They asked questions without waiting for answers, and did not mind interrupting one another, and talking all at once, like a party of school children.</p>
<p>All this was hardly polite, it is true; but people are sometimes surprised out of their good manners on Christmas evenings, and must be forgiven for it, as such a good time happens but once a year.</p>
<p>Percy broke in with an old song, and went through with a whole stanza of it, although no one listened to a word:--

<pb n="34 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>" Good luck unto old Christmas,</p>
<p>And long life let us sing,</p>
<p>For he doeth more good unto the poor</p>
<p>Than many a crowned king."</p>
<p>"My beautiful books!" cried aunt Madge; "Russia morocco."</p>
<p>"My writing-desk,--has any one looked at it?" said Mrs. Parlin; "rosewood, inlaid with brass."</p>
<p>"My skates!" broke in Susy, at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>"Hush!" screamed cousin Percy;--"won't anybody please notice my drum? If you won't look, then look out for a drum in each ear!"</p>
<p>And, as nobody would look or pay the slightest attention, they all had to hear "Dixie" pounded out in true martial style, till they held on to their ears.</p>
<p>"Rattlety bang!" went the drum.

<pb n="35 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

"Tweet, tweet," whistled the little musical instruments which the children were blowing.</p>
<p>"Have pity on us!" cried aunt Madge; "I am bewildered; my head is floating like a Chinese garden."</p>
<p>"Order!" shouted Mr. Parlin, laughing.</p>
<p>"0, yes, sir," said Percy, seizing Susy and whirling her round. "Children, why don't you try to preserve order? My nerves are strung up like violin-strings! I've got a pound of headache to every ounce of brains. Susy Parlin, do try to keep still!"</p>
<p>"Thee needn't pretend it is all Susan," said grandma Read, smiling. "Thee and little Prudence are the noisiest of the whole!"</p>
<p>In fact, they raised such a din, that after a while poor grandma Read smoothed the

<pb n="36 SISTER SUSY"/>

Quaker cap over her smiling face, and stole off into her own chamber, where she could "settle down into quietness." Much noise always confused grandma Read.</p>
<p>But in a very few moments, when the excitement began to die out, there was a season of overwhelming gratitude. Everybody had to thank everybody else; and Mr. Parlin, who had a beautiful dressing-gown to be grateful for, nevertheless found time to tell Susy, over and over again, how delighted he was with her book-mark, made, by her own fingers, of three wide strips of velvet ribbon; on the ends of which were fastened a cross, a star, and an anchor, of card-board.</p>
<p>"Papa, one ribbon is to keep your place in the Old Testament," said Susy; "one is to stay in the middle, at the births and marriages; and the other one is for our chapter in the New Testament, you know."</p>

<pb n="37 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

<p>"I think my lamp-mat is very pretty," said aunt Madge, kissing Susy; "every bit as pretty as if Prudy hadn't 'been and told.'"</p>
<p>Prudy had bought a shawl-pin for her mother, a fierce little wooden soldier for aunt Madge, and something for everybody else but Susy. Not that she forgot Susy. 0, no! but one's money does not always hold out, even at Christmas time.</p>
<p>"Why," said Mr. Parlin, "what is this sticking fast to the sole of my new slipper? Molasses candy, I do believe."</p>
<p>"Yes sir; that's for Susy," cried Prudy, suddenly remembering how she had tucked it in at the last moment, when she could not stop to find any wrapping-paper. "It isn't so big as it was, but it's the biggest piece I had in this world. I saved it last night. Susy likes 'lasses candy, and I couldn't think of nothin' else."</p>

<pb n="38 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>It was a wonder that Prudy's candy had not spoiled some of the nice presents.</p>
<p>Susy received several pretty things; and though she did not talk quite so much as Prudy, she was just as happy. For one thing, she had what she had not dreamed was possible for a little girl--a bottle of otto of rose; "just like a young lady."</p>
<p>This was a real delight to Susy; but Prudy, sniffing at it, said, coolly, "0, ho! it smells 's if it didn't cost more'n a cent! 'Tisn't half so sweet as pepmint!"</p>
<p>Before Dotty could be put to bed, she had contrived to break several toys, all of which happened to be Susy's--a sugar temple, a glass pitcher, and a small vase.</p>
<p>This was an evening long to be remembered; but the most remarkable event of all was to come.</p>
<p>"Susy, my daughter," said Mr. Parlin,

<pb n="39 SUSY'S CHRISTMAS"/>

"have you been wondering why you don't see a present from me?"</p>
<p>Susy blushed. She had certainly expected something handsome this year from her father.</p>
<p>"I haven't forgotten you, my dear; but the present I have chosen wouldn't sit very well on the shoulders of such a little fellow as Santa Claus."</p>
<p>Percy laughed. "Wouldn't it have been a load, uncle?"</p>
<p>"Hush!" whispered aunt Madge; "she isn't to know till morning."</p>
<p>"But, papa," said Susy, her eyes shining with excitement, "why couldn't you bring it in here now?"</p>
<p>"It is better off out of doors. Indeed, to tell the truth, my child, it is hardly suitable for the parlor."</p>
<p>" Now, Miss Susy," said Percy, measuring

<pb n="40 SISTER SUSY"/>

off his words on the tips of his fingers, "I'm authorized to tell you it's something you mustn't take in your lap, mustn't hang on a nail; if you do, you'll lose it. I'm sure 'twill please you, Susy, because it's a mute, and can't speak. You  -"</p>
<p>"0, hush talking about dumb people! I shouldn't think you'd make sport of Freddy Jackson! If <hi rend="italic'>you</hi> was a little <hi rend="italic'>deaf-and-dumber</hi> than you are now, I'd like you better!</p>
<p>"0, dear, dear!" cried she, dancing about the room; "what can it be? I can't wait </p>
<p>"Only think; all night before I'll know," thought she, as she touched her pillow. "0,Prudy, to-morrow morning! Only think of to-morrow morning! All my other presents are just nothing at all. Anything is so much nicer when you don't know what it is!"</p>

CHAPTER IV.
SUSY'S WINGS.

<p>Susy awoke next morning very much surprised to find the sun so high. Prudy was lying beside her, talking to herself.</p>
<p>"I don't feel very well," said the child; "but I'm pleasant; I mean to be good all day."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you speak to me?" cried Susy, springing out of bed, "when you knew how I couldn't wait to see my present?"</p>
<p>"I would have woke you up, Susy, but I ain't well; I'm sick in my knee."</p>
<p>And Prudy limped about the room to

<pb n="42 SISTER SUSY"/>

show her sister how lame she was. But Susy was in too great a hurry to pay much attention to her, or to help her dress.</p>
<p>"Good morning, papa!" she exclaimed, the moment she entered the parlor; "now may I see the present?"</p>
<p>"Do you suppose you could wait till after breakfast, Susy?"</p>
<p>Aunt Madge smiled as she looked at the little eager face.</p>
<p>"I see you are going on with your lessons," said she.</p>
<p>"What lessons, auntie? Why, it is the holidays!"</p>
<p>"Lessons in patience, my dear. Isn't something always happening which you have to be patient about? "</p>
<p>Susy thought of Prudy's habit of disclosing secrets, Dotty's trying way of destroying playthings; and now this long

<pb n="43 SUSY'S WINGS"/>

delay about her present. She began to think there were a great many vexations in the world, and that she bore them remarkably well for such a little girl.</p>
<p>"Yes, thee must let patience have her perfect work, Susan" said grandma Reed, after the "silent blessing" had been asked at the table.</p>
<p>"Mayn't I go, too?" said Prudy, when she saw her father, her auntie, and Susy leaving the house just after breakfast.</p>
<p>And she went, as a matter of course; but the pavements were a little slippery from sleet; and Prudy, who was never a famous walker, had as much as she could do, even with the help of her father's hand, to keep from falling.</p>
<p>"Why, Prudy," said Mr. Parlin, "what ails you this morning? You limp so much that I believe you need crutches."</p>

<pb n="44 SISTER SUSY"/>
<p>"I'm sick in my knee," replied Prudy, delighted to see that her lameness was observed. "If <hi rend="italic'>you</hi> had my knee, and it hurt, you'd know how it feels!"</p>
<p>By this time they had reached a livery stable; and, to Susy's surprise, her father stopped short, and said to a man who stood by the door, "Mr. Hill, my daughter has come to look for her pony."</p>
<p>Prudy was in great fright at sight of so many horses, and needed all her auntie's attention; but Susy had no fear, and Mr. Parlin led her along to a stall where stood a beautiful black pony, as gentle-looking as a Newfoundland dog.</p>
<p>"How do you like him, Susy? Stroke his face, and talk to him."</p>
<p>"But, O, papa, you don't mean, you can't mean, he's my very own! A whole pony all to myself!"</p>
<pb n="45 SUSY'S WINGS"/>

<p>"See what you think of his saddle, miss," said Mr. Hill, laughing at Susy's eagerness; and he led pony out, and threw over his back a handsome side-saddle.</p>
<p>"Why, it seems as if I could just jump on without anybody touching me," cried Susy.</p>
<p>" Not afraid a bit?" said Mr. Hill, as Mr. Parlin seated Susy in the saddle, and gave her the reins. "Ponies throw people, sometimes."</p>
<p>"0, but my papa would never give me a bad pony," answered Susy, with perfect confidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Hill laughed again. He was a rough man; but he thought a child's faith in a parent was a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>He did not know many passages of Scripture, but thought he had read somewhere, "And if he ask bread, will he give him a 

<pb n="46 SISTER SUSY"/>

stone?" No; fathers are glad to give their "best gifts," and the little ones trust them.</p>
<p>"It's like sailing in a boat," cried Susy, riding back and forth about the yard in great excitement; "why, it's just as easy as the swing in the oilnut-tree at grandma Parlin's! 0, papa, to think I should forget to thank you!"</p>
<p>But perhaps Mr. Parlin regarded glowing, cheeks and shining eyes as the very best of thanks.</p>
<p>Prudy thought the pony a beautiful "baby horse;" wanted to ride, and didn't want to; was afraid, and wasn't afraid, and, as her father said, "had as many minds as some politicians who are said to 'stand on the fence.'" By and by, after some coaxing, the timid little thing consented to sit behind Susy, and cling round her waist, if her father would walk beside her to make</p>

<pb n="47 SUSY'S WINGS"/>

sure she didn't fall off. In this way they went home.</p>
<p>"I like to sit so I can hug my sister, while she drives the horse," said Prudy; "besides, it hurts me to walk."</p>
<p>Mr. Parlin and aunt Madge smiled at the child's speeches, but gave no more heed to this lameness of which she complained, than they did to any of the rest of her little freaks.</p>
<p>Prudy liked to be pitied for every small hurt; and when Susy had a sore throat, and wore a compress, she looked upon her with envy, and felt it almost as a personal slight that her throat could not be wrapped in a compress too.</p>
<p>On their way they met "lame Jessie," a little girl with crooked spine and very high shoulders, who hobbled along on crutches.</p>
<p>"She's lamer than me," said Prudy. "Good morning, Jessie."</p>

<pb n="48 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>"I know what I've thought of," said Susy, who could talk of nothing which was not in some way connected with her pony. "I'm going to give that girl some rides. How happy she will be, poor little Jessie !"</p>
<p>"When you get your sleigh," said Mr. Parlin.</p>
<p>"My sleigh, papa? How many more presents are coming?"</p>
<p>"It is hard to tell, Susy; one gift makes way for another, you see. First comes the pony; but how can he live without a stable, and a groom to feed him? Then what is a pony worth without a saddle? And, as one does not wish always to ride pony-back, sleigh is the next thing."</p>
<p>"But, papa, you know in the summer!"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear, in the summer, if we all live, there must be a light carriage made on purpose for you."</p>

<pb n="49 SUSY'S WINGS"/>

<p>"There is one thing more that pony needs," said aunt Madge, stroking his eyebrows, "and that is, a name."</p>
<p>"O, I never thought of that," said Susy; "help me find a name, auntie."</p>
<p>"Let me think. I should call him something good and pleasant. Think of something you like very much."</p>
<p>"0, Frosted Cake," cried Prudy :" wouldn't that be pleasant? Susy loves that."</p>
<p>"I should like to name him for the American Eagle," said Susy, who had heard some patriotic speeches from her cousin Percy; "only you couldn't pet that name, could you?"</p>
<p>"You might call him Don Carlos, or Don Pedro," suggested Mr. Parlin.</p>
<p>"No, papa; only think of Donny: that is like Donkey! You haven't any long ears, <hi rend="italic'>have</hi> you, pony? If you had, I'd call you

<pb n="50 SISTER SUSY"/>

Little Pitcher, for 'little pitchers have great ears.' That makes me think of Mr. Allen, auntie. How big his ears are, you know! <hi rend="italic'>Is</hi> it because his teacher pulled them so ?"</p>
<p>"0, call him 'Gustus,'" cried Prudy.</p>
<p>" But that would soon be Gusty," said aunt Madge, "and would sound too much like the east wind."</p>
<p>"Deary me," sighed Susy; "who'd ever think it was such hard work to find names?"</p>
<p>"0, look," said Prudy, as they passed a jaded old horse; "there is a pony just exactly like this! Only it's twice as big, you know, and not a <hi rend="italic'>bit</hi> such a color!"</p>
<p>"Well, there, Prudy," said Susy, disdainfully, "I thought, when you began to speak, you was going to tell something! Why don't you wait till you have something to say? Please give me a list of names, papa."</p>
<p>"There's Speedwell, Lightfoot, Zephyr, Prince, Will-o'-the-wisp--"</p>

<pb n="51 SUSY'S WINGS"/>

<p>"I might call him Wispy," broke in Susy. "Zephyr is good, only it makes you think of worsteds."</p>
<p>"Now, listen," said aunt Madge; "you might call him Elephant, just for sport, because he is in reality so very little. Or, on the other hand, you might find the least speck of a name, like Firefly, or Midge."</p>
<p>"I don't like any of those," replied Susy, still disatisfied.</p>
<p>"I see," said aunt Madge, laughing, "nothing will please you but a great name. What say to Pegasus, a flying horse, which poets are said to ride? It might be shortened to Peggy."</p>
<p>"Now, auntie, you wouldn't have this beautiful pony called Peggy; you know you wouldn't! the one my father bought on purpose for me! But was there such a horse, truly?"</p>

<pb n="52 SISTER SUSY"/>

"0, no; there is an old fable, which, as we say, is 'as true now as it ever was,' of a glorious creature with wings, and whoever mounts him gets a flying ride into the clouds. But the trouble is to catch him!"</p>
<p>"0, I wish my pony could fly," said Susy, gazing dreamily at his black mane and sleek sides. "The first place I'd go to would be the moon; and there I'd stay till I built a castle as big as a city. I'd come home every night, so mother wouldn't be frightened, and fly up in the morning, and--and--"</p>
<p>"See here," said Prudy, who had for some time been trying to speak; "call him <hi rend="italic'>Wings</hi>!"</p>
<p>"So I will," answered Susy, quickly, "and I'1l make believe he flies in the air like a bird. Now, auntie, what do you think of Wings?"</p>
<p>"Odd enough, I'm sure, my dear."</p>

<pb n="53 SUSY'S WINGS"/>

<p>"Well, <hi rend="italic'>I</hi> like it," returned Susy, with a positive shake of the head. "It's of no use to keep fussing so long over a name, and I feel a great deal easier, now I've made up my mind! Dear little Wings, you prick up your ears, and I know you like it, too. I wish you had a soul, so you could be taken to church, and christened like a baby."</p>
<p>Just here Susy was startled by a sudden laugh from cousin Percy, who had for some moments been walking behind the pony unobserved.</p>
<p>"You're enough to frighten any one to death," she screamed, "creeping about like a cat."</p>
<p>Susy had a foolish dread of being laughed at.</p>
<p>"Creeping like a cat," echoed Percy, "while you creep like a snail! What will you take for your pony, that can fly in the air like a </p>

<pb n="54 SISTER SUSY"/>

bird, but can't walk on the ground any better than a goose?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," said Susy, quite excited: "if you want to see anybody ride fast, just look here." And she started the pony at full speed, regardless of Prudy, who was so frightened, that she seized poor Wings by his flowing mane, and called out for her sister to stop. But Susy dashed on at a flying pace, and Percy cried after her, "0, Susy, cousin Susy, what think of your Christmas present?</p>
<p>Will you remember not to eat it, and not to hang it on a nail? Susy, Susy?"</p>
<p>There was hardly a happier child living than Susy, during those delightful holidays. She said to herself, sometimes, that this was such a beautiful world, she couldn't think of a single thing that wasn't as splendid as it could be.</p>

<pb n="55 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

CHAPTER V
PRUDY'S TROUBLE.

<p>The happy days flew by. The Old Year was worn out, and the New Year stepped in fresh and youthful. Susy found her little sleigh a very comfortable affair; and so, I think, did "lame Jessie." When her father found that Susy had really chosen for her pony the name of Wings, he ordered a beautiful picture of the Flying Horse to be painted on the dashboard of the sleigh.</p>
<p>Susy was delighted with this, and her vivid fancy took wings at once, and flew away to the other end of the world, where her aunt Madge told her the fountain of Pirene was said to gush out of a hill-side.</p>

<pb n="56 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>"Only think," said she to Flossy; "it was a woman once, that fountain was; but she poured her life all out into tears, crying because her son was killed. So the fountain is made of tears!"</p>
<p>"Bitter and salt, then," said Florence, threading her needle.</p>
<p>"No, indeed; just as sweet and nice as any water. Pegasus loved it; and there was a beautiful young man, his name was Bel--Bel--well, I declare, I've forgotten, --no, 'twas Bellerophon; and he had a bridle, and wanted a horse. 0, do you know this horse was white, with silvery wings, wild as a hawk; and, once in a while, he would fold up his wings, and trot round on the mountain "
<p>Florence yawned, and waxed her thread.</p>
<p>"0, it was a splendid bridle, this man had, made of gold; and I forgot--the moun-

<pb n="57 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

tain the horse trotted round on was called Helicon. And the man mounted him, and went up, up, till they were nothing but specks in the sky."</p>
<p>"A likely story," said Florence; "there, you've told enough! I don't want to hear any more such nonsense."</p>
<p>"Well, if you don't want to hear about the monster they killed, you needn't; that's all I can say; but the young man loved that horse; and he kissed him, too, he was so splendid!"</p>
<p>"Kiss a horse!" Flossy looked very much disgusted.</p>
<p>"Why, I've kissed my pony a great many times," said Susy, bravely, "right between his eyes; and he almost kisses me. He wants to say, 'I love you.' I can see it in his eyes."</p>
<p>By this time Flossy had finished her doll's

<pb n="58 SISTER SUSY"/>

garment, and, putting it on the little thing's shoulders, held up the doll to be admired.</p>
<p>"I think her opera cloak is very 'bewitching,' don't you, Susy? It is trimmed with ermine, because she is a queen, and is going to the opera."</p>
<p>"It looks well enough," said Susy, indifferently, "but it isn't ermine; it's only white cat's fur, with black spots sewed on."</p>
<p>"Of course it isn't real ermine!" replied Florence; "but I play that it is, and it's just as well."</p>
<p>"But you know all the while it's a make-believe. She hasn't any more sense than a stick of wood, either; and I don't see any sport in playing with dolls."</p>
<p>"And I don't see any sense in fairy stories," retorted Flossy. "Do you know what Percy says about you? He says your head is as full of airy notions as a dandelion

<pb n="59 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

top. I love Queen Mab as if she was my own sister," continued Flossy, in a pettish tone. "You know I do, Susy. I always thought, if anything should happen to Queen Mab, and I lost her, I should certainly dress in mourning: now you needn't laugh."</p>
<p>"0, I can't help laughing, when anybody makes such a fuss over a doll," replied Susy, with a curl of the lip. "Anything that isn't alive, and hasn't any sense, and don't care for you!  I like canary birds, and babies, and ponies, and that's enough to like."</p>
<p>"Well, now, that's so funny!" said Florence, twitching the folds of Queen Mab's dress into place; "for the very reason I like my doll, is because she <hi rend="italic'>isn't</hi> alive. I wouldn't have been you, Susy Parlin, when you had your last canary bird, and let him choke to death."</p>

<pb n="60 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>"0, no, Flossy, I didn't let him choke; I forgot to put any seed in the bottle, and he stuck his head in so deep, that he smothered to death."</p>
<p>"I don't know but smothering is as bad as choking," said Florence; and now your new bird will be sure to come to some bad end."</p>
<p>"You're always saying hateful things," exclaimed Susy, a good deal vexed. "I like Grace Clifford ten times as well, for she's a great deal more lady-like."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose I can go home," said Florence, with a rising color: "you're such a perfect lady that I can't get along with you."</p>
<p>"0, dear," thought poor Susy, "what does ail my tongue? Here this very morning I said in my prayer, that I meant to be good and patient."</p>

<pb n="61 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

<p>Florence began to put on her cloak.</p>
<p>"Cousin Flossy," said Susy, in a hesitating voice, "I wish you wouldn't go. I didn't mean to tell that I liked Gracie best; but it's the real honest truth, and if I should take it back, 'twould be a lie."</p>
<p>This was not making matters much better. Florence put on her hood, and tied it with a twitch.</p>
<p>"But I like <hi rend="italic'>you</hi> ever so much, Flossy; now, you know I do. You're hateful sometimes; but so am I; and I can't tell which is the hatefulest."</p>
<p>Here Flossy, who was as fickle as the wind, laughed merrily, took off her hood and cloak, and danced about the room in high spirits.</p>
<p>"Yes," said she, "I'll stay just on purpose to plague you!"</p>
<p>But good humor had been restored on

<pb n="62 SISTER SUSY"/>

both sides, and the little girls were soon talking together, as freely as if nothing had, happened.</p>
<p>"Just come out in the kitchen," said Susy, "and you shall see me wash my bird."</p>
<p>"Why, I thought birds washed themselves," replied Florence, following her cousin with some surprise.</p>
<p>"They do, but Dandy won't; it's all in the world I have against Dandy; he isn't a cold-water bird."</p>
<p>Grandma Read stood by the kitchen table, clear-starching one of her caps--a piece of work which she always performed with her own hands. She moved one side to make room for Susy's bird-cage, but said she did not approve of washing canaries; she thought it must be a dangerous experiment.</p>
<p>"If he needed a bath, he would take it himself, Susan. Little birds know what is 

<pb n=" PRUDY'S TROUBLE 63"/>

best for them by instinct, thee may depend upon it."</p>
<p>"But my birdie gay ought to be clean," persisted Susy, who was often very positive. "Mrs. Mason says so--the lady that gave him to me. I told her he wouldn't bathe, and she said then I must bathe him."</p>
<p>Susy went to the range, and, dipping some hot water from the boiler, cooled it with fresh water, till she found, by putting in her fingers, that it was of a proper temperature, according to her own judgment. Then she plunged the timid little canary into the bowl, in spite of his fluttering. Such a wee young thing as he was too! He seemed to be afraid of the water, and struggled against it with all his small strength.</p>
<p>"0, Dandy, darling," said Susy, in a cooing voice, as if she were talking to a baby; "be a little man, Dandy; hold up his

<pb n="64 SISTER SUSY"/>

head, and let Susy wash it all cleany! O, he's Susie's birdie gay ! --What makes him roll up his eyes?"</p>
<p>"Take him out quick, Susan," said grandma Reed; "he will strangle."</p>
<p>A few seconds more and all would have been over with birdie gay. He curled down very languidly on the floor of the cage, and seemed to wish to be let alone.</p>
<p>"He acts so every morning when I bathe him," said Susy, who would not give up the point; "but Mrs. Mason told me to do it! Dotty always cried when she was washed, till she was ever so old."</p>
<p>"I think," said Mrs. Parlin, who had just entered the kitchen, "I must ask Mrs. Mason if she is very sure it is proper to treat little birds in that way."</p>
<p>"But look, mamma; here he is, shaking out his feathers, all bright and happy again.

<pb n="65 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

0, you cunning little Dandy, now we'll hang you up in the sun to dry. See him hop on one foot; that is just to make me laugh."</p>
<p>"But <hi rend="italic'>I</hi> hop on one foot, too," said little Prudy, "and you don't laugh at me."</p>
<p>"This is a droll little head for fancies," said Mrs. Parlin, patting Prudy's curls, and looking at grandma Reed. "Do you know, mother, that for several days she has made believe she was lame Jessie, and has hobbled about whenever she could think of it."</p>
<p>"Now you mustn't laugh," said Prudy, looking up with a grieved face; "I can't never help hopping; I <hi rend="italic'>have</hi> to hop. My knee was so sick, I cried last night, and I was just as <hi rend="italic'>wide-awakeful!</hi>"</p>
<p>"Aint thee afraid the child has been hurt in some way, my daughter?" said grandma Read.</p>

<pb n="66 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>"0, no, mother," said Mrs. Parlin, smiling, as Prudy limped out of the room. "I have examined her knee, and there is nothing the matter with it. She is only imitating that lame child. You know Prudy has all sorts of whims. Don't you know how she has wanted us to call her Jessie sometimes?"</p>
<p>"Why, no, indeed, grandma, she isn't: lame," said Susy, laughing. "Sometimes she will run about the room as well as I do, and then, in a few minutes, when she thinks of it, she will limp and take hold of chairs. Mother, isn't it just the same as a wrong story for Prudy to act that way? If I did so, you'd punish me; now, wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what to think about it," said Mrs. Parlin, gravely. "Sometimes I am afraid Prudy is really becoming naughty and deceitful. I thought once it was only 

<pb n="67 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

her funny way of playing; but she is getting old enough now to know the difference between truth and falsehood."</p>
<p>There was an anxious look on Mrs. Parlin's face. She was a faithful mother, and watched her children's conduct with the tenderest care.</p>
<p>But this lameness of which little Prudy complained, was something more than play; it was a sad truth, as the family learned very soon. Instead of walking properly when her mother bade her do so, the poor child cried bitterly, said it hurt her, and she was so tired she wished they would let her lie on the sofa, and never get up. At times she seemed better; and when everybody thought she was quite well, suddenly the pain and weakness would come again, and she could only limp, or walk by catching hold of chairs.</p>

<pb n="68 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>At last her father called in a physician.</p>
<p>"How long has this child been lame?" said he.</p>
<p>"A month or more."</p>
<p>The doctor looked grave. "Has she ever had an injury, Mr. Parlin, such as slipping on the ice, or falling down stairs?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," replied Mr. Parlin, "I believe not."</p>
<p>"Not a serious injury that I know of," said Mrs. Parlin, passing her hand across her forehead, and trying to remember. " No, I think Prudy has never had a <hi rend="italic'>bad</hi> fall, though she is always meeting with slight accidents."</p>
<p>"0, mamma," said Susy, who had begged to stay in the room, "she did have a fall: don't you know, Christmas day, ever so long ago, how she went rolling down stairs with her little chair in her arms, and woke everybody up?"</p>
<p>The doctor caught at Susy's words.</p>

<pb n="69 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

<p>"With her little chair in her arms, my dear? And did she cry as if she was hurt?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; she said the <hi rend="italic'>prongs</hi> of the chair stuck into her side."</p>
<p>"It hurt me dreffully," said Prudy, who had until now forgotten all about it. "Susy spoke so quick, and said I was a little snail; and then I rolled over and over, and down I went."</p>
<p>The doctor almost smiled at these words, lisped out in such a plaintive voice, as if Prudy could not think of that fall even now, without pitying herself very much.</p>
<p>"Just let me see you stand up, little daughter," said he; for Prudy was lying on the sofa.</p>
<p>But it hurt her to bear her weight on her feet.</p>
<p>She said, "One foot, the <hi rend="italic'>'lame-knee-foot,'</hi> came down so long, it <hi rend="italic'>more</hi> than touched the floor."

<pb n="70 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>The doctor looked sober. The foot did drag indeed. The trouble was not in her knee, but in her hip, which had really been injured when she fell down stairs, and the "prongs" of the chair were forced against it.</p>
<p>It seemed to Mrs. Parlin strange that Prudy had never complained of any pain in her side; but the doctor said it was very common for people to suffer from hip-disease, and seem to have only a lame knee.</p>
<p>"Hip-disease !"  When Mrs. Parlin heard these words, she grew so dizzy, that it was all she could do to keep from fainting. It came over her in a moment, the thought of what her little daughter would have to suffer--days and nights of pain, and perhaps a whole lifetime of lameness. She had often heard of hip-disease, and was aware that it is a very serious thing.</p>
<p>Do you know, she would gladly have

<pb n="71 PRUDY'S TROUBLE"/>

changed places with Prudy, would gladly have borne all the child must suffer, if by that means she could have saved her? This is the feeling which mothers have when any trouble comes upon their children; but the little ones, with their simple minds, cannot understand it.</p>

<pb n="72 SISTER SUSY"/>

CHAPTER VI.
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.

<p>Prudy had enjoyed a great many rides in Susy's beautiful sleigh; but now the doctor forbade her going out, except for very short distances, and even then, he said, she must sit in her mother's lap. He wanted her to lie down nearly all the time, and keep very quiet.</p>
<p>At first, Mrs. Parlin wondered how it would be possible to keep such a restless child quiet; but she found, as time passed, and the disease made progress, that poor little Prudy was only too glad to lie still. Every motion seemed to hurt her, and some-

<pb n="73 ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY"/>

times she cried if any one even jarred the sofa suddenly.</p>
<p>These were dark days for everybody in the house. Susy, who was thoughtful beyond her years, suffered terribly from anxiety about her little sister. More than that, she suffered from remorse.</p>
<p>"0, grandma Read," said she one evening, as she sat looking up at the solemn, shining stars, with overflowing eyes--"O, grandma!" The words came from the depths of a troubled heart. "I may live to be real old; but I never shall be happy again! I can't, for, if it hadn't been for me, Prudy would be running round the house as well as ever!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Read had a gentle, soothing voice. She could comfort Susy when anybody could. Now she tried to set her heart at rest by saying that the doctor gave a great deal of 

<pb n="74 SISTER SUSY"/>

hope. He could not promise a certain cure, but he felt great faith in a new kind of splint which he was using for Prudy's hip.</p>
<p>"O, grandma, it may be, and then, again, it may not be," sobbed poor Susy; "we can't tell what God will think best; but any how, it was I that did it."</p>
<p>"But, Susan, thee must think how innocent thee was of any wrong motive. Thee did not get angry, and push thy little sister, thee knows thee didn't, Susan! Thee was only in a hurry, and rather thoughtless. The best of us often do very foolish things, and cause much mischief; but thee'll find it isn't best to grieve over these mistakes. Why, my dear little Susan, I have lived eight years to thy one, and if I should sit down now and drop a tear for every blunder I have made, I don't know but I could almost make a fountain of myself, like that woman thee tells about in the fairy story."</p>

<pb n="75 ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY"/>

"The fountain of Pirene that Pegasus loved," said Susy; "that was the name of it. Why, grandma, I never should have thought of your saying such a queer thing as that! Why, it seems as if you always did just right, and thought it all over before you did it. Do <hi rend="italic'>you</hi> ever do wrong? How funny!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Read smiled sadly. She was not an angel yet; so I suppose she did wrong once in a while.</p>
<p>"Now, grandma, I want to ask you one question, real sober and honest. You know it was so dark that morning in the middle of the night, when we were going down the back stairs? Now, if I'd made a great deal worse mistake than calling Prudy a snail,--if I'd pushed her real hard, and she had fallen faster, --0, I can't bear to think! I mean, if the chair-prongs had hit her head, grandma-and--killed her! What would

they have done to <hi rend="italic'>me</hi>? I thought about it last night, so I couldn't go to sleep for the longest while! I heard the clock <hi rend="italic'>strike</hi> once while I was awake there in bed! Would they have put me in the lock-up, grandma, and then hung me for murder?"</p>
<p>"My dear child, no, indeed! How came such horrible ideas in thy tender little brain? It is too dreadful to think about; but, even if thy little sister <hi rend="italic'>had</hi> died, Susan, thee would have been no more to blame than thee is now, and a great, great deal more to be pitied."</p>
<p>Susy sat for a long while gazing out of the window; but the stars did not wink so solemnly; the moon looked friendly once more. Susy was drinking in her grandmother's words of comfort. The look of sadness was disappearing from her young face, and smiles began to play about the corners of her mouth.</p>

<pb n="ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY"/>

<p>"Well," said she, starting up briskly, "I'm glad I wasn't so very terribly wicked! I wish I'd been somewhere else, when I stood on those back-stairs, in the middle of the night; but what's the use? I'm not going to think any more about it, grandma; for if I should think till my head was all twisted up in a knot, what good would it do? It wouldn't help Prudy any; would it, grandma?"</p>
<p>"No, dear," said the mild, soothing voice again; "don't think, I beg of thee; but if thee wants to know what would do Prudence good, I will tell thee: try thy best to amuse her. She has to lie day after day and suffer. It is very hard for a little girl that loves to play, and can't read, and doesn't know how to pass the time; don't thee think so, Susan?"</p>
<p>It was certainly hard. Prudy's round,

<pb n="78 SISTER SUSY"/>

rosy face began to grow pale; and, instead of laughing and singing half the time, she would now lie and cry from pain, or because she really did not know what else to with herself.</p>
<p>It was worst at night. Hour after hour she would lie awake, and listen to the ticking of the clock. Susy thought it a pitiable case, when <hi rend="italic'>she</hi> heard the clock strike <hi rend="italic'>once</hi>; but little Prudy heard it strike again and again. How strangely it pounded out the strokes in the night! What a dreary sound it was, pealing through the silence! The echoes answered with a shudder. Then, when Prudy had counted one, two, three, four, and the clock had no more to say at that time, it began to tick again: "Prudy's sick! Prudy's sick! 0, dear me! O, dear.me!"</p>
<p>Prudy could hardly believe it was the

<pb n="79 ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY"/>

same clock she saw in the daytime. She wondered if it felt lonesome in the night, and had the blues; or what <hi rend="italic'>could</hi> ail it! The poor little girl wanted somebody to speak to in these long, long hours. She did not sleep with Susy, but in a new cot-bed of her own, in aunt Madge's room; for, dearly as she loved to lie close to any one she loved, she begged now to sleep alone, "so nobody could hit her, or move her, or joggle her."</p>
<p>It was a great comfort to have aunt Madge so near. If it had been Susy instead, Prudy would have had no company but the sound of her breathing. It was of no use to try to wake Susy in the dead of night. Pricking her with pins would startle her, but she never knew anything even after she was startled. All she could do was to stare about her, cry, and act very cross, and then--go to sleep again.</p>

<pb n="80 SISTER SUSY"/>

<p>But with aunt Madge it was quite different. She slept like a cat, with one eye open. Perhaps the reason she did not sleep more soundly, was, that she felt a care of little Prudy, No matter when Prudy spoke to her, aunt Madge always answered. She did not say, "0, dear, you've startled me out of a delicious nap!" She said "Well, darling, what do you want?" Prudy generally wanted to know when it would be morning? When would the steamboat whistle? What made it stay dark so long? She wanted a drink of water, and always wanted a story.</p>
<p>If aunt Madge had forgotten to provide a glass of water, she put on her slippers lighted the little handled lamp, and stole softly down stairs to the pail, which Norah always pumped full of well-water the last thing in the evening.

<pb n="81 ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY"/>

<p>Or, if Prudy fancied it would console her to have a peep at her beautiful doll which "would be alive if it could speak," why, down stairs went auntie again to search out the spot where Susy had probably left it when "she took it to show to some children."</p>
<p>The many, many times that kind young lady crept shivering down stairs to humor Prudy's whims! Prudy could not have counted the times; and you may be sure aunt Madge never <hi rend="italic'>would</hi>.</p>
<p>Then the stories, both sensible and silly, which Prudy teased for, and always got! Aunt Madge poured them forth like water into the <hi rend="italic'>sieve</hi> of Prudy's mind, which could not hold stories any better than secrets. No matter how many she told, Prudy insisted that she wanted "one more," and "the same one over again."</p>




<pb n="82"/>
82             SISTER SUSY.
It touched Susy to the heart to see how
much her little sister suffered, and she spent
a great deal of time at first in trying to
amuse her. Aunt Madge told stories in the
night; but Susy told them in the daytime,
till, as she expressed it, her "tongue ached."
She cut out paper dolls when she wanted
to read, and played go visiting, or dressel
rag babies, when she longed to be out of
doors. But while the novelty lasted, she
was quite a Florence Nightingale.
Her Wednesday and Saturday afternoons
were no longer her own. Before Prudy's,
lameness, Susy had used her new skates a
great deal, and could now skim over the ice
quite gracefully, for a little girl of her age.
The reason she learned to skate so well,
was because she was fearless. Most children 
tremble when they try to stand on the ice,
and for that very reason are nearly sure to




<pb n="83"/>
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.     83
fall; but Susy did not tremble in the face
of danger: she had a strong will of her own,
and never expected to fail in anything she
undertook.
She had spent half of her short life out
of doors, and almost considered it lost time
when she was obliged to stay in the house
for the rain-
Mrs. Parlin kept saying it was high time
for her eldest daughter to begin to be wo-
manly, and do long stints with her needle:
she could not sew as well now as she sewed
two years ago.
But Mr. Parlin laughed at his wife's anx-
iety, and said he loved Susy's red cheeks;
he didn't care if she grew as brown as an
Indian. She was never rude or coarse, he
thought; and she would be womanly enough
one of these days, he was quite sure.
"Anything," said Mr. Parlin, " but these

womanly little girls, such as I have sei
sitting in a row, sewing seams, without ani
mation enough to tear rents in their ow
dresses ! If Susy loves birds, and flowers
and snowbanks, I am thankful, and perfectl
willing she should have plenty of them fo
playthings." 
Then, when Mrs. Parlin smiled mischiev
ously, and said, "I should like to know wha
sort of a wild Arab you would make out of
a little girl," Mr. Parlin answered triumph
antly, -
"Look at my sister Margaret ! I brought
her up my own self! I always took her ou
in the woods with me, gunning and trouting.
I taught her how to skate when she was a
mere baby. I often said she was all the
brother I had in the world! She can re-
member now how I used to wrap her in
shawls, and prop her up on the woodpile,
while I chopped wood."




<pb n="85"/>
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.       85
" And how you hired her to drop ears of
corn for you into the corn-sheller; and how,
one day, her fingers were so benumbed,
that one of them was clipped off before she
knew it!"
"Well, so it was, that is true; but only
the tip of it. Active children will meet
with accidents.  She was a regular little
fly-away, and would sooner climb a tree
or a ladder any time, than walk on solid
ground. Now look at her ! "
And Mr. Parlin repeated the words,
"Now look at her," as if he was sure his
wife must confess that she was a remarkable
person.
Mrs. Parlin said, if Susy should ever
become half as excellent and charming as
Miss Margaret Parlin, she should be per-
fectly satisfied, for her part.
Thus Susy was allowed to romp to her

heart's content; "fairly ran wild," as aun
Eastman declared, with a frown of disap-
proval. She gathered wild roses, and wore
them in her cheeks, the very best place in
the world for roses. She drank in sunshin

of-doors life: Susy did not love to stay i'
the house. Rainy days and evenings, to be
sure, she made herself very happy with
reading, for she loved to read, particularly
fairy books, and Rollo's Travels.
But now, just as she had learned to skate 
on the basin with other little girls and young
ladies, and could drive Wings anywhere and
everywhere she pleased, it was a sore trial
to give up these amusements for the sake :
of spending more hours with poor little
Prudy. She was very self-denying at first,




<pb n="87"/>
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.     87
but it grew to be an " old story."  She found
it was not only pony and skates she must
give up, but even her precious reading, for
Prudy was jealous of books, and did not
like to have Susy touch them. She thought
Susy was lost to her when she opened a
book, and might as well not be in the house,
for she never heard a word that anybody
said.
Now I know just what you will think:
"O, I would have given up a great deal
more than ponies and books for my dear
little sister ! I would have told her stories,
and never have complained that my 'tongue
ached.' It would not have wearied me to
do anything and everything for such a patient
sufferer as little Prudy !"
But now I shall be obliged to confess one
thing, which I would have gladly concealed.
Prudy was not always patient.   Some

sweet little children become almost like the
angels when sickness is laid upon them; but
Prudy had been such a healthy, active child,,
that the change to perfect quiet was exceed-
ingly tiresome. She was young, too,- too 
young to reason about the uses of suffering. 
She only knew she was dreadfully afflicted;
and thought everybody ought to amuse;
her.
"O, dear me!" said Susy, sometimes, "I
just believe the more anybody does for'
Prudy, the more she expects."
Now this was really the case. When Prudy
first began to lie upon the sofa, everybody
pitied her, and tried to say and do funny
things, in order to take up her attention.
It was not possible to keep on giving so
much time to her; but Prudy expected it.
She would lie very pleasant and happy for
hours at a time, counting the things in the




<pb n="89"/>
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.     89
room, talking to herself, or humming little
tunes; and then, again, everything would
go wrong. Her playthings would keep fall-
ing to the floor, and, as she could not stoop
at all, some one must come and pick them
up that very minute, or they " didn't pity
her a bit."
Every once in a while, she declared her
knee was "broke in seven new places," and
the doctor must come and take off the splint.
She didn't want such a hard thing "right on
there;" she wanted it " right off."
Her mother told her she must try to be
patient, and be one of God's little girls.
"But, mamma," said Prudy, "does God love
me any? I should think, if he loved me,
he'd be sorrier I was sick, and get me
well."
Then, sometimes, when she had been more
fretful than usual, she would close her eyes,




<pb n="90"/>
90            SISTER SUSY.
and her mother would hear her say, in
low voice,- 
"0, God, I didn't mean to. It's my kne
that's cross !"
Upon the whole, I think Prudy was as
patient as most children of her age would
have been under the same trial. Her father
and mother, who had the most care of her,   l
did not wonder in the least that her poor,
little nerves got tired out sometimes. 
While Susy was at school, Prudy had a^
long time to think what she wanted her to
do when she should come home. She would
lie and watch the clock, for she had learned
to tell the time quite well; and when the
hour drew near for Susy to come, she moved 
her head on the pillow, and twisted her
fingers together nervously.
If Susy was in good season, Prudy put'
up her little mouth for a kiss, and said,--
i::




<pb n="91"/>
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.     91
t0, how I do love you, Susy; Ain't I
your dear little sister? Well, won't you
make me a lady on the slate?"
Susy's ladies had no necks, and their
heads were driven down on their shoulders,
as if they were going to be packed into
their chests; but, such as they were, Prudy
wanted them over and over again.
But if Susy stopped to slide, or to play
by the way, she would find little Prudy in
tears, and hear her say, " 0, what made
you? Naughty, naughty old Susy! I'm
goin' to die, and go to God's house, and
then you'll be sorry you didn't 'tend to your
little sister."
Susy could never bear to hear Prudy
talk about going to God's house. Her con-
science pricked her when she saw that the
poor child was grieved; and she resolved,
every time she was late, that she would
never be late again.

Prudy had a great many odd fancies no
among others, she had a fancy that she d
not like the name of Prudy.
"Why, only think," said she, "you kee

smiling, "it happens, unfortunately, tha

have to try and bear it as well as you
can."
"But I can't bear it any longer," said the
child, bursting into tears. "Prudy is all
lame and sick, and I never shall walk any
more while you call me Prudy, papa."
Mr. Parlin kissed his little daughter's
pale cheek, and said, "Then we will call
you pet names; will that do?"
Prudy smiled with delight.




<pb n="93"/>
ROSY FRANCES EASTMAN MARY.     93
"I've thought of a real beautiful, splendid
name," said she. "It is -Rosy Frances East-
man Mary; ain't it splendid? "
After this announcement, Prudy expected
the family would be sure to call her Rosy
Frances Eastman Mary; and, indeed, they
were quite willing to please her, whenever
they could remember the name. They all
supposed it was a fancy she would forget
in a day or two; but, instead of that, she
clung to it more and more fondly. If any
one offered her an orange, or roasted apple,
and said, "Look, Prudy; here is something
nice for you," she would turn her face over
to one side on the pillow, and make no
reply.  If she wanted a thing very much,
she would never accept it when she was ad-
dressed by the obnoxious name of Prudy.
Even when her father wanted to take her
in his arms to rest her, and happened to

say, "Prudy, shall I hold you a littl
while?" she would say, "Who was you
a-talkin' to, papa? There isn't any Prud
here!" Then her father had to humble
himself, and ask to be forgiven for bein
so forgetful.
The child had a delicate appetite, and her
mother tried to tempt it with little niceties i
but, no matter what pains she took, Prudi
relished nothing unless it was given to her
as Rosy Frances, the little girl who was not

"You precious little sister," said Susy,

"I'll try to" replied Prudv, with a look
of meek forbearance, as she sipped the lem-

and tiptoeing about, till the ladies smiled,
and said, "0, what sweet little boots ! " and
then she was perfectly happy.
Susy was not very wide awake in the
morning; but 'Dotty was stirring as soon
as there was a peep of light, and usually
stole into Susy's bed to have a frolic. Noth-
ing but a story would keep her still, and

" Won't you tell me 'tory - tell me a 'tor

" Well, what do you want to hear?'
Now, it was natural for Susy to feel cros:
when she was sleepy. It cost her a har

succeeded in doing so, I set it down as on
of her greatest victories over herself. Th

to remember it.
"Tell 'bout little yellow gell," said the,
voice of the musquito, over and over again. 
Susy roused herself after the third re-
quest, and sleepily asked if something else:
wouldn't do?
"I had a little nobby-colt."




<pb n="101"/>
LITTLE TROUBLES.         101
"No, no, you di'n't, you di'n't; grand-
ma had the nobby ! Tell yellow gell."
" O," sighed Susy, " how can you want to
hear that so many, many times? Well,
once when I was a little bit of a girl -- "
"'Bout's big as me, you said," put in
Dotty.
"0, yes, I did say so once, and I suppose
I must tell it so every time, or you'll fuss !
Well, I had a yellow dress all striped off in

"Di'n't it go this way?" said Dotty,
smoothing the sheet with her little hand,
"and this way?"
"What? What?"     Susy roused herself
and rubbed her eyes. "0, yes, it went in
checks; and I was at grandma Parlin's, and
Grace - Grace - 0, Grace and I went into
the pasture where there were a couple of
cows, a gray cow and a red cow."




<pb n="102"/>
102           SISTER SUSY.    "
"Now   you must say what is coupIl
says Dotty.
"Then what is couple?"
' Gray cow," answers Dotty, very gravel
" So when the cows saw us coming, they

nearly asleep.
"Up in the air?"
"Yes, of course, up in the air.  (There,
I will wake up !)  And the gray cow began
to run towards us, and Grace says to me,n
'O, my, she thinks you're a pumpkin !'" 
"You ?"
"Yes, me, because my dress was so yel-
low. I was just as afraid of the cow as I]
could be."
"Good cow! He wouldn't hurt!"
"No, the cow was good, and didn't think. !




<pb n="103"/>
LITTLE TROUBLES.        103
I was a pumpkin, not the least speck. But
I was so afraid, that I crept under the bars,
and ran home."
"To grandma's house?"
"Yes; and grandma laughed."
"Well, where was me?" was the next
question, after a pause.
Then, when the duty of story-telling was
performed, Susy would gladly have gone
back to " climbing the dream-tree;" but no,
she must still listen to Dotty, though she an-
swered her questions in an absent-minded
way, like a person " hunting for a forgotten
dream."
One morning she was going to ride with
her cousin Percy. It had been some time
since she had seen Wings, except in the
stable, where she visited him every day.
But Dotty had set her heart on a rag-baby
which Susy had promised to dress, and

Prudy wa3 anxious that Susy should p
several games of checkers with her.
"0, dear," said the eldest sister, with. t
perplexed air of a mother who has disob
dient little ones to manage. "I think 
have about as much as I can bear.    T
children always make a fuss, just as su
as I want to go out."
The old, impatient spirit was rising; tha
spirit which it was one of the duties o
Susy's life to keep under control.
She went into the bathing-room, an'
drank off a glass of cold water, and talked
to herself a while, for she considered tha
the safest way.
"Have I any right to be cross?  Yes, I
think I have. Here Dotty woke me up,
right in the middle of a dream, and I'm
sleepy this minute. Then Prudy is a little
babyish thing, and always was-making a

fuss if I forget to call her Rosy Frances!
Yes, I'll be cross, and act just as I want to.
It's too hard work to keep pleasant; I won't
try."
She walked along to the door, but, by
that time, the better spirit was struggling
to be heard.
"Now, Susy Parlin," it said, "you little
girl with a pony, and a pair of skates, and
feet to walk on, and everything you want,
ain't you ashamed, when you think of that
dear little sister you pushed down stairs -
no, didn't push - that poor little lame
sister! --0, hark! there is your mother
winding up that hard splint! How would
you feel with such a thing on your hip?
Go, this minute, and comfort Prudy! "
The impatient feelings were gone for that
time; Susy had swallowed them, or they had
flown nut of the window.

"Now   Rosy  Frances Eastman Mary,"
said she, "if your splint is all fixed, I'll
comb your hair." 
The splint was made of hard, polished
wood and brass. Under it were strips of
plaster an inch wide, which wound round
and round the poor wounded limb. These'
strips of plaster became loose, and there :
was a little key-hole in the splint, into 
which Mrs. Parlin put a key, and wound 
up and tightened the plaster every morn- 
ing. This operation did not hurt Prudy
at all.
"Now," said Susy, after she had combed 
Prudy's hair carefully, and put a net over 
it, until her mother should be ready to 
curl it, "now we will have a game of 
checkers."

lowed her to jump all her men, and march

triumphantly into the king-row, at the head
of a victorious army.
"There, now, Rosy," said Susy, gently,
"are you willing to let me go out riding? I
can't play any more if I ride, for I must
dress Dotty's doll, and feed my canary."
" 0, well," said Prudy, considering the
matter, "I'm sick; I tell you how it is, I'm
sick, you know; but-well, you may go,
Susy, if you'll make up a story as long as
a mile."
Susy really felt grateful to Prudy, but
it was her own gentle manner which had
charmed the sick child into giving her
consent.
Then Susy proceeded to dress Dotty's
doll in a very simple fashion, with two holes
for short sleeves, and a skirt with a raw
edge; but she looked kind and pleasant
while she was at work, and Dotty was just

as well pleased as if it had been an elega
costume she was preparing. And it was
really good enough for a poor deformed,
rag-baby, with a head shaped like a stove4s
pipe.
Susy was delighted to find how well a-
little patience served her in amusing "the% i
children."  Next, she went to give Dandy
his morning bath. Mrs. Parlin still thoughtH
it a dangerous practice, but had not seena
Mrs. Mason, to question her about it, and
Susy was too obstinate in her opinion to .
listen to her mother. 
"I must do it," said Susy; "it has been'
ever so long since Dandy was bathed, and
I shouldn't take any comfort riding, mamma,
if I didn't leave him clean." 
Susy plunged the trembling canary into 
his little bathing-bowl, in some haste. He ;
struggled as usual, and begged, with his :




<pb n="109"/>
LITTLE TROUBLES.        109
weak, piping voice, to be spared such an in-
fliction. But Susy was resolute.
"It'll do you good, Ducky Daddles; we
mustn't have any lazy, dirty birdies in this
house."
Ducky Daddies rolled up his little eyes,
and gasped for breath.
"0, look, mother !" cried Susy, laughing;
"how funny Dandy acts! Do you suppose
it's to make me laugh?  0, is he fainting
away ?"
"Fainting away! My dear child, he is
dying !"
This was the sad truth.   Mrs. Parlin
fanned him, hoping to call back the lingering
breath. But it was too late. One or two
more throbs, and his frightened little heart
had ceased to beat; his frail life had gone
out as suddenly as a spark of fire.
Susy was too much shocked to speak.




<pb n="110"/>
110           SISTER SUSY.
She stood holding the stiffening bird in he
hands, and gazing at it.
Mrs. Parlin was very sorry for Susy, an
had too much kindness of feeling to add t
her distress by saying,- 
"You know how I warned you, Susy."   i
Susy was already suffering for her oby
stinacy and disregard of her mother's ad-
vice; and Mrs. Parlin believed she would
lay the lesson to heart quite as well without,
more words. It was a bitter lesson. Susy
loved dumb creatures dearly, and was just'
becoming very fond of Dandy.
In the midst of her trouble, and while !
her eyes were swollen with tears, her cousini
Percy came with Wings and the sleigh to 
give her the promised ride. Susy no longer :
cared for going out: it seemed to her that
her heart was almost broken.
"Well, cousin Indigo, what is the mat-




<pb n="111"/>
LITTLE TROUBLES.           111
ter?" said  Percy; "you look as if this
world was a howling wilderness, and you
wanted to howl too. What, crying over
that bird? Poh! I can buy you a screech-
owl any time, that will make twice the
noise he could in his best days. Come,
hurry, and put your things on!"
Susy buried her face in her apron.
' I'll compose a dirge for him," said Percy.
"My bird is dead, said Susy P.,
My bird is dead; 0, deary me!
He sang so sweet, te whee, te whee;
He sings no more; 0, deary me!
Go hang his cage up in the tree,
That cage I care no more to see.
My bird is dead, cried Susy P."
These provoking words Percy drawled out
in a sing-song voice. It was too much.
Susy eyes flashed through her tears.
"You've always laughed at me, Percy
Eastman, and plagued me about Freddy

Susy was about to say, "Can't speak fo!
himself," but saw in time how absurdl       s
she was talking, and stopped short.
Percy laughed.
"Where are you going with that cage ?" 
"Going to put it away, where I'll nevm
see it again," sobbed poor Susy. 
"Give it to me," said Percy: "I'll tak
care of it for you."
If Susy's eyes had not been blinded bY
tears, she would have been surprised to see
the real pity in Percy's face. 
He was a rollicking boy, full of merri;
ment and bluster, and what tender feelings
he possessed, he took such a wonderful
amount of pains to conceal, that Susy never




<pb n="113"/>
LITTLE TROUBLES.         113
suspected he had any. She would have en-
joyed her ride if she had not felt so full
of grief.  The day was beautiful. There
had been a storm, and the trees looked as   -
if they had been snowballing one another;
but Susy had no eye for trees, and just then 
hardly cared for her pony.
Percy put the cage in the sleigh, under
the buffalo robes; and when they reached 
his own door, he carried the cage into the
house, while Susy drew a sigh of relief.
He offered to stuff Dandy, or have hin
stuffed; but Susy rejected the idea with
horror.
"No, if Dandy was dead, he was all
dead; she didn't want to see him sitting
up stiff and cold, when he couldn't sing a
speck."

But the day was not over yet.     The
bright sun and blue sky were doing what
they could to make a cheerful time of 'it
but it seemed as if Susy fell more deeply
into trouble, as the hours passed on.
There are such days in everybody's lifer
when it rains small vexations from morning
till night, and when all we can do is to hope
for better things to-morrow.           '
It was Wednesday; and in the afternoon,
Flossy Eastman came over with a new game,:i
and while the little girls, Flossy, Susy, and
Prudy were playing it, and trying their best :




<pb n="115"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.          115
to keep Dotty Dimple's prying fingers and
long curls out of the way, in came Miss
Annie Lovejoy.
This was a little neighbor, who, as the
children sometimes privately declared, was
"always 'round." Mrs. Parlin had her own
private doubts about the advantages to be
derived from her friendship, and had some-
times gone so far as to send her home, when
she seemed more than usually in the way.
Annie's mother lived next door, but all
Mrs. Parlin knew of her, was what she
could see and hear from her own windows;
and that little was not very agreeable.' She
saw that Mrs. Lovejoy dressed in gaudy
colors, and loaded herself with jewelry; and
she could hear her scold her servants and
children with a loud, shrill voice.
The two ladies had never exchanged calls;
but Annie, it seemed, had few playmates,




<pb n="116"/>
116           SISTER SUSY. 
and she clung to Susy with such a show of,
affection, that Mrs. Parlin could not forbid |
her visits, although she watched her closely g
anxious, as a careful mother should be, to.j:
make sure she was a proper companion fork
her little daughter. So far she had never'l
known her to say or do anything morally
wrong, though her manners were not exactly 
those of a well-bred little girl. 
This afternoon, when the new game was
broken up by the entrance of Annie, the i
children began the play of housekeeping, ;
because Prudy could join in it. Susy found
she enjoyed any amusement much more 
when it pleased the little invalid. 
"I will be the lady of the house," said _
Annie, promptly, "because I have rings on :
my fingers, and a coral necklace. My name
is Mrs. Piper. Prudy,-no, Rosy,-you
shall be Mrs. Shotwell, come a-visiting me; 
I




<pb n="117"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.         117
because you can't do anything else. We'll
make believe you've lost your husband in
the wars.  I know a Mrs. Shotwell, and
she is always taking-on, and saying, 'My
poor dear husband,' under her handkerchief;
just this way."
The children laughed at the nasal twang
which Annie gave to the words, and Prudy
imitated it to perfection, not knowing it was
wrong.
"Well, what shall I be?" said Susy, not
very well pleased that the first characters
had been taken already.
" 0, you shall be a hired girl, and wear
a handkerchief on your head, just as our
girl does; and you must be a little deaf,
and keep saying, 'What, ma'am?' when I
speak to you."
"And I," said Florence, "will be Mr.
Peter Piper, the head of the family."




<pb n="118"/>
118           SISTER SUSY.
"Yes," returned Annie, "you can put on
a water-proof cloak, and you will make quite 
a good-looking husband; but I shall be the 
head of the family myself, and have thingsi:
about as I please "
"Well, there," cried Flossy, slipping her
arms into the sleeves of her cloak, "I don't 
know about that; I don't think it's very 
polite for you to treat your husband in that ;[
way."
Flossy wanted to have the control of
family matters herself.                  '
"But I believe in 'Woman's Rights,'" said 
Annie, with a toss of the head, "and if 
there's anything I despise, it is a man  :
meddling about the house."
Here little Dotty began to cause a dis-
turbance, by sticking a fruit-knife into the
edges of the "what-not," and making a 
whirring noise.




<pb n="119"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.          119
"I wouldn't do so, Dotty," said Susy,
going up to her; "it troubles us; and, be-
sides, I'm afraid it will break the knife."
"I don't allow my hired girl to interfere
with my children," said Annie, speaking up
in the character of Mrs. Piper; "I am mis-
tress of the house, I'd have you to know!
There, little daughter, they shan't plague
her; she shall keep on doing mischief; so
she shall I"
Dotty needed no coaxing to keep on doing
mischief, but hit the musical knife harder
than ever, giving it a dizzy motion, like the
clapper in a mill.
Prudy was quite annoyed by the sound,
but did not really know whether to be ner-
vous or not, and concluded to express her
vexation in groans: the groans she was
giving in memory of the departed Mr. Shot-
Well, who had died of a "cannon bullet."




<pb n="120"/>
120           SISTER SUSY.
"My good Mrs. Shotwell," said Mr
Piper, trying to "make conversation," '
think I have got something in my eye: wi
you please tell me how it looks ?" 
" O," said Prudy, peeping into it, you
eye looks very well, ma'am; don't yo
'xcuse it; it looks well enough for me." 
"Ahem !" said Mrs. Piper, laughing, al
settling her head-dress, which was Susy's re
scarf: "are your feet warm, Mrs. Shotwell ?
"Thank you, ma'am," replied' Prudy, "
don't feel 'em cold. 0, dear, if your huS.
band was all deaded up, I guess you'd cryi
Mrs. Piper."
Susy and Flossy looked at each other, 
and smiled.  They thought Prudy seemed
more like herself than they had known her
for a long time.
"You must go right out of the parlor,;;
Betsey," said Mrs. Piper, flourishing the: '




<pb n="121"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.           121
poker; "I mean you, Susy-the parlor
isn't any place for hired girls."
"Ma'am?" said Susy, inclining her head
to one side, in order to hear better.
"0, dear! the plague of having a deaf
girl!" moaned Mrs. Piper.    "You don't
know how trying it is, Mrs. Shotwell!
That hired girl, Betseyehears with her elbows,
Mrs. Shotwell; I verily believe she does!"
0, no, ma'am," replied Prudy; " I guess
she doesn't hear with her elbows, does she ?
If she heard with her elbows, she wouldn't
have to ask you over again! "
This queer little speech set Mr. Piper and
his wife, and their servant, all to laughing,
and Betsey looked at her elbows, to see if
they were in the right place.
"Will you please, ma'am," said Prudy,
"ask Betsey to hot a flatiron? I've cried my
handkerchief all up !"

<pb n="122"/>
122           SISTER SUSY.             '
"Yes; go right out, Betsey, and hot a
flatiron," said Mrs. Piper, very hospitably. 
"Go out, this instant, and build a fire, 
Betsey."
"Yes, go right out, Betsey," echoed Mr. 
Piper, who could find nothing better to do 
than to repeat his wife's words; for, in spite -
of himself, she did appear to be the "head'
of the family." 
"It was my darlin' husband's handker- 
chief," sobbed Prudy. 
"Rather a small one for a man," said Mr. 
Piper, laughing.
"Well," replied Prudy, rather quick for 
a thought, "my husband had a very small 
nose "
Mrs. Piper tried to make more "conver-
sation."
"O, Mrs. Shotwell, you ought to be ex- 
ceeding thankful you're a widow, and don't

ANNIE LOVEJOY.          123
keep house! I think my hired girls will
carry down my gray hairs to the grave!
The last one I had was Irish, and very
Catholic."
Prudy groaned from sympathy, and wiped
her eyes on that corner of her handkerchief
which was supposed to be not quite "cried
up."
"Yes, indeed, it was awful," continued
Mrs. Piper; "for she was always going
to masses and mass-meetings; and there
couldn't anybody die but they must be
'waked,' you know."
" Why, I didn't know they could be waked
up when they was dead," said Prudy, open-
ing her eyes.
"0, but they only make believe you can
wake 'em," said Mrs. Piper; " of course it
isn't true! For my part, I don't believe a
Word an Irish girl says, any way."




<pb n="124"/>
124           SISTER SUSY.
"Hush, my child," she continued, turning
to Dotty, who was now sharpening the silver
knife on the edges of the iron grate. "Bet-
sey, why in the world don't you see to that
baby ? I believe you are losing your mind I "
"That makes me think," said Prudy, sud-
denly breaking in with a new idea; " what do 
you s'pose the reason is folks can't be waked l
up? What makes 'em stay in heaven all the 
days, and nights, and years, and never come
down here to see anybody, not a minute ?"
"What an idea " said Annie. "I'm sure
I don't know."                          '
"Well, I've been a thinkin'," said Prudy, 
answering her own question, "that when 
God has sended 'em up to the sky, they like '
to stay up there the best. It's a licer place, 
a great deal nicer place, up to God's house."
"0, yes, of course," replied Annio, "but 
our play  -"

<pb n="125"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.          125
" I've been a thinkin'," continued Prudy,
"that when I go up to God's house, I shan't
wear the splint. I can run all over the
house, and he'll be willing I should go up
stairs, and down cellar, you know."
Prudy sighed.   Sometimes she almost
longed for "God's house."
"Well, let's go on with our play," said
Annie, impatiently. "It's most supper-time,
Mrs. Shotwell. Come in, Betsey."
"Ma'am?" said Betsey, appearing at the
door, and turning up one ear, very much as
if it were a dipper, in which she expected to
catch the words which dropped from the lips
of her mistress. " Betsey, have you attended
to your sister-- to my little child, I mean ?
Then go out and make some sassafras cakes,
and some eel-pie, and some squirrel-srup;
and set the table in five minutes. dQ ynu
hear?"




<pb n="126"/>
126           SISTER SUSY.
"Ma'am?" said the deaf servant; "what
did you say about gingerbread?"
Susy did not like her part of the game ;
but she played it as well as she could, and
let Annie manage everything, because that
was what pleased Annie.               :
"0, how stupid Betsey is!" said Mr.f
Piper, coming to the aid of his wife. "Mrs.
Piper says eel-jumbles, and sassafras-piej
and pound-cake; all made in five minutes !
Here everybody laughed, and Prudy, sud
denly remembering her part, sighed, and
said, -
"0, my darlin' husband used to like jum
ble-pie!  I've forgot to cry for ever s9
long !"
Susy began to set the table, and went into;
the nursery for some cake and cookies,
which were kept in an old tin chest, on pur- 
pose for this play of housekeeping, which




<pb n="127"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.          127
had now been carried on regularly every
Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, for
some time.
Susy opened the cake-chest, and found
nothing in it but a few dry cookies: the
fruit-cake was all gone. Who could have
eaten it? Not Flossy, for she had a singular
dislike for raisins and currants, and never so
much as tasted fruit-cake. Not Prudy, for
the poor little thing had grown so lame by
this time, that she was unable to bear her
weight on her feet, much less to walk into
the nursery. Dotty could not be the thief.
Her baby-conscience was rather tough and
elastic, and I suppose she would have felt
no more scruples about nibbling nice things,
than an unprincipled little mouse.
But, then, Dotty couldn't reach the cake-
chest; so she was certainly innocent.
Then Susy remembered in a moment that
9




<pb n="128"/>
128           SISTER SUSY.
it was Annie: Annie had run into the house
morning and night, and had often said, "I'
right hungry. I'm going to steal a piece of
our cake !"
So it seemed that Annie had eaten it all,
Susy ran back to Prudy's sitting-room, where
her little guests were seated, and said, trying
not to laugh, -
"Please, ma'am, I just made some eel-
jumbles and things, and a dog came in andy
stole them."
"Very well, Betsey," said Mrs. Piper, 
serenely; "make some more."
"Yes, make some more," echoed Mr,'
Piper; and added, " chain up that dog."
"But real honest true," said Susy, "the
fruit-cake is all gone out of the chest.
You ate it up, you know, Annie; but it's 
no matter: we'll cut up some cookies, or, 
may be, mother'll let us have some oyster-
crackers."




<pb n="129"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.          129
I ate up the cake !" cried Annie; "it's
no such a thing; I never touched it! " Her
face flushed as she spoke.
"0, but you did," persisted Susy; "I sup-
pose you've forgotten I You went to the
cake-chest this morning, and last night, and
yesterday noon, and ever so many more
times."
Annie was too angry to speak.
"But it's just as well," added Susy, po-
litely; "you could have it as well as not,
and perfectly welcome !"
"What are you talking about?" cried
Annie, indignantly; for she thought she
saw a look of surprise and contempt on
Flossy's face, and fancied that Flossy de-
spised her because she had a weakness for
fruit-cake.
"I wonder if you take me for a pig, Susy
Parlin! I heard what your mother said




<pb n="130"/>
130           SISTER SUSY. 
about that cake I She said it was too dr
for her company, but it was too rich fd
little girls, and we must only eat a teet
speck at a time. I told my mamma, an
she laughed, to think such mean dried-up
cake was too rich for little girls!" 
Susy felt her temper rising, but her desir
to be polite did not desert her.
"It was rich, nice cake, Annie; b
mother said the slices had been cut a grea
while, and it was drying up. Let's not tal
any more about it."
"0, but I shall talk more about it," crie
Annie, still more irritated; "you keep hid
ing that I tell wrong stories and steal cake
yes, you do! and then you ain't willing t
let me speak!"
All this sounded like righteous indig
nation, but was only anger.    Annie was
entirely in the wrong, and knew it; therefore
she lost her temper. 




<pb n="131"/>
ANNIE LOVEJOY.         131
Susy had an unusual amount of self-con-
trol at'this time, merely because she had the
truth on her side. But her dignified com-
posure only vexed Annie the more.
"I won't stay here to be imposed upon,
and told that I'm a liar and a thief; so I
won't! I'll go right home this very minute,
and tell my mother just how you treat your
company!"
And, in spite of all Susy could say, Annie
threw on her hood and cloak, and flounced
out of the room; forgetting, in her wrath,
to take off Susy's red scarf, which was still
festooned about her head.
"Well, I'm glad she's gone," said Flossy,
coolly, as the door closed with a slam.
"She's a bold thing, and my mother wouldn't
like me to play with her, if she knew how
she acts ! She said 'victuals' for food, and
that isn't elegant, mother says. What right

had she to set up and say she'd be Mrs.
Piper? So forward!" 
After all, this was the grievous part of
the whole to Flossy, -that she had to tak
an inferior part in the play.
"But I'm sorry she's gone," said Susy, un-
easily. "I don't like to have her go and tell
that I wasn't polite." 
"You was polite," chimed in little Prudy,
from the sofa; "a great deal politer'n she
was ! I wouldn't care, if I would be you
Susy. I don't wish Annie was dead, but 
wish she was a duck a-sailin' on the water I
The children went back to the game the
had been playing before Annie came; but
the interest was quite gone.  Their quickS
tempered little guest had been a " ill-joy,'
in spite of her name.
But the afternoon was not over yet. 
What happened next, I will tell you ii:

CHAPTER IX.
MORAL COURAGE.
ANNIE LOVEJOY had not been gone fifteen
minutes, when there was a sharp ringing of
Mrs. Parlin's door-bell, and a little boy
gave Norah the red scarf of Susy's, and a
note for Mrs. Parlin.
Norah suspected they both came from
Mrs. Lovejoy, and she could see that lady
from the opposite window, looking toward
the house with a very defiant expression.
Mrs. Parlin opened the note with some
surprise, for she had been engaged with
visitors in the parlor, and did not know what
had been going on up stairs.




<pb n="134"/>
134           SISTER SUSY,
Whatever Mrs. Lovejoy's other accomJ
plishments might be, she could not write
very elegantly.  The ink was hardly dry,
and the words were badly blotted, as well
as incorrectly spelled.
"MRS. PARLIN.

"SERENA LOVEJOY."
Mrs. Parlin was at a loss to understand 
this, for she had quite forgotten the fact,
that the children had any cake to use at 
their play of housekeeping. She supposed
that Susy must have accused Annie of 
prying into the china-closet, where the




<pb n="135"/>
MORAL COURAGE.         135
cakes and jellies were kept. She sent for
Susy at once.
"My daughter," said she, in her usual
quiet tones, "did you ever have any reason
to suppose that Annie Lovejoy went about
meddling with our things, and peeping into
the closets?"
"Why, no, mother," replied Susy, much
surprised; " she never saw the closets, that-
I know of. Why, mother, what do you
mean?"
" Never ate cake, did she, without leave?"
"0, now I know what you mean, mother I
Yes'm, she ate some of that fruit-cake you
gave us to play with; and when I told her
of it, she got angry, and said she was going
right home, and would tell her mother how I

you found that out!"
"Never mind yet how I found it out, my

dear. I want to know if you are sure that
Annie ate the cake?"
"Yes, mother: just as certain sure as I can 
be   You know Dotty can't reach that highl
shelf in the nursery-closet, and I can't, with- 
out getting into a chair; and Prudy can't 
walk a step; and Flossy despises cake." 
"But," said Mrs. Parlin, smiling, "I don't il
see that you have proved Annie to be the :
guilty one." 
"Guilty?   0, I don't know as she is I
guilty, mamma; but she ate the cake ! She X
ate it right before my face and eyes; but I I
told her it was just as well, she was per- :

said, the more angry she grew, and I       ;
couldn't make her believe I didn't think

she was a thief and a liar! Only think, a
thief and a liar! But I never said those   !
words at 'all, mother!
"Very well, my dear; I am sure you did
not. It is a great comfort to me, Susy, that
I can always rely on your word. You have
done nothing wrong, and need not be un-
happy; but Mrs. Lovejoy sends for you to 
go over and tell her just what you mean
about the cake; are you willing to go?"
Susy was not willing; indeed, she was
very much   frightened, and begged her
mother to excuse her in some way to Mrs.
Lovejoy, or, if that would not do, to go
herself and explain the matter for her.
But, as it was Susy's own affair, Mrs.
Parlin wished to have as little to do with
it as possible. Besides, she considered it
a good opportunity to teach Susy a lesson
in moral courage.
Susy started very reluctantly.




<pb n="138"/>
138           SISTER SUSY.
"I'm afraid Mrs. Lovejoy will scold rea
sharp," said she. "What shall I do?  o 
mother, I didn't see Annie eat all the cakes
I didn't watch. How do I know but she
gave some crumbs to the cat?   Can't I-
can't I say, I guess the cat ate it?" 
"Susy !" said Mrs. Parlin, sternly, " ari
you more afraid of displeasing Mrs. Love;4
joy than you are of displeasing God? Allt
that is required of you is the simple truth.'
Merely say to Annie's mother just what
you have said to me; that you saw Annie",:
eating cake several times, though there was-
no harm in it, and you did not call her
either a thief or a liar. Speak respectfully, 
but decidedly; and when you have said all 
that is necessary, leave her politely, and 
come home."                             .
Susy called up all her courage when she  ' i
entered Mrs. Lovejoy's house, and saw that '

lady sitting very erect on a sofa, with a
bleak face, which looked somehow as if a
north-east wind had blown over it, and
frozen it.
"Well, little girl," said she, without
waiting for ceremony, "so you call my
Annie all the bad names you can think of,
it seems. Is that the way you are brought
up?"
"I didn't call her names, ma'am; she
ate the cake, but I was willing," replied
Susy, calmly and respectfully, though she
trembled from head to foot. There was one
thought which sustained Susy; she was
telling the truth, and that was just what
God wanted her to do.
" Well," said Mrs. Lovejoy, " I must say
you're a dignified little piece!  Do you
know you've done the same thing as to
tell me I lie?"




<pb n="140"/>
140           SISTER SUSY.
This was just the way Annie had spoken 
warping innocent words, and making them
the occasion of a quarrel.
Susy could think of nothing which seemed
exactly right to say to Mrs. Lovejoy in-
reply; so she wisely held her peace.
"Yes, miss, you've insulted my child, '
and, as if that were not enough, you come :
over here, deliberately, and insult me, in
my own house !"
Tears sprang to Susy's eyes, but she 
resolutely crushed them back. There was,.;
in her childish mind, a certain sense of -;
self-respect, which made her unwilling to -
cry in the presence of such a person as :
Mrs. Lovejoy.   She felt instinctively that .
the woman was not a lady. Susy was too
young to reason about the matter; but she 
was quite sure her own mother was a model 
of good manners; and never, never had she  -




<pb n="141"/>
MORAL COURAGE.          141
known her mother to raise her voice to such
a high key, or speak such angry words !
Mrs. Lovejoy said a great many things
which were both severe and unjust; but
Susy managed to keep up a respectful man-
ner, as her mother had directed. Mrs.
Lovejoy was disappointed.  She had ex-
pected Susy would quail before her pres-
ence, and make the most humble confes-
sions.
"I always knew," cried Mrs. Lovejoy, be-
coming more and more exasperated,-" I
always knew Mrs. Parlin held her head
pretty high !  She is a proud, stuck-up
woman, your mother is; she has taught you
to look down on my little girl! 0, yes,
I understand the whole story! You're a
beautiful family for neighbors! "
Poor Susy was fairly bewildered.
Now you may go home as straight as

you can go!    But remember one think
never, while we live in this city, shall
daughter Annie darken your doors again! '"'
Susy walked home with downcast hea
and overflowing eyes. Her heart was ver
heavy, for she felt that she had been di
graced for life, and could never be respecte
any more.   Here was a trial so terri
that it caused the death of little Dandy

had fallen to her lot to-day. She wasii
little girl of quick and sensitive feelings, aii
a sharp word always wounded her more thai
a blow. How that angry woman had talke
about her mother ! 
Susy decided, upon the whole, that thi,
was the sting-this was the "pin in th'
lash," which had hurt her more than thb




<pb n="143"/>
MORAL COURAGE.          143
lash. How dared Mrs. Lovejoy say a word
about her own mother, who was certainly
the best woman that ever lived, always
excepting the good people in the Bible!
By the time she entered the house, her
indignation had risen like a blaze, and
burned away all her tears. But should she
tell her mother what Mrs. Lovejoy had said
about her own self, about her being " stuck
up," and holding her head pretty high?
Susy could not decide whether she ought
to tell her, and risk the danger of almost
breaking her heart! But before she had
time to decide, she had poured out the
whole story in a torrent.
Strange to say, Mrs. Parlin listened with
perfect calmness, and even said, when Susy
had finished, -
"Very well, my dear; now you may go
and hang up your hood and cloak."




<pb n="144"/>
144           SISTER SUSY. 
"But, mother," said Susy, rushing u
stairs again, quite out of breath, "no 
I've taken care of my things; but did yo
understand what I said, mother?   Anni
will never come into this house, neve
again ! Her mother forbids it!"
" That is quite fortunate for me, Susy
as it saves me the trouble of forbidding i
myself I"
"Why, mother, you wouldn't do such 
thing as that! Why, mother, I never hear.
of your doing such a thing in my life! " 
"I should regret the necessity very much
my child; but wouldn't it be better, on th.
whole, to have a little moral courage, an
put an end to all intercourse between th
two families, than to live in a constan
broil?"
" Why, yes, mother, I suppose so."
Susy was beginning to feel more co

MORAL COURAGE.          145 
posed. She saw that her mother understood
the whole story, yet her heart was far from
being broken!
" What is moral courage, mother ?"
"The courage to do right."
"Did I have moral courage when I told
Mrs. Lovejoy the truth?"
" Yes, dear. It was hard for you, wasn't
it? If it had been easy, there would have
been no moral courage about it."
"I am glad I had moral courage!" said
Susy, with animation. "I knew I did some-
thing right. but I didn't know what you
called it."
"Now," continued Mrs, Parlin, "I have
this very day been talking with a lady, who
once lived next door to Mrs. Lovejoy; and
she tells me enough about her to convince
me that she is not a person I wish for
a neighbor. And I have heard enough

146           SISTER SUSY.
about Annie, too, to feel very sure she it
not a safe companion for my little daughter."
"But, mother," said Susy, "you are not
-you don't feel 'stuck-up' above Mrs.
Lovejoy?"
Mrs. Parlin smiled.
"That is not a very proper expression,
Susy; but I think I do not feel stuck-up above
her in the least. I am only anxious that
my little daughter may not be injured by!

Sabbath school, and be better?"
Mrs. Parlin did not answer at once.
She was thinking of what she had said to




<pb n="147"/>
MORAL COURAGE.          147
Susy about people who are " home-mission-
aries," and do a great deal of good by a
beautiful example.
"If you were older, dear, it would be
quite different. But, instead of improving.
Annie, who is a self-willed child, I fear
you would only grow worse yourself. She
is bold, and you are rather timid.  She
wants to lead, and not to follow.  I fear
she will set you bad examples."
"I didn't know, mamma; but I thought
I was almost old enough to set my own
examples! I'm the oldest of the family."
Susy said no more about becoming a
home-missionary to Annie; for, although
she could not quite see the force of her
mother's reasoning, she believed her mother
was always right.
"But what does she mean by calling me
timid ? She has blamed me a great deal
for being bold."




<pb n="148"/>
148           SISTER SUSY.
Yes, bold Susy certainly was, when ther
was a fence to climb, a pony to ride, or
storm to be faced; but she was, neverthe-
less, a little faint-hearted  when people
laughed at her.   But Susy was learnin
every day, and this time it had been
lesson in moral courage. She did not fully
understand her mother, however, as you will
see by .nd by.

RUTHIE TURNER.          149
CHAPTER X.
RUTHIE TURNER.
"The darkest day,
Wait till to-morrow, will have passed way."
THE next morning, Susy awoke with a
faint recollection that something unpleasant
had occurred, though she could not at first
remember what it was.
"But I didn't do anything wrong," was
her second thought. "Now, after I say my
prayers, the next thing I'll feed--0, Dandy
is dead!"
"See here, Susy, said Percy, coming into
the dining-room, just after breakfast; "did
you ever see this cage before?"




<pb n="150"/>
150           SISTER SUSY.
"Now, Percy! When you know I want
it out of my sight!" 
Then, in the next breath, "Why, Percy
Eastman, if here isn't your beautiful mock-
ing-bird in the cage!"
"Yes, Susy; and if you'll keep him, and
be good to him, you'll do me a great favor." 
It was a long while before Susy could be
persuaded that this rare bird was to be herJ
" ownest own." It was a wonderfully gifted',
little creature. Susy could but own that he
was just as good as a canary, only a great
deal better.  "The greater included thei
less," He had as sweet a voice, and a vast
deal more compass. His powers of mimicry
were very amusing to poor little Prudy, ;
who was never tired of hearing him mew
like a kitten, quack like a duck, or whistle
like a school-boy.
Susy was still more delighted than Prudy. 




<pb n="151"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.          151
It was so comforting, too, to know that she
was doing Percy "a great favor," by accept-
ing his beautiful present. She wondered in
her own mind how he could be tired of such
an interesting pet, and ask her to take it,
just to get rid of it!
About this time, Mr. Parlin bought for
Prudy a little armed-chair, which rolled
about the floor on wheels. This Prudy her-
self could propel with only the outlay of
a very little strength; but there were days
when she did not care to sit in it at all.
Prudy seemed to grow worse. The doctor
was hopeful, very hopeful; but Mrs. Parlin
was not.
Prudy's dimpled hands had grown so thin,
that you could trace the winding path of
every blue vein quite distinctly. Her eyes
were large and mournful, and seemed to be
always asking for pity.  She grew  quiet




<pb n="152"/>
152           SISTER SUSY.
and patient-" painfully patient," her father 
said. Indeed, Mr. Parlin, as well as his l
wife, feared the little sufferer was ripeningl
for heaven.
"Mamma," said she, one day, "mamma,i
you never snip my fingers any nowadays ,
do you? When I'm just as naughty, you
never snip my fingers!"
Mrs. Parlin turned her face away. There 
were tears in her eyes, and she did not like i
to look at those little white fingers, which
she was almost afraid would never have the 
natural, childish naughtiness in them any
more. 
"I think sick and patient little girls don't-
need punishing," said she, after a while.
"'Do you remember how you used to think 
I snipped your hands to 'get the naughty 
out?' You thought the naughty was all in
your little hands!" 
I




<pb n="153"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.         153
"But it wasn't, mamma," said Prudy,
slowly and solemnly. "I know where it
was: it was in my heart."
"Who can take the naughty out of our
hearts, dear? Do you ever think?"
"Our Father in heaven.   No one else
can. He knows how to snip our hearts,
and get the naughty out.  Sometimes he
sends the earache and the toothache to
Susy, and the-the-lameness to me.
0, he has a great many ways of snipping! "
Prudy was showing the angel-side of her
nature now.   Suffering was "making her
perfect." She had a firm belief that God
knew all about it, and that somehow or
other it was "all right." Her mother took
a great deal of pains to teach her this. She
knew that no one can bear affliction with
real cheerfulness who does not trust in God.
But there was now and then a bright day




<pb n="154"/>
154           SISTER SUSY.
when Prudy felt quite buoyant, and wanted:
to play. Susy left everything then, and?
tried to amuse her.  If this lameness wasa
refining little Prudy, it was also making :i
Susy more patient. She could not look at,;
her little sister's pale face, and not be 
touched with pity.
One afternoon, Flossy Eastman and Ru-
thie Turner came to see Susy; and, as it was
one of Prudy's best days, Mrs. Parlin said
they might play in Prudy's sitting-room.
Ruthie was what Susy called an "old-fash-
ioned little girl."  She lived with a widowed
mother, and had no brothers and sisters,
so that she appeared much older than she
really was. She liked to talk with grown
people upon wise subjects, as if she were
at least twenty-five years old. Susy knew
that this was not good manners, and she
longed to say so to Ruthie.




<pb n="155"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.          155 
Aunt Madge was in Prudy's sitting-room
when Ruthie entered. Ruthie went up to
her and shook hands at once.
"I suppose it is Susy's aunt Madge," said
she. "I am delighted to see you, for Susy
says you love little girls, and know lots
of games.
There was such a quiet composure in
Ruth's manner, and she seemed to feel so
perfectly at home in addressing a young
lady she had never seen before, that Miss
Parlin was quite astonished, as well as a
little inclined to smile.
Then Ruthie went on to talk about the
war.   Susy listened in mute despair, for
she did not know anything about politics.
Aunt Madge looked at Susy's face, and felt
amused, for Ruthie knew nothing about
politics either: she was as ignorant as Susy.
She had only heard her mother and other




<pb n="156"/>
156          SISTER SUSY.
ladies talking together.  Ruthie answered
all the purpose of a parrot hung up in a
cage, for she caught and echoed everything
that was said, not having much idea what
it meant.
When aunt Madge heard Ruth laboring
away at long sentences, with hard words
in them, she thought of little Dotty, as shei
had seen her, that morning, trying to tug
Percy's huge dog up stairs in her arms.
"It is too much for her," thought aunt 
Madge: "the dog got the upperhand of H
Dotty, and I think the big words are more
than a match for Ruth."
But Ruth did not seem to know it, for I
she persevered.  She gravely asked aunt
Madge if she approved of the "'Mancimation
of Proclapation." Then she said she and her
mamma were very much "perplexed" when
news came of the last defeat. She would




<pb n="157"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.           157
have said "surprised," only surprised was
an every-day word, and not up to her stand-
ard of elegant English.
Ruth was not so very silly, after all. It
was only when she tried to talk of matters
too old for her that she made herself ridicu-
lous. She was very quiet and industrious,
and had knit several pairs of socks for the
soldiers.
As soon as Miss Parlin could disentangle
herself from her conversation with Ruthie,
she left the children to themselves.
"Let's keep school," said Prudy. "I'll be
teacher, if you want me to."
"Very well," replied Susy, "we'll let her;
won't we, girls? she is such a darling."
"Well," said Prudy, with a look of im-
mense satisfaction,- "please go, Susy, and
ask grandma if I may have one of those
shiny, white handkerchiefs she wears on her
.?eck, and a cap, and play Quaker."




<pb n="158"/>
158           SISTER SUSY.-          .
Grandma was very glad that Prudy f
well enough to play Quaker, and lent ]h
as much "costume" as she needed, as w
as a pair of spectacles without eyes, whic
the children often borrowed for their play
fancying that they added to the dignity o
the wearer.
When Prudy was fairly equipped, she wa
a droll little Quakeress, surely, and grandm
had to be called up from the kitchen to be-
hold her with her own eyes. The little sofl
face, almost lost in the folds of the expan-I
sive cap, was every bit as solemn as if she
had been, as aunt Madge said, "a hundred
years old, and very old for her age." 
She was really a sweet little likeness of
grandma Read in miniature.
"And their names are alike, too," said-
Susy: "grandma's name is Prudence, and so ,
is Prudy's."




<pb n="159"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.          159
"Used to be," said Prudy, gravely.
" Rosy Frances " was now lifted most care-
fully into her little wheeled chair, and no
queen ever held a court with more dignity
than she assumed as she smoothed into place
the folds of her grandma's snowy kerchief,
which she wore about her neck.
"What shall we do first?" said Flossy
and Susy.
"Thee? thee?" Prudy considered " thee"
the most important word of all. " Why,
thee may behave; I mean, behave thyselves."
The new teacher had not collected her
ideas yet.
"Let's get our books together," said Susy,
"and then we'll all sit on the sofa and
study."
"Me, me," chimed in Dotty Dimple, drop-
ping the little carriage in which she was
wheeling her kitty; "me, too!"




<pb n="160"/>
160           SISTER SUSY.
"Well, if you must, you must; snug
in here between Flossy and me," said Sus
who was determined that to-day everythir
should go on pleasantly.
" Sixteenth class in joggerphy," said Mi
Rosy Frances, peeping severely over hL
spectacles. "Be spry quick!"
The three pupils stood up in a row, hol
ing their books close to their faces.
"Thee may hold out your hands no
and I shall ferule thee -the whole school,
was the stern remark of the young teacheI
as she took off her spectacles to wipe t
holes.
" Why, we haven't been doing anything
said Ruthie, affecting to cry.
"No, I know it; but thee'd ought to ha
been doing something; thee'd ought to haV
studied thy lessons."                 i
"But, teacher, we didn't have time',
i 




<pb n="161"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.          161
pleaded Flossy; "you called us out so
quick ! Won't you forgive us !"
"Yes, I will," said Rosy Frances, gently;
"I will, if thee'll all speak up 'xtremely loud,
and fix thine eyes on thy teacher."
The pupils replied, "Yes, ma'am," at the
top of their voices.
"Now," said Rosy Frances, appearing to
read from the book, " where is the Isthmus
of Susy?" 
The scholars all laughed, and answered
at random. They did not know that their
teacher was trying to say the "Isthmus
of Suez."
The next question took them by surprise :
" Is there any man in the moon ?"
"What a queer idea, Rosy," said Susy;
"what made you ask that?"
"'Cause I wanted to know," replied the
Quaker damsel. "They said he came down




<pb n="162"/>
162           SISTER SUSY.
when the other man was eatin' porridge. I
should think, if he went back up there, and
didn't have any wife and children, he'd be :
real lonesome ! " 
This idea of Prudy's set the whole school,
to romancing, although it was in the midst
of a recitation. Flossy said if there was
a man in the moon, he must be a giant, or 
he never could get round over the moun-
tains, which she had heard were very steep.
Ruthie asked if there was anything said,
about his wife! Susy, who had read con-,
siderable poetry, was sure she had heard
something of a woman up there, named:I
"Cynthia;" but she supposed it was all
"moonshine," or "made up," as she ex-
pressed it. She said she meant to ask her
aunt Madge to write a fairy story about it.
Here their progress in useful knowledge 
was cut short by the disappearance of Dotty.




<pb n="163"/>
EUTHIE TURNER.          163
Looking out of the window, they saw the
little rogue driving ducks with a broomstick.
These ducks had a home not far from Mrs.
Parlin's, and if Dotty Dimple had one temp-
tation stronger than all others, it was the
sight of those waddling fowls, with their
velvet heads, beads of eyes, and spotted
feathers.  When she saw them   "marshin'
along," she was instantly seized with a de-
sire either to head the company or to march
in the rear, and set them to quacking. She
was bareheaded, and Susy ran down stairs
to bring her into the house; and that was
an end of the school for that day. Dotty
Dimple was something like the kettle of
molasses which Norah was boiling, very
sweet, but very apt to boil over: she needed
watching.
When Norah's candy was brought up
stairs, the little girls pronounced it ex-
uellent.




<pb n="164"/>
164            SISTER SUSY.
"0, dear," said Flossy, "I wish our girl
was half as good as Norah ! I don't see why'
Electa and Norah ain't more alike when they
are own sisters !"
"What dreadful girls your mother always
has ! " said Susy; "it's too bad ! "
"I know of a girl," said Prudy, "one ;
you'd like ever'n, ever so much, Flossy;:
only you can't have her."
"Why not?" said Flossy: "my mother'
would go hundreds of leagues to get a good" f
girl. Why can't she have her?"
"0, 'cause, she's dead!    It's Norah'sl-
cousin over to Ireland." 
They next played the little game of guess-
ing "something in this room," that begins
with a certain letter. Ruthie puzzled them :
a long while on the initial S. At last she: 
said she meant "scrutau" (escritoire or
scrutoire), pointing towards the article with 
her finger. 




<pb n="165"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.          165
"Why, that's a writing-desk," said Susy.
"I don't see where you learn so many big
words, Ruthie."
" 0, I take notice, and remember them,"
replied Ruthie, looking quite pleased. She
thought Susy was praising her.
"Now   let me tell some letters," said
Prudy.
"L. R. She lives at your house, Flossy."
Nobody could guess.
"Why, I should think that was easy
enough," said Prudy: "it's that girl that
lives there; she takes off the covers of
your stove with a clothes-pin: it's 'Lecta
Rosbor.nd.'"
The little girls explained to Prudy that
the true initials of Electa Osborne would
be E. 0., instead of L. R. But Prudy did
not know much about spelling. She had
known most of her letters; but it was some

out of her head.                         .
She said, often, she wished she could*

teach her, but Mrs. Parlin said it would
never do till Prudy felt stronger.
I will tell you now why I think Susy did 
not understand her mother when she said
Annie was not a suitable playmate. In thl  i
evening, after Ruthie and Flossy were gone, i 
Susy said to her mother, -                ?
"I feel real cross with Ruthie, mamma: I :
think she puts herself forward.  She goes I'
into a room, and no matter how old the 
people are that are talking, she speaks up, ,
and says, '0, yes, I know all about it. I 
never saw such an old-fashioned little girl.": i  "
Very well," said Mrs. Parlin; "if she
is rude, take care that the same fault does
not appear in yourself, Susy."




<pb n="167"/>
RUTHIE TURNER.         167
"But, mother," said Susy, suddenly veer-
ing about and speaking in Ruth's favor, "
don't know but it's proper to do as Ruthy
does.  If you know something, and other
people don't, ain't it right to speak up and
say it?"
"It is never right for little girls to mo-
nopolize conversation, Susy; that is, to take
the lead in it, and so prevent older people
from talking. Neither is it proper to pre-
tend to know more than we do, and talk
of things beyond our knowledge."
"I knew you would say so, mother. I
just asked to hear what you would say. I
know Ruthie is ill-mannered: do you think
I ought to play with her any more ?"
Mrs. Parlin looked at Susy in surprise.
"Why, you know, mother, you wouldn't
let me play with Annie Lovejoy. You said,
'evil communications corrupted good man-
ners.'"

"But can't you see any difference in theI
cases, Susy? What a muddy little head your
must wear on your shoulders !"         -
"Not much of any," said Susy, trying to
think; "they're both bold; that's what you
don't like."
"Anything else, Susy?" 
"0, yes, mother; Ruthie's good, and Annie
isn't. It was queer for me to forget that! " -
"I should think it was, Susy, since it is '
the only thing of much importance, after all. ;
Now, it seems to me you are very ready to 
cast off your friends when their manners 
offend you. How would you like it to be 
treated in the same way?   Suppose Mrs. 
Turner and Ruthie should be talking to- 
gether this very minute.    Ruthie says,
'That Susy Parlin keeps her drawers in I
a perfect tumble; she isn't orderly a bit.
Susy Parlin never knit a stitch for the -

soldiers in her life. Mother, mayn't I step
playing with Susy Parlin? '"
Susy laughed, and looked a little ashamed.
"Well, mother," said she, twisting the
corner of her handkerchief, " I guess I can't
say anything about Ruthie Turner; she's
a great deal better girl than I am, any
'way."'

DAYS and weeks passed.     The snow- `
flakes, which had fallen from time to time, 
and kept themselves busy making a patch-;
work quilt for mother Earth, now melted
away, and the white quilt was torn into
shreds.  The bare ground was all there
was to be seen, except now and then a dot:
of the white coverlet. It was Spring, and;
everything began to wake up.    The sun l
wasn't half so sleepy, and didn't walk off 
over the western hills in the middle of the
afternoon to take a nap.
The sleighing was gone long ago. Thel

roads were   dismal swamps.    "Wings"
would have a rest till "settled going."
Susy's skates were hung up in a green
baize bag, to dream away the summer.
The mocking-bird performed his daily
duties of entertaining the family, besides
learning a great many new songs.    Susy
said she tried not to set her heart on that
bird.
"I'll not give him a name," she added,
' for then he'll be sure to die! My first
canary was Bertie, and i named the others
Berties, as fast as they died off. The last
one was so yellow that I couldn't heip
calling him Dandelion; but I wish I hadn't,
for then, perhaps, he'd have lived."
Susy had caught some whimsical notions
about 'signs and wonders." It is strange
how some intelligent children will believe
in superstitious stories! But as soon as




<pb n="172"/>
172           SISTER SUSY.
Susy's parents discovered that her young
head had been stored with such worse than
foolish ideas, they were not slow to teach
her better. 
She had a great fright, about this time,;
concerning Freddy Jackson. He was one
of the few children who were allowed to;
play in "Prudy's sitting-room." He did not
distract the tired nerves of "Rosy Frances,";
as her cousin Percy and other boys did, by
sudden shouts and loud laughing. Prudy,
had a vague feeling that he was one of the;l
little ones that God thought best to punish
by "snipping his heart."  She knew what 
it was to have her heart snipped, and had
a sympathy with little Freddy.
Susy loved Freddy, too. Perhaps Percy X
was right, when he said that Susy loved :
everything that was dumb; and I am not 
sure but her tender heart would have 
;ij




<pb n="173"/>
SUSY'S BIRTHDAY.        173
warmed to him all the more if he had been
stone-blind, as well as deaf.
Freddy had a drunken father, and a sad
home; but, for all that, he was not entirely
miserable. It is only the wicked who are
miserable. The kind Father in heaven has
so planned it that there is something pleas-
ant in everybody's life.
Freddy had no more idea what sound is
than we have of the angels in heaven; but
he could see, and there is so much to be
seen! Here is a great, round world, full
of beauty and wonder. It stands ready to
be looked at. Freddy's ears must be for-
ever shut out from pleasant sounds; but
his bright eyes were wide open, seeing all
that was made to be seen.
He loved to go to Mrs. Parlin's, for there
he was sure to be greeted pleasantly; and
he understood the language of smiles as well
as anybody.

When grandma Read saw him coming
Ahe would say,-                       '
"Now, Susan, thee'd better lay aside thy
book, for most likely the poor little fellow
will want to talk."
And Susy did lay aside her book. She
had learned so many lessons this winter ih
self-denial !
These "silent talks" were quite droll.
Little Dotty almost understood somethin
about them; that is, when they used the
signs: the alphabet was more than she couldJ
manage. When Freddy wanted to talk about
Dotty, he made a sign for a dimple in eachl
cheek. He smoothed his hair when he meant
Susy, and made a waving motion over hiss
head for Prudy, whose hair was full of 
ripples.
Prudy said she had wrinkled hair, and,'
she knew it; but the wrinkles " wouldn't 
come out."




<pb n="175"/>
SUSY'S BIRTHDAY.        175
Grandma Read sat one evening by the
coal-grate, holding a letter in her hand, and
looking into the glowing fire with a
thoughtful expression. Susy came and sat
near her, resting one arm on her grandma's
lap, and trying in various ways to attract
her attention.
" Why, grandma," said she, "I've spoken
to you three times; but I can't get you to
answer or look at me."
"What does thee want, my dear? I will
try to attend to thee."
" 0, grandma, there are ever so many
things I want to say, now mother is out
of the room, and father hasn't got home.
I must tell somebody, or my heart will
break; and you know, grandma dear, I can
talk to you so easy."
" Can thee? Then go on, Susy; what
would thee like to say?"
12




<pb n="176"/>
176           SISTER SUSY.
"0, two or three things. Have you nt
ticed, grandma, that I've been just as sobe
as can be?"                               [
"For how long, Susan?"
" 0, all day; I've felt as if I couldn't but
just live!"
Grandma Read did not smile at this.:;
She knew very well that such a child as
Susy is capable of intense suffering. 
"Well, Susan, is it about thy sister Pru-
dence?"
"O, no, grandma! she's getting better;!
isn't she?"
"Are thy lessons at school too hard ibr 
thee, Susan?" 
Mrs. Read saw that Susy was very reluc
taut about opening her heart, although she'
had said she could talk to her grandmother
"so easy."
"No, indeed, grandma; my lessons are




<pb n="177"/>
SUSY'S BIRTHDAY.        177
not too hard.  I'm a real good scholar-
one of the best in school for my age."
This was a fact. Some people would have
chidden Susy for saying it; but Mrs. Read
reflected that the child was only telling the
simple truth, and had no idea of boasting.
She was not a little girl who would intrude
such remarks about herself upon strangers.
But when she and her grandma were talk-
ing together confidentially, she thought it
made all the difference in the world; as
indeed it did.
"I have a great deal to trouble me," said
Susy, and the "evening-blue" of her eyes
clouded over, till there were signs of a
shower. "I thought my pony would make
me happy as long as I lived; but it hasn't.
One thing that I feel bad about is-well, it's

Grandma smiled, but did not interrupt
Susy.

Grandma tried to look serious.
"Who put such a foolish idea into thy
head, child?"
" Cousin Percy told me last night," an-
swered Susy, solemnly.   "How can you
laugh when it's all in the Bible, grandma?
I never told anybody before. Wait; I'll
show you the verse. I've put a mark at
the place."
Susy brought her Bible to her grand.
mother, and, opening it at the thirty-first
chapter of Proverbs, pointed, with a trem-
bling finger, to the eighth verse, which Mrs.
Read read aloud,-
"Open thy mouth for the dumb in the
cause of all such as are appointed to de,
struction."
"Now Percy says that's a sure sign! I
told him, 0, dear! Freddy ought to marry
a dumb woman; that would be properest;

we should read his Bible as if it were a /

"Then you don't think I shall have to 
marry Freddy Jackson," cried Susy, im-,
mensely relieved.   "I'm  so glad I told    .
you! I felt so sober all day, only nobody  .
noticed it, and I was ashamed to tell!" 
"It is a good thing for thee to tell thy.:
little troubles to thy older friends, Susan :
thee'll almost always find it so," said grand
ma Read, stroking Susy's hair. 
"Now, my child, I have a piece of newsy'
for thee, if thee is ready to hear it: thy
cousin, Grace Clifford, has a little sister.",

"A baby sister? A real sister? Does
mother know it?"
"Yes, thy mother knows it."
"But how could you keep it to yourself
so long?"
"Thee thinks good news is hard to keep,
does thee? Well, thee shall be the first to
tell thy father when he comes home."
Susy heard steps on the door-stone, and
rushed out, with the joyful story on her lips.
It proved to be not her father, but callers,
who were just ringing the bell; and they
heard Susy's exclamation, -
"0, have you heard?   Grace has a new
sister, a baby sister, as true as you live !"
with the most provoking coolness.
But when Mr. Parlin came, he was suffi-
ciently interested in the news to satisfy
even Susy.

FAREWELL.
PRUDY was really getting better.  Mrs:
Parlin said she should trust a physician   ! 
more next time. The doctor declared that   :
all the severe pain Prudy had suffered was  ^  -
really necessary.           ;:1.
"Believe me, my dear madam," said he, ^ 
"when the poor child has complained most,  I  -,
she has in fact been making most progress :;:
towards health. When the sinews are 'knit- i 
ting together,' as we call it, then the agony
is greatest."                              i
This was very comforting to Mrs. Parlin, i-t
who thought she would not be discouraged :.




<pb n="183"/>
FAREWELL.             183
so easily again; she would always believe
that it is "darkest just before day."
There was really everything to hope for
Prudy. The doctor thought that by the end
of three months she would walk as well as
ever.  He said she might make the effort
now, every day, to bear her weight on her
feet. She tried this experiment first with
her father and mother on each side to sup-
port her; but it was not many days before
she could stand firmly on her right foot, and
bear a little weight on her left one, which
did not now, as formerly, drag, or, as she
had said, " more than touch the floor." By
and by she began to scramble about on the
carpet on all fours, partly creeping, partly
pushing herself along.
It was surprising how   much pleasure
Prudy took in going back to these ways
of babyhood.




<pb n="184"/>
184           SISTER SUSY.
Faint blush roses began to bloom in her
cheeks as soon as she could take a little
exercise and go out of doors.  Her father
bought a little carriage just suitable for the
pony, and in this she rode every morning,
her mother or Percy driving; for Mrs. Par-
lin thought it hardly safe to trust Susy with
such a precious encumbrance as this dear
little sister.
She had been willing that Susy should
manage Wings in a sleigh, but in a carriage -
the case was quite different; for, though in
a sleigh there might be even more danger
of overturning, there was not as much
danger of getting hurt.   Indeed, Susy's
sleigh had tipped over once or twice in
turning too sharp a corner, and Susy had
fallen out, but had instantly jumped up
again, laughing.
She would have driven in her new car- 
-i

riage to Yarmouth and back again, or per-
haps to Bath, if she had been permitted.
She was a reckless little horsewoman,
afraid of nothing, and for that very reason
could not be trusted alone.
But there was no difficulty in finding com-
panions. Percy pretended to study book-
keeping, but was always ready for a ride.
Flossy was not steady enough to be trusted
with the reins, but Ruth Turner was as
careful a driver as need be; though Susy
laughed because she held the reins in both
hands, and looked so terrified.
She said it did no good to talk with Ruth
when she was driving; she never heard a
word, for she was always watching to see
if a carriage was coming, and talking to
herself, to make sure she remembered which
was her right hand, so she could "turn to
the right, as the law directs."




<pb n="186"/>
186            SISTER SUSY.
Prudy enjoyed the out-of-doors world
once more, and felt like a bird let out of
a cage. And so did Susy, for she thought
she had had a dull season of it, and fully
agreed with Prudy, who spoke of it as the;
"slow winter."
But now it was the quick spring, the live:
spring. The brooks began to gossip; the 
birds poured out their hearts in song, and 
the dumb trees expressed their joy in leaves.
"The bobolink, on the mullein-stalk,
Would rattle away like a sweet girl's talk."  - .
The frogs took severe colds, but gave     :;
concerts a little way out of the city every 
evening. The little flowers peeped up from
their beds, as Norah said, "like babies ask- 
ing to be took;" and Susy took them, when-' - 
ever she could find them, you may be sure, 
and looked joyfully into their faces.  She   :
could almost say,-




<pb n="187"/>
FAREWELL.             187
" And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes."
She said, "I don't suppose they know
much, but perhaps they know enough to
have a good time: who knows?"
Susy took long walks to Westbrook, and
farther, coming home tired out, but loaded
with precious flowers. There were plenty
of friends to give them to her from their
early gardens: broad-faced crocuses, jon-
quils, and lilies of the valley, and by and
by lilacs, with "purple spikes."
She gathered snowdrops, "the first pale
blossoms of the unripened year," and May-
flowers, pink and white, like sea-shells, or
like "cream-candy," as Prudy said. These
soft little blossoms blushed so sweetly on
the same leaf with such old experienced
leaves! Susy said, "it made her think of
little bits of children who hadn't any mother,
and lived with their grandparents."




<pb n="188"/>
188           SISTER SUSY.
Dotty was almost crazy with delight
when she had a "new pair o' boots, and a
pair o' shaker," and was allowed to toddle
about on the pavement in the sunshine.
She had a green twig or a switch to flourish,
and could now cry, " Hullelo ! " to those
waddling ducks, and hear them reply,
"Quack! quack!" without having such a
trembling fear that some stern Norah, or
firm mamma, would rush out bareheaded,
and drag her into the house, like a little
culprit.
It was good times for Dotty Dimple, and
good times for the whole family. Spring
had come, and Prudy was getting well.
There was a great deal to thank God for!
It is an evening in the last of May. A
bit of a moon, called "the new moon," is
peeping in at the window. It shines over
Susy's right shoulder, she says. Susy is

reading, Prudy is walking slowly across the
floor, and Dotty Dimple is whispering to
her kitty, telling her to go down cellar, and
catch the naughty rats while they are asleep.
When kitty winks, Dotty thinks it the same
as if she said, -
"I hear you, little Miss Dotty: I'm
going."
I think perhaps this is a good time to bid
the three little girls good by, or, as dear
grandma Read would say, "Farewelll"

PREFACE.
HERE is a story about the oldest of the three
little Parlin girls, " Sister Susy;" though so
many things are always happening to Prudy
that it is not possible to keep her out of the
book.
I hope my dear little friends will see how
kind it was in God to send the " slow winter"
and the long nights of pain to little Prudy.
If trouble should come to us, let us grow
gentle, and patient, and lovely.
Little friends, be sure of one thing- our dear
Father in heaven sends us something hard to 
bear only because he loves us.

For twenty years I had been perfectly comfortable; for twenty years I had had the window-boxes filled in the spring, the carpets lifted, the awnings put up and the furniture covered with brown linen; for as many summers I had said good-by to my friends, and, after watching their perspiring hegira, had settled down to a delicious quiet in town, where the mail comes three times a day, and the water supply does not depend on a tank on the roof.</p><p>And then--the madness seized me. When I look<pb n="2     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"/>back over the months I spent at Sunnyside, I wonder that I survived at all. As it is, I show the wear and tear of my harrowing experiences. I have turned very gray--Liddy reminded me of it, only yesterday, by saying that a little bluing in the rinse-water would make my hair silvery, instead of a yellowish white. I hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and I snapped her off.</p><p>"No," I said sharply, "I'm not going to use bluing at my time of life, or starch, either."</p><p>Liddy's nerves are gone, she says, since that awful summer, but she has enough left, goodness knows! And when she begins to go around with a lump in her throat, all I have to do is to threaten to return Sunnyside, and she is frightened into a semblance of cheerfulness,--from which you may judge that the summer there was anything but a success.</p><p>The newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incomplete--one of them mentioned me but once, and then only as the tenant at the time the thing happened--that I feel it my due to tell what I know. Mr.Jamieson, the detective, said himself he could never have done without me, although he gave me litte enough credit, in print.</p><pb n="3     I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE"/><p>I shall have to go back several years--thirteen, to be exact--to start my story. At that time my brother died, leaving me his two children. Halsey was eleven then, and Gertrude was seven. All the responsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me suddenly; to perfect the profession of motherhood requires precisely as many years as the child has lived, like the man who started to carry the calf and ended by walking along with the bull on his shoulders. However, I did the best I could. When Gertrude got past the hair-ribbon age, and Halsey asked for a scarf-pin and put on long trousers--and a wonderful help that was to the darning--I sent them away to good schools. After that, my responsibility was chiefly postal, with three months every summer in which to replenish their wardrobes, look over their lists of acquaintances, and generally to take my foster-motherhood out of its nine months' retirement in camphor.</p><p>I missed the summers with them when, somewhat later, at boarding-school and college, the children spent much of their vacations with friends. Gradually I found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome than when signed to a letter, though I wrote them at stated intervals. But when Halsey had<pb n="4     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"/>finished his electrical course and Gertrude her boarding-school, and both came home to stay, things were suddenly changed. The winter Gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of sitting up late at night to bring her home from things, taking her to the dressmakers between naps the next day, and discouraging ineligible youths with either more money than brains, or more brains than money. Also, I acquired a great many things: to say <hi rend="italic">lingerie</hi> for under-garments, "frocks" and "gowns" instead dresses, and that beardless sophomores are not college boys, but college men. Halsey required less personal supervision, and as they both got their mother's fortune that winter, my responsibility became purely moral. Halsey bought a car, of course, and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray baize veil, and, after a time, never to stop to look at the dogs one has run down. People are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs.</p><p>The additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt, and by spring I was quite tractable. So when Halsey suggested camping in the Adirondacks and Gertrude wanted Bar Harbor, we compromised on a good country house with links near,<pb n="5     I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE"/>within motor distance of town and telephone distance of the doctor. That was how we went to Sunnyside.</p><p>We went out to inspect the property, and it seemed to deserve its name. Its cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of the ordinary. Only one thing seemed unusual to me: the housekeeper, who had been left in charge, had moved from the house to the gardener's lodge, a few days before. As the lodge was far enough away from the house, it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their work of destruction undisturbed. The property was an extensive one: the house on the top of a hill, which sloped away in great stretches of green lawn and clipped hedges, to the road; and across the valley, perhaps a couple of miles away, was the Greenwood Club House. Gertrude and Halsey were infatuated.</p><p>"Why, it's everything you want," Halsey said. "View, air, good water and good roads. As for the house, it's big enough for a hospital, if it has a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back," which was ridiculous: it was pure Elizabethan.</p><p>Of course we took the place; it was not my idea of comfort, being much too large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question serious. But I give my-<pb n="6     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"/>self credit for this: whatever has happened since never blamed Halsey and Gertrude for taking me there. And another thing: if the series of catastrophes there did nothing else, it taught me one thing--that somehow, somewhere, from perhaps a half-civilized ancestor who wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his food or his prey, I have in me the instinct of the chase. Were I a man I should be a trapper of criminals, trailing them as relentlessly as no doubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar. But being an unmarried woman, with the handicap of my sex, my first acquaintance with crime will probably be my last. Indeed, it came near enough to being my last acquaitance with anything.</p><p>The property was owned by Paul Armstrong, the president of the Traders' Bank, who at the time took the house was in the west with his wife daughter, and a Doctor Walker, the Armstrong family physician. Halsey knew Louise Armstrong--had been rather attentive to her the winter before, but as Halsey was always attentive to somebody, I had not thought of it seriously, although she was a charming girl.  I knew of Mr. Armstrong only through his connection with the bank, where the children's money<pb n="7     I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE"/>was largely invested, and through an ugly story about the son, Arnold Armstrong, who was reported to have forged his father's name, for a considerable amount, to some bank paper. However, the story had had no interest for me.</p><p>I cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party, and moved out to Sunnyside the first of May. The roads were bad, but the trees were in leaf, and there were still tulips in the borders around the house. The arbutus was fragrant in the woods under the dead leaves, and on the way from the station, a short mile, while the car stuck in the mud, I found a bank showered with tiny forget-me-nots. The birds--don't ask me what kind; they all look alike to me, unless they have a hall mark of some bright color--the birds were chirping in the hedges, and everything breathed of peace. Liddy, who was born and bred on a brick pavement, got a little bit down-spirited when the crickets began to chirp, or scrape their legs together, or whatever it is they do, at twilight.</p><p>The first night passed quietly enough. I have always been grateful for that one night's peace; it shows what the country might be, under favorable circumstances. Never after that night did I put my<pb n="8     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE/>head on my pillow with any assurance how long it would be there; or on my shoulders, for that matter.</p><p>On the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston, my own housekeeper, had a difference of opinion, and Mrs. Ralston left on the eleven train. Just after luncheon, Burke, the butler, was taken unexpectedly with a pain in his right side, much worse when I was within hearing distance, and by afternoon he was started cityward. That night the cook's sister had a baby--the cook, seeing indecision in my face, made it twins on second thought--and, to be short, by no the next day the household staff was down to Lidd and myself. And this in a house with twenty-two rooms and five baths!</p><p>Liddy wanted to go back to the city at once, but the milk-boy said that Thomas Johnson, the Armstrongs' colored butler, was working as a waiter at the Greenwood Club, and might come back. I have the usual scruples about coercing people's servants away, but few of us have any conscience regarding institutions or corporations--witness the way we beat railroads and street-car companies when we can--so I called up the club, and about eight o'clock Thomas Johnson came to see me. Poor Thomas!</p><pb n="9     I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE"/><p>Well, it ended by my engaging Thomas on the spot, at outrageous wages, and with permission to sleep in the gardener's lodge, empty since the house was rented. The old man--he was white-haired and a little stooped, but with an immense idea of his personal dignity--gave me his reasons hesitatingly.</p><p>"I ain't sayin' nothin', Mis' Innes," he said, with his hand on the door-knob, "but there's been goin's-on here this las' few months as ain't natchal. 'Tain't one thing an' 'tain't another--it's jest a door squealin' here, an' a winder closin' there, but when doors an' winders gets to cuttin' up capers and there's nobody nigh 'em, it's time Thomas Johnson sleeps somewhar's else."</p><p>Liddy, who seemed to be never more than ten feet away from me that night, and was afraid of her shadow in that great barn of a place, screamed a little, and turned a yellow-green. But I am not easily alarmed.</p><p>It was entirely in vain I represented to Thomas that we were alone, and that he would have to stay in the house that night. He was politely firm, but he would come over early the next morning, and if I gave him a key, he would come in time to get some sort of<pb n="10     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE/>breakfast. I stood on the huge veranda and watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive, with mingled feelings--irritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at getting him at all I am not ashamed to say that I double-locked the hall door when I went in.</p><p>"You can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed, Liddy," I said severely. "You give me the creeps standing there. A woman of your age ought to have better sense." It usualy braces Liddy to mention her age: she owns to forty--which is absurd. Her mother cooked for my grandfather, and Liddy must be at least as old as I. But that night she refused to brace.</p>"you're not going to ask me to lock up, Miss Rachel!" she quavered. "Why, there's a dozen French windows in the drawing-room and the billiard-room wing, and every one opens on a porch. And Mary Anne said that last night there was a man standing by the stable when she locked the kitchen door."</p><p>"Mary Anne was a fool," I said sternly. "If there had been a man there,she would have had him in the kitchen and been feeding him what was left from dinner,inside of an hour,from force of habit. Now don't be ridiculous. Lock up the hose and go to bed. I am going to read."</p><pb n="11     I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE"/><p>But Liddy set her lips tight and stood still.I'm not going to bed," she said. I'am going to pack up, and to-morrow I am going to leave."</p>"You'll do nothing of the sort," I snapped. Liddy and  I often desire to part company, but never at the same time. "If you are afraid, I will go with you, but for goodness' sake don't try to hide behind me."</p>The house was a typical summer residence on an extensive scale. Wherever possible,on the first floor, the architect had done away with partitions, using arches and columns instead. The effect was cool and spacious, but scarcely cozy. As Liddy and I went from one window to another, our voices echoed back at us uncomfortably. There was plenty of light--the electric plant down in the village supplied us--but there were long vistas of polished floor, and mirrors which reflected us from unexpected corners, until I felt some of Lyddy's foolishness communicate itself to me.</p>The house was very long, a rectangle in general form,with the main entrance in the center of the long side. The brick-paved entry opened into a short hall, to the right of which, separated only by a row of pillars, was a huge living-room. Beyond that was the drawing-room,and in the end, the billiard-room. Off<pb n="12     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"/> the billiard-room, in the extreme right wing, was a den, or card-room, with a small hall opening on the east veranda, and from there went up a narrow circular staircase. Halsey had pointed it out with delight.</p><p>"Just look, Aunt Rachel," he said with a flourish.</p><p>"The architect that put up this joint was wise few things. Arnold Armstrong and his friends could sit here and play cards all night and stumble up to bed in the early morning, without having the family send in a police call."</p><p>Liddy and I got as far as the card-room and turned on all the lights. I tried the small entry door there,which opened on the veranda, and examined the windows. Everything was secure, and Liddy, a little less nervous now, had just pointed out to me the disgracefully dusty condition of the hard-wood floor, when suddenly the lights went out. We waited a moment; I think Liddy was stunned with fright, or she would have screamed. And then I clutched her by the arm and pointed to one of the windows opening on the porch. The sudden change threw the window into relief, an oblong of grayish light, and showed us a figure standing close, peering in. As I looked it darted across the veranda and out of sight in the darkeness.<pb n="13"/>CHAPTER IIA LINK CUFF-BUTTON<p>LIDDY's knees seemed to give away under her.</p><p>Without a sound she sank down, leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement. Liddy began to moan under her breath, and in my excitement I reached down and shook her.</p><p>"Stop it," I whispered. "It's only a woman--maybe a maid of the Armstrongs'. Get up and help me find the door." She groaned again. "Very well," I said, "then I'll have to leave you here. I'm going."</p><p>She moved at that, and, holding to my sleeve, we felt our way, with numerous collisions, to the billiard-room, and from there to the drawing-room. The lights came on then, and, with the long French windows unshuttered, I had a creepy feeling that each one sheltered a peering face. In fact, in the light of what happened afterward, I am pretty certain we were under surveillance during the entire ghostly evening. We<pb n="14     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"/>hurried over the rest of the locking-up and got upstairs as quickly as we could. I left the lights all on, and our footsteps echoed cavernously. Liddy had a stiff neck the next morning, from looking back over her shoulder, and she refused to go to bed</p><p>"Let me stay in your dressing-room, Miss Rachel," she begged. "If you don't, I'll sit in the hall outside the door. I'm not going to be murdered with my eyes shut."</p><p>"If you're going to be murdered," I retorted, "it won't make any difference whether they are shut or open. But you may stay in the dressing-room, if you will lie on the couch: when you sleep in a chair you snore."</p><p>She was too far gone to be indignant, but after a while she came to the door and looked in to where I was composing myself for sleep with Drummond's <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Life.</hi></p><p>"That wasn't a woman, Miss Rachel," she said, with her shoes in her hand. "It was a man in a long coat."</p><p>"What woman was a man?" I discouraged her* without looking up, and she went back to the couch.</p><p>It was eleven o'clock when I finally prepared for<pb n="15     A LINK CUFF-BUTTON/>bed. In spite of my assumption of indifference, I locked the door into the hall, and finding the transom did not catch, I put a chair cautiously before the door--it was not necessary to rouse Liddy--and climbing up put on the ledge of the transom a small dressing-mirror, so that any movement of the frame would send it crashing down. Then, secure in my precautions, I went to bed.</p><p>I did not go to sleep at once. Liddy disturbed me just as I was growing drowsy, by coming in and peering under the bed. She was afraid to speak, however, because of her previous snubbing, and went back, stopping in the doorway to sigh dismally.</p><p>Somewhere down-stairs a clock with a chime sang away the hours--eleven-thirty, forty-five, twelve. And then the lights went out to stay. The Casanova Electric Company shuts up shop and goes home to bed at midnight: when one has a party, I believe it is customary to fee the company, which will drink hot coffee and keep awake a couple of hours longer. But the lights were gone for good that night. Liddy had gone to sleep, as I knew she would. She was a very unreliable person: always awake and ready to talk when she wasn't wanted and dozing off to sleep when<pb n="16     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"/>she was. I called her once ot twice, the only result being an explosive snore that threatened her very windpipe--then I got up and lighted a bedroom candle.</p><p>My bedroom and dressing-room were above the big living-room on the first floor. On the second floor a long corridor ran the length of the house, with rooms opening from both sides. In the wings were small corridors crossing the main one--the plan was simplicity itself. And just as I got back to bed, I heard a sound from the east wing, apparently, that made me stop,frozen, with one bedroom slipper half off, and listen. It was a rattling metallic sound, and it reverberated along the empty halls like the crash of doom. It was for all the world as if something heavy, perhaps a piece of steel, had rolled clattering and jangling down the hard-wood stairs leading to the card-room.</p><p>In the silence that followed Liddy stirred and snored again. I was exasperated:first she kept me awake by silly alarms, then when she was needed she slept like Joe Jefferson, or Rip,--they are always the same to me. I went in and aroused her, and I give her credit for being wide awake the minute I spoke.</p> <pb n="17     A LINK CUFF-BUTTON"/><p>Get up," I said, "if you don't want to be murdered in your bed."</p><p>"Where? How?"she yelled vociferously, and jumped up."</p>There's somebody in the house," I said. "Get up. We'll have to get to the telephone."</p><p>"Not out in the hall!"she gasped; "Oh, Miss Rachel, not out in the hall!" trying to hold me back. But I am a large woman and Liddy is small. We got to the door, somehow, and Liddy held a brass and-iron, which it was all she could do to lift, let alone brain anybody with. I listened, and hearing nothing, opened the door a little and peered into the hall. It was a black void, full of terrible suggestion, and my candle only emphazised the gloom. Liddy squealed and drew me back again, and as the door slammed, the mirror I had put on the transom came down and hit her on the head. That completed our demoralization. It was some time before I could persuade her she had not been attacked from behind by a burglar, and when she found the mirror smashed on the floor she wasn't much better.</p><p>There's going to be a death!" she wailed. "Oh, Miss Rachel, there's going to be a death!"</p><pb n="18"/>I8     THE CIRCULAR       STAIRCASE"There will be," I said grimly, "if you don't keepquiet, Liddy Allen."And so we sat there until morning, wondering ifthe candle would last until dawn, and arranging what.trains we could take back to town. If we had onlystuck to that decision and gone back before it was too'late!The sun came finally, and from my window Iwatched the trees along the drive take shadowy form,gradually lose their ghostlike appearance, become:gray and then green. The Greenwood Club showeditself a dab of white against the hill across the valley,and an early robin or two hopped around in the dew.Not until the milk-boy and the sun came, about thesame time, did I dare to open the door into the halland look around Everything was as we had left it.Trunks were heaped here and there, ready for thetrunk-room, and through an end window of stainedglass came a streak of red and yellbw daylight thatwas eminently cheerful. The milk-boy was poundingsomewhere below, and the day had begun.Thomas Johnson came ambling up the drive abouthalf-past six, and we could hear him clattering aroundon the lower floor, opening shutters. I bad to take.<pb n="19"/>A LINK CUFF-BUTTON                 19Liddy to her room up-stairs, however,-she was quitesure she would find something uncanny. In fact, whenshe did not, having now the courage of daylight, shewas actually disappointed.Well, we did not go back to town that day.The discovery of a small picture fallen from thewall of the drawing-room was quite sufficient to satisfyLiddy that the alarm had been a false one, but I wasanything but convinced. Allowing for my nerves andthe fact that small noises magnify themselves at night,there was still no possibility that the picture had madethe series of sounds I heard To prove it, however, Idropped it again. It fell with a single muffled crashof its wooden frame, and incidentally ruined itselfbeyond repair. I justified myself by reflecting thatif the Armstrongs chose to leave pictures in unsafepositions, and to rent a house with a family ghost, thedestruction of property was their responsibility, notmine.I warned Liddy not to mention what had happenedto anybody, and telephoned to town for servants.Then after a breakfast which did more credit toThomas' heart than his head, I went on a short tourof irvestigation, The sounds had come from the east<pb n="20"/>20     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEwing, and not without some qualms I began there. Afirst I found nothing. Since then I have developed mpowers of observation, but at that time I was a noviceThe small card-room seemed undisturbed. I lookfor footprints, which is, I believe, the conventionthing to do, although my experience has been that clues both footprints and thumb-marks are more us.ful in fiction than in fact. But the stairs in thatwinoffered something.At the top of the flight had been placed a wicker hamper, packed with linen that had come frotown. It stood at the edge of the top step, almobarring passage, and on the step below it was a lonfresh scratch. For three steps the scratch was rpeated, gradually diminishing, as if some object hfallen, striking each one. Then for four steps noting. On the fifth step below was a round dent inhard wood. That was all, and it seemed little enougexcept that I was positive the marks had not bthere the day before.It bore out my theory of the sound, which had befor all the world like the bumping of a metallic objdown a flight of steps. The four steps had beeskipped. I reasoned that an iron bar, for instan<pb n="21"/>A LINK CUFF-BUTTON                2Iwould do something of the sort,-strike two or threesteps, end down, then turn over, jumping a few stairs,and landing with a thud.Iron bars, however, do not fall down-stairs in themiddle of the night alone. Coupled with the figure onthe veranda the agency by which it climbed might beassumed. But-and here was the thing that puzzledme most-the doors were all fastened that iorning,the windows unmolested, and the particular door fromthe card-room to the veranda had a combination lockof which I held the key, and which had not been tam-pered with.I fixed on an attempt at burglary, as the most nat-ural exp  ation-an attempt frustrated by the fall-ing of the object, whatever it was, that had roused me.Two things I could not understand: how the intruderhad escaped with everything locked, and why he hadleft the small silver, which, in the absence of a butler,had remained down-stairs over night.Under pretext of learning more about the place,Thomas Johnson led me through the house and thecellars, without result. Everything was in good orderand repair; money had been spent lavishly on con-'struction and plumbing. The house was full of con-<pb n="22"/>22     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEveniences, and I had no reason to repent my barsave the fact that, in the nature of things, night mcome again. And other nights must follow-andwere a long way from a police-station.In the afternoon a hack came up from Casanwith a fresh relay of servants.

She was hardly herself yet, but privatelyI think she was worrying about the broken mirror andits augury, more than anything else. When she camein she was holding something in her hand, and shelaid it on the dressing-table carefully."I found it in the linen hamper," she said. "Itmust be Mr. Halsey's, but it seems queer how it gotthere."It was the half of a link cuff-button of unique de-sign, and I looked at it carefully."Where was it? In the bottom of the hamperP" Iasked."On the very top," she replied. 'It's a mercy itdidn't fall out on the way."When Liddy had gone I examined the fragmentattentively. I had never seen it before, and I was cer-tain it was not Halsey's. It was of Italian workman-ship, and consisted of a mother-of-pearl foundation,encrusted with tiny seed-pearls, strung on horsehairto hold them. In the'center was a small ruby. Thetrinket was odd enough, but not intrinsically of great<pb n="24"/>24     THE   CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEvalue.

In spiteof myself I had a chilly sensation in the small of myback, and I left him mumbling over his dishes.

I am particu-lar about Mr. Bailey, because he was a prominentfigure in what happened later.Gertrude was tired with the trip and went up tobed very soon. I made up my mind to tell them noth-ing until the next day, and then to make as light ofour excitement as possible. After all, what had I totell? 'An inquisitive face peering in at a window; acrash in the night; a scratch or two on the stairs, andhalf a cuff-button! As for Thomas and his forebod-ings, it was always my belief that a negro is one partthief, one part pigment, and the rest superstition.It was Saturday night. The two men went to thebilliard-room, and I could hear them talking as I wentup-stairs. It seemed that Halsey had stopped at theGreenwood Club for gasolene and found Jack Baileythere, with the Sunday golf crowd.

"They may only be hurt, and we must findthem," she said, her eyes dilated with excitement.I don't remember how we got down the stairs: I doremember expecting every moment to be killed.

There was a band drawntight around my throat."It is Arnold Armstrong," he said, looking at meoddly, "and he has been murdered-in his father'shouse."After a minute I gathered myself together and Mr.arvis helped me into the living-room. Liddy had gotGtrude up-stairs, and the two strange men from thedb stayed with the body. The reaction from thehock and strain was tremendous: I was collapsed-md then Mr. Jarvis asked me a question that broughtbk my wandering faculties."Where is Halsey?" he asked."Halsey!" Suddenly Gertrude's stricken face rosefore me-the empty rooms up-stairs. Where wasey?<pb n="36"/>36     THE   CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE"He was here, wasn't he?" Mr. Jarvis pers"He stopped at the club on his way over.""I-don't know where he is," I said feebly.One of the men from the club came in, askedthe telephone, and I could hear him excitedly tasaying something about coroners and detectives.Jarvis leaned over to me."Why don't you trust me, Miss Innes?" he"If I can do anything I will.

If Halsey-""'Why, you don't think Halsey did it !" I exclaimed.There was a queer feeling of physical nausea comingover me."No, no, not at all," he said with forced cheerful-ness. "Come, Miss Innes, you're a ghost of yourself,and I am going to help you up-stairs and call yourmaid. This has been too much for you."Liddy helped me back to bed, and under the im-pression that I was in danger of freezing to death,put a hot-water bottle over my heart and another atmy feet. Then she left me. It was early dawnow, and from voices under my window I surmisedat Mr. Jarvis and his companions were searchinggrounds. As for me, I lay in bed, with everyaculty awake. Where had Halsey gone? How hadgone, and when? Before the murder, no doubt, buto would believe that? If either he or Jack Baileydheard an intruder in the house and shot him-asey might have been justified in doing-why hadey run away? The whole thing was unheard of, out-us, and-impossible to ignore.<pb n="38"/>38     THE   CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEAbout six o'clock Gertrude came in. She was fdressed, and I sat up nervously.'Poor Aunty !" she said. "What a shocking niyou have had!" She came over and sat down onbed, and I saw she looked very tired and worn."Is there anything new?" I asked anxiously."Nothing.

Anyhow, whoever itthat night, left this little souvenir."<pb n="39"/>WHERE IS HALSEY?                  39Gertrude took one look at the cuff-link, and went aswhite as the pearls in it; she clutched at the foot ofthe bed, and stood staring. As for me, I was quiteas astonished as she was."Where did-you-find it?" she asked finally, witha desperate effort at calm. And while I told her shestood looking out of the window with a look I couldnot fathom on her face. It was a relief when Mrs.Watson tapped at the door and brought me some teaand toast. The cook was in bed, completely demor-alized, she reported, and Liddy, brave with the day-light, was looking for footprints around the house.Mrs. Watson herself was a wreck; she was blue-whitearound the lips, and she had one hand tied up. Shesaid she had fallen down-stairs in her excitement. Itwas natural, of course, that the thing would shock her,having been the Armstrongs' housekeeper for severalyears, and knowing Mr. Arnold well.Gertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs.Watson, and I dressed and went down-stairs. Thebilliard and card-rooms were locked until the coronerand the detectives got there, and the men from theclub had gone back for more conventional clothing.I could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately<pb n="40"/>40    iTHE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEwailing for Mr. Arnold, as he called him, and citthe tokens that had precursed the murder.

I picked my way gingerly overthrough the dew and stooped down: almost buried inthe soft ground was a revolver! I scraped the earthoff it with the tip of my shoe, and, picking it up,slipped it into my pocket. Not until I had got into mybedroom and double-locked the door did I venture totake it out and examine it. One look was all I needed.It was Halsey's revolver. I had unpacked it the daybefore and put it on his shaving-stand, and therecould be no mistake. His name was on a small silverplate on the handle.I seemed to see a network closing around my boy,innocent as I knew he was. The revolver-I am afraidof them, but anxiety gave me courage to look throughthe barrel-'the revolver had still two bullets in it. Icould only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that Ihad found the revolver before any sharp-eyed detec-tive had come around.I decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, thegolf-stick and the revolver, in a secure place until Icould see some reason for displaying them. The cuff-link had been dropped into a little filigree box on mytoilet table. I opened the box and felt around for it.The box was empty-the cuff-link had disappeared!<pb n="42"/>CHAPTER VGERTBUDE'S ENGAGEMENTA     T ten o'clock the Casanova hack broughtthree men. They introduced themselves as coroner of the county and two detectifrom the city.

It was oafter they had got a fair idea of things as they wthat they sent for me.I received them in the living-room, and I had mup my mind exactly what to tell.

On 42<pb n="43"/>GERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT                43third night I believed that some one had been in thehouse: I had heard a crashing sound, but being alonewith one maid had not investigated. The house hadbeen locked in the morning and apparently undis-turbed.Then, as clearly as I could, I related how, the nightbefore, a shot had roused us; that my niece and I hadinvestigated and found a body; that I did not knowwho the murdered man was until Mr. Jarvis from theclub informed me, and that I knew of no reason whyMr. Arnold Armstrong should steal into his father'shouse at night. I should have been glad to allow himentree there at any time."Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes," the cor-oner asked, "that any member of your household,imagining Mr. Armstrong was a burglar, shot him inself-defense?""I have no reason for thinking so," I said quietly."Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followedhere by some enemy, and shot as he entered thehouse?""I don't think I have a theory," I said. 'The thingthat has puzzled me is why Mr. Armstrong shouldenter his father's house two nights in succession,<pb n="44"/>44     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEstealing in like a thief, when he needed only toentrance to be admitted."The coroner was a very silent man: he took snotes after this, but he seemed anxious to makenext train back to town. He set the inquest forfollowing Saturday, gave Mr. Jamieson, the younof the two detectives, and the more intelligent looka few instructions, and, after gravely shaking hawith me and regretting the unfortunate affair, this departure, accompanied by the other detective.I was just beginning to breathe freely when Jamieson, who had been standing by the window, over to me."The family consists of yourself alone, Innes?""My niece is here," I said."There is no one but yourself and your niece?""My nephew." I had to moisten my lips."Oh, a nephew. I should like to see him, if hehere.""He is not here just now," I said as quietly acould. "I expect him-at any time.""He was here yesterday evening, I believer'"No-yes."<pb n="45"/>GERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT                45"Didn't he have a guest with him? Another man?""He brought a friend with him to stay over Sunday,a Mr. Bailey.""Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the Traders' Bank,I believe." And I knew that some oje at the Green-wood Club had told. "When did they leave?""Very early-I don't know at just what time."Mr. Jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me."Please try to be more explicit," he said. "You say.your nephew and Mr. Bailey were in the house lastnight, and yet you and your niece, with some women-servants, found the body. Where was your nephew?"I was entirely desperate by that time."I do not know," I cried, "but be sure of this:Halsey knows nothing of this thing, and no amount ofcircumstantial evidence can make an innocent manguilty.""Sit down," he said, pushing forward a chair."There are some things I have to tell you, and, in re-turn, please tell me all you know. Believe me, thingsalways come out. In the first place, Mr. Armstrongwas shot from above. The bullet was fired at closerange, entered below the shoulder and came out,after passing through the heart, well down the back.I<pb n="46"/>46     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEIn other words, I believe the murderer stood on stairs and fired down.

"Miss Innes, has occurred to you that Mr. Bailey might know somthing of this?"Gertrude had come down-stairs and just as he sposhe came in. I saw her stop suddenly, as if she been struck."He does not," she said in a tone that was not heown. "Mr. Bailey and my brother know nothing this. The murder was committed at three.

"Do you know at what time they left?""I do," Gertrude answered firmly. "At a quarterbefore three my brother and Mr. Bailey left the house,by the main entrance. I-was-there.""Gertrude," I said excitedly, "you are dreaming!Why, at a quarter to three-""Listen," she said. "At half-past two the down-stairs telephone rang. I had not gone to sleep, and Iheard it. Then I heard Halsey answer it, and in a fewminutes he came up-stairs and knocked at my door.We-we talked for a minute, then I put on my dress-ing-gown and slippers, and went down-stairs withhim. Mr. Bailey was in the billiard-room. We-we alltalked together for perhaps ten minutes. Then it wasdecided that-that they should both go away-""Can't you be more explicit?" Mr. Jamieson asked."Why did they go away?""I am only telling you what happened, not why ithappened," she said evenly. "Halsey went for the car,and instead of bringing it to the house and rousingpeople, he went by the lower road from the stable. Mr.Bailey was to meet him at the foot of the lawn. Mr.Bailey left-"<pb n="48"/>48     THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE"Which way?" Mr. Jamieson asked sharply."By the main entrance. He left-it was a quato three.

Nothing seemed to escape him."He looked at his watch," she replied, and I cosee Mr. Jamieson's eyes snap, as if he had made a covery. As for myself, during the whole recital Ibeen plunged into the deepest amazement."Will you pardon me for a personal questionThe detective was a youngish man, and I thoughtwas somewhat embarrassed. "What are your-yorelations with Mr. Bailey?"Gertrude hesitated. Then she came over and Pher hand lovingly in mine."I am engaged to marry him," she said simply.I had grown so accustomed to surprises that I coonly gasp again, and as for Gertrude, the hand tlay in mine was burning with fever."And-after that," Mr. Jamieson went on, "ywent directly to bed?"Gertrude hesitated."No," she said finally. "I-I am not nervous,after I had extinguished the light, I remember<pb n="49"/>GERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT               49something I had left in the billiard-room, and I feltmy way back there through the darkness.""Will you tell me what it was you had forgotten?""I can not tell you," she said slowly. "I-I did notleave the billiard-room at once-""Why?" The detective's tone was imperative."This is very important, Miss Innes.""I was crying," Gertrude said in a low tone."When the French clock in the drawing-room struckthree, I got up, and then-I heard a step on the eastporch, just outside the card-room. Some one with akey was working with the latch, and I thought, ofcourse, of Halsey. When we took the house he calledthat his entrance, and he had carried a key for it eversince. The door opened and I was about to ask whathe had forgotten, when there was a flash and a report.Some heavy body dropped, and, half crazed with ter-ror and shock, I ran through the drawing-room andgot up-stairs-I scarcely remember how."She dropped into a chair, and I thought Mr. Jamie-son must have finished. But he was not through."You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Baileyadmirably," he said. "The testimony is invaluable,especially in view of the fact that your brother and<pb n="50"/>50     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEMr. Armstrong had, I believe, quarreled rather sously some time ago.""Nonsense," I broke in.

Whatever therappings have been-and the colored man says theybegan when the family went west three months ago-they are likely to stop now."Which shows how much he knew about it. Theghost was not laid: with the murder of Arnold Arm-strong he, or it, only seemed to take on fresh vigor.Mr. Jamieson left then, and when Gertrude hadgone up-stairs, as she did at once, I sat and thoughtover what I had just heard. Her engagement, once soengrossing a matter, paled now beside the significanceof her story. If Halsey and Jack Bailey had left be-fore the crime, how came Halsey's revolver in the-tulip bed? What was the mysterious cause of theirsudden flight? What had Gertrude left in the billiard-room? What was the significance of the cuff-link, andwhere was it?<pb n="52"/>CHAPTER VIIN.

"Mr. Harton, I amgoing to ask you some questions, and I hope you willanswer them. I feel that I am entitled to some know-ledge, because I and my family are just now in a mostambiguous position."I don't know whether he understood me or not: hetook off his glasses and wiped them."I shall be very happy," he said with old-fashionedcourtesy."Thank you. Mr. Harton, did Mr. Arnold Arm-strong know that Sunnyside had been rented?""I think-yes, he did. In fact, I myself told himabout it.""And he knew who the tenants were?""Yes.""He had not been living with the family for someyears, I believe?""No. Unfortunately, there had been trouble be-tween Arnold and his father.

The handsome, dissipated face of ArnArmstrong, purged of its ugly lines, was now pathetic. As we went in Mrs. Watson appeared at card-room door."Come in, Mrs. Watson," the lawyer said. But,shook her head and withdrew: she was the only;in the house who seemed to regret the dead man, even she seemed rather shocked than sorry.I went to the door at the foot of the circular scase and opened it. If I could only have seen ,<pb n="55"/>IN THE EAST CORRIDOR                 55coming at his usual hare-brained clip up the drive, ifI could have heard the throb of the motor, I wouldhave felt that my troubles were over. But there wasnothing to be seen. The countryside lay sunny andquiet in its peaceful Sunday afternoon calm, and fardown the drive Mr. Jamieson was walking slowly,stooping now and then, as if to examine the road.When I went back, Mr. Harton was furtively wipinghis eyes."The prodigal has come home, Miss Innes," hesaid. "How often the sins of the fathers are visitedon the children !" Which left me pondering.Before Mr. Harton left, he told me something ofthe Armstrong family. Paul Armstrong, the father,i had been married twice. Arnold was a son by the firstJ marriage. The second Mrs. Armstrong had been awidow, with a child, a little girl. This child, now per-haps twenty, was Louise Armstrong, having taken herstepfather's name, and was at present in Californiawith the family."They will probably return at once," He concluded,"and part of my errand here to-day is to see if youwill relinquish your lease here in their favor."' We would better wait and see if they wish tokc <pb n="56"/>56     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEcome," I said. "It seems unlikely, and my town hois being remodeled." At that he let the matter but it came up unpleasantly enough, later.At six o'clock the body was taken away, andseven-thirty, after an early dinner, Mr. Harton wGertrude had not come down, and there was no nof Halsey. Mr. Jamieson had taken a lodging invillage, and I had not seen him since mid-afternIt was about nine o'clock, I think, when the bell rand he was ushered into the living-room."Sit down," I said grimly.

It was Halsey's flowing signature to a <pb n="57"/>IN THE EAST CORRIDOR                   57but it lacked Halsey's ease. The ones toward the bot-tom of the sheet were much better than the top ones.Mr. Jamieson smiled at my face."His old tricks,"' he said. "That one is merely curi-ous; this one, as I said before, is puzzling."The second scrap, folded and refolded into a com-pass so tiny that the writing had been partly oblit-erated, was part of a letter-the lower half of a sheet,not typed, but written in a cramped hand."--   by altering the plans for- rooms, may be possi-ble.

I managed to say."We are going to exchange information," he s'I am going to tell you that, when you tell me you picked up in the tulip bed."We looked steadily at each other: it was not an<pb n="59"/>IN  THE EAST      CORRIDOR         59friendly stare; we were only measuring weapons.Then he smiled a little and got up."With your permission," he said, "I am going toexamine the card-room and the staircase again. Youmight think over my offer in the meantime."He went on through the drawing-room, and I lis-tened to his footsteps growing gradually fainter. Idropped my pretense at knitting and, leaning back, Ithought over the last forty-eight hours. Here was I,Rachel Innes, spinster, a granddaughter of old JohnInnes of Revolutionary days, a D. A. R., a ColonialDame, mixed up with a vulgar and revolting crime,and even attempting to hoodwink the law! CertainlyI had left the straight and narrow way.I was roused by hearing Mr. Jamieson coming rap-idly back through the drawing-room. He stopped atthe door."Miss Innes," he said quickly, "will you come withme and light the east corridor? I have fastened some- -body in the small room at the head of the card-roomstairs."I jumped up at once."You mean-the murderer?" I gasped."Possibly," he said quietly, as we hurried together<pb n="60"/>60     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEup the stairs. "Some one was lurking on the stairwhen I went back.

At the section of the small hallway with the larger,circular staircase wound its way up, as if it hadan afterthought of the architect. And just aroundcorner, in the small corridor, was the dopr vlr. Json had indicated. I was still unfa$iliar withhouse, and I did not remember the door. My hwas thumping wildly in my ears, but I nodded to<pb n="61"/>IN THE EAST CORRIDOR                 6ito go ahead. I was perhaps eight or ten feet away-and then he threw the bolt back."Come out," he said quietly. There was no re-sponse. "Come-out," he repeated. Then-I think hehad a revolver, but I am not sure-he stepped asideand threw the door open.From where I stood I could not see beyond the door,but I saw Mr. Jamieson's face change and heard himmutter something, then he bolted down the stairs, threeat a time. When my knees had stopped shaking, Imoved forward, slowly, nervously, until I had a partialview of what was beyond the door. It seemed at firstto be a closet, empty. Then I went close and examinedit, to stop with a shudder. Where the floor shouldhave been was black void and darkness, from whichcame the indescribable, 'damp smell of the cellars.Mr. Jamieson had locked somebody in the clotheschute.

"Thatwhole end of the cellar is kept locked, so nobody canget at the clothes, and then the key's left in the door,so that unless a thief was as blind as-as some de-tectives, he could walk right in.""Liddy," I said sharply, "come down with us andturn on all the lights."She offered her resignation, as usual, on the spot,but I took her by the arm, and she came along finally.She switched on all the lights and pointed to a doorjust ahead."That's the door," she said sulkily. "The key'sin it."But the key was not in it. Mr. Jamieson shook it,but it was a heavy door, well locked. And then hestooped and began punching around the keyhole withthe end of a lead-pencil. When he stood up his facewas exultant."It's locked on the inside," he said in a low tone."There is somebody in there.""Lord have mercy!" gasped Liddy, and turned torun.I'<pb n="64"/>64     THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE "Liddy," I called, "go through the house at.'and see who is missing, or if any one is.

It was not until I hadcoiled a step or two that I recognized Gertrude, she me."Good gracious, Aunt Ray," she exclaimed, 'is the matter?""There's somebody locked in the laundry," I ed. "That is-unless-you didn't see any one ing the lawn or skulking around the house, did y<pb n="65"/>A SPRAINED ANKLE                  65"I think we have mystery on the brain," Gertrudesaid wearily. "No, I haven't seen any one, except oldThomas, who looked for all the world as if he hadbeen ransacking the pantry. What have you lockedin the laundry?""I can't wait to explain," I replied. "I must getWarner from the lodge. If you came out for air,you'd better put on your overshoes." And then I no-ticed that Gertrude was limping-not much, but suf-ficiently to make her progress very slow, and seem-ingly painful."You have hurt yourself," I said sharply."I fell over the carriage block," she explained. "Ithought perhaps .1 might see Halsey coming home.He-he ought to be here."I hurried on down the drive. The lodge was somedistance from the house, in a grove of trees where thedrive met the county road. There were two whitestone pillars to mark the entrance, but the iron gates,once closed and tended by the lodge-keeper, now stoodpermanently open. The day of the motor-car hadcome; no one had time for closed gates and lodge-keepers. The lodge at Sunnyside was merely a sortof supplementary servants' quarters: it was as con-<pb n="66"/>66     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEvenient in its appointments as the big house finitely more cozy. As I went down the drive, my thoughts were Who could it be that Mr. Jamieson had trapthe cellar?

I had come almost silently in my eveningslippers, and I had my second collision of the eveningon the road just above the house. I ran full into aman in a long coat, who was standing in the shadowbeside the drive, with his back to me, watching thelighted windows."What the hell!" he ejaculated furiously, andturned around. When he saw me, however, he did notwait for any retort on my part. He faded away-this is not slang; he did-he absolutely disappearedin the dusk without my getting more than a glimpseof his face. I had a vague impression of unfamiliarfeatures and of a sort of cap with a visor. Then hewas gone.I went to the lodge and rapped. It required two orthree poundings to bring Thomas to the door, and hev  opened it only an inch or so.k<pb n="68"/>68     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"Where is Warner?" I asked."I-I think he's in bed, ma'm.""Get him up," I said, "and for goodness' sake the door, Thomas. rll wait for Warner.""It's kind o' close in here, ma'm," he said, obegingerly, and disclosing a cool and comfortable-ing interior.

"Mr. Jamieson wants you to help him breakthe lock. Warner, whose bag is this?"He was in the doorway by this time, and he pre-tended not to hear."Warner," I called, "come back here. Whose bagis this?"He stopped then, but he did not turn around."It's-it belongs to Thomas," he said, and fled upthe drive.To Thomas! A London bag with mirrors and cos-metic jars of which Thomas could not even haveguessed the use! However, I put the bag in the backof my mind, which was fast becoming stored withanomalous and apparently irreconcilable facts, andfollowed Warner to the house.Liddy had come back to the kitchen: the door tothe basement stairs was double-barred, and had a<pb n="70"/>70     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEtable pushed against it; and beside her on thewas most of the kitchen paraphernalia."Did you see if there was any one missing house?"

"Confound such careless work! Imight have known."It was true enough. We got the lights on finallyand looked all through the three rooms that consti-tuted this wing of the basement. Everything wasquiet and empty. An explanation of how the fugitiveh ad escaped injury was found in a heaped-up basketof clothes under the chute. The basket had been over-turned, but that was all. Mr. Jamieson examined thewindows: one was unlocked, and offered an easyescape. The window or the door? Which way hadthe fugitive escaped? The door seemed most prob-able, and I hoped it had been so. I could not haveborne, just then, to think that it was my poor Ger-trude we had been hounding through the darkness,and yet-I had met Gertrude not far from that verywindow.I went up-stairs at last, tired and depressed. Mrs.Watson and Liddy were making tea in the kitchen.In certain walks of life the tea-pot is the refuge intimes of stress, trouble or sickness: they give tea tothe dying and they put it in the baby's nursing bottle.Mrs. Watson was fixing a tray to be sent in to me,<pb n="72"/>72     THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASand when I asked her about Rosie she on.absence."She's not here," she said; "but I would tmuch of that, Miss Innes.

Whatwere your reasons for thinking that?"I hesitated.73<pb n="74"/>74     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"If you have any reason for believing that midnight guest was Mr. Armstrong, other thvisit here the next night, you ought to tell me,Innes.

He ask<pb n="75"/>THE OTHER HALF OF THE LINK 75to describe the link accurately, and I did so, while heglanced at a list he took from his pocket."One set monogram cuff-links," he read, "one setplain pearl links, one set cuff-links, woman's head setwith diamonds and emeralds. There is no mention ofsuch a link as you describe, and yet, if your theory isright, Mr. Armstrong must have taken back in hiscuffs one complete cuff-link, and a half, perhaps, ofthe other."The idea was new to me. If it had not been themurdered man who had entered the house that night,who had it been?"There are a number of strange things connectedwith this case," the detective went on. "Miss Ger-trude Innes testified that she heard some one fumblingwith the lock, that the door opened, and that almostimmediately the shot was fired. Now, Miss Innes,here is the strange part of that. Mr. Armstrong hadno key with him. There was no key in the lock, or onthe floor. In other words, the evidence points abso-lutely to this: Mr. Armstrong was admitted to thehouse from within.""It is impossible," I broke in. "Mr. Jamieson, doyou know what your words imply?

"It is to the fnine as the hug of a bear is to the scratch of--<pb n="77"/>THE OTHER HALF OF THE LINK 77anything with claws. Is that you, Thomas? Comein."Thomas Johnson stood in the doorway. He lookedalarmed and apprehensive, and suddenly I remem-bered the sealskin dressing-bag in the lodge. Thomascame just inside the door and stood with his headdrooping, his eyes, under their shaggy gray brows,fixed on Mr. Jamieson."Thomas," said the detective, not unkindly, "I sentfor you to tell us what you told Sam Bohannon at theclub, the day before Mr. Arnold was found here, dead.Let me see. You came here Friday night to see MissInnes, didn't you? And came to work here Saturdaymorning?"For some unexplained reason Thomas looked re-lieved."Yas, sah," he said.

The old man held out a tiny object andMr. Jamieson took it. Then he held it on his extendedpalm for me to see.

As security for the loan he had deposited three hundred International Steamship Companin total value three hundred thousand dollars.Trautman went to the loan clerk and, after <pb n="103"/>THE TRADERS' BANK                 I03formalities had been gone through, the loan clerk wentto the vault. Mr. Trautman, who was a large andgenial German, waited for a time, whistling under hisbreath. The loan clerk did not come back. After aninterval, Mr. Trautman saw the loan clerk emergefrom the vault and go to the assistant cashier: thetwo went hurriedly to the vault. A lapse of anotherten minutes, and the assistant cashier came out andapproached Mr. Trautman. He was noticeably whiteand trembling. Mr. Trautman was told that throughan oversight the bonds had been misplaced, and wasasked to return the following morning, when every-thing would be made all right.Mr. Trautman, however, was a shrewd businessman, and he did not like the appearance of things. Heleft the bank apparently satisfied, and within thirtyminutes he had called up three different members ofthe Traders' Board of Directors. At three-thirtythere was a hastily convened board meeting, with somestormy scenes, and late in the afternoon a nationalbank examiner was in possession of the books. Thebank had not opened for business on Tuesday.At twelve-thirty o'clock the Saturday before, assoon as the business of the day was closed, Mr. John<pb n="104"/>Io4    THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASEBailey, the cashier of the defunct bank, had takhat and departed.

Before now minor officials had been used tocloak the misdeeds of men higher up. Inseparable asthe words "speculation" and "peculation" have grownto be, John Bailey was not known to be in the stockmarket. His only words, after his surrender, had been"Send for Mr. Armstrong at once." The telegraphmessage which had finally reached the President of theTraders' Bank, in an interior town in California, hadbeen responded to by a telegram from Doctor Walker,the young physician who was traveling with the Arm-strong family, saying that Paul Armstrong was veryill and unable to travel. That was how things stood that Tuesday evening.The Traders' Bank had suspended payment, and JohnBailey was under arrest, charged with wrecking it;Paul Armstrong lay very ill in California, and his onlyson had been murdered two days before.

"But when the bonds areoffered for sale, Halsey, won't the thief be detected atonce?"Halsey turned with a superior smile.'It wouldn't be done that way," he said.

Gertrude followed us shortly. "The light wasthickening," to appropriate Shakespeare's descrip-tion of twilight, and once again the tree-toads and thecrickets were making night throb with their tiny life.It was almost oppressively lonely, in spite of itsbeauty, and I felt a sickening pang of homesicknessfor my city at night-for the clatter of horses' feeton cemented paving, for the lights, the voices, thesound of children playing. The country after darkoppresses me. The stars, quite eclipsed in the city bythe electric lights, here become insistent, assertive.Whether I want to or not, I find myself looking forthe few I know by name, and feeling ridiculously newIII<pb n="112"/>112    THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEand small by contrast-always an unpleasantsation.After Gertrude joined us, we avoided any fmention of the murder. To Halsey, as to me,was ever present, I am sure, the thought of ourversation of the night before. As we strolledand forth along the drive, Mr. Jamieson emefrom the shadow of the trees."Good evening," he said, managing to includetrude in his bow. Gertrude had never beenordinarily courteous to him, and she nodded colHalsey, however, was more cordial, although weall constrained enough. He and Gertrude wenttogether, leaving the detective to walk with me.soon as they were out of earshot, he turned to me."Do you know, Miss Innes," he said, "the deego into this thing, the more strange it seems to am very sorry for Miss Gertrude. It looks as:Bailey, whom she has tried so hard to save, is than a rascal; and after her plucky fight for him,seems hard."I looked through the dusk to where Gertrude's lidinner dress gleamed among the trees. She had ma plucky fight, poor child. Whatever she might ha<pb n="113"/>HALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE I13been driven to do, I could find nothing but a deepsympathy for her. If she had only come to me withthe whole truth then!"Miss Innes," Mr. Jamieson was saying, "in thelast three days, have you seen a-any suspiciousfigures around the grounds? Any-woman?""No," I replied. "I have a houseful of maids thatwill bear watching, one and all. But there has been no'strange woman near the house or Liddy would laveseen her, you may be sure. She has a telescopic eye."Mr. Jamieson looked thoughtful."It may not amount to.anything," he said slowly."It is difficult to get any perspective on things aroundhere, because every one down in the village is sure hesaw the murderer, either before or since the crime.And half of them will stretch a point or two as tofacts, to be obliging. But the man who drives the hackdown there tells a story that may possibly prove to beimportant.""I have heard it, I think. Was it the one the parlormaid brought up yesterday, about a ghost wringingits hands on the roof? Or perhaps it's the one thenilk-boy heard: a tramp washing a dirty shirt, pre-sumably bloody, in the creek below the bridge?"<pb n="114"/>I14    THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE     :I could see the gleam of Mr. Jamieson's teeth, smiled"Neither," he said. "But Matthew Geist, whour friend's name, claims that on Saturday ninine-thirty, a veiled lady-" -'I knew it would be a veiled lady," I broke in. "A veiled lady," he persisted, "who was apparyoung and beautiful, engaged his hack and askebe driven to Sunnyside.

Now, Miss Innes, you had no 'visitor, I believe?""None," I said decidedly."Geist thought it might be a maid, as you had.a supply that day. But he said her getting outthe gate puzzled him. Anyhow, we have nowveiled lady, who, with the ghostly intruder of Frinight, makes two assets that I hardly know what towith.""It is mystifying," I admitted, "although Ithink of one possible explanation. The path fromGreenwood Club to the village enters the road nthe lodge gate. A woman who wished to reach<pb n="115"/>HALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE II5Country Club, unperceived, might choose such amethod. There are plenty of women there."I think this gave him something to ponder, for in ashort time he said good night and left. But I myselfwas far from satisfied. I was determined, however, onone thing. If my suspicions-for I had suspicions-were true, I would make my own investigations, andMr. Jamieson should learn only what was good forhim to know.We went back to the house, and Gertrude, who wasmore like herself since her talk with Halsey, sat downat the mahogany desk in the living-room to write a'letter. Halsey prowled up and down the entire eastwing, now in the card-room, now in the billiard-room,and now and then blowing his clouds of tobacco smokeamong the pink and gold hangings of the drawing-room. After a little I joined him in the billiard-room,and together we went over the details of the discoveryof the body.The card-room was quite dark. Where we sat inthe billiard-room, only one of the side brackets waslighted, and we spoke in subdued tones, as the hourand the subject seemed to demand. When I spoke ofthe figure Liddy and I had seen on the porch throughi       <pb n="116"/>I 6    THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEthe card-room window Friday night, Halsey saunteinto the darkened room, and together we stood tmuch as Liddy and I had done that other night.The window was the same grayish rectangle in blackness as before. A few feet away in the hall the spot where the body of Arnold Armstrong ;ibeen found. I was a bit nervous, and I put my hon Halsey's sleeve.

Halsey threw me off then strode forward. "Who is it?" he called imperiously, and took a haldozen rapid strides toward the foot of the staircaThen I heard'him mutter something; there was icrash of a falling body, the slam of the outer d<pb n="117"/>r      HALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE 117and, for an instant, quiet. I screamed, I think. ThenI remember turning on the lights and finding Halsey,white with fury, trying to untangle himself fromsomething warm and fleecy. He had cut his foreheada little on the lowest step of the stairs, and he wasrather a ghastly sight. He flung the white object atme, and, jerking open the outer door, raced into thedarkness.Gertrude had come on hearing the noise, and nowwe stood, staring at each other over-of all things onearth-a white silk and wool blanket, exquisitely fine!It was the most unghostly thing in the world, with itslavender border and its faint scent. Gertrude was thefirst to speak."Somebody-had it ?" she asked."Yes. Halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell.Gertrude, that blanket is not mine. I have never seenit before."She held it up and looked at it: then she went to thedoor on to the veranda and threw it open. Perhaps ahundred feet from the house were two figures, thatmoved slowly toward us as we looked. When theycame within range of the light, I recognized Halsey,and with him Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper.<pb n="118"/>CHAPTER XII ONE   MYSTERY     FOR   ANOTHER:I;jT     lHE most commonplace incident takes on a,appearance if the attendant circumstaare unusual.

But just now Mrs. Watson's face waaenigma.

Hervoice was deep and very clear: just now it was some-what tremulous. "I was taking a blanket down toThomas, who is-not well to-night, and I used thisstaircase, as being nearer the path to the lodge.When-Mr. Innes called and then rushed at me, I-Iwas alarmed, and flung the blanket at him."Halsey was examining the cut on his forehead in asmall mirror on the wall. It was not much of an in-jury, but it had bled freely, and his appearance wasrather terrifying."Thomas ill?" he said, over his shoulder. "Why, Ithought I saw Thomas out there as you made thatcyclonic break out of the door and over the porch."I could see that under pretense of examining hisinjury he was watching her through the mirror."Is this one of the servants' blankets, Mrs. Wat-son?" I asked, holding up its luxurious folds to thelight."Everything else is locked away," she replied.<pb n="120"/>120    THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEWhich was true enough, no doubt. I had rented house without bed furnishings. "If Thomas is ill," Halsey said, "some memberthe family ought to go down to see him. You needbother, Mrs. Watson.

'<pb n="121"/>ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER I2I"Thomas was standing beside that magnolia tree,"Halsey replied, "when I ran after Mrs. Watson. It'sdown to this, Aunt Ray. Rosie's basket and Mrs.Watson's blanket can only mean one thing: there issomebody hiding or being hidden in the lodge. Itwouldn't surprise me if we hold the key to the wholesituation now. Anyhow, I'm going to the lodge toinvestigate."Gertrude wanted to go, too, but she looked soshaken that I insisted she should not. I sent for Liddyto help her to bed, and then Halsey and I started forthe lodge. The grass was heavy with dew, and, man-like, Halsey chose the shortest way across the lawn.Half-way, however, he stopped."We'd better go by the drive," he said. "Thisisn't a lawn; it's a field. Where's the gardener thesedays ?""There isn't any," I said meekly. "We have beenthankful enough, so far, to have our meals preparedand served and the beds aired. The gardener who be-longs here is working at the club.""Remind me to-morrow to send out a man fromtown," he said. "I know the very fellow."I record this scrap of conversation, just as I have<pb n="122"/>I22    THE   CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE tried to put down anything and everything that a bearing on what followed, because the gardener IH'sey sent the next day played an important part in.,events of the next few weeks-events that culminatas you know, by stirring the country profoundly.

Which shohow near one can come to the truth, and yet miss altogether.At the lodge everything was quiet. There wasilight in the sitting-room down-stairs, and a faigleam, as if from a shaded lamp, in one of the uprooms. Halsey stopped and examined the lodge wicalculating eyes."I don't know, Aunt Ray," he said dubiously; "tis hardly a woman's affair. If there's a scrap of a. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.  .<pb n="123"/>ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER 123kind, you hike for the timber." Which was Halsey'ssolicitous care for me, put into vernacular."I shall stay right here," I said, and crossing thesmall veranda, now shaded and fragrant with honey-suckle, I hammered the knocker on the door.Thomas opened the door himself-Thomas, fullydressed and in his customary health. I had theblanket over my arm."I brought the blanket, Thomas," I said; "I amsorry you are so ill."The old man stood staring at me and then at theblanket. His confusion under other circumstanceswould have been ludicrous."What! Not ill?" Halsey said from the step."Thomas, I'm afraid you've been malingering."Thomas seemed to have been debating somethingwith himself. Now he stepped out on the porch andclosed the door gently behind him."I reckon you bettah come in, Mis' Innes," he said,speaking cautiously. "It's got so I dunno what to do,and it's boun' to come out some time er ruther."He threw the door open then, and I stepped inside,Halsey close behind. In the sitting-room the oldnegro turned with quiet dignity to Halsey.<pb n="124"/>124    THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE"You bettah sit down, sah," he said. "It's a pfor a woman, sah." Things were not turning out the way Halsey epected. He sat down on the center-table, with ihands thrust in his pockets, and watched me as I flowed Thomas up the narrow stairs. At the topwoman was standing, and a second glance showed it was Rosie. She shrank back a little, but I sanothing. And then Thomas motioned to a partly opdoor, and I went in. The lodge boasted three bedrooms up-stairs, comfortably furnished. In this one, the largest aairiest, a night lamp was burning, and by its lighticould make out a plain white metal bed.

I put my hand on the sick girl's forehead.It was burning with fever, and I turned to whereThomas lingered in the hallway."Will you tell me what you mean, Thomas John-son, by not telling me this before?" I demanded in-dignantly.Thomas quailed."Mis' Louise wouldn' let me," he said earnestly. "Iwanted to. She ought to 'a' had a doctor the night shecame, but she wouldn' hear to it. Is she-is she verybad, Mis' Innes?""Bad enough," I said coldly. "Send Mr. Innes up."Halsey came up the stairs slowly, looking ratherinterested and inclined to be amused. For a momenthe could not see anything distinctly in the darkenedroom; he stopped, glanced at Rosie and at me, andthen his eyes fell on the restless head on the pillow.I think he felt who it was before he really saw her;he crossed the room in a couple of strides and bentover the bed."Louise !" he said softly; but she did not reply, andher eyes showed no recognition. Halsey was young,and illness was new to him. He straightened himselfslowly, still watching her, and caught my arm.It<pb n="126"/>126    THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE "She's dying, Aunt Ray !" he said huskily.

The old man was alone,Warner not having arrived, and at first he was uncer-tain about opening the door. He did so finally, andwas amazed at being confronted by Louise Arm-strong. Thomas was an old family servant, havingbeen with the present Mrs. Armstrong since she wasa child, and he was overwhelmed at seeing Louise. Hesaw that she was excited and tired, and he drew herinto the sitting-room and made her sit down. After awhile he went to the house and brought Mrs. Watson,and they talked until late. The old man said Louisewas in trouble, and seemed frightened.

Shehad asked for Arnold, and was told he had left town.Thomas had not the moral courage to tell her of thecrime. She refused a doctor, and shrank morbidlyfrom having her presence known. Mrs. Watson and<pb n="129"/>r        ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER I29Thomas had had their hands full, and at last Rosiehad been enlisted to help them. She carried necessaryprovisions-little enough-to the lodge, and helped tokeep the secret.Thomas told me quite frankly that he had beenanxious to keep Louise's presence hidden for this rea-son: they had all seen Arnold Armstrong that night,and he, himself, for one, was known to have had novery friendly feeling for the dead man. As to thereason for Louise's flight from California, or why shehad not gone to the Fitzhughs', or to some of herpeople in town, he had no more information than Ihad. With the death of her stepfather and the pros-pect of the immediate return of the family, things hadbecome more and more impossible. I gathered thatThomas was as relieved as I at the turn events hadtaken. No, she did not know of either of the deathsin the family.Taken all around, I had only substituted one mys-tery for another.

They occupiedthe end of the east wing, beyond the circular staircase,and we had not even opened them.The girl herself was too ill to notice what was beingdone. When, with the help of the doctor, who was afatherly man with a family of girls at home, we gother to the house and up the stairs into bed, shedropped into a feverish sleep, which lasted until morn-ing. Doctor Stewart-that was the Englewood doctor-stayed almost all night, giving the medicine him-I3I<pb n="132"/>I32    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEself, and watching her closely. Afterward he told.that she had had a narrow escape from pneumoand that the cerebral symptoms had been rather alaing.

When I was a girlwe called in the doctor alike when we had measles, orwhen mother's sister died in the far West. He cut outredundant tonsils and brought the babies with thesame air of inspiring self-confidence. Nowadays itrequires a different specialist for each of these occur-rences. When the babies cried, old Doctor Wain-wright gave them   peppermint and dropped warmsweet oil in their ears with sublime faith that if itwas not colic it was earache. When, at the end of ayear, father met him driving in his high side-barbuggy with the white mare ambling along, and askedfor a bill, the doctor used to go home, estimate whathis services were worth for that period, divide it inhalf-I don't think he kept any books-and sendfather a statements in a cramped hand, on a sheet ofruled white paper. He was an honored guest at all theweddings, christenings, and funerals-yes, funerals-<pb n="134"/>134    THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE for every one knew he had done his best, and thereno gainsaying the ways of Providence. Ah, well, Doctor Wainwright is gone, and I am;elderly woman with an increasing tendency to livewthe past.

Her husband died yesterday, in Cfornia and-wait, I will read you the message."I knew what was coming, and I made up my miat once. If Louise Armstrong had a good and suf<pb n="135"/>LOUISE                    135cient reason for leaving her people and coming home,a reason, moreover, that kept her from going at onceto Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, and that brought her to thelodge at Sunnyside instead, it was not my intention tobetray her. Louise herself must notify her people. Ido not justify myself now, but remember, I was in apeculiar position toward the Armstrong family. I wasconnected most unpleasantly with a cold-bloodedcrime, and my niece and nephew were practically beg-gared, either directly or indirectly, through the headof the family.Mrs. Fitzhugh had found the message."'Paul died yesterday. Heart disease,'" she read."'Wire at once if Louise is with you.' You see, MissInnes, Louise must have started east, and Fanny isalarmed about her.""Yes," I said."Louise is not here," Mrs. Fitzhugh went on, "andnone of her friends-the few who are still in town-has seen her. I called you because Sunnyside was notrented when she went away, and Louise might havegone there.""I am sorry, Mrs. Fitzhugh, but I can not helpyou," I said, and was immediately filled with comn-<pb n="136"/>136    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEpunction. Suppose Louise grew worse? Who was to play Providence in this case? The anxious mothecertainly had a right to know that her daughter wain good hands. So I broke in on Mrs. Fitzhugh's voluble excuses for disturbing me."Mrs. Fitzhugh," I said. "I was going to let yoithink I knew nothing about Louise Armstrong, but jhave changed my mind. Louise is here, with me.There was a clatter of ejaculations at the other endof the wire. "She is ill, and not able to be movedlMoreover, she is unable to see any one. I wish yowould wire her mother that she is with me, and tell henot to worry. No, I do not know why she came east."But my dear Miss Innes!"

"No, she is not in a critical state now, but thdoctor says she must have absolute quiet."When I had hung up the receiver, I sat down tthink. So Louise had fled from her people in Calffornia, and had come east alone! It was not a neidea, but why had she done it? It occurred to me thaDoctor Walker might be concerned in it, might psibly have bothered her with unwelcome attentions; bu<pb n="137"/>LOUISE                   i37it seemed to me that Louise was hardly a girl to takerefuge in flight under such circumstances. She hadalways been high-spirited, with the well-poised headand buoyant step of the outdoors girl. It must havebeen much more in keeping with Louise's character, asI knew it, to resent vigorously any unwelcome atten-tions from Doctor Walker. It was the suitor whom Ishould have expected to see in headlong flight, not thelady in the case.The puzzle was no clearer at the end of the half-hour. I picked up the morning papers, which werestill full of the looting of the Traders' Bank, the in-terest at fever height again, on account of Paul Arm-strong's death. The bank examiners were working onthe books, and said nothing for publication: JohnBailey had been released on bond. The body of PaulArmstrong would arrive Sunday and would be buriedfrom the Armstrong town house. There were rumorsthat the dead man's estate had been a comparativelysmall one. The last paragraph was the important one.Walter P. Broadhurst, of the Marine Bank, hadproduced two hundred American Traction bonds,which had been placed as security with the MarineBank for a loan of one hundred and sixty thousand<pb n="138"/>138    THE    CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE dollars, made to Paul Armstrong, just before his Cafornia trip. The bonds were a part of the missi;traction bonds from the Traders' Bank! While tinvolved the late president of the wrecked bank, my mind it by no means cleared its cashier.The gardener mentioned by Halsey came out abottwo o'clock in the afternoon, and walked up from tstation. I was favorably impressed by him. His refehces were good-he had been employed by the Brayuntil they went to Europe, and he looked young vigorous. He asked for one assistant, and I was glsenough to get off so easily. He was a pleasant-facyoung fellow, with black hair and blue eyes, and hname was Alexander Graham. I have been particulabout Alex, because, as I said before, he played an iportant part later.: That afternoon I had a new insight into the chaacter of the dead banker. I had my first conversatiowith Louise. She sent for me, and against my bettjudgment I went. There were so many things scould not be told, in her weakened condition, that ;dreaded the interview. It was much easier than I epected, however, because she asked no questions.Gertrude had gone to bed, having been up almo<pb n="139"/>LOUISE                   I39all night, and Halsey was absent on one of those mys-terious absences of his that grew more and more fre-quent as time went on, until it culminated in the eventof the night of June the tenth. Liddy was in attend-ance in the sick-room. There being little or nothingto do, she seemed to spend her time smoothing thewrinkles from the counterpane. Louise lay under afield of virgin white, folded back at an angle of geo-metrical exactness, and necessitating a readjustmentevery time the sick girl turned.Liddy heard my approach and came out to meet me.She seemed to be in a perpetual' state of goose-flesh,and she had got in the habit of looking past me whenshe talked, as if she saw things. It had the effect ofmaking me look over my shoulder to see what she wasstaring at, and was intensely irritating."She's awake," Liddy said, looking uneasily downthe circular staircase, which was beside me. "She wastalkin' in her sleep something awful-about dead menand coffins.""Liddy," I said sternly, "did you breathe a wordabout everything not being right here?"Liddy's gaze had wandered to the door of the chute,now bolted securely.<pb n="140"/>140    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE "Not a word," she said, "beyond asking her a qution or two, which there was no harm in. She sathere never was a ghost known here." I glared at her, speechless, and closing the doointo Louise's boudoir, to Liddy's great disappointment, I went on to the bedroom beyond. Whatever Paul Armstrong had been, he had bee"lavish with his stepdaughter. Gertrude's rooms l!home were always beautiful apartments, but the thrrooms in the east wing at Sunnyside, set apart for th4daughter of the house, were much more splendidFrom the walls to the rugs on the floor, from the furniture to the appointments of the bath, with its poosunk in the floor instead of the customary unlovely tub1everything was luxurious. In the bedroom Louisawas watching for me. It was easy to see that she wamuch improved; the flush was going, and the peculiagasping breathing of the night before was now a conifortable and easy respiration. She held out her hand and I took it between both omine. "What can I say to you, Miss Innes?" she saislowly. "To have come like this-"<pb n="141"/>LOUISE                    I4II thought she was going to break down, but she didnot."You are not to think of anything but of gettingwell," I said, patting her hand. "When you are bet-ter, I am going to scold you for not coming here atonce. This is your home, my dear, and of all people inthe world, Halsey's old aunt ought to make you wel-come."She smiled a little, sadly, I thought."I ought not to see Halsey," she said. "Miss Innes,there are a great many things you will never under-stand, I am afraid. I am an impostor on your sym-pathy, because I-I stay here and let you lavish careon me, and all the time I know you are going to de-spise me.""Nonsense!" I said briskly. "Why, what wouldHalsey do to me if I even ventured such a thing? Heis so big and masterful that if I dared to be anythingbut rapturous over you, he would throw me out of awindow. Indeed, he would be quite capable of it."She seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone. Shehad eloquent brown eyes-the Inneses are fair, andare prone to a grayish-green PptiQ that is better for<pb n="142"/>142    THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE ;Huse than appearance-and they seemed now 'clouded with trouble. "Poor Halsey !" she said softly. "Miss Innes, not marry him, and I am afraid to tell him. Iicoward-a coward!"I sat beside the bed and stared at her. She waill to argue with, and, besides, sick people takeqfancies."We will talk about that when you are strongesaid gently."But there are some things I must tell you,' ssisted.

But Louisewas literal."He didn't come back that night," she said,'"and itwas so important that I should see him.""I believe he has gone away," I replied uncertainly."Isn't it something that we could attend to instead?"But she shook her head. "I must do it myself," shesaid dully. "My mother must have rented Sunnysidewithout telling my stepfather, and-Miss Innes, didyou ever hear of any one being wretchedly poor in themidst of luxury?"Did you ever long, and long, for money-moneyto use without question, money that no one would takeyou to task about?

But we have never hadany money, Miss Innes; that must have been whymother rented this house. My stepfather pays ourbills. It's the most maddening, humiliating existencein the world. I would love honest poverty better.""Never mind," I said; "when you and Halsey are<pb n="144"/>144    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE married you can be as honest as you like, and you wicertainly be poor." Halsey came to the door at that moment and could hear him coaxing Liddy for admissidn to tisick room."Shall I bring him in?" I asked Louise, uncertai'what to do. The girl seemed to shrink back amoniher pillows at the sound of his voice.

"Why didn't you trust me, and send for me be-fore?""It was because I couldn't trust myself," she saidin a low tone. "I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh,Halsey, how I have wanted to see you !"There was something I did not hear, then Halseyagain."We could go away," he was saying.

"Sweetheart, as long as youcare for me, I am not afraid."The wind slammed the door between the two roomsjust then, and I could hear nothing more, although Imoved my chair quite close. After a discreet interval,I went into the other room, and found Louise alone.She was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted onthe ceiling over the bed, and because she looked tired.I did not disturb her.<pb n="148"/>CHAPTER XIV AN   EGG-NOG    AND   A TELEGRAMW    Y   TE had discovered Louise at the lodgTuesday night. It was Wednesday ihad my interview with her. Thursdayand Friday were uneventful, save as they marked improvement in our patient. Gertrude spent almost althe time with her, and the two had grown to be greafriends. But certain things hung over me constantlythe coroner's inquest on the death of Arnold Armstrong, to be held Saturday, and the arrival of MrArmstrong and young Doctor Walker, bringing thbody of the dead president of the Traders' Bank.

Poor Thomas! He had the fac-ulty-found still in some old negroes, who cling tothe traditions of slavery days-of making his employ-er's interest his. It was always "we" with Thomas.I miss him sorely; pipe-smoking, obsequious, not overreliable, kindly old man!On Thursday Mr. Harton, the Armstrongs' legaladviser, called up from town. He had been advised,he said, that Mrs. Armstrong was coming east withher husband's body and would arrive Monday. Hecame with some hesitation, he went on, to the fact thathe had been further instructed to ask me to relinquishmy lease on Sunnyside, as it was Mrs. Armstrong'sdesire to come directly there.I was aghast."Here!" I said. "Surely you are mistaken, Mr.Harton. I should think, after-what happened hereonly a few days ago, she would never wish to comeback."<pb n="150"/>150    THE    CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE        2"Nevertheless," he replied, "she is most anxiouecome.

"I have a tele-gram for her, Mrs. Innes. Shall I send it out ?""Better open it and read it to me," I suggested. "Ifit is important, that will save time."There was a pause while Mr. Harton opened thetelegram. Then he read it slowly, judicially."'Watch for Nina Carrington. Home Monday.Signed F. L.

Very well, Mr. Harton, I will tellher, but she is not in condition to watch for any one.""Well, Miss Innes, if you decide to-er-relin-quish the lease, let me know," the lawyer said."I shall not relinquish it," I replied, and I imaginedhis irritation from the way he hung up the receiver.e     I wrote the telegram down word for word, afraidto trust my memory, and decided to ask Doctor Stew-art how soon Louise might be told the truth. Theclosing of the Traders' Bank I considered unneces-sary for her to know, but the death of her stepfatherand stepbrother must be broken to her soon, or shemight hear it in some unexpected and shocking man-ner.Doctor Stewart came about four o'clock, bringing<pb n="152"/>152    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEhis leather satchel into the house with a great decare, and opening it at the foot of the stairs to sme a dozen big yellow eggs nesting among the bot"Real eggs," he said proudly.

Drop by drop theliquor had cooked the egg, and now, with a finalwhisk, a last toss in the shaker, it was ready, a sym-phony in gold and white.

"Drawn byHuston in town. So I naturally believed him."When the doctor came down, I was ready with aquestion."Dootor," I asked, "is there any one in the neigh-borhood named Carrington?

"Ask ahead: everything but my domestic af-fairs is at your service.""Try to be serious," I said. "And tell me this:has your firm made any plans for a house recently, fora Doctor Walker, at Casanova?""Yes, we have.""Where was it to be built?

Shedid it as gently as she could, telling her firstthat he was very ill, and finally that he was dead.Louise received the news in the most unexpectl man-ner, and when Gertrude came out to tell me how shehad stood it, I think she was almost shocked."She just lay and stared at me, Aunt Ray," shesaid. "Do you know, I believe she is glad, glad! Andshe is too honest to pretend anything else. What sortof man was Mr. Paul Armstrong, anyhow?""He was a bully as well as a rascal, Gertrude," Isaid. - "But I am convinced of one thing; Louise will*.end for Halsey now, and they will make it all up."For Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey allthat day, and the boy was frantic.I57<pb n="158"/>I58    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE      i~We had a quiet hour, Halsey and I, that evand I told him several things; about the requestwe give up the lease to Sunnyside, about the telexto Louise, about the rumors of an approaching iriage between the girl and Doctor Walker, and, 1all, my own interview with her the day before.

Thomas says once or twice he al-most broke into the room, he was so alarmed forLouise.""Another thing, Halsey," I said, "have you everheard Louise mention a woman named Carrington,Nina Carrington?""Never," he said positively.For try as we would, our thoughts always cameback to that fatal Saturday night, and the murder.Every conversational path led to it, and we.all feltthat Jamieson was tightening the threads of evidencearound John Bailey. The detective's absence washardly reassuring; he must have had something towork on in town, or he would have returned.The papers reported that the cashier of theTraders' Bank was ill in his apartments at the Knick-erbocker-a condition not surprising, considering ev-erything. The guilt of the defunct president was nolonger in doubt; the missing bonds had been adver-tised and some of them discovered. In every instancethey had been used as collateral for large loans, andthe belief was current that not less than a million and<pb n="160"/>i6o    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEa half dollars had been realized. Every one connewith the bank had been placed under arrest, and1leased on heavy bond.Was he alone in his guilt, or was the cashier hiMscomplice? Where was the money? The estate ofdead man was comparatively small-a city house fashionable street, Sunnyside, a large estate laIimortgaged, an insurance of fifty thousand dollars,!some personal property-this was all. The restin speculation probably, the papers said. Thereone thing which looked uncomfortable for Jack' iley: he and Paul Armstrong together had promotrailroad company in New Mexico, and it was rum:that together they had sunk large sums of mthere. The business alliance between the two added to the belief that Bailey knew something oflooting. His unexplained absence from the bankMonday lent color to the suspicion against him. r/strange thing seemed to be his surrendering himon the point of departure. To me, it seemed shrewd calculation of a clever rascal. I was not actily antagonistic to Gertrude's lover, but I meant to;Iconvinced, one way or the other. I took no one faith.<pb n="161"/>LIDDY    GIVES THE      ALARM       16iThat night the Sunnyside ghost began to walkagain. Liddy had been sleeping in Louise's dressing-room on a couch, and the approach of dusk was a sig-nal for her to barricade the entire suite. Situated as itwas, beyond the circular staircase, nothing but an ex-tremity of excitement would have made her pass itafter dark. I confess myself that the place seemed tome to have a sinister appearance, but we kept thatwing well lighted, and until the lights went out atmidnight it was really cheerful, if one did not knowits history.On Friday night, then, I had gone to bed, resolvedto go at once to sleep. Thoughts that insisted on ob-truding themselves I pushed resolutely to the back ofmy mind, and I systematically relaxed every muscle.I fell asleep soon, and was dreaming that DoctorWalker was building his new house immediately infront of my windows: I could hear the thump-thumpof the hammers, and then I waked to a knowledge thatsomebody was pounding on my door.I was up at once, and with the sound of my foot-step on the floor the low knocking ceased, to befollowed immediately by sibilant whispering throughthe keyhole.<pb n="162"/>I62    THE    CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE "Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel!" somebody was say- .ing, over and over. "Is that you, Liddy?" I asked, my hand on theknob. "For the love of mercy, let me in !" she said in a low tone.She was leaning against the door, for when I opened |it, she fell in. She was greenish-white, and she had a red and black barred flannel petticoat over her shoul-t ders. "Listen," she said, standing in the middle of the floor and holding on to me. "Oh, Miss Rachel, it's the Xghost of that dead man hammering to get in " "Sure enough, there was a dull thud-thud-thud ifrom some place near. It was muffled: one rather felt 'than heard it, and it was impossible to locate. One moment it seemed to come, three taps and a pause,from the floor under us: the next, thud-thud-thud.-it came apparently from the wall. "It's not a ghost," I said decidedly. 'If it was a lghost it wouldn't rap: it would come through the key- lhole." Liddy looked at the keyhole. "But it sounds lvery much as though some one is trying to break into :the house."<pb n="163"/>LIDDY GIVES THE ALARM                163Liddy was shivering violently. I told her to get memy slippers and she brought me a pair of kid gloves,so I found my things myself, and prepared to callHalsey. As before, the night alarm had found theelectric lights gone: the hall, save for its night lamp,was in darkness, as I went across to Halsey's room. Ihardly know what I feared, but it was a relief to findhim there, very sound asleep, and with his door un-locked."Wake up, Halsey," I said, shaking him.He stirred a little. Liddy was half in and half outof the door, afraid as usual to be left alone, and notquite daring to enter. Her scruples seemed to fade,however, all at once. She gave a suppressed yell,bolted into the room, and stood tightly clutchingthe foot-board of the bed. Halsey was graduallywaking."I've seen it," Liddy wailed. "A woman in whitedown the hall!"I paid no attention."Halsey," I persevered, "some one is breaking intothe house. Get up, won't you?""It isn't our house," he said sleepily. And then heroused to the exigency of the occasion. "All right,<pb n="164"/>I64    THE   CIRCULAR      STAIRCASEAunt Ray," he said, still yawning. "If you'll let mget into something-" "It was all I could do to get Liddy out of the rooThe demands of the occasion had no influence on hershe had seen the ghost, she persisted, and she wasn'going into the hall. But I got her over to my room alast, more dead than alive, and made her lie down o0the bed.The tappings, which seemed to have ceased for lwhile, had commenced again, but they were fainterHalsey came over in a few minutes, and stood listeninand trying to locate the sound."Give me my revolver, Aunt Ray," he said; anI got it-the one I had found in the tulip bed-angave it to him. He saw Liddy there and divined aonce that Louise was alone. "You let me attend to this fellow, whoever it iiAunt Ray, and go to Louise, will you? She may bawake and alarmed." So in spite of her protests, I left Liddy alone andwent back to the east wing. Perhaps I went a littljfaster past the yawning blackness of the circular staircase; and I could hear Halsey creaking cautiouslydown the main staircase. The rapping, or pounding<pb n="165"/>LIDDY GIVES THE ALARM                165had ceased, and the silence was almost painful. Andthen suddenly, from apparently under my very feet,there rose a woman's scream, a cry of terror thatbroke off as suddenly as it came. I stood frozen andstill. Every drop of blood in my body seemed to leavethe surface and gather around my heart. In the deadsilence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst.More dead than alive, I stumbled into Louise's bed-room. She was not there!<pb n="166"/>.l  ,  ' ;CHAPTER XVI IN  THE EARLY      MORNINGSTOOD looking at the empty bed. The coveings had been thrown back, and Louise's pisilk dressing-gown was gone from the fowhere it had lain. The night lamp burned direvealing the emptiness of the place. I picked it ubut my hand shook so that I put it down again, agot somehow to the door.There were voices in the hall and Gertrude carunning toward me.            :"What is it?" she cried. "What was that sounWhere is Louise?""She is not in her room," I said stupidly. "I thin-it was she-who screamed."Liddy had joined us now, carrying a light. Wstood huddled together at the head of the circulaistaircase, looking down into its shadows. There wnothing to be seen, and it was absolutely quiet do'i66<pb n="167"/>I'      IN   THE    EARLY    MORNING          1.67there. Then we heard Halsey running up the mainstaircase. He came quickly down the hall to where wewere standing."There's no one trying to get in. I thought Iheard some one shriek. Who was it ?"Our stricken faces told him the truth."Some one screamed down there," I said. "And-        ;Fand Louise is not in her room."With a jerk Halsey took the light from Liddy andran down the circular staircase. I followed him, moreslowly. My nerves seemed to be in a state of paraly-sis: I could scarcely step. At the foot of the stairsHalsey gave an exclamation and put down the light."Aunt Ray," he called sharply.At the foot of the staircase, huddled in a heap, herhead on the lower stair, was Louise Armstrong. Shelay limp and white, her dressing-gown dragging loosefrom one sleeve of her night-dress, and the heavybraid of her dark hair stretching its length a coupleof steps above her head, as if she had slipped down.She was not dead: Halsey put her down on the floor,and began to rub her cold hands, while Gertrude andLiddy ran for stimulants. As for me, I sat there atthe foot of that ghostly staircase-sat, because my<pb n="168"/>I68    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEknees wouldn't hold me-and wondered where it woall end. Louise was still unconscious, but shebreathing better, and I suggested that we get her bato bed before she came to. There was somethigrisly and horrible to me, seeing her there in almothe same attitude and in the same place where we found her brother's body. And to add to the siilarity, just then the hall clock, far off, struck fainthree o'clock. It was four before Louise was able to talk, and first rays of dawn were coming through her windowhich faced the east, before she could tell us corently what had occurred.

It musthave been three when I heard some one rapping. Isat up and listened, to be quite sure, and the rappingkept up. It was cautious, and I was about to callLiddy. Then suddenly I thought I knew what it was.The east entrance and the circular staircase were al-ways used by Arnold when he was out late, and some-times, when he forgot his key, he would rap and Iwould go down and let him in. I thought he had comeback to see me-I didn't think about the time, for hishours were always erratic. But I was afraid I wastoo weak to get down the stairs. The knocking keptup, and just as I was about to call Liddy, she ranthrough the room and out into the hall. I got up then,feeling weak and dizzy, and put on my dressing-gown.If it was Arnold, I knew I must see him."It was very dark everywhere, but, of course, Iknew my way. I felt along for the stair-rail, and wentdown as quickly as I could. The knocking hadstopped, and I was afraid I was too late. I got to thefoot of the staircase and over to the door on to the eastveranda. I had never thought of anything but that itwas Arnold, until I reached the door. It was unlockedand opened about ah inch. Everything was black: it<pb n="170"/>I70    THE    CIRCULAR      STAIRCASE was perfectly dark outside. I felt very queershaky. Then I thought perhaps Arnold had usedkey; he did-strange things sometimes, and I turaround. Just as I reached the foot of the staircasthought I heard some one coming.

There could be no dou!of its truth, and the thing that made it inexpressiblawful to me was that the poor girl had crept down answer the summons of a brother who would nevneed her kindly offices again. Twice now, without aparent cause, some one had entered the house by meaof the east entrance: had apparently gone his way unhindered through the house, and gone out again as had entered. Had this unknown visitor been there'third time, the night Arnold Armstrong was muidered? Or a fourth, the time Mr. Jamieson had lockesome one in the clothes chute?                  :Sleep was impossible, I think, for any of us. W'.,.<pb n="171"/>IN  THE    EARLY     MORNING         I7Idispersed finally to bathe and dress, leaving Louiselittle the worse for her experience. But I determinedthat before the day was over she must know the truestate of affairs. Another decision I made, and I putit into execution immediately after breakfast. I hadone of the unused bedrooms in the east wing, backalong the small corridor, prepared for occupancy, andfrom that time on, Alex, the gardener, slept there.One man in that barn of a house was an absurdity,with things happening all the time, and I must saythat Alex was as unobjectionable as any one couldpossibly have been.The next morning, also, Halsey and I made an ex-haustive examination of the circular staircase, thesmall entry at its foot, and the card-room openingfrom it. There was no evidence of anything unusualthe night before, and had we not ourselves heard therapping noises, I should have felt that Louise's imag-ination had run away with her. The outer door wasclosed and locked, and the staircase curved above us,for all the world like any other staircase.Halsey, who had never taken seriously my accountof the night Liddy and I were there alone, was graveenough now. He examined the paneling of the wain-<pb n="172"/>172    THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEscoting above and below the stairs, evidently lookintgfor a secret door, and suddenly there flashed into mniimind the recollection of a scrap of paper that MrJamieson had found among Arnold Armstrong's effects. As nearly as possible I repeated its contents him, while Halsey took them down in a note-book.  ;""I wish you had told me that before," he said, ap:he put the memorandum carefully away. We founinothing at all in the house, and I expected little fromiany examination of the porch and grounds. But aS;we opened the outer door something fell into the entrywith a clatter. It was a cue from the billiard-room. :Halsey picked it up with an exclamation."That's careless enough," he said. "Some of the''servants have been amusing themselves."I was far from convinced. Not one of the servants -would go into that wing at night unless driven by direnecessity. And a billiard cue! As a weapon of eitheroffense or defense it was an absurdity, unless one ac-;cepted Liddy's hypothesis of a ghost, and even then,!as Halsey pointed out, a billiard-playing ghost would-:be a very modern evolution of an ancient institution. That afternoon we, Gertrude, Halsey and I, attend- ed the coroner's inquest in town. Doctor Stewart had'j,<pb n="173"/>IN THE EARLY MORNING                173been summoned also, it transpiring that in that earlySunday morning, when Gertrude and I had gone toour rooms, he had been called to view the body. Wewent, the four of us, in the machine, preferring theexecrable roads to the matinee train, with half of Cas-anova staring at us. And on the way we decided tosay nothing of Louise and her interview with her step-brother the night he died. The girl was in troubleenough as it was.<pb n="174"/>CHAPTER XVIIA HINT OF SCANDALIN giving the gist of what happened at the in-quest, I have only one excuse-to recall to thereader the events of the night of Arnold Arm-strong's murder. Many things had occurred whichwere not brought out at the inquest and some thingswere told there that were new to me. Altogether, itwas a gloomy affair, and the six men in the corner,who constituted the coroner's jury, were evidently themerest puppets in the hands of that all-powerful gen-tleman, the coroner.Gertrude and I sat well back, with our veils down.There were a number of people I knew: Barbara Fitz-hugh, in extravagant mourning-she always went intoblack on the slightest provocation, because it was be-coming-and Mr. Jarvis, the man who had come overfrom the Greenwood Club the night of the murder.174<pb n="175"/>A HINT OF SCANDAL                  I75Mr. Harton was there, too, looking impatient as theinquest dragged, but alive to every particle of evi-dence. From a corner Mr. Jamieson was watching theproceedings intently.Doctor Stewart was called first. His evidence wastold briefly, and amounted to this: on the Sundaymorning previous, at a quarter before five, he had beencalled to the telephone. The message was from a Mr.Jarvis, who asked him to come at once to Sunnyside,as there had been an accident there, and Mr. ArnoldArmstrong had been shot. He had dressed hastily,gathered up some instruments, and driven to Sunny-side.He was met by Mr. Jarvis, who took him at once tothe east wing. There, just as he had fallen, was thebody of Arnold Armstrong. There was no need ofthe instruments: the man was dead. In answer tothe coroner's question-no, the body had not beenmoved, save to turn it over. It lay at the foot of thecircular staircase. Yes, he believed death had beeninstantaneous. The body was still somewhat warmand rigor mortis had not set in. It occurred late incases of sudden death. No, he believed the probabilityof suicide might be eliminated; the wounds could have<pb n="176"/>I76    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEbeen self-inflicted, but with difficulty, and there hadbeen no weapon found.The doctor's examination was over, but he hesitatedand cleared his throat."Mr. Coroner," he said, "at the risk of taking upvaluable time, I would like to speak of an incident thatmay or may not throw some light on this matter."The audience was alert at once."Kindly proceed, Doctor," the coroner said."My home is in Englewood, two miles from Casa-nova," the doctor began. "In the absence of DoctorWalker, a number of Casanova people have been con-sulting me. A month ago-five weeks, to be exact-awoman whom I had never seen came to my office. Shewas in deep mourning and kept her veil down, and shebrought for examination a child, a boy of six. Thelittle fellow was ill; it looked like typhoid, and themother was frantic. She wanted a permit to admit theyoungster to the Children's Hospital in town here,where I am a member of the staff, and I gave her one.The incident would have escaped me, but for a curiousthing. Two days before Mr. Armstrong was shot, Iwas sent for to go to the Country Club: some one hadbeen struck with a golf-ball that had gone wild. It<pb n="177"/>A  HINT    OF SCANDAL            177was late when I left-I was on foot, and about a milefrom the club, on the Claysburg road, I met two peo-ple. They were disputing violently, and I had no dif-ficulty in recognizing Mr. Armstrong. The woman,beyond doubt, was the one who had consulted me aboutthe child."At this hint of scandal, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh satup very straight. Jamieson was looking slightlyskeptical, and the coroner made a note."The Children's Hospital, you say, Doctor?" heasked."Yes. But the child, who was entered as LucienWallace, was taken away by his mother two weeksago. I have tried to trace them and failed."All at once I remembered the telegram sent toLouise by some one signed F. L. W.-presumablyDoctor Walker. Could this veiled woman be the NinaCarrington of the message?  But it was only idlespeculation. I had no way of finding out, and the in-quest was proceeding.The report of the coroner's physician came next.The post-mortem examination showed that the bullethad entered the chest in the fourth left intercostalspace and had taken an oblique course downward and<pb n="178"/>178    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEbackward, piercing both the heart and lungs. Theleft lung was collapsed, and the exit point of the ballhad been found in the muscles of the back to the leftof the spinal column. It was improbable that such awound had been self-inflicted, and its oblique down-ward course pointed to the fact that the shot had beenfired from above. In other words, as the murderedman had been found dead at the foot of a staircase, itwas probable that the shot had been fired by some onehigher up on the stairs. There were no marks ofpowder. The bullet, a thirty-eight caliber, had beenfound in the dead man's clothing, and was shown tothe jury.Mr. Jarvis was called next, but his testimonyamounted to little. He had been summoned by tele-phone to Sunnyside, had come over at once with thesteward and Mr. Winthrop, at present out of town.They had been admitted by the housekeeper, and hadfound the body lying at the foot of the staircase. Hehad made a search for a weapon, but there was nonearound. The outer entry door in the east wing hadbeen unfastened and was open about an inch.I had been growing more and more nervous. Whenthe coroner called Mr. John Bailey, the room was<pb n="179"/>A HINT OF SCANDAL                  I79filled with suppressed excitement. Mr. Jamieson wentforward and spoke a few words to the coroner, whonodded. Then Halsey was called."Mr. Innes," the coroner said, "will you tell underwhat circumstances you saw Mr. Arnold Armstrongthe night he died?""I saw him first at the Country Club," Halsey saidquietly. He was rather pale, but very composed. "Istopped there with my automobile for gasolene. Mr.Armstrong had been playing cards. When I saw himthere, he was coming out of the card-room, talking toMr. John Bailey.""The nature of the discussion-was it amicable?"Halsey hesitated."They were having a dispute," he said. "I askedMr. Bailey to leave the club with me and come toSunnyside over Sunday.""Isn't it a fact, Mr. Innes, that you took Mr. Baileyaway from the club-house because you were afraidthere would be blows ?""The situation was unpleasant," Halsey said eva-sively."At that time had you any suspicion that theTraders' Bank had been wrecked ?"<pb n="180"/>I8o THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE"No.""What occurred next?""Mr. Bailey and I talked in the billiard-room untiltwo-thirty.""And Mr. Arnold Armstrong came there, while youwere talking?""Yes. He came about half-past two. He rappedat the east door, and I admitted him."The silence in the room was intense. Mr. Jamie-son's eyes never left Halsey's face."Will you tell us the nature of his errand?""He brought a telegram that had come to the clubfor Mr. Bailey.""He was sober?""Perfectly, at that time. Not earlier.""Was not his apparent friendliness a change fromhis former attitude?""Yes. I did not understand it.""How long did he stay ?""About five minutes. Then he left, by the east en-trance.""What occurred then?""We talked for a few minutes, discussing a plan<pb n="181"/>A  HINT    OF   SCANDAL           18IMr. Bailey had in mind. Then I went to the stables,where I kept my car, and got it out.""Leaving Mr. Bailey alone in the billiard-room?"Halsey hesitated."My sister was there."Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh had the courage to turn andeye Gertrude through her lorgnon."And then?""I took the car along the lower road, not to disturbthe household. Mr. Bailey came down across the lawn,through the hedge, and got into the car on the road.""Then you know nothing of Mr. Armstrong'smovements after he left the house?""Nothing. I read of his death Monday evening forthe first time.""Mr. Bailey did not see him on his way across thelawn?""I think not. If he had seen him he would havespoken of it.""Thank you. That is all. Miss Gertrude Innes."Gertrude's replies were fully as concise as Halsey's.Mrs. Fitzhugh subjected her to a close inspection,commencing with her hat and ending with her shoes.<pb n="182"/>i82    THE   CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEI flatter myself she found nothing wrong withher gown or her manner, but poor Gertrude'smony was the reverse of comforting.

"That is thchild Stewart spoke of at the inquest."Warner, with his mechanic's instinct, had reaedfor the key. What he said was not a surprise."Yale lock," he said. "Probably a key to the eastentry." There was no reason why Thomas, an old and trust-ed servant, should not have had a key to that particu-lar door, although the servants' entry was in the westwing. But I had not known of this key, and it openedup a new field of conjecture. Just now, however, there,were many things to be attended to, and, leavingWarner with the body, we all went back to the house. Mr. Jamieson walked with me, while Halsey and Ger-trude followed."I suppose I shall have to notify the Armstrongs,"I said.

He came up early the next morning, justwe finished breakfast, in a professional looking with a black hood.

Abig fellow he was, tall and dark, as Gertrude had said4smooth-shaven and erect, with prominent features and.a square jaw. He was painfully spruce in his aptpearance, and his manner was almost obtrusively po-lite."I must make a double excuse for this early visit,Miss Innes," he said as he sat down. The chair waslower than he expected, and his dignity required col..lecting before he went on. "My professional duties Iare urgent and long neglected, and"-a fall to the.every-day manner-"something must be done about that body.""Yes," I said, sitting on the edge of my chair.

I think he was uncertain as to my con-nection with the Armstrong family, and dubiouswhether I considered Mr. Armstrong's taking away amatter for condolence or congratulation. He was notlong in doubt.I liked the little man. He had known Thomas well,and had promised to officiate at the services in therickety African Zion Church. He told me more ofhimself than he knew, and before he left, I astonishedhim-and myself, I admit-by promising a newcarpet for his church. He was much affected, and Igathered that he had yearned over his ragged chapelas a mother over a half-clothed child. "You are laying up treasure, Miss Innes," he saidbrokenly, "where neither moth nor rust corrupt, northieves break through and steal." "It is certainly a safer place than Sunnyside," 'admitted. And the thought of the carpet permitte<pb n="215"/>FOURTEEN      ELM   STREET        215to smile.

And yet-while I ought to say nothingbt good of the dead-Mr. Armstrong saw nothingfthis fair prospect. To him these trees and lawnsrenot the work of God. They were property, atmuch an acre. He loved money, Miss Innes. Henered up everything to his golden calf. Not power,ambition, was his fetish: it was money."  Theni dropped his pulpit manner, and, turning to me withengaging smile: "In spite of all this luxury," heid, "the country people here have a saying that Mr.al Armstrong could sit on a dollar and see alliund it. Unlike the summer people, he gave neithero the poor nor to the church. He loved money for itssake.""And there are no pockets in shrouds!"

I made out a list of questions and possible an-swers, but I seemed only to be working around in acircle. I always ended where I began. The list was,something like this:Who had entered the house the night before the murder?Thomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on thefoot-path, and who owned the pearl cuff-link.Why did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left thehouse the night he was killed?No answer. Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned?Who admitted him?Gertrude said she had locked the east entry. There was nokey on the dead man or in the door. He must have been ad-maitted from within.Who had been locked in the clothes chute?_Some one unfamiliar with the house, evidently.  Only twopeople missing from the household, Rosie and Gertrude.

It seemed more likely some one who suspected a secret at the lodge. Was Louise undersurveillance?Who had passed Louise on the circular staircase? Could it have been Thomas?

Girls in my day did not meekly accept the public's verdict as to the man theyloved.But presently something occurred that made methink that under Gertrude's surface calm there was aseething flood of emotions.Tuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the grounds, but he found nothing. In the'afternoon he disappeared, and it was late that nightwhen he came home. He said he would have to goback to the city the following day, and arranged with-Halsey and Alex to guard the house.Liddy came to me on Wednesday morning with her-black silk apron held up like a bag, and her eyes big with virtuous wrath.

"Whatve you got there?"- Liddy pushed aside a half-dozen geranium pots, andthe space thus cleared she dumped the contents ofapron-a handful of tiny bits of paper. Alexd stepped back, but I saw him watching her curi-musly."Wait a moment, Liddy," I said. "You have beenig through the library paper-basket again !"Liddy was arranging her bits of paper with thellof long practice and paid no attention.* "Did it ever occur to you," I went on, putting myad over the scraps, "that when people tear up theirorrespondence, it is for the express purpose of keep-it from being read?""If they wasn't ashamed of it they wouldn't takeD much trouble, Miss Rachel," Liddy said oracularly..ore than that, with things happening every day, Insider it my duty.

If the scraps had anything to<pb n="220"/>ao     !THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEd. with the -mystery ordinary conventions had novalue. So Liddy arranged the scraps, like workinout one of the puzzle-pictures children play with, andshe did it with much the same eagerness. When it wasfinished she stepped aside while I read it."Wednesday night, nine o'clock. Bridge," I readaloud. Then, aware of Alex's stare, I turned oLiddy."Some one is to play bridge to-night at ninemoclock," I said. "Is that your business, or mine?" :-Liddy was aggrieved.

It was a pretty little town, on the river,<pb n="222"/> 222    THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE and back on the hill I could see the Mortons' big coun-try house, where Halsey and Gertrude had been stay-ing until the night of the murder.Elm Street was almost the only street, and numberfourteen was easily found. It was a small whitehouse, dilapidated without having gained anythingpicturesque, with a low window and a porch only afoot or so above the bit of a lawn. There was a baby- icarriage in the path, and from a swing at the sideame the sound of conflict. Three small children were: disputing vociferously, and a faded young womanwith a kindly face was trying to hush the clamor.When she saw us she untied her gingham apron andcame around to the porch."Good afternoon," I said. Jamieson lifted his hat, without speaking. "I came to inquire about a child -- named Lucien Wallace.""I am glad you have come" she said. "In spite of-the other children, I think the little fellow is lonely. *? We thought perhaps his mother would be here to-day." : Mr. Jamieson stepped forward.You are Mrs. Tate?"

He was gettingeer of typhoid, she said, and he's picking up fine.". "Will you tell me his mother's name and address?""That's the trouble," the young woman said, knit-ing her brows. "She gave her name as Mrs. Wallace,said she had no address. She was looking for aboardinghouse in town.

It is a general department store."He was silent after that, but he went to the tele-phone as soon as we got home, and called up Kingand Company, in the city.After a time he got the general manager, and theyitalked for some time.

It was Halsey's way always with women.He and Louise had no conversation together untilthat night. Gertrude and Alex-I mean Jack-hadgone for a walk, although it was nine o'clock and Aany-body but a pair of young geese would have known thatdew was falling, and that it is next to impossible to getrid of a summer cold.At half after nine, growing weary of my own com-pany, I went down-stairs to find the young people. Atthe door of the living-room I paused. Gertrude andJack had returned and were there, sitting together ona divan, with only one lamp lighted. They did not seeor hear me, and I beat a hasty retreat to the library.But here again I was driven back. Louise was sittingin a deep chair, looking the happiest I had ever seenher, with Halsey on the arm of the chair, holding herclose.It was no place for an elderly spinster. I retired tomy up-stairs sitting-room and got out Eliza Kline-felter's lavender slippers. Ah, well, the foster mother-hood would soon have to be put away in camphoragain.<pb n="354"/>354    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE The next-day, by degrees, I got the whole story,Paul Armstrong had a besetting evil-the love ofmoney. Common enough, but he loved money, not forwhat it would buy, but for its own sake. An examina-tion of the books showed no irregularities in the past;year since John had been cashier, but before that, in the time of Anderson, the old cashier, who had died,much strange juggling had been done with the rec-ords. The railroad in New Mexico had apparentlydrained the banker's private fortune, and he deter-mined to retrieve it by one stroke. This was nothing less than the looting of the bank's securities, turning  -them into money, and making his escape.But the law has long arms. Paul Armstrong evi-dently studied the situation carefully. Just as theonly good Indian is a dead Indian, so the only safe de- ;faulter is a dead defaulter. He decided to die, to all appearances, and when the hue and cry subsided, hewould be able to enjoy his money almost anywhere hewished. The first necessity was an accomplice. The con- nivance of Doctor Walker was suggested by his love for Louise. The man was unscrupulous, and with the girl as a bait, Paul Armstrong soon had him fast. The , i<pb n="355"/>THE ODDS AND ENDS                 355plan was apparently the acme of simplicity: a  smalltown in the west, an attack of heart disease, a bodyfrom a medical college dissecting-room shipped in atrunk to Doctor Walker by a colleague in San Fran-cisco, and palmed off for the supposed dead banker.What was simpler?The woman, Nina Carrington, was the cog thatslipped. What she only suspected, what she reallyknew, we never learned. She was a chambermaid inthe hotel at C-, and it was evidently her intention toblackmail Doctor Walker. His position at that time awas uncomfortable: to pay the woman to keep quietwould be confession. He denied the whole thing, andshe went to Halsey.It was this that had taken Halsey to the doctor thenight he disappeared. He accused the doctor of thedeception, and, crossing the lawn, had said somethingcruel to Louise. Then, furious at her apparent con-nivance, he had started for the station. Doctor Walkerand Paul Armstrong--the latter still lame where I hadshot him-hurried across to the embankment, certainonly of one thing. Halsey must not tell the detectivewhat he suspected until the money had been removedfrom the chimney-room. They stepped into the road<pb n="356"/>356    THE    CIRCULAR      STAIRCASEin front of the car to stop it, and fate played into theirhands. The car struck the train, and they had only todispose of the unconscious figure in the road. Thisthey did as I have told. For three days Halsey lay inthe box car, tied hand and foot, suffering tortures ofthirst, delirious at times, and discovered by a tramp atJohnsville only in time to save his life.To go back to Paul Armstrong. At the last mo-ment his plans had been frustrated. Sunnyside, withits hoard in the chimney-room, had been rented with-out his knowledge! Attempts to dislodge me havingfailed, he was driven to breaking into his own house.The ladder in the chute, the burning of the stable andthe entrance through the card-room window-all werein the course of a desperate attempt to get into thechimney-room.Louise and her mother had, from the first, been thegreat stumbling-blocks. The plan had been to sendLouise away until it was too late for her to interfere,but she came back to the hotel at C- just at thewrong time. There was a terrible scene. The girl wastold that something of the kind was necessary; thatthe bank was about to close and her stepfather wouldeither avoid arrest and disgrace in this way, or kill<pb n="357"/>THE ODDS AND ENDS                 357himself. Fanny Armstrong was a weakling, but Louisewas more difficult to manage. She had no love for herstepfather, but her devotion to her mother was entire,self-sacrificing. Forced into acquiescence by her moth-er's appeals, overwhelmed by the situation, the girlconsented and fled.From somewhere in Colorado she sent an anonymoustelegram to Jack Bailey at the Traders' Bank.Trapped as she was, she did not want to see an inno-cent man arrested. The telegram, received on Thurs-day, had sent the cashier to the bank that night in afrenzy.Louise arrived at Sunnyside and found the houserented. Not knowing what to do, she sent for Arnoldat the Greenwood Club, and told him a little, not all.She told him that there was something wrong, andthat the bank was about to close. That his father wasresponsible. Of the conspiracy she said nothing. Toher surprise, Arnold already knew, through Baileythat night, that things were not right. Moreover, hesuspected what Louise did not, that the money was hid-den at Sunnyside. He had a scrap of paper that indi-cated a concealed room somewhere.His inherited cupidity was aroused. Eager to get<pb n="358"/>358     THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASEHalsey and Jack Bailey out of the house, he went upto the east entry, and in the billiard-room gave thecashier what he had refused earlier in the evening--the address of Paul Armstrong in California and atelegram which had been forwarded to the dub forBailey, from Doctor Walker. It was in response toone Bailey had sent, and it said that Paul Armstrongwas very ill.Bailey was almost desperate. He decided to go westand find Paul Armstrong, and to force him to dis-gorge. But the catastrophe at the bank occurredsooner than he had expected. On the moment of start-ing west, at Andrews Station, where Mr. Jamieson hadlocated the car, he read that the bank had closed, and,going back, surrendered himself.John Bailey had known Paul Armstrong intimately.He did not believe that the money was gone; in fact, itwas hardly possible in the interval since the securitieshad been taken. Where was it? And from some chanceremark let fall some months earlier by Arnold Arm-strong at a dinner, Bailey felt sure there was a hiddenroom at Sunnyside. He tried to see the architect ofthe building, but, like the contractor, if he knew of theroom, he refused any information. It was Halsey's0        '  :'t~~~~~~<pb n="359"/>THE ODDS AND ENDS                 359idea that John Bailey come to the house as a gardener,and pursue his investigations as he could. His smoothupper lip had been sufficient disguise, with his changeof clothes, and a hair-cut by a country barber.So it was Alex, Jack Bailey, who had been ourghost. Not only had he alarmed Louise-and himself,he admitted-on the circular staircase, but he had dugthe hole in the trunk-room wall, and later sent Elizainto hysteria. The note Liddy had found in Ger-trude's scrap-basket was from him, and it was he whohad startled me into unconsciousness by the clotheschute, and, with Gertrude's help, had carried me toLouise's room. Gertrude, I learned, had watched allnight beside me, in an extremity of anxiety about me.That old Thomas had seen his master, and thoughthe had seen the Sunnyside ghost, there could be nodoubt. Of that story of Thomas', about seeing JackBailey in the footpath between the club and Sunny-side, the night Liddy and I heard the noise on the cir-cular staircase-that, too, was right. On the nightbefore Arnold Armstrong was murdered, Jack Baileyhad made an attempt to search for the secret room.He secured Arnold's keys from his room at the club,and got into the house, armed with a golf-stick for<pb n="360"/>360    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASEsounding the walls. He ran against the hamper at thehead of the stairs, caught his cuff-link in it, anddropped the golf-stick with a crash. He was gladenough to get away without an alarm being raised, andhe took the "owl" train to town.The oddest thing to me was that Mr. Jamieson had'known for some time that Alex was Jack Bailey. Butthe face of the pseudo-gardener was very queer indeed,when that night, in the card-room, the detective turnedto him and said:"How long are you and I going to play our littlecomedy, Mr. Bailey?"Well, it is all over now. Paul Armstrong rests inCasanova churchyard, and this time there is no mis-take. I went to the funeral, because I wanted to besure he was really buried, and I looked at the step ofthe shaft where I had sat that night, and wondered ifit was all real. Sunnyside is for sale-no, I shall notbuy it. Little Lucien Armstrong is living with hisstep-grandmother, and she is recovering graduallyfrom troubles that had extended over the entire periodof her second marriage. Anne Watson lies not farfrom the man she killed, and who as surely caused herdeath. Thomas, the fourth victim of the conspiracy,<pb n="361"/>THE ODDS AND ENDS                 361is buried on the hill. With Nina Carrington, five liveswere sacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy.There will be two weddings before long, and Liddyhas asked for my heliotrope poplin to wear to thechurch. I knew she would. She has wanted it for threeyears, and she was quite ugly the time I spilled coffeeon it. We are very quiet, just the two of us. Liddystill clings to her ghost theory, and points to my wetand muddy boots in the trunk-room as proof. I amgray, I admit, but I haven't felt as well in a dozenyears. Sometimes, when I am bored, I ring for Liddy,and we talk things over. When Warner married Rosie, Liddy sniffed and said what I took for faith- fulness in Rosie had been nothing but mawkishness. i have not yet outlived Liddy's contempt because I gavethem silver knives and forks as a wedding gift.So we sit and talk, and sometimes Liddy threatensto leave, and often I discharge her, but we stay to-gether somehow. I am talking of renting a house nextyear, and Liddy says to be sure there is no ghost. To be perfectly frank, I never really lived until that sum ,mer. Time has passed since I began this story. Myneighbors are packing up for another summer. Liddyis having the awnings put up, and the window-boxes<pb n="362"/>362    THE    CIRCULAR     STAIRCASE filled. Liddy or no Liddy, I shall advertise to-morrowfor a house in the country, and I don't care if it hasa Circular Staircase.THE END
